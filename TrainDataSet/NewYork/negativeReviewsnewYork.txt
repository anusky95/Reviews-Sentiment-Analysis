N => Loved this hotel From the moment I arrived to receive excellent and friendly service at the front desk to the moment I left in a hotel booked car to the airport everything about the Beekman was great  I was upgraded to a suite with a good view and was really happy to see that what felt like a Manhattan apartment would be my home base for the next week  My room was quiet the bed was very comfortable and the cleaning staff did a great job  This was my first trip to NYC and the Beekman was an integral part of what was a wonderful experience  I have and will continue to recommend it unreservedly 
N => Spacious Room but Dont Try to Sleep In   Its Noisy Booked with Travelzoo special  Stayed here  night during the week  Was walking distance to Grand Central Station but off the beaten path and near the UN building  Placed in a the shorter of the two buildings not the main tower  Was difficult to roll two  luggage bags and carry other bags and open the elevator door  The elevator is fast and reliable  The room used radiator heat  The stay was dry and hot because we were unable to control the heat  We had to request for an ironing board but the staff was very prompt and friendly  The rooms are spacious and are condostudio style  The traffic noise is uncontrollable beware if you want to sleep inOverall good to great experience  Would recommend to family and friends  
N => Doesnt deserve the star rating  blocks from Times Square Booked this hotel from Amex com it said this hotel is   stars  Comparing this to other   stars it doesnt match the standard  The kitchen was clean however the bedroom was not satisfactory  Bed was not in great condition  The bathroom was too cramped  Top of the tower restaurant didnt accomodate walk in even though there were   empty tables  
N => ent Hotel Stayed here for four nights In a superior suite The room was good spacious and very clean  Maid service daily with towel change Staff were friendly and helpful Location was a bit far out but in some respects wasnt a bad thing  minutes walk to main areas at most  Was good after an evening meal as you had the chance to walk It off All in all a good hotel and worth looking at as an option  
N => Fantastic non expensive hotel in Manhattan We were amazed by the size of room we got which was a full suite and for   a nightOther than that the room was very clean though not very new had  TVs with enough channels to fall asleep to and hotel staff was usually very helpful The location is somewhat at a quiet location in Manhattan but for the price we got it it was great The hotels roof top restaurant was less of an experience and very expensive Highly recommended and we would definitely go back there when looking to pay less in Manhattan  
N => beware of low rates We were excited to have secured a good rate  for a night here  We were told when we got there that there was no room available for an early check in so we had to use the quothealth clubquot bathrooms to change into clothes for a wedding  But we were told that all was ready for our check in the front desk staff even showed us a packet of our registration materials all ready to go  So imagine our surprise when we returned after the wedding and were told that the hotel was full and they were sending us to another hotel  That hotel was ent but certainly not the quality we expected  Perhaps Im suspicious but it seems clear that we were shuffled off because we had a lower rate agreement than someone else  From what we did see of the hotel it was fairly dingy  I wonder if this is something hotels make a practice of when they find that they can do better than an agreed upon rate  
N => Hotel from Hell Beekman Tower Hotel New York People stayed at this Hotel from the   till the    We were split into two s and a   The room we were allocated was  bedroomed with a bed settee in the living area  We were expected to sleep together  When we asked for extra beds we were told we would have to pay another  Dollars a night each or if we wanted to upgrade to another room it would be  Dollars a night  The  people had a room with  toilets and it was much larger they didnt have to pay extra  There was only enough toiletries for  person not enough towels or blankets  It was a dark dingy hole  It was miles from anywhere Had to take taxis all the time too far to walk coming back it was hard to get a taxi  ided to have breakfast the last morning it took  hour before we were even served when the food came it was cold took it away and put in microwave still cold it cost us  dollars plus tip  A complete rip off  The safe in the room didnt work the key was lost they didnt replace it carried all out money with us I would never recommend this Hotel to anyone  
N => Shabby infested Within ten minutes of arrival I was approached by a mouse in my room  The mouse was quite bold and obviously comfortable in its surroundings  The first room phone I picked up to notify the front desk staff did not work  The hotel staff relocated me to a different floor which allowed smoking even though I purchased a nonsmoking room  The room service breakfast was not as ordered  I paid nearly  to stay in the Beekman Tower for two nights  far more than I should have  Had it been a refundable fare I would have relocated to another hotel  It is definitely not worth the price  
N => Be Careful We stayed at the hotel while in NY to see the US Open  Hotel is a little on the worn side but the rooms were spacious and comfortably accomodated our family of four  Overall we had a good trip  The problem came  months later when an unauthorized charge appeared on my credit card in the amount of  for The Beekman Towers  I have called the hotel four times over the past two days to try to get an explanation but the staff at the front desk says they cant help and the accountant is not available  It is possible that there was an honest mistake but given that the staff are not the least bit concerned and they have not made any effort to assist me I doubt it  I cancelled the card immediately and will now have to go through the hassle of setting up another account  
N => sucks has rats in rooms even roaches horrible hotel 
N => Fantastic value for money great location The hotel was in the most perfect loation for seeing everything that we wanted to in New York  We arrived to a very friendly welcome the staff were very attentive we arrived too early so we just left our cases with the porter  within  minutes we were right on th Avenue and able to get to everywhere we wanted to visit by walking  The room was clean and comfortable I have quite high standards and it  be time for a modernisation but to be honest the rooms were so well equiped that it jus added to the art o charm  We had a great comfy sofa and a cute little kitchenette so we could have cold drinks out of the fridge which is always useful  We had a hairdryer in the room safe and air con  There were plenty of lifts always ready and the restaurantcocktail bar was fabulous  We ordered room service breakfast and it was delivered hot fresh right on time  Good selection of coldcooked great croissantsfruit salad and amazing eggs benedict  Really enjoyed staying here for the price we paid we were very impressed  
N => Quiet yet perfectly located hotel in New York Me my sister and mother went for a weekend for Mums th Birthday and wanted somewhere that would suit us all and where we could all stay in the same room  Found the Beekman on Trip Advisor and booked due to good reviews   we werent disappointed  Lots of space great views ideally located if you dont want to be near hustle and bustle but still near enough to walk to the mid town attractions like Times Square Rockefeller Grand Central Station etc  We booked the hop onhop off open top bus tour which has a stop  mins walk from the hotel outside the UN which gets you to all the main sights of NY   is also a main bus stop which get you anywhere you need to go  Cleanliness of room wasnt perfect in corners and under beds but we had clean towels everyday beds made and the kitchenette was cleaned on our return daily  Staff were brilliant and extremely friendly   they helped us with booking a car back to the airport and finding out times of broadway shows  Great diner   United   across the road and also a  hour convenience store  Chinese just up the road on st Ave delivers to your room in the hotel and was good value  All in all a great find   we will be booking again  
N => loads of room Checked out this Hotel onlinewas looking for a room with a bit of space to chill out in  Want disappointed room was massive  Small kitchen area was ideal but the living space was huge  Not the most modern interior a bit quot shabby chicquot but an ideal place to relax after walking all day  Not a bad location if you dont mind walking around use the bus service that runs right past the door I was in a suite  smoking on the th flooraks for a room high up as the views are pretty good  Had an excellent week here 
N => Stay Away First the service My husband and I booked our hotel room on Hotwire in uary  for three nights in ch  The room was for us and three children so we thought we better call to make sure the room was going to be able to accommodate us all  We called the next day and were told by the Beekman employee on the phone that we currently only had a room with one queen bed reserved however for an additional  per night we could upgrade to a one bedroom suite with a queen bed and fold out couch so we did  When we arrived at the Beekman we signed a piece of paper at the front desk that said one bedroom suite however the room was anything but  It was a tiny room with one bed and small kitchenette and that s it  Barely enough room for a roll away  So we went back down to the front desk and told the gentleman there was a mistake that we had reserved a one bedroom suite  He said they were totally booked for that night apologized and started calling around to other hotels in Manhattan to send us to  Our assumption is that since we arrived at the hotel late at night they gave our one bedroom suite away to someone else  Anyway he gave us a letter that was addressed to the  Affinia Manhattan  Hotel and  cab fare and told us that this Affinia Hotel could accommodate us for that night and to come back the next day and the Beekman would have a suite ready for us for the next two nights  So we took the cab to the Affinia Hotel only to find out that they could not accommodate five people either  So they sent us back to the Beekman and our only choice was to take the tiny room and deal with it  The Beekman offered to pay for the cab fare to and from the Affinia Hotel free breakfast the next morning and the first night s reservation free  We went up to the tiny room they brought us a roll away and my husband and I slept on the floor  The next morning we packed up and went down to the front desk to have them hold our bags for the day and make sure they really did have a suite ready for us that night and the next  The woman Heather was rude patronizing and of course we had to explain the ENTIRE story to her as she knew nothing about the situation and she was not the least bit empathetic  She assured us we had a suite booked for that night and the next  So we went out for the day and came back later and sure enough the suite was awaiting us  This room was much more spacious  We still had to get a roll away but at least nobody had to sleep on the floor  Much to our dis when we received the bill on the third morning they charged us for the breakfast the cab fare and three upgrade fees at  each  After complaining to the front desk to whom we AGAIN had to explain the whole story they took off one upgrade fee the breakfast and the cab fare  We now have a mysterious  charge on our credit card that we can only assume is for the roll away as we had no parking charges because we didn t have a car  I can t muster up the energy to call about that at this point  We prepaid Hotwire for all three nights so I am assuming the  first night free  promise will never materialize  Now for the rooms Dirty  Very old and dirty  The bathroom fixtures and appliances were in desperate need of an upgrade there was mold on the bathroom wall around the window the floors were dirty and the carpet was bunching up and folding in places obviously needs replaced the water was brown when we first turned it on in the shower just all kinds of problems  The heatingcooling unit was also difficult to deal with  The one bed hotel room the first night was especially old and dirty  Hotwire has this hotel rated a three star  I can only assume the rating is based on the lobby and the location alone  Everything else was a mess  The only good thing about the rooms was the kitchenette  That was ent  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone nor will I ever stay here again  The location was okay the restaurant across the street called the Nations Caf  I believe was very good and the service there was wonderful  Do not stay here if you have ANY other options and if you do have to stay here call to confirm your reservation and get the person s name you speak with  Without that you re obviously a liar according to the front desk personnel  
N => Not a  Star Hotel I had booked the room through Priceline com  I was looking for a  or  Star hotel in mid town Manhatten for a weekend get a way What I got was the Beekman Tower for  a night  Great price for mid town but there was a lot to be desired  Location was OK at st and th    just a   min walk to all of the action of midtown  There were a good number of smaller less popular restaurants in the area  Staff was great although we did have to wait  min to get into our room  The room we had was a studio next to the compactor room So from time to time there was a lot of clanking coming from the next room  We were on the th floor with a view of st street heading north  The room was clean enough   but the rooms needed a face lift  Carpets were old and tired and I felt like I was staying at someones grandmothers house  
N => Only average best avoided The Beekman was our major quotspendquot for a week in NY we chose to spend a few nights out in Queens to save money and finish off the week with a couple of nights in the supposedly nice Beekman Hotel on Manhattan We booked a stay in the Beekman via an online booking agent which is where our problems began  The booking had been cancelled by the Beekman due to payment not getting made as of our time of check in by the booking agent  Not their problem I guess but the manager we spoke to had to be the rudest person I met in NY all week   we were obviously in a spot of bother and the best she could offer us was a different lesser room which would have been OK except she insisted on charging us UPFRONT for the full room rate plus some  As finding a room at such late notice in NY is next to impossible we were forced into taking this room  When I tried to reason with the manager regarding the price suggesting that the rate they were supposed to have been paid by the agent and which we had booked at was approximately half of this value she refused to cooperate  Her perogative I guess but a terrible attitude in general The room itself was indeed massive I think it was one of their quotstudiosquot but it was in a different building with no porter service offered  The room was in a fairly repit state possibly why it was still empty and not clean enough by any stretch  The sheets on the bed were also threadbare and rough which is not what you expect when paying over US per night The only good thing was access to a very old and broken kitchentte and the minimal street noise we were subject to due to our location   necessary as we needed to have the windows open for ventilation as there was no cooling or heating to speak ofOverall I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone   if you book a few months in advance you can get a lot nicer in Manhattan for less money  I could have forgiven some of the failings if it werent for the most obnoxious management I have ever come across   if the hotel wants to accept business from agents then they should be more accomdating to problems such as we had rather than viewing them as a means to double their money  
N => Dont hesitate  Solid Hotel  My wife and I wanted something other than the typical pricey Times Square Hotel and we were very pleased  We were unpgraded to a br and could have brought the kids with plenty of room  We ended up walking to Times Square anyway but it was nice to stay outside the norm Very nice hotel  Not luxurious  But at   It was better than staying in a riott Courtyard which is what we usually do  
N => great mini break stayed here for  days excellent location easy walking distance to times square shops etc hotel in quieter part of new york overlooking east rivernot far from La guardia or jfk airport   dollars transfer hotel will organise limo as they do not call taxis to collect at hotel this is more expensive though  The hotel was clean and staff very helpful the heating in the suite was very effective too hot most of the time had to turn it off it was one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in very handy with the kitchen and erate lounge  great time had by all would certainly go back to this hotel everyone should go to new york once before they die 
N => Sleepless in Beekman Our experience at the Beekman was terrible  As per other reviews the pictures on the internet in no way represent the actual rooms with exception of the curtains  The room we had was very hot and when we turned on the airconditioning it actually blew out hot air  My husband and I woke up at am because we were scratching constantly due to severe itchiness  Once we turned on the lights and pulled the covers back we found there were little black bugs in our bed  When we went to the front desk to ask them to change rooms immediately they told us to go back upstairs back to bed and they would accomodate a room change for us the next morning  But honestly how can you go back to bed when you know there are bugs in it We had booked to stay three nights but left at am the internet provider from which we booked was very helpful in helping us get out of our reservation  The cost of the hotel is very expensive  Youd be better off staying at a  star Days Inn than at this supposed   star Beekman Towers Hotel  
N => Spacious apartment like rooms This midtown hotel must have among the biggest rooms NY has on offer  My room was as big as your average New York apartment  It also came with a hefty price tag around  dollars a night including all the various taxies levied by Bloomberg  I stayed there during the UN General Assembly when prices were outrageous all over town  I guess you can get a much better rate during the UNs off season the hotel is next door to the UN and seems to cater to delegations  In terms of design and furniture theres nothing to write home about    the usual heavy American Grandpa style you find in hotels all around the country  
N =>  Bedroom Suite   Nice size Accomodation   Quiet location The Beekman Tower was a nice place to stay in NYC if you want to be close to midtown but off the beaten path  It was located on the mid east side of town a short walking distance to the United Nations  The lobby is small with just one clerk but nevertheless the check in was quick and easy  Our room was on the th floor and we had a nice view  When we entered our  Bedroom suite we were thrilled with the overall size of the accomodation  There was a large size Living room with sofa and chair a full size dining table a desk and a galley kitchen all in the Living room area of the suite  The kitchen was a galley style with everythiing you would need including a stove fridge microwave dishwasher and coffee pot  The layout of the suite was very nice with lots of room to spread out  The Bedroom was on the small size but still very nice  The Bathroom was located off of the bedroom and was adequate with the exception of there was only a shower not a tub see photo  The furniture and or was a bit dated in a traditional style cherry wood but it was not like it was run down and uncomfortable just not a luxury brand new style  I have no real complaints about this hotel as the  BD suite was really quite large and we were very pleased considering we paid less than  including taxes when booking through Orbitz  For the money we got a great accomodation with lots of square footage and convenience  Another plus was that the hotel was in a more quiet area without the constant traffic and loud street noise  Overall this hotel was just wonderful for those who want some extra space and convenience  We loved our stay at the Beekman Tower  Huge room quiet location convenience  It was a very pleasant place to stay in NYC  
N => Fantastic time Being our first time in New York we were a bit nervous as to where we should stay in the city  We wanted to stay somewhere pretty nice as we were in NY for Christmas This was an excellent choice  We pretty much walked everywhere from here    we even got up at am Christmas morning and walked to the bottom of the island although it took a few hours We had excellent service thorughout our stay and the staff were always happy to stop and have a chat whenever we needed help or had a question We were more than happy with our room we had a suite and it was more than sufficient    we even got our own kitchen although it wasnt really ever usedAll up we were thrilled with the Beekman Tower and would stay again in a heart beat  
N => Okay is a perfect description I stayed here with two other business colleagues  New York was booked solid due to conventions so we could either stay at the Beekman for  or someplace else for   We did the responsible thing and stayed at the Beekman for a night The staff was very friendly on our initial arrival but there was some confusion about our rooms  Clearly not as good of a reservation system as youll find at the larger chains  They gave us one room and promised the other  later  When we returned they tried to get  of us to share a room  Needless to say I let them know that was not acceptable and they backed off and gave us two rooms  Not very st on their part to try and put  business people in the same room The rooms are clean and ent sized by NY standards  The bed was not the most comfortable but passable for a night  The big flaw with the rooms was the air conditioning units  They either didnt work well or were very noisy in all of our rooms  None of us got a good night of sleep At checkout there was again confusion about payment for the rooms but it got sorted out properly Overall it was probably still worth saving our company about  but this is not a place I would seek out again  
N => Even give me a free I would never stay it The picture of internet was not actually with really hotel room  I was requested for one bed room high floor suite room but the room was only give me on the th floor out of st floor and the bathroom was very very very smallI have been many hotel but never see it so small  Service was not very good too  It was make me very unhappy and very angry I was requested for  person room which is one queen size bed and one sofa bed but actually it has only give me  person bedroom  I was tell than set up for sofa bed in the first night than after they were forget it even I have been requert the sofa bed but they STILL or try to forget it  The service was not really respecting and care to custome  I really has bad experiences so Even if it give me one more change or free to stay again  Sorry I would give up this change  
N => exremely impressed with beekman tower hotel We arrived on th il for  nights  We were dealt with quickly and given the keys to our room on the th floor  I had advised the Hotelthat it was our th wedding anniversary and my husbands birthday so they gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and fantastic views from our roomThe room was big with kitchen area and bathroom etc yes it is slightly dated but we loved it because it was clean spacious and cosy  We did end up with the window open as it was quite warm however the weather was in late s to s anyway  We walked to Time Square  mid Town in around  mins infact we walked mostly everywhere only getting a taxi once and buses  with o metro card each to Ellis Island China Town Tribecca Ground Zero etc so good location Each moring we either had breakfast at the United Nations cafe opposite or got a bagel and juice to go in the little shop next to cafe On the day we left we experienced major problems with the shuttle service blue bus  This was pre paid with our holiday  They are renowned to be totally unreliable   we learned from our friendly dooeman and unforyunately didnt bother coming to collect us as thetraffic was bad An hour later and with no transport  our doorman quickly arranged the hotel car to take us  We had no dollars left so they kindly let us have the dollars from their till with a payment on our visa   this is not done unless in an emergency We got to the airport safely and in time   be warned dont use the shuttle our story is one of many Anyway highly recommend this hotel will not bother fining a different one if I go again as its was great in all ways   finally the views from the cocktail bar are so great they really are worth a visit  
N => Beekman Tower   Bang on Arrived at the Beekman Tower at aroun  pm local time we were swiftly checked in to our room  There was no fortunate upgrade or piece of luck that made our stay that little bit more special   we were given the exact room wed paid for and that we were expecting This makes this review even more positive as I believe I experienced a stay that the vast majority of travellers will relate to We were in the east wing  yards away from the main building  Our room was fine one large double bed a small kitchen with possibly the Worlds most effective toaster and a bathroom that although a little dated was clean and rather pleasant For the week that we stayed there was never too much noise from the street that it interrupted our sleep and to be honest I felt really at home immediately in the little studio far nicer than a sterile Hilton Hotel room As a diabetic I found a little bagel shop on st Avenue selling sugar free cakes that could only be described as delicious  Its a really pleasant hotel slightly old world like and its very cheap  I cant really recommend it any higher   stay there and youll not be disappopinted    
N => not a bad place   clean not a bad place for the price   nyc is so damn expensive   so we got a great deal from travelzoo for this hotel   it is in a quiet location at least on the weekend   walking distance if youre dont mind walking   clean no mold no bugs   be the rug was a little worn but for that price in ny   you can live with it    we had a small functioning kitchenette in our room which can be a big moneysaver for folks on a budget    front desk treated us nice even with a budget website reservation    all in all not a bad place for the price 
N => A Quiet Oasis My dhter and I recently spent  nights at the Beekman Towers  We found it to be a secluded oasis in the midst of the Manhattan chaos  The service was impeccable and the room clean and comfortable  Although not a flashy  upscale hotel we found it to be quietly refreshing in a classy way  I would certainly reccomend this facilty to travelers looking for a quiet facilty away from the hustle and bustle of the city but yet still close enough to be convenient to the major attractions of Manhattan  
N => Dissapointed We stayed at the Beekman Tower Suites for  ngihts at the beginning of ember When booking with the agent I requested a non smoking room on a non smoking floor I also emailed the hotel direct with this request after we booked When we arrived we were checked into a smoking room on a smoking floor   stank as soon as the lift doors opened onto our floorThe room was very well aired and as it was the middle of the night and we were exhausted we just collapsed there for the night and then requested it was changed in the morning The next Day the man on reception said they would find us another room and to ask him about it when we returned after our day out When I did ask about it on our return at lunch time I was told they had given our room away as we were not packed and ready to move everything in our rooms was packed up apart from tooth brushes I was told there were no more rooms so we would have to stay in the one we were in After I refused to accept that then they found us a non smoking room on a non smoking floor The rooms were clean and comfortable but there was lots of niggly things that needed fixing in both rooms they were just old and run down Loose tiles on kitchen floor curtains that dont close broken toilet fixtures etc The walls were very thin could hear our neighbours coming in every morning at about am and continuing their partying The coffee machine in the room was great but getting a Kettle to make Tea was a bit of a trauma as well but we did get there in the end We had  meal in the Top of the Tower restaurant the view was great and the food was all nice although I did not get what I ordered  There was meant to be a piano player in there all night every night as well proudly told this by reception when we checked in but there was not a note of music in there all night I chose the Beekman because of reviews on here but having stayed there I would not want to recommend it to anyone as there are pleanty of better places to stay in the city It just felt that to get anything done there was a fight and that is not a holiday  
N => Disappointing I booked a suite at the Beekman to use to get ready for my wedding and as the hotel for our wedding night  I had visited the hotel before booking to check out the suites and they seemed nice although I was obviously shown the nicest suite they have but booked into a subpar room I booked a Queen Suite through Quikbook  Upon my arrival they directed me to an entrance down the street   not exactly what I had expected  Then the keys didnt work  With my wedding dress and flowers in tow it was obvious that I was there for my wedding and this room wouldnt do  John the bellman quickly took care of getting me a suite in the main building and he was very pleasant and helpful with getting all of my stuff into the room The suite was much smaller than I expected  It was also very warm   the AC was not working as well as it should  This became very obvious when my bridal party hairdresser and makeup person came over and we were all sweating especially now that the suite was more crowded  We had to open the windows to cool the place off The day of my wedding was in the s and fairly humid  I returned to the room after the wedding to find the AC had been turned off and the heat cranked up high It was unbearably hot and killed any wedding night romance  The staff promised us a portable air conditioner which never arrived  We had to make do with a fan  We got no sleep and ended up checking out very early  It was very disappointing as we were looking forward to having a romantic morning with breakfast in bed The room was very outdated and needs reations especially when they are charging  a night  There were also no utensils provided in the kitchen   I had to run to the deli to get some plastic knives and forks  Also room service will not provide wine or champagne   I had to run to a liquor store to get some celebratory champagne Im from NYC and I didnt mind the location though some  be off put by being in a more residential area  The MM crosstown bus is just across the street which can connect you to most tourist areas or subway stops to get you around town All in all I was very disappointed with the Beekman  The heat was unbearable and I didnt get any special treatment after I told them I was there for my wedding   a bottle of champagne or flowers would have been a nice touch  
N => eptive Website Since we have been pleased with the one bedroom suites at the Beekman we booked a studio queen suite on the website for a one night stay  We were dised to find a very small double bed in a room that was too small to hold a queen sized bed  The room would have been adequate for one person but was too small for two    small enough so that it was difficult to get into the bed  When we complained we were told that queen suites  have either a double or queen bed but this is not clear from the website  The room was significantly overpriced for what it was  
N => spacious digs in NYC We stayed at the Beekman Towers for  nights in il   It was walking distance to many restaurants and seemed to have a lot of locals and internatioinal visitors its next to the U N  in the area  Our room was basically a  bedroom apartment with a arate living area including sofa bed and kitchen  It was not luxurious but very clean and had absolutely everything you needed   desk coffee table  TVs  closets We couldnt get the radiator to work quite right but it was OK because the windows opened  We didnt need to call the hotel to help us out we just regulated the temperature by opening and closing the windows There was a nice breeze our entire stay  The hotel is in kind of a quiet area so noise wasnt an issue It wasnt super close to any of the major attractions but central to everything  Central Park one day Yankee stadium the next nightclub in the Meatpacking District play on nd street Awake and Sing was an excellent drama shopping in Chinatown  Next visit well hit the museums and be Shea Stadium We loved the convenience of sandwiches at the little ket across the street we couldnt find any restuarants open late Sunday night near the hotel and the Indian restaurant about a block away  We had a drink in the bar on the top floor just to enjoy the view We booked last minute and paid over night but the Beekman Tower is a steal at any price below   
N => Very Bad Horrible experience here  I had stayed at other Affina hotels and I thought that they were a great deal  It is clear that they have not updated this place in a very long time  The carpet was dirty and had burn ks in it  The room smelled old and like smoke  Not convenent to a subway  And worst of all there is no lighting in the rooms  I felt like I was in a cave 
N => In a word    appalling I spent two horrible nights in the Beekman during the United Nations General Assembly a time when the hotel was packed and also chose to hike its nightly rate to  before tax  They put me in the East Wing which is part of the same building but has a arate entrance  I opened to door to my ground floor ior suite and was almost knocked over by the stale smell  The room was not particularly clean  The next thing to strike me was the noise  My room backed onto the main air conditioning system which produced a level of noise you normally hear in the cramped berths of passenger ferries  I went to the front desk and reminded them that Id requested a quiet room  quotThe only ones we have left are on st Avenue and theyre horrifically noisyquot admitted the woman behind the desk with a smile  I did not sleep well that first night  I slept even worse the second night because the lower sheet was too small for the bed and kept riding up as I tossed and turned  I couldnt even seek relief in the restaurant the next morning because although it was supposed to open at  when I got there at   it was still shut because of quotstaffing problemsquot  The doors opened shortly afterwards and the first thing I saw was two of the staff arguing  Staffing problems is right  My total bill for two nights and two mediocre breakfasts was more than   I will never return to this repit hotel which needs a major reation and a complete change in attitude  
N =>  star hotel This is a two star hotel not a four star Wery old and sad rooms  We changed room during our stay but they was al the same  Hotel ides what temperature it s in your room and they like it warm   Ok it s cheap and our one bed room suite was very big  Location is a litle bit off  We moved to Crowne Plaza at the U N  after four nights  Smal rooms but up to date  Clean  Effective air condition  
N => I wish I could say I hated it But I cant  For anyone traveling to NYC you definitely need to give this hotel a try My weekend trip to NYC started out badly  Some idiot state cop in some podunk Catskill town with nothing better to do ided he was going to hassle us because my travelling partner was african american  Fortunately as disturbing as that incident was if ended fine and that was the only bad part of the trip Once arriving at the Beekman things could not have been better The Beekman is right at the corner of st avenue about  blocks north of the UN  This puts it at about a  block walk to the nearest Subway station but the streets seems safe and clean even at odd hours  The front of house staff was nice and very accomodating  We had reserved a ior Suite but because we also wanted a smoking room we were upgraded to a  bedroom suite  We were told we needed to exit the building go up one entrace to the quotEquot tower and take that elevator up to the th floor  The quotlobbyquotentranceway to quotEquot tower is a bit stark Scary might be a better term but then the elevator opens with a bright blue and stainless steel gleam  We took the elevator to our so called quotroomquot  An Apartment would have been a better description  The room was HUGE by any standard and absolutely cavernous by New York Standards  You entered through a brief hallway that opened up into a living room almost larger than mine at home  Off to the left was a small breakfast nook and to the left of that a complete and spotless galley kitchen complete with stove full sized fridge microwave coffeemaker and sink  Utensils were utilitarian Corning Corelle dishes but all were perfectly clean  A toaster was hidden in one of the many cabinets and a couple saucepans and a frying pan were above the sink  Just off the living room was the single bedroom  It only contained a single full sized bed but the couch in the livingroom was a pull out bed  I did hear that they charge  for a roll away The bath is small but a nice fit  I was even able to find on street parking right in front of the hotel There is a small corner grocery right across the street and a more full sized grocery a few blocks away  The formal hotel restaurant was closed for a private function but Smith and Wollenskys steakhouse was only about  blocks away  Smaller less formal places abound in that area  All in all a very clean very large and VERY reasonably priced room  The only thing the Beekman lacks is location  We returned to Upstate NY very pleased with our stay and taking care NOT to go through the Catskills The trip was quicker through Scranton anyway 
N => Excellent Service Better than Expected Loved the personal attention Stayed for  days  Checked in and got rd floor right below a bus stop which was rather noisy as the buses pulled away  Room was nice but ided that a higher floor would be better  Front desk called right after we checked in and we asked if they had a higher floor  He said that the hotel was sold out for the night but they would try to find another room for us tomorrow  We were pleasantly surprised when they called the next morning and moved us to the th floor  The room was much larger and very quiet  This particular room had a table for dining which we also used for our computers  What made this hotel stand out for us besides the size of the room was the friendly service we received  Everyone was very helpful and attentive to all our needs  They made our first trip to New York City a wonderful experience  We would with no hesitation stay at the Beekman again 
N => Wonderful We stayed at the Beekman Tower for a long weekend at the end of il  We can only agree with the other reviews The suite  C was huge  We were expecting a large suite but this was really more than expected  It included a full kitchen that even had a dish washer and yes detergent was included  It had a master bathroom and a arate half bath  The staff was nice in a sincere way  No problem checking out a couple of hours after check out time  The only thing that we were less happy about was that our room was on the th floor  We had requested a higher floor  However the bedroom window was turned towards a quiet street so after closing the doors to the bathroom and living dining room we hardly heard any traffic  
N => Not too bad After hearing bad reviews on this site about another hotel we made reservations at I ided to give this hotel a try  The reviews were good but the main thing was the price  No its not the Waldorf but for   a night I was not complaining  The staff was very nice  There was this one bellman who was always extra nice to us  When I left they asked if everything was to my liking  It was nice to have someone be nice to you when it seems the whole city is either rude or very impatient I had a street vendor in China Town call me quotstupidquot because I wanted to open up his t shirts to see what they looked like  I know the city is fast paced but when it seems like no one in New York cares the Beekmans staff seemed to always smile when we walked into the doors  The housekeeping was great too  They even washed the dishes once for us  The room was very quiet We were in the corner and I only heard the people next door to us once when they closed the door  Having a room quiet is very important for me  I booked our trip with a well known website and the pictures they showed us didnt look like the room we got  The kitchen was smaller as was the bathroom  I liked having a kitchen because we bought cereal from a ket around the corner and ate in our room every morning  For cost reasons this is the way to go  The location was nice     right next to the United Nations and it was mostly residental  I requested a high floor the day before we checked in and I got the th floor out of  floors  I also took the advice of a previous guest and told them that it was an anniversary and they left us a nice note and some chocolates and Pelligrino water  Nice gesture  Overall I would recommend this nice hotel and I am a picky person  Believe me I dont recommend places often  
N => Great Hotel Having read so many good revievs on this hotel on this site I was still impressed with the level of service provided by the staff at The Beekman Towers  we spent four nights there and while the first two were in a different suite on the bottom floor which was spacious but dark  I complained about a noise that woke me on the second night and as they explained to me that it was the heat and probably would happen again set us up in a slightly smaller but more standard room on the th floor  Beautiful view and very comfortable bed  i was   mths pregnant Pillows galore they have several kinds to choose from  Very courteous doormen and wonderful cafedeli across street that had great food at reasonable prices  The kitchenette was huge and we used it to heat leftovers from the night before when we were just too tired from seeing all the sights to go out again  What a life saver Pregnant as I am it was not that bad a walk to all the sights on times square and Rockefeller Center  All in all if and when we go back it will be to the beekman Highly recommended Not fancy but Comfortable 
N => Needs an Update Good Service We spent a night during Christmas week at the Beekman Towers  While we were impressed by the service the rooms are dated and do not expect the most comfortable furnishings  In particular our queen bed which seemed a bit smaller than that was extremely uncomfortable and provided for less than a restful night of sleep  The bedding was also not desirable   a thin blanket that you would see at a lesser property  Also there was some street noise due to the age of the windows  On the plus side although the bedroom was tiny the arate livingdining room was great for the kids to spread out and enjoy  The service was quick and friendly  The kitchen was adequate I dont think we would rush back to the Beekman  However if youre looking for a large space at a good rate you  want to consider it  
N => Friendly Hotel  My wife  yr old dhter and I  really enjoyed ourstay at this hotel The accomodation was comfortableand tidy  Members of staff were extra helpful  Not too much trouble to make a call  with any enquiries youmight have  prior to visiting somewhere We intend to visit this great city again  We will tryto make a reservation at Beekman Tower as first choice  
N => home from home This was our nd stay at the Beekman in  year  The first trip was OK but the quotsuitequot we had was tiny for us and our  kids  This time it was just the  of us but we were given a huuuuuuge suite  The hotel and rooms are in need of serious updating but they are adequate amp comfortable with all the amenities you need  The concierge even recognized us from the last time  There were many familiar faces which was very comforting The suite was clean not spotless   but satisfactory  The Beekman is in a lovely safe neighborhood   we love it and feel very at home there  
N => great return stay Returned to the beekman for the second time this year same super service got upgrade to super suite on  floor staff super as ever nothing to much trouble shop around there are some great rates around for this hotel so have look around  
N => Terrible Air conditioner in room did not function properly  Staff was unresponsive to requests to fix the problem  Carpets in rooms were shabby and rooms were not cleaned properly 
N => Old Stayed here around graduation week as there was no other option  Room was old smelly and with a dated kitchenette  Was a suite but still small  Staff was very friendly and attentive though  Restaurant looked interesting but didnt try  Near UN and nothing else  Boring location  
N => Excellent choice  This was our first trip to New York and we were a little apprehensive  However this hotel really was excellent  The room was spotlessly clean and the hotel staff were very professional   nothing was too much trouble  They responded very quickly to any requests we had and were extremely helpful if we had any queries  The area surrounding the hotel was very pleasant and we were happy to be outside the centre of Manhattan  New York is such a hectic place that it was nice to return to the quieter area around the hotel in the nights after a busy day walking and sightseeing I read all the reviews on this hotel before my trip and wondered if they were accurate however I can honestly say that this hotel lived up to all the positive comments Id read  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and if I ever visit New York again I wouldnt hesitate to stay at this hotel  
N => Excellent if rooms are high I experienced two rooms during my stay at beekman because at first they put me in a rd floor room which was quite good but views was not really exciting and a bit of noise pervade our room so i asked to changed it  The receptionist who called  second after we got into our room asked if everithing was ok so i asked for change  She replies some better room  be free the next day  So we waited and we received with no extra  an incredible st floor room with an excellent view a king size bed and lots of space around it Excellent 
N => Excellent value spacious and tidy rooms   of us shared  one bedroom suites and all were delighted with the space and how clean they all were  Superb value I have spent a lot more to stay in inferior accomodation  As someone who slept in the sofa bed I can confirm that it was as comfortable as a normal bed NOT one of those with a flimsy mattressHaving read the few negative reviews on here I can only assume they are talking about somewhere else  peeling paint and small roomsSimply not the case The only negative were the pricey drinks in the Top of the Tower but you dont have to go there it was just a handy place to meet up before a night out  
N => We Love This Place My husband and I took our first NYC trip together in   to celebrate our anniversary so expectations were high  It seemed we were playing quotmusical roomsquot the first few days which put a damper on our plans but were quickly accomodated by a very helpful staff  Our one bedroom suite was velous Spacious all amenities you could ask for and a great view  The location was ideal offering scenic walks and a quiet alternative to the more congested parts of Manhattan  One block west is Associated Superket which we found fulfilled our shopping needs  Cant forget the Zephyr Grill  Breakfast was fresh and delicious  Staying at the Beekman only sweetened our memorial occasion  We hope to return to New York soon and stay here once again  
N => Excellent Excellent didnt I say it was Excellent     We stayed  nights during ch amp we found the Beekman to be an excellent hotel in every department  We stayed in the  bedroom suite for  a night booked through the Affinia website which for what we got was excellent valueI spent hours researching where to stay in NY as we were wary about finding a stinker we found the absoulute oppositeI could talk for ages about the qualities of the room  hotel but a list will hopefully paint the picture  Superb sized room with arate lounge area sofa table chairs great size  Excellent arate kitchen with dishwasher fridge freezer microwave hob toaster cutlery kettle etc  All rooms clean with excellent maid service and all the good touches like iron hairdryer safe etc  Basically its a good quality flat with excellent space  Good bedroom and excellent shower  bath Helpful staff   we asked to be moved to the back of the hotel as there was a little road noise amp this was done efficiently courtesy calls by the manager to make sure all is well etc  For NY the road noise is minimal but we are not used to that so the back of the property was better  Express any preferences you have when you book The downside well the only one we could think of could be its location th Street st Avenue  This was not a problem for us it is only  mins walk from the tube at Lexington Avenue and there is a bus stop close to the hotel  Its not too far from everything  However if you must be close to say Times Square or Central Park then this  not be the place for you All in all a cracking hotel  Well worth a stay  
N => An Upstate review of the Beekman Towers My favorite place to stay when in NYC  Pleasant attentive hotel staff Outstanding gourmet food served by waiters who knew the menu  I even met the head chef who took time to greet my guests and I   He wanted to be sure we enjoyed our food  We certainly did Ill be back 
N => The Beekman was worth it I spent about  days in NYC back in    The Beekman Tower was recommended from clients of mine  I hadnt been to the city since a high school trip ades ago but wanted to vacation there to visit the sites  So solo I flew up knowing only what I had read about in travel guides I was anxious  As soon as I pulled up to the hotel I knew I was going to enjoy this trip  Very stylish and front reception polite friendly  Cozy  I was given a one bedroom suite on the th floor overlooking First Ave  Great large apartment unit with lots of windows livingroom dining desk fax kitchen nicely appointed bedroom smallish bath but with the best view from a toilet in the city B fast in the Zephyr was superb and cocktails up in the Tower were excellent Did not order room service  Felt pampered every day coming back to my quotplacequot after long days out in the greatest city Location is good  a little quottoo eastquot but it all depends on what you want to do and see there  I will miss staying there this  as I am returning to NYC with friends but they want The Waldorf  Hope it lives up to quotmy placequot at The Beekman  
N => Stay AWAY  
N => Ok place but       
N => Could not be more pleased  
N => eins von den g nstigeren hotels aber sauber und gem tlich  
N => Great for the price Room was very clean not huge but not too tiny  This was my first quotshared bathroomquot experience but we found most NYC hotels with own bathrooms were either to pricey or looked terrible for their high prices The bathroom never seemed to be occupied anyway and was consistently clean  We had air con fridge hair dryer iron etc provided  All staff were polite and most were extremely helpful and friendly  Great location on Upper West side   close to a couple of subway stations and Central Park a lovely short walk away  kets food coffee all a couple of blocks away  
N => Cheap clean room on the Upper West Side We had one of the rooms with a shared bathroom  Modern and basic  It was clean and was all we needed for a few adventurous days in the city  We had two twin beds and a sink in our room  The room also had a flat screen cable TV and an iPod dock which I thought was cool  Great location close to many shops restaurants and bars  Very close to Central Park and to the subway too  We did have a problem with the heat and they had to bring us a space heater up to our room  
N => Trip to NYC Even though this was a shared bath accommodation the hotel was very clean and comfortable and the front desk staff very helpful on getting around  The hotel was a close walk to Central Park on the Upper West Side    a great location  
N => Great Location Will stay here again Our hotel room was a queen with shared bathroom and was bigger than we expected  Facing th street NE there was a nice street view and sunshine in the morning  Very comfortable bed good sized tv chair and suit case horse and wardrobe but no draws  We were missing the information guide but no big deal  The shared bathroom was fine much less of a drama than we thought three rooms are though a hall door with a bathroom which is not accessable to other people  The bathroom already had a lot of other peoples toiletries in it which was no bother and we therefore left our bathroom bag in there but found it in the hall the next morning unsure whether this was other guests or the cleaner  Tips min walk to Time Square mins to central park  short blocks to Subway th St hr train from JFK PC with internet in gift shop but no interenet cafes close to hotel Hair Straightnener  not work because of low USA power voltage Columbus street has good shopping and restaurants  Check out Big Nicks Pizza big and fat but the best pizza 
N => Not a bad choice for a hot spot on a budget Its in a great location GREAT  I walked to Central Park History Museum and pretty much everywhere  Its not a  min walk though but its doable It was in the inner street so you were away from the busiest traffic and it still felt residential The hotel itself is ent for the price  Overall its a small  star hotel in a great location with more spacious rooms I loved the room  I requested  double and the beds were very spacious and we still had plenty of space to walk around for  adults  Loved that it was hardwood and the bathroom was more on the small side but adequate and clean  We even had a view nothing spectacular but it was nice to be able to open the window and at least stare out into something ProsFor NYC the room itself was spaciousLocation couldnt have been better  You can go around any corner and find something to eat  Theres at least  newspaper stands for smaller items ConsElevator way too claustrophobic  Even for European standard it was probably not on the bigger end  And very slow so slow that we had to wait to get in only by ourselves so it wouldnt make any stops Not that there was much room for moreI wouldnt mind going back for the value and location  
N => Good hotel   but avoid rooms at back of hotel We checked in   around noon and were told that our room was not ready yet but that there was another room we could check into  We were tired from the commute to the hotel so we just accepted the room they provided  I asked if it was a similar room to what we had booked and told yes at the back of the hotel  Long story short  we were right outside the air vents and did not get a good nights sleep while we were there   there was a constant vibrating noise in the room  We were only there  nights and spent all day out so I didnt complain until we checked out  If I had known the room would be so noisy I would have just stored the luggage waited til our room was ready   lesson learned  
N => looks good online but doesnt deliver in person  We looked for hours for a less expensive place to stay on our honeymoon in New York City  Online this hotel looked amazing The rooms looked clean and all we could find by way of complaint was that the elevator was small and there were outside noises  My husband and I thought we could handle both  Little did I know that when you sign up for a shared bathroom which neither of us minded you never see the other hotel guests that you sign up for a room barely larger than the queen bed  Also the tv looked like it had been from the s the heating was either way to much or not enough and when we went down to complain that they had ripped us off on the room   they refused to help us but said that they couldnt do anything for us but if we wanted they could move us to a larger room for a more expensive price the next day  I was very upset by how beautiful the rooms appeared be online and how trashy the room turned out to be  We also had made a request before arriving that there be no goose down or feathers in the room   they didnt do anything about it until an hour after we had already been in the room  
N => Clean and Tasteful at a ent Price I stayed here with a large business group of about  from school on an excursion to New York City so stayed in a suite with  other girls  I was a little apprehensive at first since the hotel seemed to be going extensive reations when we arrived so that you could not even see the front exterior of the hotel  Also it took a little more time than desired to check in However once we were able to put away our luggage and sit down in our rooms for a moment I was pleased with the modern but not over the top or of the suite  Everything was clean and well organized and after a long day of business meetings I had no trouble falling asleep in bed The location seemed very safe an important factor to consider when youre a young woman staying in a big city as it is located in the Upper West Side and right next to the prestigious Collegiate School  Also it was close enough to a few clubs and bars that the cost of a taxi didnt inhibit us from going out I would definitely recommend the Hotel Belleclaire if you are not planning on spending much time in your hotel room while you are in the city but still want a pleasant place to relax while you catch your breath at a reasonable price  
N => Be careful of not getting what you pay for I booked a  night stay here through expedia for a room with a queen bed and a shared bath  As I was spending little time in the room I didnt feel the shared bath would be an issue  When I arrived to check in the first person I spoke to was unable to find my reservation  After consulting with another employee they were finally able to locate my reservation  When I attempted to enter my room neither of the key cards worked and I was forced to return to the front desk and obtain new keys  Once I was finally Im the room I was apalled at the tiny bed  I was expecting a queen not something that barely qualified as a double bed  Furthermore the light fixture hanging from the ceiling by its wires served to increase my unease  I inquired with the front desk about the possibility of moving to a different room but was informed that none were available  At this point I ided that my money was better spent elsewhere checked out and found another hotel  A few minor notes there was only one working elevator the service elevator was also a available the free wireless service was extremely slow and the room itself was incredibly tiny even for a new york hotel  
N => False advertisement and try to rip you off on everything We booked through an outside site and found out when we got there that it was community bathrooms Our room was tiny and didnt even have a queen size bed  There was barely enough room to walk around the bed and that was the only thing in the room besides a tv  We asked to switch rooms and they did not have any availability and didnt even apologizeThey charge you for internet and all of their concierge services are a total rip off I would never stay there again  
N => Great location friendly staff We had a great time staying at this hotel  It is near many restaraunts bakeries grocery stores and close to the red line subway so easy to get to downtown cheap The staff was very friendly  They are in the middle of reations but we didnt find it to be a problem  We did have to share a bathroom with  other rooms but this was also not an issue  It had plenty of hot water clean rooms and was quiet  We will probaly return to this hotel for our next trip  
N => Great Location Comfortable Room Friendly Staff I felt like I was taking a risk by booking three nights in this hotel because I booked it through an outside website that I was not familiar with but the deal was too good to pass up  I was nervous that it would turn out to be a major dud so I am relieved to say that this was my favorite of the three hotels in three different cities that I visited during my tripThe hotel was a little bit hard to find because there were no large signs for it  We found it as easily as we did mostly because I recognized the building from the photos here on TripAdvisor  This difficulty is partly because they are in the middle of reations so part of the outside is covered in scaffolding  However there is always a doorman outside during the day which makes the door a little easier to spot The staff was very friendly and helpful  They let us check in almost two hours early and gave us a stack of brochures along with our keys  Later when we stopped at the desk to ask about the umbrellas for sale the clerk went to the back room to get one to show us even though we werent sure that we wanted to buy it  And the day before we left our key cards stopped working but the clerk re activated it with no problem and was very gracious about it When we were waiting to check in I overheard a family checking out who were complaining about construction noise from the reations  From what I heard which really wasnt much I thought that the clerk was very nice about it and the family didnt seem to be upset when they left  I would like to say that anyone planning to stay here should be aware that there is construction going on  It never bothered us   we heard pounding once in a while but not loud enough to be a disturbance   but we did notice that they never started work before  or  in the morning and they always seemed to be done by about  in the afternoon  If you are planning to sleep late each morning or take naps during the day you might want to request a room away from the construction site when you check in  However if you are going to be up for the day by then it probably wont bother you at all Our room was fantastic  We booked a budget room which meant that we had a sink in our room but we had to share the toilet and shower with two other rooms  However this wasnt a problem at all  We never actually saw any of our neighbors and only had to wait for the bathroom once  I know that we had neighbors because we did have to wait once and because we sometimes heard them when passing outside their rooms in the hallway but never through the walls inside our room  Even though we were sharing a bathroom with strangers it always seemed to be clean although there were no towels provided in it   we had to bring one from our room Our room was practically perfect especially for a budget room  We had a room with  twin beds and they were very comfortable with warm duvets although the pillows were more dense than I expected  Im not sure what they were stuffed with but it was comfortable We had our own window air conditioner so we were able to control the climate ourselves  We also had a corner room which is actually more of a turret or rounded wall room so we actually had windows on three sides which gave us plenty of light and interesting views of the streets  There was plenty of floor space as well as a mini refrigerator and flat screen TV and they have a movie pay per view option The location is also great  There is a subway stop two blocks away and several restaurants coffee shops and bakeries within very easy walking distance  Central Park is a couple of blocks away and Grays Papaya   a great hot dog shop featured in the movie quotYouve Got Mailquot   is only a few blocks away for any movie buffs out there  The subway line is the  local train which actually took us almost everywhere we needed to go as typical tourists  It was very easy to get around from this hotel All in all I would highly recommend this hotel although my experience is only with their budget rooms  I gave  stars for cleanliness and rooms because of the shared bathroom but it was really a great experience for us  
N => Couldnt tell you much us but about the hotel  We arrived and our room was not ready which seems to be a running occurence We were told we would be put in a suite that night and that they would move our bags the next day The room was very basic one room with a bed the other room had a bed and en suite  Bathroom was actually ok and modern We ordered from the diner accross the road we flew with air india and didnt each much as we didnt fancy what they offered on board Food arrived and was hot tasted ok nothing special Woke the next morning having not unpacked we left our bags ready for collection this was around  am and told the staff they were free to move our bags We went to the same diner for breakfast wanting to try the famous pancakes and bacon  Not my cup of tea but an experience We walked through central park then we hit the shops  Starting in the massive queue for Abercrombie and Fitch This is where it all went wrong  I began to feel ill then started being sick and could not stop  We struggled back to our hotel only to be told that our room was still not ready this was now  pm   hours after we left and  hours affter the previous inhabitants should have checked out The man was very rude our bags had been moved to the new room so I couldnt even go and freshen up  He told us that without a manager to sign off the new room we couldnt even go up there  I explained that I was ill and just wanted a moment  He even had to give me a key to the general toilet because I needed to be sick again Eventually he allowed us up but only to get some things out of our bag and we had to be escorted We went back out and I tried to soldier through  We came back to our room at   with a view to get ready to go out that night to Billy Elliot my partner then started being sick so we realised we must have food poisening  To this day the thought of pancakes and bacon makes me gag as does it my partner The lift smelt of food all the time how when there was no rest on site The lifts were slow and we often had to walk Our key would never work when we got back to our room we always had to go back to reception to change it with the painfuilly slow lift this is no mean feat and a fun game to play will we make it back before one of us is sick We didnt see much of New York itself we spent  hours non stop in bed and didnt eat dinner or have one drop of alchohol we would spend our days muddling through site seeing and then recover at night in bed We still had a good trip but the hotel was a skank pit that I would never ever go back to  The sheets actually smelled like the lift did When we left the doorman gave me all our bags because my partner was in the toilet and I had to drag them to the door myself  We then had to call our own taxi I complained at the time but they did not seem interested but I am pleased to say Expedia gave us a voucher on our return  
N => Absolutely fantastic My fiance and I stayed in this hotel for three nights during the tember long weekend  We were skeptical at first as we had stayed in another three star hotel previously that year and it had left us with bad impressions The hotel from the outside is very old school looking and really doesnt look like a hotel  The lobby is absolutely gorgous small but very modern  The Elavators are tiny and they take forever Check In went fairly quickly althouugh are room wasnt ready yet but they stored our luggage so we could go out and start seeing the sights till we got backRoom The rooms are small but very modern and in a city like New York you dont spend a lot of time in them  The bed was amazingly comfortable even better than my bed at home and the linens were so comfortable i wanted to steal them and take them home  but i didnt lolRoom Service They dont have a restaurant in the hotel but they do room service from a litle restaurant across the street  You call the restaurant and order what you want and they deliver right to your door  Not the best food but still more than edible Aside from the rooms and lobby there is not much else to the hotel i think there  have been a gym but not really sure When we go back to New York we will without a doubt be staying at this hotel again you get more than you paid for with this one  
N => Try it if you want to meet mickey mouse and its friends I wasnt expeting too much but we received an uninvited visit from Mickey mouse  We changed the room  times due to rats in our room  The hotel manager could just say quotI am sorry about thatquot  I wouldnt reccomend this hotel to anybody  
N => Good basic hotel This hotel is not as st as it looks from its website Having said that its good   fair value and excellent location  Very near Central Park Natural History Museum and subway for rest of city  Staff are excellent   really friendly and couldnt be more helpful  Our room was nicely orated and clean  The bed King was enormous and very comfortable  There was a fantastic big flatscreen TV and also a full size iron and ironing board in the room which was very useful  The Diner across the road   the Manhattan Diner   was wonderful and good value and they also do  hour room serviceBad points they change the sheets and towels EVERY DAY  This is crazy most hotels dont do this any more  Our room was very noisy thanks to an air con unit outside not belonging to the hotel but with ear plugs it didnt disturb our sleep at all  Chamber maids perhaps not brilliant one day we werent left any toiletries I was relying on the shampoo and conditioner and another day we asked for an extra pillow and received even more towels but no pillow  The next day the extra towels were taken away and not replaced so not good if we really HAD wanted more towels but still no extra pillow  Hotel  pillows between  people are not enough  One of the lifts was broken not a massive problem but annoying  There was a full length mirror in our room but hung at about  foot from the floor so we could only see ourselves up to our chests  Overall impression was that they are spending too much time on unnecessary things changing beds and towels crazy leather headboard and not enough on essentials sorting out nearby noise fixing heating   our radiator wouldnt turn off  But staff are so nice and its in such a good place Id recommend it  
N => Noisy hotel I stayed  nights at this hotel during uary   I had previously stayed for  nights during ust   My first stay at the hotel was very positive  Four of us stayed in two rooms which were off each other  The rooms were very large by NY standards and the bathroom was extremely modern  Due to this positive experience I ided to book the Hotel Belleclaire for my  trip When we arrived at our room it was very different to the room I had stayed in during   The bathroom was extremely small  To use the sink you had to reach over the toilet  The room itself was fine except for the constant noise coming from the radiator  We had to call the hotel plumber who examined the radiator and ided to turn it off  he gave us an electric heater instead which kept us warm  However the radiator continued to make noises throughout the night There is a fire station just across the road from the hotel and every night I was awoken at least twice by fire engines leaving the station with their sirens blaring  This problem could easily be overcome by the fitting of double glazing windows by the hotel During our trip we were spending one night outside NYC  I contacted the hotel before I arrived to see if we could keep some of our bags in their left luggage room  They said no because of security reasons  I felt this was a bit of bad form by the hotel  All in all I wont be staying at this hotel again  
N => Loved the Belleclaire My husband and I wanted to get away for a few day  We stayed at the Belleclaire hotel and are so glad we did  From the front desk to our accomodations it could not have been more perfect  Our room was exactly as pictured on the web site  We also did not encounter any problems with the elevators  
N => Lame  If you want to stay in a hostel style hotel and pay hotel rates this is perfect The hotel has easy access to the  train and close to central park  The staff was friendly enough but they couldnt find my reservation  Not sure why not  I made a mistake by not reading the FULL description of the room tho and ended up with a TINY room a bed that they call quotqueenquot that is NOT more than a Full  I travel for a living so I know the difference between sizes all to well  My BIGGEST complaint is shared bathrooms  Why is a HOTEL using shared bathrooms There were  rooms sharing this one bathroom and Ill never do it again I cant comment on the other rooms they have that DO have private bathrooms thats what I was told but shared sucks  
N => Complete disappointment My husband and I stayed at this hotel for  nights in ember  We booked a superior king room and when we entered the room were shocked to find that it looked hardly anything like the photo on their website  The room was very small and the king bed took up most of it  There was a tiny window in the back corner of the room letting in a small amount of light and the toilet was also running  I called reception to complain and they offered to move me to a queen size room which they said would be larger  I was astounded that the king room that I was paying extra for was actually smaller in size than the queen room The queen room was still sub standard and only had a small window again in the far corner of the room  The window was propped open with a shampoo bottle and the air conditoner was wrapped in a towel When I asked reception why I didnt get a king room that looked like it did on their website they said that there is only  rooms in the entire hotel that look like the king room on their website and that every room in the hotel is a different size They also didnt send anyone to the room to move our luggage so we had to move it all to the other room ourselves  The TV reception was so poor that it was frustrating to even watch TV  We had spent almost  weeks in Manhattan staying in apartments and found that the Belleclaire was the only place where the reception was bad  The remote control also worked only sometimes I would not recommend this hotel but instead would suggest to stay in an apartment  My husband and I stayed in a wonderful apartment on W th Street close to the Belleclarie for almost a week  We had a arate kitchen large bathroom and big bay windows overlooking the street and we payed  a night much less than the Belleclaire 
N => It was ok My stay at the hotel with my sister for a week was rather tainted by the crazy man who appeared to live in the room at the end of our corridorFirst night we arrived we were put in a room that was in a corridor with two other rooms and a bathroom no problem except when I went to use the bathroom for the first time and the man in the room directly next to the bathroom kept knocking on the door while I was in there and then when I left he shouted through his door for me to leave the bathroom door open A little bit freaky he did exactly the same thing to my sister and we eventually asked to be moved to another room Not really the sort of thing you want when two girls are travelling alone and if he does live there then something needs to be done about him  
N => Very disappointed We stayed at the Belleclaire from th to th ember having chosen to return to the hotel wed stayed in during our last visit to New York three years earlier  First time around we were very happy with the hotel and its location but this time we were given an incredibly sub standard room with air conditioning that didnt do anything to reduce the super hot temperature of the room  The location is fantastic but the hotel was very disappointing the second time around   so much so that I can guarantee Ill not be back  Upper West Side is a brilliant location but the Belleclaire for us was not  The temperature is something that seems to be a common problem with the hotel and it seems to be pot luck as to whether you get a good room or not  For this reason I wouldnt condemn the entire hotel its just a bit of a lottery  All this aside we still had a fantastic time in NYC  
N => Winter in Manhattan We booked the Hotel Belleclaire as a place to spend the night rather than a place to stay in New York  A place to spend the night is about what we got  We were impressed by the pictures on the internet and found similar views in the lobby upon arrival but after leaving the elevator we found slightly different accomodations  The hallways were narrow and stuffy and our room was fairly small with a brick wall view  We chose to get a room with a shared bathroom  This was ok as we never needed to use it when it was occupied however it was a little dirty with standing water and soap scum  The room itself was very basic and again much different than the pictures we saw online  That said we were in New York and didnt want to spend much time at the hotel anyways  If youre looking for an affordable hotel with no frills but a ent place to lay your head down this one  work for you  The location was not bad as its right off Broadway in the upper west side  Its a couple blocks from central park and there are plenty of places to eat and shop in the nearby neighborhoods  The subway is within a block and cabs are plentiful on Broadway as well  Not the luxury hotel it appeared to be in pictures but definately an economical option for the traveler that didnt come to New York for the bedding    
N => Dont book you cant cancel Booked a quad room here back in il for  nights th th  in y realised I wanted to stay on the th aswell as I had got concert tickets for Madonna in Madison sq gardens  Rang the hotel to book and was told there was no availability so cancelled the room when I asked to receive confirmation number of the cancellation I was told it was ok room was cancelled dont worry about it Arrived home from new york after booking another hotel to find the belleclaire had charged me for a night for not cancelling rang the hotel and they said they had no records when it was them who told me not too worry about a cancellation confirmation  Ripped me off for  and cant do anything about it This is a cheap trick from an obviously cheap hotel lesson learned and wont happen again but needless to say I will tell everyone I know in Ireland not to book here  
N => Good location at a suprisingly good rate  This Hotel was not our first choice  However having spent weeks trawling round trip advisor and all the accomodation websites we could think of e g expedia hotels com etc we finally gave up on the idea of having a room with our own private bathroom  All such hotels cost more money than we earn in year We were dubious at first about having to spend  nights  tember to th tember sharing a bathroom with others  In reality I neednt have worried  The hotel was clean and tidy if very basic  You did get the luxury of few toiletries on arrival clean towels every day a iron amp board amp a hair dryer  The bathroom we shared was just across the hall from us and was shared only by two other rooms  In fact the three rooms and bathroom could only be accessed through swiping the same card you had to open your own room door thus providing extra security  The room itself was very basic with little oration plain painted walls no pictures headboard etc and the bed was plain white sheets  The only real thing lacking was a shelf by the sink in the room to put toiletries on  I also think the room was actually quite spacious by comparison to others I have read about  I was expecting no room at all and that we would be tripping over each other  However the room was suprisingly spacious with little noise from outside  The only noise that might cause concern came from the air con and as a result we didnt have this on too muchAs for the location it is little far up town than many  wish to be but take into account that it is only say  minutes to Central Park and the Natural History Museum and  blocks to the nearest subway station you can be downtown in less than  minutes Overall I would say good for the price we paid   for the  nights clean and well located near  blocks from a subway station  
N => Great experience We were really pleased with this hotel  I had booked a queen room and they upgraded us to a King  It was larger than I expected nice hardwood floors clean and nicely orated  We stayed in one of the round rooms  I forgot to bring my hair dryer and they brought one to the room  Nice location to walk to Central Park subway close to go downtown  I would definately go back  The only down side would be street noise from traffic in the morning but it wasnt unbearable  
N => Great hotel Great location We just stayed there for  nights on our first visit to NYC  There were  of us so we booked a  bedroom  bath room  Our room had a refrigerator and closet and the other room had the bathroom  The beds were comfortable and the staff was very helpful  Theres a subway station  blocks away so it was very convenient to get downtown  The location is in a nice neighborhood with many options for dining Nicks Manhattan Diner Ruby Foos Europan   to name a few that we enjoyed  The space to the bathroom was a little tight   be  inches wide from the foot of a bed to the wall  The exercise facility was large  We definitely would stay there again and will recommend this hotel to friends  We also used Gotham Limousine service to get to and from the Newark Airport  Taxes toll fees and gratuity were all included in the price  The drivers were very professional and the vehicles very clean  We enjoyed this option to a cab  
N => Great Location Good Price Would Stay Again We went up to New York for a few days to catch a Yankees Game before they store the stadium down  The hotel is  blocks from the th street subway entrance  The staff was very pleasant and sharing a bathroom was never an issue  We were in a block of three rooms that had to share a bathroom  We never saw any of the others in those rooms  When we needed the bathroom it was always available  The only down side as far as cleanliness was the shower wall  The grout looked a little rough but I had no hesitation about using it  The size is what you would expect when it comes to New York prices  The queen bed and a sink mini fridge side table chair and long table with the tv on it left little room to move around  I stubbed my toe several times trying to get to the opposite side of the bed  The room itself was clean and the bed was comfortable  The halways were small and so was the elevator   people and a few bags made it seems like  piling into a vw bug  The elevator was slow as well but it served its purpose and was clean  We went into the trip thinking the subways were a place you wouldnt want to be after dark and that all New Yorkers had attitude  That was completely wrong  We had no trouble getting around on the subway  We got in at Penn Station as we flew into Philly and took the Amtrak Saved us about  plus dollars to do it that way We got on at the th street station and took the one up to the th to our hotel  Then got back on the one to th  Transferred to the D to Yankee Stadium st street several times with no issue  I would suggest buying a metro card as soon as you get to town if you plan on getting around via subway  My wife lost her cell phone the day we were leaving  I sent a text to it and an older gentleman called me back telling me he had found it and we made arrangements to have it mailed back to us  He was very nice  Thank you Mr  Sandberg  All in all our Trip to New York left us wanting more  We didnt have the time to do everything we wanted but we did alot  Went to bed everynight exhausted only to get up early and start all over  The only attitude we ran into was at Yankee Stadium  They have major tude there  Dont dream of taking a packback or video camera in or they will hunt you down  Trust me on this one  
N => Great Hotel   no disappointments Stayed at the Belleclaire for  nights  I was a little worried because it seemed cheaper than comparable hotels but we were not disappointed  Booking through the hotels own website was cheaper than expediaebookers  Queen sized double room was fab   spacious comfortable clean and stylish  Bed was fine plenty of storage space bathroom was fine plenty of hot water strong shower flat screen tv ipod dock sample copy of timeout in the room  Location was super as it was close to Central Park the subway and a number of good restaurants  Zabars two blocks up is great for croissants in the morning  I would recommend this hotel to my friends  
N => Frustrating Experience The hotel was ok for the money  Definitely less than Im used to but Im also not comparing it to the Four Seasons  Upon arriving to NY around pm I had my assistant call the hotel to confirm that my room would still be available if I didnt check in until after pm that night  They confirmed that it was available as expected When I arrived at the hotel   about pm   they announced they had quotupgradedquot me to a double room  I had booked a king  I explained to the front desk person that in no place on earth was two double beds an upgrade from a king but he said they were already sold out of the king rooms and that they could move me the next day  I agreed to this but let him know I was dissatisfied The room was ok but it had more than a few things that I either didnt like or was ambivalent about The ProsGood sized room   especially for NYComfortable bed although the double was smallClean linens   sheets with a minimum of stains towels fluffyNice size desk area   although I didnt use it I always book a king bed so I can spread out on it   obviously not possible on a double bedRelatively clean room although I found some hair and dust on the floor when I dropped a pantyliner sticky side down   yuck Shower pressure was goodThe ConsGray grout in bathroom makes the whole thing look dirtyOnly one trashcan in the whole room   in the bathroomRemote control wasnt strong enough to reach the TV in the double room although this was better in the king roomWeird bathroom layout in the double room I had to close the door to use the sinkUgly light fixture in the center of the room  Really ugly   they could have spent  dollars more and made it betterInadequate lighting   I had to rearrange the lamps to get enough light to even readToiletries in the bathroom were obviously not fresh   yuck Lousy TV selection   no TBS Food Network Discovery channel TLC   No washcloths   is this a European thing This has happened to me several times lately   Hallways look like what youd find in a hostelMy opinion of the hotel might be different if they had offered anything for my inconvenience of switching rooms    but all they did was switch me  I think they should have refunded my first room night or at the very least offered me a discount on a future stay  But nothing  I never heard from them again not even to check in and see how the new room was working out Sigh  I probably wont stay there again   another NY hotel on my quotDont stay therequot list  
N => Great hotel  My husband amp I recently stayed at the Hotel Bellclaire  Having never been to New York City before nor really knowing the neighborhoods I was understandably nervous about finding a nice place to stay  We were SO pleased with the Hotel Bellclaire  Parking We arrived on a Sunday having driven from Wisconsin amp the frontdoorsman was kind enough to help us find a chance spot to park on thet street  When it was time to move the car two days later we selected the Hertz Rental Car garage on th street  They have a deal w the hotel amp parking was only  a day  considering this is NYC that is pretty reasonable  I was very nervous about having a car in the city since everyone says quotdont drive in Manhattan quot All in all our experience was a good one  We left the car in the parking garage for the week amp took the subway or walked  This Hertz lot is just up the street from the hotel so it was easy to walk luggage in hand to pick up our car the day we left town The hotel Lobby is small amp nice  The staff typically greeted us with a quothelloquot each time we passed through  We were able to check in a bit early which was nice  At first the front desk staff couldnt find our Expedia reservation but after we presented our paperwork amp the clerk checked a bit all was well  The elevators  in the hotel are small but thats typical for an older building  As someone who is usually nervous about elevators these worked just fine  We were on the th floor  I rarely saw anyone in the halls amp thought the hotel itself was rather quite  Space in the city is at a premium amp we thought that they made good use of space in our room a queen sized bed single bathroom  The or is contemporary flat screen tv etc  We basically only spent enough time in our room to sleep each night  It was   degrees the entire week amp we were so happy that the window ac worked well  Neighborhood This is a fantastic neighborhood  We always felt safe even walking in the evening  Lots of grocery stores restaurants etc  Near the subway  min  walk at most amp  min  walk to Central Park  Overall Personally I find these reviews to be rather nervewracking since people can have a random bad experience amp then trash an otherwise nice hotel  I would say that this is a really great place to stay  We saw everyone from European families to couples younger groups etc  I would highly recommend this hotel amp hope that others have as positive an experience as we did  
N => The worst hotel room ever My   incl taxes per night room was the worst and most expensive hotel room Ive ever had  Since I prepaid for  nights I wasnt able to make any changes The room was of average size but the bed was too large which made it difficult to open the refrigerator door that had hinges on the wrong side There were no drawers in the room and only a small shelf in the back of the tiny walk in closet  Since there was no place to put some bags except on the closet floor it was hard get to the clothes rack or shelf as there was an ironing board in the way There was no light in the closet  There were  lights over the bed but non over the sink or at a long table which was useless There was no towel rack in the room It took at least  minutes for the water in the bedroom sink to get warm If I put the air conditioner on it was too noisy for sleeping  If I Iturned it off it was too hot to sleep The public hall th floor looked very tired and was in need of redocoratingThe location was perfect  
N => Affordable Manhattan Sumy Make sure you get a refurbished room with own bath  It is a very cheap hotel by Manhattan standards so don t expect  star service  The hotel is very well located and very well priced but not perfect Detail This hotel has quite a few options in rooms and the differences are enormous  We stayed there for  weeks in  very different rooms  Our first night we had a shared bathroom room  Not for me  The room was so small that I kept generating static electricity as there was only  feet maximum between the bed and walls  I literally could not take a photo of the room as you cannot stand far away enough to get anything in the viewfinder  So if you are at all claustrophobic   do not go here  If you can cope with being a sardine the room was clean and we did not encounter much traffic in the shared bathroom on our one night stay  The bathroom was equally small and no where to put your belongings whilst you shower  I could not wait to move rooms We were supposed to move into a  bedroom suite the following day with friends flying in later in the day  The rooms were not as explained to me when I rang and I had been very clear about my needs  Only one bedroom has access to the bathroom and our friends would have to walk through our bedroom to reach the bathroom  There is no  suite  no living area just the  very small bedrooms and one bathroom  Fortunately we were able to negotiate  arate rooms before their arrival  The staff thankfully were able to accommodate our change but they gave the impression of being completely disinterested in our situation  Our final room was exactly what I had hoped for when I originally booked  As we were there for  weeks I did not want to be stuck in a shoe box  The room was large and recently refurbished make sure you ask for and get a refurbished room the window looked down onto the street and could be opened which was a blessing as the hotels heater had a mind of its own  Using the window for cooling we were able to regulate our room temp better than the control on the heater  We therefore had no trouble with room temp  I am not convinced that the bathroom had undergone a full reation yet as it was a strange dark green small tile  But everything in it worked and the fixtures seemed new enough  Considering how much we paid for our three week stay I was delighted with our room and the hotels location is brilliant  Subway access very handy  The  Manhattan diner  over the road is fabulous   blocks away we found a Laundromat where we dropped our laundry in the morning and collected it that evening for a reasonable fee  We had internet access in our room by paying for an outside provider not owned by the hotel  They just gave us the connection details  After connecting we had no problem during our stay The gift shop is compact and full of tourist items you can pick up anywhere  The concierge job is filled by whoever is working in the gift shop and we found them to be useless  The information they gave us about the city tour buses was wrong  They had no idea how we should go about booking tickets to a Hockey match and had no idea where we could find a laundry  We gave up after that and did all our planning and touring by researching online  The  small lifts that service the hotel are always busy and you will wait to get up and down  You can always take the stairs as we did I would stay here again in a heartbeat as it allowed me a Manhattan adventure I did not think we would be able to afford  
N => Friendliest staff EVER Our stay at Hotel Belleclaire was a pleasurable one  While the rooms were not the best that I have stayed in they were quite sufficient for our weeks stay  The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome  By the time we left the hotel we were on a st name basis with all  When we returned from our days activities the bell hop asked about how we liked       Awesome neighborhood to stay in  Convenient to everything Would recommend to anyone going to NYC 
N => Great place to stay We just got back from our stay in New York city and really loved the Belleclaire  Friendly and helpful staff especially one in particular who gave us lots of good restaurant choices etc  Close to the subway although the closest one was closed during our stay but there was one a couple of streets away  Our room was nice clean and had a comfortable bed  I only wish there was more counter space in the bathroom  With a pedestal style sink they only gave you one shelf  Very nice quotregularquot hairdryer not one of those thats attached to the wall  It was very quiet so I dont know why some people experienced a lot of noise  It might have been because our room was on the th floor and faced the side street and we also had a view of the river  I thought it was an excellent location if you want a quotquieterquot stay   not on Times Square  Overall I would recommend the Belleclaire  
N => Terrible employees worse managers I went there not too long ago and i must admit the room was relatively inexpensive given its ent location  However thats the only plus things i can say about this hotel  It all started when i first checked in  I checked in with a young lady who greeted me by my first name and continued to call me by my first name  Im not too upset about that I just thought that was unprofessional but hey that isnt near as bad as whats to come  Basically to make a long story short I NEEDED an internet access  When i checked in they informed me that room had internet however after a day of traveling through nyc i came back to my hotel room that night to find out my room DID NOT HAVE INTERNET  Supposedly there are only certain rooms that have internet  It states on their website along with a couple of other websites that there is internet access  Thats false advertising no I had to sit in the unconfortable lobby for  hours while trying to do work while there were non stop traffic not to mention the loud giggles of the girls working there  Upon checking out I asked to talked to the manager which turned out to be THE SISTER OF THE GIRL THAT CHECKED ME IN Exactly how professional is Hotel Belleclaire 
N => Bedbugs I got bedbugs from this hotel beware  
N => Dont do it I had a terrible experience with this hotel  I booked it when I went to visit my dhter at Columbia and I thought it would be convenient  It is convenient and it is also clean  However for the price    over  per night    it was really disappointing  When I checked in the agent started to give me a room on a high floor but the manager stopped her and insisted that I be put on the second floor  My quotdeluxequot room was an odd shaped room and while not tiny was pitifully underfurnished  There was no dresser nor drawers nor shelves in the closet to put away clothes  That meant liviing out of the suitcase  There was no coffee maker no ice bucket no glasses    only a few cheap paper cups  The hairdryer did not get hot    only blew lukewarm air    so it took forever to dry my hair  There was an air conditioner in the window that blocked the light and was constantly on making a constant hum  The second night of my stay it was in the s outside but the hotel had no heat  When I complained they brought me a space heater that blew out the fuse  I really cannot see how this hotel gets three stars nor how it charges the prices it does  
N => Everything I Hoped It Would Be   a GREAT VALUE GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD After reading about the Hotel Belleclaire on Trip Advisor I ided to book a week for my son and I on our first vacation to NYC The hotel staff was immediately friendly and very helpful  Everyone seemed interested in helping us find our way to the subways good restaurants close by and anything that we needed  The hotel lobby and rooms were immaculate  We chose the Economy Shared Queen Room which means that we shared a bath with two other rooms  Never had a problem with the situation at all and even became neighborly when our next door neighbors locked themselves out of their room  PLUS The rooms were very quiet I was afraid of street noise throughout the night but not a peep Its a great neighborhood and my  yr old son and I felt safe walking from the subway terminals to our hotel even at p at night  We will be making yearly pilgrimages to NYC and will ALWAYS stay at the WONDERFUL Hotel Belleclaire  
N => Charming and Clean The hotel was one of the cleanest I have been to in NYC  The staff was very attentive to detail and always strightening up something  We had a room that was a shared bath with two other rooms  Sounds bad but it was not  The only drawback was a lot of slamming of doors early in the morning because other travelers were using the shower and going back and forth to their rooms  Sharing the bath provided us with two locked doors before we reached the hallway so it added for extra sound insulation and protection  Location was wonderful  Only disappointment was that we did not get any padded headboard at all just a wall so not like the photos  But bed is comfortable and sheets are crisp and clean  Would stay there again  
N => Nice room with allnight bird noise When my dhter and I checked in we were told we had beenchosen to be upgraded to a two bedroom suite  The suite wasclean and trendy looking but the blinds were fully drawn despiteit being daylight  The good news was the two small rooms thebad news was we looked onto scaffolding with large bags ofdebris outside our window  They were sounds of woundedpigeons allnight long outside the window which was prettycreepy We were told the hotel was sold out and that no otherrooms were available  The value was good for NYC but notsure it was worth the lack of sleep due to the birds nestingand trash outside the windows  
N => great for family Stayed with a group including my parents my husband and  year old son and  of our university friends  the  friends stayed in a twin room with shared bath which they were happy with  we stayed in one of the family rooms    connected rooms no door in between but private enough  room sizes good for NY   bathroom fine amp plenty of hot water  everything clean and staff very helpful  my parents thought room was great too and I was happy that it was clean etc enough to stay there with small child  no restaurant facilities but manhattan diner across the road is fantastic  radiator in my parents room had a hissing fit in the early hours of one morning but maintenance were up within a few mins to sort it out  will be going to stay again   have stayed in two other hotels in NY pre parenthood and this would be the one id go back to  
N => Could have been better Stayed for a long weekend  Radiators kept us up  nights in a row with the clinking and quottssssssquot sounds  The temperature in the room was VERY difficult to regulate  Maintenance very receptive and came to room very quickly  My mother in law and brother in law stayed in another suite and their room had bedbugs but they were totally reimbursed for their room rate for the entire stay  Not sure if that was worth it or not Small hotel lobby that gets quite crowded  Great location   near lots of great little fruitveg kets places to eat Central Park  Great area to take walks  
N => Great location I stayed in the Hotel Belleclaire for  nights in    There were  of us in the group and having priced many hotels in New York we opted to stay in a suite as this appeared to be more cost effective  The Hotel Belleclaire had previously been recommended to me and having checked their website   I was impressed  We booked a two bedroom suite with private bathroom  The hotel is on West th Street in between two Tube stations ndth Street  These are really handy   literally  mins to Times Square  Like most hotels in NYC the room was on a Room Only basis but there was a great diner across the street   Manhatten Diner  It was busy good food and good value  You need a good brekkie when setting out on some serious sightseeing and shopping Most of the Diners are the same   we tried to find somewhere different one day and ended up walking miles My tip   Just use the one across the streetHotel was clean service was great  Rooms were cleaned every day  My only concern was the layout of the room  The first suite I was shown had two bedrooms but no door in between the rooms  I spoke with reception and was taken to a smaller room with dividing doors  Much better for two young couples  However the bathroom was situated off one of the bedrooms  It wasnt too bad for  days and for our close group   but please check with the hotel if you choose this option  I think we paid about   GBP between the  of us for  nights  It worked out about   a night which was nearly half the cost of other hotels  This hotel  not be as central as some others but I think in NYC something has to give   Price or location  We ided to save money on the hotel and spend more on presents for ourselves 
N => Fabulous loved every minute in hotel We checked in all five girls for a  day shopping trip prior to Xmas  Totally loved the size of the rooms and the beds were very soft and comfortableone room had one double bed and the other had two  Flatscreen t v in each room and stereo  Bathroom was lovely but probably needed  being it was  females sharing but it was not a problem The hallways are a little in need of an upgrade but you dont sleep in the hallway Staff very friendly and free safe deposit box at reception Nearest tubesubway was  blocks away and a great place for breakfast just accross the street  We will be back again next ember not many hotels allow  persons to a room which makes for a cheaper stay more money to spend on shopping  
N => Only worth it if you get a great deal The location is great but the rooms are inconsistent  Make sure you see your room before you take all your baggage up A pal and I booked and paid for a  room suite  In order to get to the bathroom the nd person would have to push onto the bed we moved In suites one room has a small wardrobe the other has none they advertise WiFi access but reluctantly admitted later that many of the rooms did not have it  Some rooms have plenty of spare outlets some have NONE  NO plug or closing in the bathtub  The staff seem willing but not really able to cope  This was my rd visit and it will be my last  
N => Disappointed  We booked a king size room for our honeymoon well in advance  When we reached the hotel construction work was going on near the entrance  We were given a room on the first floor with windows facing next building wall within a few feet even though we requested for a room with a view well in advance  There was generator noise all through the night  Next day they moved us to a room next to the lift on the ninth floor  Disappointed  
N => Loved the Belleclaire We stayed at the Belleclaire the last weekend in ober  It was a girls only weekend  It must have taken me several weeks to make up my mind of where to make our reservations and a lot of researching  Well let me say that we were definitely not disappointed with our choice The hotel is in a great neighborhood  There is a place to catch the subway a very short walk from the hotel and its the red line which will get you just about anywhere you need to go  When we first walked in the lobby isnt as large as it appears in the pictures but it is nice  The hotel staff were soooo friendly and helpful from the time we stepped through the door until we left  Now the elevators are quite small but really no big deal  I wasnt at all sure what to expect when we opened the door to our room because I had read so much about a lot of NYC hotel rooms being small but to say that we were pleasantly surprised was putting it mildly  Our room was actually  rooms and there were  queen size beds by no means was it small  It was very tastefully orated laminate wood floors padded headboards quite new looking  The only thing that I really would like to see them do would be to put more light in the bathroom other than that there wasnt anything that I would have wanted different  Also very important the room was very clean There are restaurants very near the hotel its very close to Central Park  It was a wonderful experience especially being our first trip to NYC and I would stay at the Hotel Belleclaire again in a heartbeat  
N => Wonderful Stay Had a wonderful  night stay autumn special package  Room was simple but clean and cosy felt like I was going back to my own house  Room was more spacious than I had expected flat screen TV radio that allows you to directly plug in your ipod  Toilet was clean  Pity it was a little dark in the shower area bathtub  The mini fridge was pretty noisy too so I unplugged it  And the radiator wasnt working  Good thing it wasnt too cold  Hotel staff were friendly and extremely helpful  Allowed us to use the gym shower room only  room for free to freshen up before departing for the airport  Pretty near subway station near central park upper west side away from the maddening crowds further downtown  All in all a pretty cool and popular hotel  Constant stream of guests checking in and walking out  coming back  
N => Every thing we wanted Last weekend was one of the busiest in NY  We wanted a reasonably priced room for  nights in a convenient location near Lincoln Center Radio City and the theater district  We got exactly what we wanted  The subway is only minutes away as is a bus that goes almost to the door or the Metropolitan Museum of Art  We had to take a room with a shared bath not a first choce but it posed no problem  Room was basic and larger than we expected  It had the necessary amenities   fridge TV hairdryer ironing board  Moreover it was CLEAN staff were very friendly and responded promptly to any request   I first couldnt operate the shower  Somone came immediately  An excellent find for ones budget  Jonathon Halifax a Scotia Canada 
N => If you stay here go for a private bath Just got back from the Belleclaire and was a bit disappointed  People dont go to New York to hang out in their hotel room but even as a place to hang our hat there were some drawbacks  Yes the room was tiny   the person sleeping closer to the window had to walk sideways to get between the bed and the table to get to the door  And why they even bothered putting a chair in there I dont know   the only place a person could sit was by the sink which defeated the purpose of having a desk in the room Secondly the room was  hot  when we checked in   and even with the radiator turned all the way down and the fan on for white noise the room was still overly warm  I wish wed sprung the extra  for a private bathroom   unlike other reviewers our shared bath seemed to always be in use by occupants of the other two rooms whenever we wanted i e  needed to use it  And the bathroom was NOT clean  There were bits of plaster on the floor and a broom left behind were we supposed to clean it ourselves   and the wall tiles in the shower were darkened with mildewy build up that have been I take it left untouched by bleach or Ajax We did not have a remote and the TV did not work  A handyman had to finally bring in a new TV and on that point Belleclaire gets my thumbs up attentive and efficient service  I liked the location too and its a couple of blocks from the Subway  Im not sure I would stay there again though   it depends on the rate and I probably would opt for a room with private bath  There was no excuse for the bathroom I used to have that kind of dirt build up that it did  For the amount we paid I expected a little more  
N => Great Great little hotel on upper Westside  Close to subway stop  Clean nice rooms  Sure are not large but not paying that much Ignore bad review re cockroach  Hey this is NYC I am surprised when I do not see a cockroach  Bottom line  nice place great value  Would gladly stay there again 
N => A Bit Disappointing     We booked a Queen Size room with shared bathroom as described on Expedia co uk  When we arrived the room was far from what the example picture on the website showed The bed felt smaller than our normal double bed at home and the room itself just about fitted the bed and our two open suitcase in  We had to shuffle past the bottom of the bed where a long table had our TV and towels on which we found rather awkward The room itself was fairly clean although a dripping tap kept up awake  out of the  nights that we were there that slamming of doors by our neighbours and the infamous noisy air conditioning The lift was extreemly slow took us quicker to get to the top of the Empire State Building than it did to get to the th floor To be fair the bathroom was pretty clean and the staff friendly and willing to help  We were in quite a nice area close to central park and underground  This is a great hotel if you are on a budget and if your not going to be in your room much anyway with seeing all the sights but dont expect what you see in the pictures as you  be disappointed 
N => Got better the next day I reserved a room on Expedia   who had special offer of two twin beds at discounted rate of   tax  I booked for  nights  I was taking my yr old son to see the city so arate beds was extremely important  When I received my Expedia confirmation it stated that my reservation had been placed but could not confirm that hotel will accept my special requests for  twin beds  This was not a special request but AS ADVERTISED  I called the hotel and they guaranteed I would have  beds  When I arrived at the hotel they brought me a roll away to use in a room already crowded with a double bed  I did not plan to pay  a night to sleep on a rollaway The next day we were moved to a larger room with  twin beds   but we were inconvenienced by packing our luggage and moving to another room the next morning  It eventually worked out but I was not happy with the initial results and the hotel did nothing to compensate us for our inconvenience  
N => An excellent find Great hotel in a great location rooms were small average for Manhattan but spotlessly clean as was the bathroom  Noisy aircon unit and roadnoise from Broadway came into the room but was not offensive  Staff were all very polite and helpful  There was a great little excercise room for use by residents with up to date equipment  Excellent neighbourhood to visit but also close to the Subway for ventures around the city  I have been to NY many many times including a work secondment in  but normally just stay with friends which was not possible this trip  This was as good a replacement as I could hope to find  
N => As expected We arrived around  p m  The staff was kind  As we read on other reviews the elevators were small and slow but they were working We had booked a queen bed shared bathroom  Our room was   When we opened the door we were so pleased The sheets on the bed were clean and spotless there was a sink with beauty products an alarm clock a hairdryer towels that were daily replaced a noisy but helpful air conditionning a small fridge and a TV  We slept as babies the  nights  The bed was sooo comfy I think that it was better than mine  Our experience with the shared bathroom was excellent we never really waited except once at  a m  and it was always clean The only thing that annoyed me was on the first night when my boyfriend went to the bathroom he saw a cockroach  As he light up the place it was gone  But we ided to always keep the light on in the bathroom  They are quotafraidquot of the light arent theyFor the price we got exactly what we were looking for good location clean and secure place We would probably go back to this hotel  
N => Loved The Belleclaire Hotel   Will Return My boyfriend and I took our first trip to NYC in il of  for  days to watch the Indians play the Yankees  After weeks of research we ided to stay at the Belleclaire Hotel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan  We had a late arrival around  p m  and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating  After the prompt check in we took the tiny elevator up to our queen suite  It was just as small as I had expected for a New York City hotel  The room was immaculate and the bed was extremely comfortable  The only downfall was the tiny sink in the bathroom which we kept splashing water on the wall and floor because it was so compact  Also there is not proficient lighting in the bathroom  We ided to order food from the Manhattan Diner across the street   they deliver   The food was okay but very overpriced for what you get  The location is great   blocks from Central Park museums and the subway  After  nights we ided to extend our stay but we downgraded to an economy room with a shared bath to save some money  The staff was extremely helpful with our last minute booking  Not to mention that the shared bath was not as bad as I had expected  The bathroom was accessed by room cards only shared between  rooms and we never had a problem getting in  Also the bathroom was very clean  Be sure to visit Big Nicks Burger and Pizza Joint open  hours located just downstairs on th amp Broadway  They have a huge  page menu covering everything from breakfast to dinner to everything in between  Extremely reasonable prices and fabulous food  The only disappointment I had was that when I was booking our next trip for later this month the hotel was completely booked Will definitely return to the Belleclaire Hotel again 
N => Loved The Belleclaire Hotel   Will Return My boyfriend and I took our first trip to NYC back in il of   It was a short shuttle ride from LGA  We arrived around  p m  and were promptly greeted by the friendly staff  We had booked a queen suite for our first night and I will admit that it was small but that is expected for New York  The room was immaculate and the bed was extremely comfortable  We had a nice sized bathroom which was a dark green color so not much lighting and it was also clean  The only thing I found inconvenient was the size of the sink   we kept splashing the water out onto the wall and floor  The next night we had ided to prolong our stay in a smaller room to save money with a shared bath  The staff was very accomodating for our last minute plans to stay another night  The shared bath worked out just fine as far as having time to shower  Also the bathroom is accessed by a card so it was very secure  We never had to wait to use the bathroom  I was extremely happy with the choice of hotel  It is within walking distance to Central Park and museums  Also be sure to check out Big Nicks Burger Joint amp Pizza Joint on th St  amp Broadway right downstairs from our room  The food is fantastic and very resonable not to mention that they are open  and serve everything from breakfast to dinner and everything in between  The only thing I was disappointed in was that when I went to book this hotel again for my trip later this month it was already booked Will definitely go back to this hotel  
N => Loved the Belleclaire The Belleclaire was a fabulous hotel for the price  Very nice neighborhood on the Upper West Side  Relatively quiet  blocks from the Metro and Central Park lots of great places to eat nearby   of us stayed in a suite which we were quite impressed with  The bathroom was a bit small but the room itself was bigger than expected  The beds were very comfortable the room was clean and seemed to have been reated recently  We didnt notice any noise from other guests and since its a pretty quiet part of town street noise was minimal  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to visit NYC 
N => We do not recommend this hotel Our stay at the Belleclaire started out ok  We arrived early and they did not have a room for us but we expected this  No problem  Check in lines were also very long and they seemed disorganized but again no problem  Our problems began on our third night there  We saw a huge cock roach in our room  The person at the front desk did not seem surprised or alarmed which leads me to beleive that this has happened on more than one occasion in the past  They could not change our room because they said they were fully booked  They sent someone up to kill the cock roach but needless to say we did not sleep well that night  The following day we checked out of the hotel even though it was fully prepaid and we were happy to do so  They did not appologize at the front desk or ask why we were leaving  Overall we do not recommend this hotel  The neighbourhood is nice and the price is right but the threat of cock roaches etc  is enough for us to not want to return  We love New York however and still enjoyed our week there but in another hotel  Sometime it is worth the price to spend a little more for peace of mind  
N => Threes a crowd Booked the Belleclaire for two days as a stopover to Las Vegas with a further two days on the way back  Went for the shared bathroom option on the way out but were unable to book that on the way back and had to pay another   a night to have own bathroom  We were a bit disappointed with our room when we arrived as although very clean it was extremely small and very basic with nowhere to put our luggage we only had two bags between us  However we were moved out of that room after a couple of hours as after going out for food and an exploration of the neighbourhood we arrived back to find a mouse sitting on the pillow We dont really mind mice that much but objected to sharing a room with someone who hadnt paid I went down to report the problem to the reception desk   leaving my boyfriend to hold off the beast of New York By the time I arrived back at the room there were two staff already there looking for the mouse and arranging for us to have a new room  That room was better than the first as it was slightly bigger and a better standard   still not much luggage space though   but it was okay and had no furry visitors No problems sharing the bathroom as we never found it full We stayed in a room with our own bathroom on the way back   it was a much nicer standard but not really worth paying an additional   for the two nights   in all  Beds in all the rooms were very comfortable and there were lots of towels provided Not the most central location but subway very close Metrocard one day Fun Pass expremely good value    dollars a day to use the subway  hours and yellow cabs easy to flag down and cheap  Best part was the magnificent diner across the road called the Manhatten   delicious food New York cheesecake to die for Hotel staff helpful and polite   one tip was that we booked a taxi back to Newark airport via the concierge who told us to allow  minutes to get there in the rush hour  This was way too much and we spent unnecessary time stuck at the airport  
N => Cosy and Comfy on a budget     We really enjoyed our stay  the only problem we had was we could not turn our heating down our room was too warm a good complaint when it was snowing outside  We had to get a staff member to show us how to turn the heat down  Our room was just a nice size Bathroom was a little small  my parents had a room on the ninth floor they too enjoyed their stay  
N => Rated Excellent for Value Location Cleanliness  We just came back from a week at the Belleclaire Hotel and I must say that we were very impressed  Some of the reviews on this website were mixed so we wanted to make sure we shared our experience  The staff were polite friendly and very helpful  We had requested a queen bed in our reservation but we checked in so late we were given two singles however the concierge told us the next morning to pack up our bags amp they would move them as soon as a queen bed became available and they did  The room amp the shared bath were kept very clean  The beds were comfortable amp the linens of good quality  We didnt hear the other guests in fact at one point we thought we were the only people in our section it was so quiet  However we did hear some doors banging closed  Be kind to your fellow hotel guests and close your door quietly The location was very convenient only two blocks from the local subway stop amp five blocks from the express stop  The West End ket located just around the corner on Broadway had an incredible variety of food and beverages including ready made meals  Across the street is the Manhattan Diner which is open  hours and is a good value we ate there for breakfast every day and they deliver to your room for no charge although we did not take advantage of this  Blondies Sports Bar on th St just east of Broadway was a quiet little place to have a nightcap after getting off the subway amp before heading back to your room  It never seemed to be very busy the staff was friendly amp there was a good selection of beers on tap  We would absolutely stay there again  
N => Wonderful experience We stayed at Hotel Belleclaire    to    and have nothing but good things to say about it We had a shared bathroom but never ran into a problem  The bathroom was spotless and the room was bigger than expected  There were clean sheets and towels everyday  Three things  The radiator would not shut off once we turned it on so the room was on the hot side but when its   degrees outside its not really a complaint    The TV was fuzzy the couple of times we watched it  In fact it went out at  am one night but the hotel staff was quick to respond sending someone up to fix it right away  He told us they are in the process of upgrading the rooms to flat panel TVs and they just hadnt gotten to our suite yet     We paid for the wireless connection and it seemed to go down after midnight every night  Of course you dont need the internet while vacationing but it was kind of a pain to pay for something we didnt get to use  If I had thought ahead I would have set up my computer with some sort of dial up as the phone had a data line and it would have been faster and more reliable than the wireless connection The front desk staff was extremely helpful  We paid  a night on Expedia com and it was really a blessing and surprise to find such a nice hotel in a great neighborhood  The subway is only two blocks away and the hotel is on the  line making it very very easy to get to all the main attractions in minutes  There are several  hour restaurants on the block and plenty of shopping and bars within a couple of blocks  It was worth every penny and much more  I will be staying at Hotel Belleclaire again probably with a private bath next time though so I wont have to worry about knocking before entering  
N => Perfrect Room  I had read a few disturbing reports but these proved to be false could not have asked for better room was great location was great and the staff were really friendly  I will have no problems recommending this hotel to my friends and I will certainly stay there again  
N => a true account first visit to new york the outside was dreadful but we got a nice surprise inside  We got upgraded to a bigger room without asking and we heard nothing  The BIG beds and lovely towels were changed every day  All the staff were so friendly we stayed seven nights  The hotel was  blocks from the metro  Buy the zagat book on places to eat  Try good enough to eat Viand and the wholefood store at Warner Centre  We were a party of five aged between   and we loved all these places  Just great  
N => A great find We spent Thanksgiving week in NYC and stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire on the upper East side  Its clean   cute   and staffed with friendly helpful people  Contrary to reviews we had read the heat was not on amp the room was comfortable for sleeping  It rained all night on Thanksgiving amp that was very noisy sounded like hail on the air conditioning unit outside the window but we requested a quiet room and in all other respects it was quiet The bathroom lacks counter space and adequate lighting  Its tiled in dark green and has one ceiling light   tough for women to apply makeup  Beds were comfy  The fridge in the room was nice to have  Manhattan Diner across the street had CHEAP breakfasts and grocery store nearby was open  hrs  even during the holiday  It was an extra  per night to have our own bathroom   but that was fine with us  Compared to prices elsewhere this was a great deal  We enjoyed the entire Columbus Circle Central Park area because it was less congested than lower Manhattan  
N => Basic I booked this hotel after seeing the photos online which nade it look very attractive  The only part of the hotel which was the same as the picture was the lobby it was orated for Christmas and was very attractive  However the room was not like the pictures at all  It was quite possibly the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in there was barely enough room to walk around the double bed  The only chair was a folding one but hardly room to unfold it  There was a sink in the room but the night stand was in front of it so you had to lean to see in the mirror above the sink  I did find a cockroach in the sink too There was no view and nothing on the walls  I have read some other positive reviews and can only think that we were extremely unlucky with our room allocation  The staff were pleasant location nice and the diners close by were good  I think I would try and find somewhere else next time  
N => Excellent hotel Great location loved upper west side  Friendly staff  The room we had was huge and speaking to other tourists we spoke to along the way this seems to be quite unusual in New York especially for the price Small gift shop concierge and internet cafe in the lobby  Great diner across the road Manhatten Diner which delivers  hour room service to the hotel Rooms lobby and corridors all clean cant fault it Cant wait to go back 
N => Bedbugs and construction   A perfect nighe weekend My wife and I had planned a nice getaway weekend  There was construction outside our window on Friday night until pm The manager refused to stop the sawing and pounding though he was very appologetic  They were less apologetic when we woke up with little bites on us the next morning  I have never had that happen to me  Suffice it to say we changed hotels for Saturday night but our weekend was already ruined and uncomfortable  PS   The hotel looks nothing like the picture   it has scaffolding up all over the place   Big disappointment  
N => Great Location We stayed at the Belleclaire for  nights recently with our booking made  months prior to our stay  We had requested a twin room with share bathroom  On arrival we were notified by reception that they did not have a twin room  I was not impressed that no one had made contact to advise us of this especially as theyd had the booking and our payment for  months Reception offered a rollaway as the hotel was fully booked it would be impossible for us to have our room of choice during our stay  We went to our room which was fine good linen and nice fluffy towels refrigerator a bonus a microwave would have been appreciated as there are  fantastic food kets within  minutes walk of the hotel all offer great ready made food as well as fresh  However the television was not working properly we made our way out to explore and advised reception who said they would send someone up to attend to it  When we returned five hours later neither rollaway or repair to tv had happened  Two visits to front desk and two further phone calls resulted in bed and maintenance man arriving  Cleaning staff were very diligent and room always left very clean one comment the maid on our floor would only knock once before barging into the room sometimes very late in the day relating that she had forgotten to leave something in our room  Share bath was fine and always clean  There was quite a bit of noise from televisions between rooms  Having said all that the Belleclaire is in a fantastic location with subway a few streets away Filenes Basement for good shopping and some good dining options very close by  
N => Reasonable stay  children and  adults stayed in a  bed suite for  nights  The first night was VERY noisy and very small rooms so we asked for another suite which was provided  Not sure that was a good move as we were put at the front of the hotel with lots of traffic noise  Not sure what was wrong with the heating either as it was either boiling hot or cold couldnt find a happy medium Still we were only there to sleep and it was very reasonable in price  I liked the neighbourhood too  
N => Good hotel I booked this hotel  months in advance and requested a corner room because I found some reviews telling me those rooms are the best  I explained the hotel we will celebrate our nd wedding anniversary and they told me they will put it in the system Just a few days before arriving in NYC we send another mail and they confirmed it was in their system When we arrived the couldnt allow us in the room yet and we stored our luggage  When we came back around PM they gave us room   This room wasnt a corner room so I went back to the front desk but they told me it was all they had So we returned to the room and after one night of almost no sleep we complained to the front desk that there was noisy airco unit outside which was making a lot of noise during the night Finally when you thought somebody switched it off  seconds later it started again  It was not about the constant noise but just switching on and off makes your needed sleep impossible They told us to come back around noon what we did because a friend arrived in the same hotel that time When we requested to move to another room they couldnt do it  We need to come back next early morning  Of course we were not happy with that but next morning we came back and they told us to come back at noon       AGAIN So we came back at  and they could give us a queen room on the th floor  Strange enough we ended at the th floor and we had a good sleep that night Next  nights of our stay were unbelievable    They were working on the heating system and during the night there was a lot of noise in the heating system  It sounded like someone got shot just near your bed We woke up several nights and that morning the heater was leaking water  When we called the front desk they promised to send someone When we waited for  minutes we left the room but when we were waiting for the elevator a guy walked out of our room so we asked if he fixed it    He told us he switched on the heating system in our room and he was gone  Uhhh    thats not the problem so I asked a staff member if she was aware of the problem and she was really thankfull that we reported this to her and she fixed it I know the price for this hotel is OK we paid  dollar incl tax for a  person room which seems to be ok in this period of the year  The hotel is very well located  You can easily take the express train red line from nd station or the local from th station There is a very good diner on the other site of the road Manhattan Diner and even if you ide to walk uptown the restaurants gets cheaper and cheaper Considering all the problems we had and the extra requests we did upfront which were ignored I wont probably stay here again But    I can imagine you get good quality for your money  I assume we were just very unlucky    of the staff was very friendly but the people handled our complains where not very helpfull and it looked like they were aware of the noise problems but they didnt feel the need to help their guests Quote quotYou know that sleeping in Manhattan can be noisyquot 
N => I was very pleased with this hotel I have to say I was supriced because I was not expecting the hotelrooms to look like they do in the photographes  But our room did  It was Nice Big and Clean and that is all I want  The staff was always helpfull  There were  of us staying in the family room and everything was perfect exept for  girls and  bathroom   but that was my fault I could have just booked  rooms  Thank you Belleclaire  
N => Great Budget Hotel We stayed at Hotel Belleclaire from     Six of us all adults stayed in one of the family suites  There were  double beds and a private bathroom  We thought since it was our first time in New York City we would rather spend our money experiencing New York City than on a fancy hotel room we would probably not be in much anyway  Although we were a little hesitant when we booked it was definitely the right ision  As other reviews have stated the hotel staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating  The room was clean the beds were really comfortable and although it was not fancy we were never in it other than to sleep and shower anyway  The hotel was in a great location and was within walking distance of Times Square   min  Central Park and several museums  There are plenty of eating places nearby and a  hour ket around the corner  Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel Tip If you are looking for an inexpensive way to see the Statue of Liberty take the Staten Island Ferry its FREE and although you will not go right to the statue you will not only get some great pictures of the Statue of Liberty but will have experienced riding the Staten Island Ferry  
N => Great Neighbourhood This is the nd time we have stayed at Belleclaire  On this occasion a couple of hours after checking in we discovered the door lock did not work  The front desk moved us without any quarrell to a much bigger room  We like this upper west side location at lot as you can escape the hustle and bustle of mid town but still find good restaurants etc 
N => Great location   Clean Hotel I have nothing to complain about with this hotel  Our room was clean the bathroom was completely updated  Great place for the price  Fantastic walking neighborhood and close to subways  Staff was friendly  
N => Great hotel for a first time NYC holiday After many hours of online research my  girlfriends and I ided on the Belleclaire Hotel thankfully not the Woogo after reading the reviews here for its price location and most importantly its offering of a room with  beds  We arrived in NYC on th  for an  night stay and had a seamless check in experience   friendly and fast  Although as other reviews have stated the lifts were small they were perfectly adequate for the  of us and our huge suitcases  I would not have even considered it an issue if I hadnt read the previous reviews  Our quotfamily suitequot was clean comfortable probably the most comfortable beds and pillows I have had in a hotel in a very long time and relatively spacious  Our only complaint during the entire stay was an issue with the air conditioner above our room which dripped loudly onto our air con  However after a call to reception we had a young man immediately within  mins attend to the situation and rectify with a somewhat primitive solution a towel placed outside by removing the panel next to the air con that nonetheless worked The location of the Belleclaire was fantastic  Having never been to NYC before we were amazed to find a fabulous delisuperket next door open hours restaurants and cafes in close proximity and even more importantly a Barneys Co op and hora just up the road We also walked downtown most days which for newbies to New York was highly pleasurable and would only take around  hour although it probably took us more like  hours giving our frequent shopping eating and rest stops The subway which we found the courage to catch on Day  was very close by and extremely easy to navigate particularly compared to the Sydney transport systemOverall we found the Belleclaire offered exactly what we were after and would have no hesitation recommending it to friends family or strangers 
N => Good hotel for the price My dhter and I stayed at the Belleclaire at the beginning of il  As we were travelling alone safety was important to us and this hotel was situated in a very nice area  The Manhattan Diner which is diagonally opposite is a must for breakfast in the morning  The hotel itself was undergoing some reations whilst we were staying there but the work did not start so early that it was a problem  We had a king size non smoking room which we found to be quite small although I have come to realise that the majority of rooms in NY are quite small and simply furnished but very clean  We had a television and a fridge in our room  The only downside was that our room was next to an air conditioning unit I think which made quite alot of noise throughout the night but it didnt bother us that much that we needed to swap rooms  We would definitely stay at this hotel again  
N => disappointed Rooms were adequate but expensive  The floor had not been thoroughly vacuumed there were remains of someones peanuts  Heating was an old fashioned radiator  There was no sign of any airconditioning beyond windows that opened  inches  This is a hotel that might have been average or above in the s but was disappointing in the st century  
N => Not satisfied I stayed in a family suite with my five year old dhter my husband and my aunt  After one hour in my room I wanted to move out  There was a smell of cigarettes mixed with sweat in our room the pipes made noise periodically and the general ambience was below my standards  The room was unbearably warm at night  This place is recommended by several guidebooks and the internet reviews seemed fine  We had originally booked for four nights but ended up staying just one night  I truly appreciate the hotel management respecting my ision to leave without imposing any penalty  
N => Just fine for us This is my first review but my mom does them a lot  I am  but have traveled all over the world from rural Iowa and Indian reservations in New Mexico to the alleged Mt  Sinai in Egypt as well as LA DC Boston Chicago etc  I stayed here in NYC with my confirmation class trip from Denver all sophomores in HS and we joined up with a group from Boulder who were also on our floor  we had chaperones with usWe were there  nights checking out on Sunday il   This was as good and in some ways location friendly staff better than most hotels I have stayed in on my youth group trips those hotels have ranged from Best Westerns to Hiltons to riotts to independent places  However I dont think my parents woud stay here as they would want more amenities and a higher level of service  One problem was the heat  We could not figure out how to get the heat turned down and it was too hot  So we propped open the window  We could do this since we were on the third floor but on the first floor it would not be safe  Also the elevators are very small and very slow  We just walked most of the time but if you were on a high floor it might be a problem  Also it would be a problem when you check out with your luggage  The TV also was bad  It got very few channels and the reception was poor  Since we did not spend too much time in the room it wasnt a big deal  But when you wanted to kick back and watch for a little while it was a problem  We easily walked to plenty of breakfast places  I had a great trip and the hotel was just fine  If they wanted they could fix these problems I think pretty easily  
N => Great Location but lack of management We spent  nights at the Belleclaire Hotel from ch    I was pleased with the reviews when I booked the hotel  I knew exactly what we were getting ourselves into so there was no hidden surprise when we checked in  The hotel depicts the websites  The hotel in our opinions was in a great location  The  Train took you everywhere you needed to go  The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were bigger then I had imagined  However after returning to our hotel after a night of sightseeing on our first night in NYC we returned to our room to a live mouse in our trash can  After requesting a change of rooms we were told that they were booked solid and that they might have an opening in the morning and a note of this incident will be left for the manager  They did not make any attempt to find us a new room or have the manager talk to us  Two nights later Tuesday ch  we found another mouse running across the floor in our room  Maintenance came up to our room and placed sticky pads throughout our room in hopes of catching the mouse  I once again asked to change rooms but they could only accommodate the change for the one night and once again they would leave a note for the manager in the morning  Twenty minutes later we did catch our mouse and maintenance disposed of it  The next morning I requested to talk to the manager but she was not in for the day yet  When we returned to the hotel later that evening I requested to talk to the manager once again but she had left for the day but we were supposedly on her to do list to be talked to in the morning  I informed the front desk that we were leaving at  am the next day and I would like to talk to the manager  They informed me that they would contact her that evening and leave a note for us  When checking out I asked if they had a note for us and they had no record of this  There solution to this was to comp us  for making   phone calls  They asked me to leave my phone number and that the manager would contact me as soon as possible  As of this moment we have not received a phone call  
N => ent small West Side hotel I stayed at this small hotel in ch  after looking over the variety of budget hotels on the West Side  The staff was accommodating to a late arrival near midnight  The room though very small similar to singles in France or Italy was very clean with a comfortable bed  Also provided were tv ironironing board refrigerator and in room sink  Would have been nice to have a comfortable chair in the room  My room was in a suite with a shared bath  arate rooms per one bathroom  Despite the proximity of guests I only heard the doors being opened and shut loudly actually  There were no problems of guests converging on the bathroom  Also the bathroom was very clean   much appreciated  Downsides  These three rooms amp bath were quothiddenquot behind an outer door to the hallway  I wouldnt want to be cht in a fire in that configuration  Window looked out to an unattractive building next door absolutely no view   The room was way overheated  I attempted to turn off the noisy radiator which helped a little  But generally just way too hot at all times no air whatsoever the weather had suddenly warmed up from the previous cold week  Also more comfy furniture in the lobby would have been nice only had benches as I had to check out at noon but transport to the airport didnt arrive until   The hotel kindly stored my luggage for  hours however  The hotel recommends the Manhattan Diner across the street but I found that despite being moderately attractive it had slow service dreary food cold toast really bad weak coffee  I searched elsewhere after the first day  The hotels location was ent for me as it is within walking distance to Lincoln Center the nd St  subway station Central Park the Museum of Natural History and nice brownstones along the Upper West Side including the Dakota  
N => Brilliant just spent  nights in the belleclaire and i couldnt fault it at all If u r looking a budget hotel then u wouldnt get better than this clean room lovely friendly helpful staff and no im not related to any of themclose to subway and a great diner across the road with free delivery which is handy specially if uve had a hard day shopping and sightseeing There were  of us and we had a family room before i went i read a review which said the family room was cramped but we found it spacious enough and we had  suitcases  holdalls and numerous shopping bagsThe only bad thing i could say was that the radiator played up a bit but we turned it off before going to bed and the room was warm enough to keep us going til morning  And this was during late ember If you have booked this hotel then rest assured u should have a great time if ur thinking of booking then go right ahead and spend the money u saved in the great shops ul find in NYC 
N => Great hotel   no complaints at all       Got back from NYC last night and stayed in the Belleclaire  Booked a suite yes one room was a little cramped but so what   who wants to spend any more time than they have to in a hotel room in NYC Clean room lovely fresh sheets firm pillows friendly staff   no complaints at all   we got what we paid for and it was more than satisfactory      
N => This hotel does not care about you My family and I were guests of the Belleclaire hotel from e      I had several concerns about the quality of the room we rented over the internet and the subsequent disinterest of the management staff to rectify our complaints When we arrived at the hotel on Tuesday the st we checked into room   Sadly the room that we had anticipated being a two room family suite was nothing of the sort  We were shocked to see how small the rooms were and that there was no sitting area that would define a suite  We had to climb OVER the bed in the first  room  in order to access the bathroom and there was very little space to set up a crib for my infant son  Not only were we disappointed that there was no common area between the rooms but we were shocked at how sticky the carpet was  The mold on the bathroom shower curtain and the stains on the alarm clock speaker were disgusting  Furthermore the window air conditioning unit had only two settings off or freezing cold and was unacceptably loud Our first morning in New York I spoke to the desk clerk who assured me that we could move to a larger suite  When we returned from our day of sightseeing I was told that the hotel was sold out and a move was impossible  How could such a terrible hotel be sold out The reservations manager cared very little about our complaints was condescending and had no desire to meet her customer s needs  My attempts to speak with the General Manager went unanswered  We left several messages for her including a cellphone number where we could be reached and not once did she make an attempt to contact us in order to avoid this issue being brought to the owners attention  Who by the way ignored my letter of complaint We are reasonable people and simply wanted to be moved to a room that reflected the price we paid for the accommodations as advertised  Overall our experience with this hotel was the worst we have seen in all our years of travel over four continents 
N => Hotel Belleclaire was perfect  I loved our stay at Hotel Belleclaire  It was my first time booking a hotel online and I was not sure what to expect  I was plesently surprised  The location was great  The staff was very helpful  They helped us find all of the tourist spots we wanted to see  The price is very reasonable and the room are nice and clean  I am definetly staying there again  
N => You get what you pay for The picture on the site are definately misconceiving  However based on the reviews I did not go there expecting much  The room was small and did not look like the pictures on the net  First thing I noticed was the dirty carpet just as you walk in  The bathroom looks like its been remodelled but there was mold in the shower  Not impressed  And to top it all off  on our very last day there we found a cochroach in the bathroom  Next time I will definately pay a little more and get a clean hotel  
N => Cant wait to come back  We spent  nights here in early ust  It was a great experience  The place was clean comfortable and friendly  The room was a ent size had t v  cd player huge fridge extra large mirror for  people to use at a time and good a c  The beds and pillows were very comfortable  The shared bath was literally outside our door  It was clean although a bit musty  Plenty of clean towels each day  We loved the location too  Dont be fooled by the enterance its quite pleasant inside  We will stay here next time  Ask for a non smoking room 
N => Pleasantly suprised Stayed rd   th y   Went to room in trepidation after reading other reviews   we were very pleasantly suprised  We had rooms  and  and they were very clean and looked as if the bathrooms had recently been refurbished  Hugh bed   the most comftable Id slept in a long time  AC worked   we were there in a heatwave and were grateful  Only real gripe was storage   no drawers   but didnt really give us a problem  A real bonus was a full size fridge   Yes the lifts only take  people   a few steps away are two normal sized lifts that go to the same place Very friendly staff   especially doormen Manhattan Diner opposite was excellent   around  for breakfast for  of us  Exceptional Deli next to hotel and an even better one   Fairways   a couple of blocks down   a foodies paradiseWe have stayed in far more expensive hotels in NY but would definatley use Belleclaire again  
N => What a dump We recently checked into this hotel or should I say quotcondemed youth hostelquot  This place was so disgusting we acutally checked out right after we saw our roomswhich were not the ones we were supposed to have because the hotel showed us as a cancellation  This is not a hotel its a wannabe dorm roomyouth hostel  The elevators are so small only two people can get in the beds looked like they were collapsing and the whole place smelled like a mixture of stale pot and urine  The bathrooms are so small you have to turn sideways to get in  The website pictures paint a completely different picture than what you actually get  Run from this place  
N => What a good hotel I just got back from staying at Hotel Belleclaire  There was three of us and we stayed for four nights and five days  I was a little unsure after reading some reviews but I was pleasently surprised  The photos do look like the hotel  The staff was friendly and we had no problems at all  Our room was clean and we felt safe  The location is great two blocks to the nearest subway  The Upper West side is a great place to stay at its not too touriesty  This was my groups firts visit to NYC and we had a blast  Our room faced Broadway but the noise was not an issue  Also we went when the temp  reached up to  degrees and our room stayed nice and cool  Some people siad their room was so small and they had to squeeze around the bed that was not the case in our room  We had  beds and our own bathrrom  The room was pretty big  The dinner across the street is great and so is Nicks resteraunt below the hotel facing Broadway  We ate there one night and had dinner outside it was great  We are definatly staying here again 
N => Good Base We are just back from a fortnight in the States  Our first  nights were spent in the Belleclaire  It was an excellent base for our visit   subway really near good places to eat close by and not far from Central Park The staff were very friendly and helpful   they let us into our room early which was really good as we could change out of our Scotland Clothes into shorts and ts before heading out to explore Our room was one of the two roomed family suites with its own bathroom  In saying  roomed more like  rooms with a large opening between the two rooms   no door so not as private as we had hoped  But for a family def better than normal family room Have to give a special mention to the cafebar on the corner   Nicks  It looks like a greasy dump but the food was fab  Breakfasts were dirt cheap   for coffee bottomless mug freshly squeezed juice toasted bagel and a huge slab of the best cream cheese We had a meal on our final night and it was delicious  They seem to pride themselves in looking like a dump but that they serve good food   which they def did 
N => upper west side experience      For my first time in new yorki was not so impressed by the hotel belleclairethough it looked nicer in the photos  it was a so so type of hotelThe windows didnt closeWe had to share a bathroomwith  other rooms   the front desk staff acted rude at timesIf it wasnt for the concierge Peter my time would have not been good at all  He knew everything there was to know about the new york experiencefrom the clothes shopping to the food even down to the night lifeHe got us free tickets to the comedy club Stand Up Nyplus he got us in free with vip status to the quotCrobarquot One of the hottest night clubs in NYHe even knew where i could find the quotSoup Natzeequot   Definatley made my time more funHe even got us to the airport in a mercedes for    I would return to the hotel in my next trip to nyespecially to talk to that attractive concierge 
N => Wonderful time at the Belleclaire Our family just returned from the Belleclaire which we stayed at for  nights  I must admit that I was a bit unsure of what we would encounter since this website had very mixed reviews but I can only praise the hotel on the following  We requested a quiet room since we knew we would be tired from sightseeing all day  They gave us a  room family suite on the th floor which was very quiet  The room was simple but clean and the beds and shower were great Yes the ac was a bit loud but we got used to it  If you are looking for a clean hotel with a nice staff in a GREAT location I highly recommend the Belleclaire  If we return to NYC well definitely be staying here once again  
N => Dont give them your credit card We were over charged on our bill  It was corrected after a fight but then when I received my AMEX card back home in Australia what did i find They had cancelled the agreed fee and bumped it back up to the wrong one  Despite attempts to have this corrected the hotel couldnt give a damn  At least you used to be able to see NYs muggers in the old days  
N => Please dont waste your money Well if I have ever seen an instance where the online photos didnt match the reality I cant think of one  First much of the staff there was down right rude  Very rude  We came in early because of a morning flight and instead of doing their best to accommodate us in any way they simply stare at my group with obvious disdain because we are waiting in their lobby  We end up not getting the double bed room we wanted they brought up a roll away bed instead  No problem we thought until we actually sat on it  Their roll away beds couldnt pass for bad air mattresses they were extraordinarily uncomfortable  The rooms themselves were small with even skinnier bathrooms  The cooler was extremely noisy and the wireless internet access was very poor  Between the poor room horrible bed dinky bathroom rude staff including what seemed like a concerted effort by the concierge to rip me off for a quottaxiquot to JFK    just combines to one simple piece of advice for goodness sake Avoid This Hotel at All Costs  Do yourself a favor  
N => Great Hotel away from the hustle  We have had a fantastic time in the Belleclaire Hotel it is a great place to stay with plenty of amenities close buy Everything you could need really  We only stayed for  nights  to  but found it to be everything that we needed which basically was a comfortable room of ample size a good bed a fridge to keep some cold drinks in amp a sink with plenty of Hot water  We shared a bathroom with three other rooms but there wasnt any problem with this at all  There was always plenty of hot water for a shower or a bath  The reception staff amp concierge service was very good amp they were always there to answer questions or to assist in any way possible  I must admit i was a little bit worried about what to expect of the hotel after reading some of the reviews from other people on this site but let me put your mind at rest amp say that it was a fantastic place to stay  Why would you need a big fancy hotel with all the trimmings when you have the whole of NYC at your disposal There is far to much to see in the Big Apple to be worrying about a fancy room Would definately recommend this hotel for all you people heading over to the good old US of A 
N => Our stay   We enjoyed our stay at this hotel  From reading the other reviews I was ready for anything Found the family suite to be comfortable and a perfect size for  adults  I was expecting a smaller room We stayed on the th floor  Our view was of other buildings and apartments but was able to see the river from the bathroom window  We did have heating problems  It was steam heat and got quite hot in the room but we were able to open windows to make it a bit more comfortable  Didnt smell the restaurant near the hotel at all  Had wonderful food at Isabellas on th street on the way to Central Park  The Manhattan Diner was also quite good and reasonably priced  Found the subway only  blocks away on th  The hotel is situated in a nice quiet area   I thought NYC would be a lot louder All in all had a great time 
N => Have Great Potential The Interior of the hotel was updated in modern tones and clean  Most of the staff were very friendly and the location is great  Unfortunately we were in a family suite on the third floor  The family suite is like having a regular  room suite but both rooms have beds instead of a leaving space for the second room  There was no thermostat in the room  Apparently they pull out the window air conditioners in fall through winter  They use steam heat and again no thermostat  The unit has a lever to go low to high but not accurate  You can t open the window because there is a Middle Eastern restaurant downstairs and all you smell is onion chicken   In the morning even with the window is closed you wake up to the smell of chicken and onions not to coffee  It might not bother some people but it was very disturbing to me  The heating unit in one of the bedroom was leaking leaving the carpet soaked  They never fixed it and could not move us to another room because the hotel was sold out  Nothing was done to fix the issues  
N => MAN TENT After reading nearly all the reviews on NYC hotels on this site we seriously thought it would be cheaper safer less hassle just taking a tent and pitching it in the park  But we ided on the Belleclaire mainly because there was  of us all male adults and it worked out alot cheaper booking one of the hotels suites with  erate beds than it did using another hotel and having to book at least  rooms  After a nervy  minutes at check in while they found our booking it all went rather well  Clean room and bathroom with plenty of towels  single beds and  double bed the double being in a erate area of the suite  T Vs ironing board and iron and enough space to pitch a  man tent its true The location was just about right aswel  Just off Broadway so not to noisy and about a   minute walk to Times Square  Also near a main subway stop ive forgot which one but we got to everywhere we wanted to from it  Also not to far from the park just in case  Give it a go its ok  
N => Perfect Location Charming Hotel We stayed at the HB for four nights in late tember  We stayed in a shared bathroom suite on the ninth floor  The bathroom was not scary nor dorm style as we had expected  The room was small but if all you are going to do is go sightsee all day and come back to the hotel to crash this is the place for you  Also lots of closet space The beds were comfy the cleaning service was impeccable and it was actually pretty private  The location is ideal  So close to so many fabulous things  Good food particularly Zen Palate across the street easy access to subway and Central Park   It was a very clean and safe neighborhood and we were really able to get a good sense of non touristy New York  I am definitely coming back to this hotel  Just dont use the phone in your room even if you have a calling card 
N => Doesnt Live Up To Reputation We spent two nights at the Hotel Belleclaire this week  The location was excellent   the hotel itself quirky  Id read that it had recently been totally reated but the walls of our room had scuff ks and paint smears on them  Theres not a single piece of artwork on the walls either which renders the hotel very stark  The window airconditioning units do keep the place very cool though and drown out the noise of the city  The beds were extremely comfortable  The TV only got about  channels  There was no wastebasket in the room just a tiny one in the bathroom  And although our beds were made and we got clean towels there was no sign of maid service  Without a wastebasket we had piled up a few shopping bags which we filled with coffee cups sugar packets brochures we no longer needed etc  and those remained on the floor throughout our stay  Our belongings werent tidied up nor was the bathroom cleaned  The staff at the front desk were relatively helpful but acted as though they were in a far fancier establishment  When I inquired about a local restaurant I was told Id need to speak to quotthe conciergequot who turned out to be a girl of about  who had a notebook with restaurant menus in it  When we arrived there was a big to do about quotsummoning the bellmanquot to take our two tiny roll on bags upstairs for us  Yet when I requested a bottle opener the quotconciergequot said shed have one delivered to my room but never did  When I inquired about it the following day she waid quotWell we didnt have one so thats why we didnt bring it quot This is a hotel that has quite a few pretentions it doesnt live up to  Still the price was excellent for the neighborhood  
N => ID SAY    STAR HOTEL Im used to  star hotels so I was disappointed with the Belleclaire Hotel  The shower was clean but there were visible patches of scrubbed off mildew  Also the ONLY elevator is too small capacity five people with no luggage  It was good for a  star hotel but NO GOOD for someone who is used to  star hotels  
N => Would never go back Stayed here with a friend in ch   I wasnt expecting the Ritz from the price we were paying but I was extremely disappointed The worst thing was the lack of heating and then the heating When we arrived the room was absolutely freezing we had to request a space heater and extra blankets  Then when the radiator was turned on it was an old fashioned steam radiator which woke us up whistling like a kettle at am every morning  The windows were so drafty that the curtains blew open continuously Other than that it was also a depressing badly orated room  Whoever took the photos on the brochure earned their moneyOn the plus side it was very clean and in a great neighborhood  But there must be better alternatives available Would never go back  
N => What    no maid service We thought that we found a gem here based on the previous reviews  Not only were we disappointed in the Belleclaire but we would have checked out after the first night had we not pre paid the three nights stay  Historical fact   who cares that k Twain slept here We recieved no maid service the first night even after returning from a full day of sightseeing around PM  Mysterious to us and the reception staff our keys failed to work after the first night  Jorge I hope he is reading this became exremely condescending advising that his quotnewquot keys should work  It took a bellman His key did not work either and management to figure the problem out  We could not access the room finally until an hour later after much proding  We would never stay nor recommend such service despite the hotels shooty attempt to reate the building  New paint does not a reation make Next time in New York I will take my money and stay elsewhere  
N => Great price clean but small Just got back from a trip with girlfriends  Second time in NYC  Upon arrival at Belleclaire Hotel the outside looked awful They were reating the Hotel  We had two adjoining rooms with shared bathroom  Rooms were very clean and the beds were fabulous with down comforters and wonderful pillows  The bathroom was small but very clean  Staff was friendly and helpful  We did have to ask for towels a few times Our room was next to the street so it was a little noisy at night  Elevators are extremely small but worked fine Staff very friendly and helpful  I would recommend this hotel  Great price  
N => no hot water Friday night This hotel is listed as a  star but I would give it   We had a double room with shared bath The room was clean but plain although it did have a hair dryer and toiletries  Towels were clean and plentiful but thin  The bathroom was clean but on one night we had no hot water for the shower and although we asked daily for  days for them to change the shower headpoor stream it was never fixed   
N => Would recommend to friends visiting NY When we arrived and saw the scaffolding outside we were afraid we were arriving to a building site however from start to finish of our visit we were pleasantly surprised  The hallways are dark and narrow but the room was bright and spotlessly clean  The shower was wonderful great water pressure  The staff were very helpful when we had questions or requests we needed more towels and they were delivered within  minutes  There were  of us so we had a  room suite which was spacious by European standards but perhaps not by US  Having said that I stayed in a   in Boston before and had nowhere near the amount of room  The location is wonderful just  block from the subway and with lots of places to eat around  Okay its not   luxury and you dont have a view of Central Park but this is great if you are looking for a base in NY to visit the sights and shop  The only problem we had  girls  bathroom 
N => Shocked    but grew on me When I first say the Hotel after arriving in New York I was very shocked to see that the Hotel did not look anything like the pictures I had seen The carpet was a bit old and the walls were not very clean  But I was happy that the bed was comfy  After being their a day or two I noticed that the location was great We had a view off Broadway we only had to walk about half a block to catch the subway  Their was a good resturant right next door and most importantly it was a very nice neighborhood very important if you have never been to New Yorkand staff was very nice  This is a great Hotel if money is tight and you only need it to sleep  Overall the Hotel is good for what you pay  
N => Cheap for college students Excellent hotel for the price we paid for  Great location near the subway  Easy access to cheap foods and kets  Location at night  not be safe for one walking streets at night but definately travel in group  The customer service was horrible at the concierge  Our room reserved online was given away  We had to settle for a smaller room with only  bed compared to   Hotel staff manager was unwilling to accomodate for a better room due to the fact that it was their fault the room was given away   our flight arrived  hours later than expected  But the rest of the staff maids and bellboy extremely friendly and helpful 
N => Spend the extra cash and skip the Belle Claire I am a frequent traveler to NYC and this time we stayed at the Belle Claire because of the price but it was not worth it we should have just paid a little more and had a pleasant experience The location is great but that is about it  The first night there was a loud buzzing every  seconds not nyc street noise either which kept us awake all night  So we switched rooms and had a lovely view of an alley and the beds gave us stiff necks and backs and our feet hung off the bottom of the beds  There are people who live in the hotel with pets so the smell in the hallway is almost unbearable so waiting for the tiny elevators was a very unpleasant experience Then to top off the whole experience we needed a larger taxi to accommodate our extra luggage and the hotel does not have a concierge to call you one they have the girl in the small gift shop do it for you  So for a car to LaGuardia Airport which on the way in cost us  with tiptolls cost us  to go back which we were told would cover tolls and TIP well first of all the girl kept  and gave the driver  and when we arrived at the airport the driver cussed us out and stormed out because we did not tip him we told him it was included and he said it was not  So we call the Belle Claire and they said they were not affiliated with the girl in the shop  I say if she is located in your lobby and you have big signs next to check in saying airport transportation in the gift shop you are affiliated with her  Big mistake on our part staying at the Belle Claire   I would advise you to pay the extra money because in the end it is definitely not worth it  
N => Fantastic hotel During our stay we had a great spacious room with a view on Broadway  Fantastic bathroom en good beds  Great hotel staff  We had a very pleasant week  
N => A pleasant stay  
N => A pleasant surprise in NYC

N => Una vacanza bellissima in un Hotel confortevolissimo

N => Not Worth The Price   even discounted I got a  rate for two nights right after Thanksgiving and given the reviews thought it was worth it I couldve saved about  a day at other similar east side hotels   I was wrong  First it is at the dead area of BEYOND York Avenue right on the water and the only thing nearby is a Mobile station  Feels deserted as you pull up  Then I came in from an international flight with a lot of luggage   there was no one there to help me and I had to lug up stairs  The front desk was professional and nice   I was upgraded to a King bed  Once inside the room I liked the or and the bathroom nice bath products but started to notice some glitches  Heat was on and it was  plus degrees outside   no way to open a window so I turned the AC on which I hate to use but I needed a nap and the heat wouldve kept me awake  Then there was no hotel directory of services I didnt know where the gym was or if they had a restaurant etc  I was too tired to go out for the long walk to a store so I looked for the minibar prices to see what it would cost to drink their water until I had some sleep    could not find a price list anywhere and even looked inside the minibar    which was as HOT as the room nonrefrigerated drinks   whats the point They had basic cable but not even HBO Several channels were just frozen   for their regular rate of over  a night they should spring for better cable  The WORST was housekeeping  Slamming doors for almost a half hour straight in the morning   there were only  rooms on my floor but the housekeeper kept walking in and out of rooms and let the door SLAM with a very loud noise  Finally I asked her to close the doors gently as I was jetlagged   was up all night and was trying to sleep  She was rude and said   well I am checking the rooms  I said yes but the doors dont need to be slammed over and over while you are doing it She slammed a few more doors and I called the front desk to complain  A half hour later as I was dozing off finally my room phone rang  It was HOUSEKEEPING asking if I wanted my room serviced  My response was the REASON I had a do not disturb sign on my door was to keep from being bothered by housekeeping     do not disturb means DONT CALL EITHER If a guest needs something they will of course ask  Just badly managed place with a general feeling of a lack of care in the rooms and amenities  No free wifi even in the lobby   walked to a Starbucks to check my email  The only pleasant experience was the front desk staff  
N => Good pricePoor location I stayed with my partner for  nights at this hotel and we chose it priily because of the sale price of  per night  Take into consideration that the hotel generally provides such a discount not earlier then  days before your check in date  We also hoped for moderate pricing for hotel services too but it was not so  Wi Fi Internet cost about  per day local calls were also for a charge  The location of the hotel is a little bit poor  It is very hard to get to centrally located sites by foot  We tried it at the first day but then ided to take a taxi  Average taxi ride to Times Squire cost    I liked room design the furniture was not too tired the only tired thing was a heater that worked not well  The stuff at the reception was helpful and very good looking  
N => Everything we needed The Bentley was everything we needed for this trip  It was conveniently located beside the Animal Medical Center where we were bringing our dog for a life saving procedure  Parking was right under the hotel and you got a discount by staying at the hotel  Our room was very clean spacious and had a nice view  The bed was inviting and so comfortable  The staff was very friendly and eager to help in any way  The restaurantbar had an outstanding view of the city  We would definitely recommend staying at the Bentley  We walked to several places and got the subway with no problems to places we wanted to go that were a little to far to walk  
N => value for money  we booked this hotel for a week in ober because it was the cheapest by far with spacious rooms and the reviews were goodafter long queues in immigration we were very happy to get to our hotel and even happier when we were told that we had been upgraded to a bigger room  The check in was very fast and the staff were very helpful and friendly  It is a little off the beaten track but if like us you enjoy walking its not a problem  Its also in a nice quiet area always felt safe  This was our third time in NYC  our last  visits we stayed in hotels near times square but after staying at the Bentley we would not stay anywhere else  We are planning our next trip to NYC already in ch   As for shopping Lexington Ave is only  mins walk from hotel and subway station to times square or downtown is on the same Ave near Bloomingdales  We would definitely recommend this hotel  
N => Friendly Staff Great Stay We spent two nights in NYC on a trip through the Northeast  The first night we stayed at an older hotel that was  star and the second night we stayed at Bentley  While both hotels were nice our experience at Bentley was great  The staff was super friendly and accomodating the room was huge and beautifully orated  We arrived early just before noon and they were more than happy to accomodate getting us into a room and one on a high floor with a great view  They made it clear during every interaction that they were there to meet our needs and exceed our expectations  We plan to stay there anytime we go back to NYC  
N => unprofessional attitude Most of hotel people were nice as written in other reviews  However every day after making up my room they charged me items in mini bar which I had not even touched I told a girl in the hotel front and claimed about those charges on the bills that I was not even aware of  Her attitude was so unprofessional and did not say a word of sorry or any apology  If I had used the mini bar and they had charged for wrong items I would have been a little bit understandable  But this was completely their mistake to charge me for mini bar and the attitude was like quotI am not in a position to make a ision on this matterquot  I would call this is a fraud  Do not stay in this hotelSam cessnacitationx gmail com 
N => perfect place After a long delay from washington to new york due to a flight with thunderstorms at one oclock pm we called Bentley hotel in Manhattan Friendly professionalclean as always are money well spent I consider this hotel a must for everyone who wants a quite place not so far away from lexington ave very confortable  from JFK yello cabits good to be back in the new york groove and bentley is the perfect place BAD AND REALLY BAD U HAVE TO PAY FOR INTERNET IN ROOMWHEN ALL AROUND IN THE STREET THERES A FREE LANBAD TOO BAD TO PAY  FOR ONE LITRE OF STILL WATER  
N => Great deal for the price we paid Overall the Bentley Hotel was great considering what we paid I broke it down to the pros and cons The pros  They automatically upgraded us to two double beds so we slept very comfortably and the room was pretty spacious plenty of space for our luggages  Great service  Location was ok it was still quite a walk away from the subway stations and not quite central but we felt pretty safe walking in the area at night  Clean bedsheets and towels  Comes with a safe in the room at least in our roomThe cons  Lacked alot of ammenities the most troublesome was no water or coffee maker so we had to go to the nearest convenience store to buy water  Be prepared to bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper   I could hear the cars honking constantly at night  The shower was weird The glass covering only covers half the shower so water splattered everywhere  We made a puddle everytime   No free internet or wifi access and their prices were quite hefty  No free local or long distance calling very exorbant pricing Its best to buy a long distance calling card for a cellphoneI would definitely consider staying at the Bentley again if we find a great deal again Though the lack of amenities was a little frustrating  But overall we enjoyed our stay 
N => Good hotel   but watch what they do wih your creditdebit card details To begin at the beginning two days after the hotel took our card details we tried to use our card in the city and it was refused  When we rang card services they told us the refusal was because the account was virtually empty  They asked us whether we recognized  amounts charged to the card the previous day US   and US    We told them no and they said they would cancel the card immediately issue new ones and investigate what we thought were fraudulent transactions Only when we told the front desk about the situation on the morning of our departure did it become clear that it was the hotel that had charged these two amounts to our card without any prior reference to us  We then agreed that what we actually owed the hotel for our stay was US    The manager we spoke to said he would deduct US  from that total because of the cost of our phone calls to the card services center in the UK  We explained that we couldn t contact card services again until Monday because it wasn t staffed over the weekend  He asked us to phone them on Monday and e mail him the details We phoned them on that Monday and discovered that the charges currently appearing as pending were US   US   US   again and US  We were also told that as those charges were still pending they couldn t tell us who had placed them until the money had been takenIt left us with only US   in that account with our cards canceled and we had to begin traveling again  minutes after placing that phone callThe hotel had by now levied a staggering US   against our account for a bill that should only have become payable at checkout and should only have amounted to that final US  We e mailed these details to the manager and said that we thought we were entitled to some compensation for the considerable inconvenience and anxiety caused and that we would give him until the end of the week to respond to that suggestion before posting the story on the web  It is now the end of the week and we have received no reply from the hotel  Our latest bank statement shows that the amount of money which has been taken is now correct and the funds that were locked in PENDING have been returned to our account  However until we receive new cards posted to our address in Belize the only way we can access the money is to transfer it to a different account which we happen to have   not everybody would which still has a functioning card attached to it So this is a cautionary tale The Hotel Bentley was fine in all other respects but if you choose to stay in it be very VERY careful about what they get up to with your creditdebit card details 
N => Most Incredible Hotel Experience  This hotel was absolutely amazing  I was recommended to stay here by a friend of mine and we called and booked directly with the hotel  The person who assisted us with booking our reservation was extremely knowledgeable and gave us a great overview of the hotel and its amenities  We right away chose to book it From the moment we arrived we were very pleasantly surprised by the hotels ambience   great music candlelit lobby very friendly and welcoming staff  Next best surprise was our room we had not expected it to be as great as it was We were upgraded to a suite on an upper floor   it had great amenities spectacular view of the city huge beds and everything was very clean with a great chic design  Best of all upon arrival we found in our room a bottle of wine with a welcome card from the general manager How sweet We now have her business card and will definitely come back  Our stay at the hotel definetly made the trip to NYC much better it was in a great location close to a lot of shopping trendy restaurants and bars and best yet   walking distance to Central Park  We loved it 
N => Not quite as I expected from webinfo and reviews but Id stay again Was surprised upon arriving to see a gas station near the foot of the hotel  Internet was  a day  Closest subway station a   min  walk  Only top  of hotel has any view to the East River due to an adjacent building  Room was clean and free of odors etc  Design and furniture were pleasantly ent  Room Standard was small for  adults though  Staff friendly and pleasant  
N => WOW WOW WOW   Trendy Hotel With Fab Staff This Hotel has had some poor reviews which was the opposite to our experience  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite they found out we were getting ried in a few days amp we received champagne from the reception staff congratulations amp freebies from the manager amp the most beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers on the day of our wedding  The suite was extremely clean amp spacious very comfortable beds lacking in storage though  Also the lifts x took a little while to arrive  The staff were amazing could not do enough for us or our wedding party of  The bellboys were great stored my dress until the day of the wedding amp generally had a lh with us on the day of the wedding long story   trying to keep me amp my hb apart  The rooftop has some amazing views of Manhattan   The location was spot on the Hotel is located in a residential district so its very quiet if you ignore the horns that go on all day long throughout NYC  It was only a few blocks from the big named streets There was a diner quotRitz Cafequot  block away which we frequented daily for breakfast  Taxiscabs are easy to come by  Tours can be purchased from Concierge  Loved it GREAT HOTEL 
N => Nice average hotel All of the reviews that I have read are accurate  The front desk women were not friendly  The door man was nicer than the front desk employees  One of the features of the hotel was a ble counter but noticed that it was chipped  I loved the view from our room that really made our stay  Room was nice  Air took a while to become cool but OK  The shower is faulty  There was only a half glass door in the shower and being open made the whole floor wet Not cool  Size of room was very good didnt mind two beds  They charge for everything here  Minibar was outrageous not coffee maker damaged hairdryer  They need to better care of this hotel I would not call this a luxury four star hotel  Location was OK if you dont mind walking  Not a good location if your looking to stay in the city  Short walk to central park near movie theater recommend rodney dangerfields comedy club which is down the street  Nice breakfast diner across the street as well  Taking the subway across that city is the way to go  Do not try to attempt walking from the hotel to the Guggenheim museum it was too far My husband and I had a great time in the city would have to say  
N => Good NYC value but out of the way Booked on Hotline got good  day rate and was pleased with comfort  Not a lot of servics and a bit out of the way  blocks to subway station but not a bad neighborhood to walk in  
N => If you want a modern light clean hotel near the centre of town   dont stay here The Bentley is dark gloomy unkempt and has few facilities I have thrown out better furniture than they have in the hotel  The bathroom was good and the beds were clean but oh dear the rest of the room and the hotel are awful  When we arrived after a tiresome journey our room eas not available and when I asked were I could get a cup of coffee I was shocked to find that the hotel couldnt provide it  I was merely told to go next door to a filling station where there was a convenience store The restaurant was appalling dirty shabby furniture and poor food and when buying a drink at the bar the staff asked for a tip yes literally asked for it Worst of all its so far from the centre of town that unless you like walking for hours taxis are always required some taxi drivers had not even heard of the hotel and had to use street maps to find it  We just couldnt wait to get out of the place  
N => Very Nice Hotel We were sent to the Bentley when our room at the Wellington was unavailable  It was a much nicer place and the room was superb  Best I have stayed at in NYC  
N => Tries to be a luxury hotel   but fails miserably I travel a lot for work mainly to the east coast and have experience with nicer hotels this hotel does not come close to a quotnicequot hotel  The hotel rooms are small as expected for new york however we had a suite   and it was still small with too much furniture that made it hard to walk through the rooms  There was a door to the bedroom that could be closed however the handle was missing from the inside so if the door was closed there was no way to open it up  There was a sofa bed that had large holes in the outside of the sofa   very visible this place was old and run down I called to ask how to increase the heat and they had maintenance come up to do it when all I wanted to know was how to do it   so I had to wait for them to show up  I had to call and ask how to set the code for the safe and after quite some time on hold I was told maintenance would be by with instructions we waited for a long time for them to show up and when we were ready to give up we noticed they put the instructions under the door without knocking to let us know  We ordered room service twice once was a quotdinnerquot we both had chicken it came with veggies and potatoes and was very bland and not worth what they charged for it another time we ordered appetizers   they were reheated and most likely frozen food not hand made  They do not do room service for breakfast and then it was only a continental buffet  It was hard to get a taxi and then it was     dollars each time to get to down town Time Square area  All in all this is not a great hotel and I would not stay here again  
N => Good value  So with my shear luck the hotel Moderne that we had our original reservation with suffered water damage the night before  I called to inquire about the parking lot but they claimed to have tried to notify me about this even though I had zero missed calls  In any event we were upgraded to one of there other hotels thus leaving us with a ior suite at the Bentley  The location was great midtown east right by the FDR  Walking distance to shopping movie theaters and restaurants  The room was quite nice although tight with quotsuitequot in the title  Very comfortable bed great view big flatscreen tiny closet and an upscale spa like bathroom  This was the first time Ive ever been in a shower with no door or curtains  Scary at first but not that bad overall  I looked up the rates after our stay there and I would say that they are quite reasonable for the city  There was a rooftop restaurant with an outdoor area  There was construction for the outdoor area but Im sure it would a beautiful place to hang out with a couple of drinks  
N => Pretty ok stay My partner and I stayed at the Bentley Hotel for Valentines  It seemed like we were walking forever to get to the hotel form the train  Once we got to the hotel it was pretty ok  Our room had a nice view and we had a good time  The only problem I had with my stay was the heat that was being generated to our room  It was terrible  We placed the heat knob to the highest it could go and was freezing out butts off we had to stay wrapped up under the covers all night  Other than that I would say it was an ok stay  
N => clean ans spacious we stayed at the hotel bentley      first time in N Y nice clean hotel good viewstowels changed daily a bit further out but that is reflected in what you have paid per night easy walking distance to central park then we enjoyed the hop onoff tour bus so distance wasnt a problem staff were always polite the only problem we had with the room was one of the heaters it was too hot turned it off easily enough all in all we have a great time at the bentley and would stay there again we did look to tripadvisor for advice before we went and reviews were mixed but we were more than happy with our stay 
N => A great hotel room to show off to friends but definitely not a home away from home place to stay for more than one night  It was my first time in New York and I picked the Bentley Hotel because it wasnt too old and the price for a quot starquot ranked hotel at the time was a good deal USA compared to the other hotels I had looked into I booked only a few days out on hotels com  I had read some bad reviews so I was prepared for anything LIKED   It was close to La Guardia airport taxi to the hotel cost USD   a great alternative to flying into JFK airport which I think I read somewhere which would have cost USD by taxi   Close to where New Yorkers lived the location was surrounded by residential buildings so you dont feel like living in a tourist zone  Modern furnishing clean bedsheets clean bathroom  Great solid and comfy queen sized bed   Large windows though curtains need to come down at night otherwise people living in the opposite facing apartment can see you but it is a fair distant apart there were views of the bridge in the far left window from my level   think it was the th floor but nothing really to rave aboutDISLIKE  No luggage assistant when I arrived had to manage with heavy backpack and maneuvering through the door myself   Staff appeared more alive with other front desk staff than me checking in  The heater did not work well to heat up the room and there wasnt additional blankets to use so you do wake up in the night feeling a bit cold  The ipod dock did not work  The bathroom set up appeared to resemble a disabled person bathroom   the toilet had a very high seat and no lid there was a chair in the shower the basin had large handles to turn tap on and off there was no where to put your tooth brush or toiletry bag or hang up clothes while you shower remember no toilet seat   there was a towel rack but water from the shower head could reach the rack the shower curtain hooks also kept falling off when you move it to get in and out of the shower  Water from the tap was either super hot or cold there was not way to adjust it to quotwarmquot which reduced my shower time   You must pay for the internet pay tv channels and snacks even if you move them from the box   apparently they have some sensor system that if you move an item for more than  seconds it gets charged to your room   I didnt test it out fearing I would be charged  No space in the mini bar for personal snacks it also had some special sensor system if items were removed   No kettle for making tea or cups to do so   Great sleep but woken up at am by the sound of police whistles directing morning traffic and attempted to get back to sleep but noise continues until am   Noisy  loud talking guest next door but this is obviously case by caseMOST UNHAPPY ABOUTArriving back after a long day to find that the cleaner had not closed my door properly after cleaning  or room had been broken into not sure really since I dont trust anyone and lock up all my personal belongings when I go out to minimize my chance of having anything stolen  I did complain to the front desk but their response was to acknowledge the call and a small apology  SUMYI stayed for  nights walking to get to the main avenues was okay since I was a tourist but would probably recommend to first time tourist to stay somewhere closer to the action if they dont enjoy walking  Overall it is very neat clean and modern place to stay but I am not sure whether that is enough to compensate for having simple luxuries such as having a heated room warm shower temperature being able to sleep in competent cleaning staff room in the fridge to store personal snacks a kettle to make some tea  So I would say it wasnt fabulous or terrible but they could definitely improve on their quality of service features for guests and bathroom design  
N => Price we got made our stay worthwhile  We went here with an open mind as we had got such a good deal from Expedia  Other reviews were good but we braced ourselves for a possible disaster  We were pleasantly surprised  Reception Staff friendly and helpfullRoom Clean  Large for NY bed big amp comfy  Cracking view from th floor Restaurant Simple but pleasant breakfast  Great st floor view to start the day with Location Just over  mins walk to Bloomingadales amp Lexington subway stn  Not much else in local area though We were greeted by very pleasant and helpful front of house staff and the reception area was fairly slick in a boutique hotel kind of way but a little worn  We had requested a deluxe room with a view of the bridge which they had provided but we then asked if there was one higher up  Floor  had a view of the bridge but the river was obstructed by another building  We moved to the th floor and loved the view  I would say aim  or higher The room was clean and big enough by New York standards and the bed was large and comfy  The view was great and worth requesting       just nice to look out at and watch the world go by in the morning or at night The st floor restaurant is a missed oppurtunity but I can understand why they are not pushingspending money on it as you would not make the journey if you were not staying there  Only had breakfast there which was a continental buffet of cereals bagels toast them yourself if you like croissants muffins fruit yoghurts and tea coffee juices etc  Could be deemed expensive at  each but is a very relaxing way to start your day with a great view Others had commented on the location but it was really only just over  minutes on foot to Bloomingdales and therefore the subway at Lexington and we would generally be taking cabs for dinner reservations anyway  But if we were being honest there is little else in the area Would we stay there again Yes if the price was the same   incl tax per night but possibly not if it was full price at say   per night  
N => Clean comfortable close to where I needed to be  I booked this hotel for its location  However if I had been visiting NYC for leisure I probably would not have stayed here as it is about   miles from midtown  The lobby looked very contemporary with very young looking staff  They werent impolite in any way just had that sort of glazed blas  that seems to affect everyone in their early s  The elevators worked  They werent the speediest but Ive taken slower and scarier  My first room smelled like smoke  Because I was afraid my suit would smell like stale smoke I called the front desk regarding the smell  They said another room was not currently available but they would be happy to send someone up to spray the room to see if that helped  About   minutes later a young man came and sprayed my room  He seemed confused about the smokiness telling me adamantly that this was a non smoking floor  Eventually he admitted that it didnt seem to be helping and he said he would go and try to find a different spray but if he couldnt call the front desk and tell them the spraying didnt help  He disappeared and I feared that it would be the last I would ever see of him   minutes later he arrived with a new room key  He offered to help me move however I didnt even bother unpacking and I only had one suitcase  From the prior reviewers I feared that I would be placed above the gas station or placed into a closet space for voicing my discontent however I was moved from the th to the th floor with about the same size room with a view of the Brooklyn Bridge and the river with no smoky smell I was really fascinated by the quotminibarquot situation stating that nothing could be moved for over  seconds or the room would be automatically charged but now I could definitely see how a previous poster was charged to brush his teeth  The TV was very nice however it was on the desk which left minimal work space  Some of furniture was very quotvintagequot looking but overall very comfortable to lounge on  I didnt really mind the heater very much I simply turned the fan to low and that seemed to remedy the noisiness of the fan  There was a lovely robe to wear around which was very comfortable and soft  The bathroom looked very recently reated however the glass counter left very little room to place my things on and I kept fearing things would fall into the toilet  The shower with the half covered glass panel baffled me as I have never seen that before  I didnt get that much splashing out of the shower but it is possible however I think putting the towel bathmat does help contain the splash zone  The shower was amazing  There was fantastic water pressure and after a long day it felt very soothing  As far as noise goes I could hear the occasional ambulance sirens since NYP Hospital is only   miles away but I did not hear the overall street noise  I was afraid that because I was so close to the elevator I would hear a lot of noise outside my room but that also didnt seem to be a problem  I did hear occasional doors closing but nothing that kept me from sleeping  The bed was very comfortable and I slept soundly through the night  This is a very long post but I wanted to address many of the things that concerned me prior to my arrival  I didnt stay here more than one day so I cannot address the housekeeping and the seeming towel shortage  If I had to return for business in the area I would definitely stay here again  
N => Noisy Reations and Rude Staff Date Reviewer Avid traveler USVIWeve just returned from our stay in NYC and I must say I was terribly disappointed in The Bentley Hotel  Upon arrival our first assigned room  had a toilet malfunction     the minute we walked in the toilet was running  We requested a room change only to placed in a smaller room  and be awakened at  am by pounding  This continued every am until we queried the front desk  It turns out we were placed on a floor they were reating Front desk personnel stated that we should have told them they were reating Shouldnt it be the other way around Why do you have guests staying on floors which are being reated So we were moved yet again  yet another small room  I called to report that we were relocated to another small room without our mini fridge for which we had to pay extra  So we were yet again relocated to another room  finally bigger and with our fridge  We thought our troubles were over only to experience a smokey smell in the bathroom at am  This is supposed to be a nonsmoking hotelFinally upon checkout we were refused a copy of our complete bill  I have never had such a negative experience in my many years of travel  
N => be prepared to pay for watching TV or drinking water or using toothpaste I think this one of the bad hotels I hav visited and would not recommend to any of you what I disliked about the place was that they charge for each and every amenity u use    even for watching TV       thats awful       I would like to pre warn you people by telling you my storyI was charged  extra dollars for watching movie and this was told to me when I was checking out NO PREWARNINGSSo who so ever lives there be prepared to pay this kind of amount for watching TV or drinking water that kept there or using the toothpaste that they provide My experience was horrible and wont recommend it to anyone  
N => Inadequate rooms very unhelpful staff After doing considerable research we booked a king size room which was  per night for two nights  Our plans changed and we tried to book an addtional night  This involved waiting for over  minutes to speak to a human being but we were offered a king size room for the third night at the same rate On arrival at about  pm on a weekday the desk staff were cool to say the least but we were shown up to a room on the th floor  The room was a good size and overlooked the th Street bridge and the cable car to the island  It had a nice sitting area However as soon as we began to unpack the noise from the air conditioning unit which was a basic box was so loud that we could not converse with each other  I went into the bathroom and was not able to obtain hot water from either the basin or the bath I called reception and the tired way that I was dealt with indicated that this was not the first time room  had had these problems  I was promised a maintenance visit which was a long time in coming  By the time the man arrived we were all unpacked and wanting to go out The maintenance man arrived and said that the only way to avoid the noise from the unit was to switch it off  As the windows did not open this was not an option After about half an hour of work in the bathroom he obtained hot water  We were very hot and sweaty  WE had to switch the unit on again However the noise from the ac unit was intolerable and I went down to the reception desk to suggest that it was either a room change or we would have to move hotels A room change was offered to  but absolutely no help in packing up or moving so another hour of our visit was spent repacking two large suitcases and moving them to a room the other side of the hotel wiht a very partial view of the river  This was much quieter but also much smaller so I suggested to the desk that this was a lower grade of room as it was so much smaller and perhaps the room rate should be adjusted I based this on the hotel web site which was very specific about room sizes and room rates The desk clerk was absolutely adamant that the room was the same size and refused a reduction At about  pm hot and quite tired from the room moving I a woman aged  and stly dressed went to the roof top bar to have a drink  There were two bar staff behind the bar talking to a couple of customers  I took a table by the window  Two other tabels were occupied by groups of business men five on one side and four on the other I sat and waited for the waiter to finish his conversation at the bar  After about ten minutes he approached my end of the room to take my order I thought  Not so lucky he offered refills to one party went off and got them then walked stly past me to the otehr group and did the same for them As I am far too large to be invisible I then walked to the bar and odered a vodka collins the other barman made it using his hand to transfer ice to the glass and continuing his conversation with the couple  I paid him and took my glass back to my table  I finished my drink but neither member of staff approached to offer me a refill which I had to fetch from the bar Frankly the attitude of all the staff with the exception of the baggage boy was offhand in the extreme Would I stay there again No  I think my dog received a more courteous welcome at his kennels  
N => absolutley hated this hotel this hotel was under construction which we were not told about when booking rooms and bathrooms were an utter disgrace no extractor fans in the bathrooms which meant the tiles were all covered in mildew furniture was all scratched and broken window sills were all cracked no beautiful views from windows as stated hotel restaurant was a death trap outside as there was no lighting around the outside of balcony  This was not a cheap hotel to go to as it cost me  per night WOULD NEVER GO BACK 
N => A view to die for I value the TripAdvisor community experiences and chose to stay at this hotel partly due to those reviews  The hotel itself is very New York chic  I stayed on the th floor in an ensuite with stellar views of the city skyline  It was an quotin n outquot business trip  I arrived late in the evening the day preceding my meeting and left early in the morning the day after  The only drawback was the area immediately adjacent to the hotel very residential  There was a gas station on the hotel property  There was not much to do insofar as restaurants etc  I had to order in which was a major pain  Unfortunately the hotel restaurant was closed due to a pre arranged function  My suite was equipped with window benches along the entire length and I was quite content to sit and watch the skyline change as the sun went down  As far as the suite goes housekeeping was not the greatest and the bathtub was not the cleanest  This is why I religiously pack my shower shoes The suite was larger than most NYC apartments  I loved the modernminimalist d cor  The headboard was white woven leather and the footboard was black woven leather loved it Guest services were polite and courteous  
N => Enjoyed our stay We booked this hotel and as the date got nearer we saw some bad reviews so started to worry  Pleased to say there was nothing for us to be concerned about and we had a pleasant stay at the hotel   no bed bugs in siteWe arrived around midday and were told the room wasnt available till around pm  When we finally returned we were surprised to be told they had upgraded our room and were offered a much better room on the th floor Room was high enough to enjoy the views and to block out any noise  Yes there is construction work nearby however we really didnt notice the noise  You cant go to NY and expect it to be totally quiet thoughRooms were spacious and fresh towels provided daily  On the one day they forgot to replace them they gave us new ones almost immediately after we rang to notify them  Bathroom size is average but suited our needs  Word of warning to all about the minibar items on the table we made the mistake of picking up the items only to find there was a  sec timer fortunately we replaced the items swiftlyThe two concierges were very friendly David amp David they both had a great sense of humour and were very patient   even when we did monopolise their time Both were very helpful and recommended a number of places for us to goto   thanks as Im sure you will be reading this eventually o Receptionist staff and the doormen were again very friendly   with the exception of one of the receptionists who hasnt learnt the art of smiling yet youll know who we mean when you get thereBe prepared to walk Central Park took us just under  mins to walk to most of the attractions you can walk to however it is a lengthy walk  I confess we were lazy and ended up getting a taxi most places however we did nonetheless cover a lot of ground by walking One complaint is the lack of room service  A menu exists within the room information pack however when we rang we were told they dont provide room service  Never did find out whether this was a temporary problem either way though I think the hotel should remove this information from the rooms  Nonetheless there are so many restaurantsbars nearby that it was fine  You must however go upstairs to the restaurant to look at the viewWould I recommend this hotel Yes Yes this hotel isnt the Hyatt but unless youre prepared to pay those prices dont grumble you cant expect to pay   prices and receive a   room Ours was a leisure holiday so we really didnt spend much time in the room either way it suited our requirements  After spending a couple of nights innear Times Square we were glad we werent staying in one of the hotels there as the crowds and noise is unbelievableIf youre looking for a hotel that offers comfort and want to avoid the busynoisy environment of the big name hotels then this is the hotel for you  
N => Room nice amenities not good I stayed at this hotel due to the close proximity walking distance to the NY Presbyterian hospital where I was working  The room was nice and air conditioning worked well  The restaurant was closed the first two nights for dinner but I was not notified which was more than annoying since I was tired  Room service for breakfast was not available though I believe it is listed in the hotel description  The wireless internet is not included in the price though the room price was great for NYC in the summer    The internet was very slow  I had to take a cold shower one morning as I did not realize it takes about  minutes to heat up the water to a lukewarm temperature  The breakfast is expensive in the restaurant and is a continental breakfast with stale pastries  The coffee was delicious  I would recommend walking a few blocks to a diner for breakfast  I would recommend having dinner delivered if you cant go out  I did not receive my wake up call on the first night  Overall the room was clean and comfortable and large for NYC  The view was nicer than most in NYC and it is easy to catch a cab  I will stay again due to the convenience of walking to the hospital unless I locate something else within walking distance  
N => disappointing The Bentley is a classic example of an overpriced hotel which has tried to use a veneer of hip or to camofle its shoddy construction and to deflect attention away from the fact that it is in desperate need of repairs and regular maintenaince  The lobby the view of the East river from our room the proximity to the Eastside the friendly and helpful doormen the fluffy towels amp quality toiletries and the ample use of natural stone were all nice amenities and what one would expect from paying  per night but those were the only positive features of our stay  The lobby looks like something out of a trendy magazine but dont let it fool you  When we checked in the woman working the front desk took forever to check us in due to her having trouble locating our reservationbilling info  We didnt mind the wait so much but she was just incompetent and kept us in the dark initially about what the problem was and then didnt give us any kind of indication as to what steps she was taking to rectify the situation or how long it would take  She didnt even try to look like or act like she was trying to get the problem resolved  She seriously needed to have customer service  training  She seemed completely clueless about how to treat customers and didnt appear to know what she was doing It was over  degrees throughout our entire stay in NYC  When we got to our floor it was like a sauna and the temperature in our room wasnt much better  The ac was on full blast the entire time we were there but barely any air came out  We complained twice to the front desk we also complained about the inadequate outlets  see below  to no avail and nothing was ever done to fix the ac and we werent able to change rooms  The front desk staff never even followed up with our complaints to let us know what the status of our complaint was  they had said that they might try to get their facilities person to look into it but we never heard anything else about it  I ended up taking several cold showers during the day because by the time I would get showered in the morning do my make up and hair I would get so hot from the room that I would sweat off all my make up and start pitting out and then Id feel compelled to shower again just to cool down and to get clean again before getting dressed to go out  There were some days where it was hotter in our room than it was outside  It was miserable  Then there were the little things like our faucet handle in the bathroom being broken the fact that all of the outlets in our room would come out of the wall if you tried to plug anything in them and if you did try to plug anything in them     you wouldnt get any electricity that after using the hairdryer for a short period of time and turning it off you wouldnt be able to get it turned back on again for several minutes the towel rack falling off the wall for no other reason than us hanging a hand towel on it the tiny cramped bathroom the lack of an operating bathroom fan the fact that they make guests pay for internet service and even when we paid and followed all the convoluted steps to get online it still didnt work  And then theres the stuff that just pisses you off     like the fact that you cant put anything in the fridge or youll get charged  which was even more aggravating because we so desperately wanted to store cold water bottles in there because our room was so freaking hot or that if you even jostle or pick up any of the food or beverages in the basket of mini bar items for longer than  seconds youll get charged for the items even if you dont consume them  of course you probably wont realize youre being charged like my husband who jokingly picked up a bottle of liquor and didnt read the fine print card with the notice about the  second charge rule buried in the basket until  seconds later  Oh and did I forget to mention that youll need to budget about  minutes into your schedule just to wait for the elevator once you press the elevator button And last but not least if you need to have the Bentley staff hold your bags for you in their storage room after you check out make sure your luggage actually makes it into the storage room  We went to check our bags in and the staff person tagged the bags as we told him we were about to leave  He then got really distracted by another employee and guests and said he needed to take the elevator up to a different floor to deal with something else but that hed be back to put our bags in the storage room  He assured us that we could leave to go do our sightseeing and that our bags would be fine  I was flabbergasted because our bags were parked adjacent to their front door and guests were coming in and out  There was no one there to attend to our bags other than the front desk staff who were preoccupied and who were over  feet away with helping other guests  But apparently he didnt seem to care about whether our bags got stolen or not  He was really adament that we should leave and not worry about our bags  I had to firmly tell him that we werent leaving until the bags got put into the storage room  Then he seemed annoyed with us  All in all it wouldnt have been so disappointing if we hadnt have had to pay so much for the room  The poor service and quality of the room wouldve been easier to tolerate if we were paying   per night  But for  a night it was just unacceptable  My suggestion look elsewhere  
N => Reasonable value hotel Reasonable hotel for the price  The Concierge desk maids and hotel porters were excellent but we found the main desk staff to be unhelpful at times The room was clean and tidy as was the bathroom  The roof restaurant is small and we had to eat off of our laps at some sofas when we used it  The  lifts were very slow to arrive too No coffeetea facilities in the rooms but there were some set out in the corner of the main lobby Though a litter further out from the center than we would have liked the taxi fares were reasonable and it was a nice walk to Central Park Bloomingdales or the two Metro stations in Lexington Avenue  
N => Poor service We stayed at the hotel in    Bathroom leaked and the water soaked the room  Our personal effects were wet Although they changed the rooms the hotel admin were not keen to reimburse this appropriately and said that it was hotel policyI wrote to the operationsmanager   at least I was given the email address   no response to my email Really poor management training or attitudeAlso too expensive for location  No internet or business centre  
N => Its OK but not great What can I say The Bentley is OK but certainly nothing to write home about  It is on the Upper East Side very close to Rockefeller University but quite a hike to downtown NY  Rooms perfectly OK bed comfortable though desk did not have a proper desk chair so working was not comfortable No coffeetea maker in room which is a pain I think every hotel should provide this  Safe in room  Wireless internet was ridiculously expensive and quite hard to connect to though my PC would pick up about a dozen open networks in range  would not advise you to use them though  Lifts very slow to arrive  Drinksice dispenser on some floors   closest one to me was out of order Breakfast roombar at the top has great views but breakfast basic and expensive  Easy to get a cab on the street outside  Plenty of bars restaurants etc within a couple of blocks   recommend the Baker Street Pub one block away   st Ave at rd St   very friendly barcafe that shows live sport including Premiership on many screens  
N => Very Helpful   Perfect for my Needs Needed a place to stay in the city while a family member had surgery at Sloan Kettering  This hotel could not have been better located or more helpful  I booked at last minute but explained my situation and got a better rate than originally quoted  The staff was helpful as we were in town for a short stay and not East Side City people  They kknew the right places to grab a quick breakfast and a fast dinner at a good price and great taste Will definately reccommend this Hotel to anyone needing to be on the East Side  
N => Not again The Bentley is far removed from everything we wanted to do Greenwich Village Circle Line restaurants and not aging well  The furniture in the room was torn carpets dirty and the bed was concave  No business center not even allowed to use the Concierges computer  Nice views of the bridge and easy to get a taxi  Bar has nice view also but very limited menu   of  elevators working  Dark hallways  I wont stay there again  
N => Great hotel Stayed at the Bentley for three nights with my  year old son Hotel was clean and cozy  Service was great We passed on the breakfast buffet it was   and you can not order of the menu so unless you are starved we thought it to be expensive Walk to Subway at thLexington   minutes but in safe neighborhood for day and late night We paid   per night on Hotwire and I was very pleased We were going to get room on nd floor but I read it would be noisy so we requested higher floor and went to  which was great Thanks for the previous reviews or we would have been above the gas station  
N => Loved this Hotel This was a great Hotel to stay in it had a welcoming lobby and we were treated very well  We were on the th floor and the views were amazing the beds were exceptionally comfortable the showers were great as it was very powerful and woke you up straight away Its a bit of a walk to get to the subway but a great way to explore upper east New York Once you walk down  Avenues you get to the subway and where bloomingdales is  We just loved it here it was nice to know there was a cosy hotel to go back to after a really long day plus the service was fantastic   when we got late to check out of our rooms we were given extra time to get our luggage and our taxi to the airport was all arranged on time Plus the view from the top floor bar is amazing youre right next to the bridge 
N => Very impressed with the Bentley My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bentley Hotel from st uary to th ruary  and were very impressed with it  We found all of the staff to be polite and helpful throughout our stay  When we arrived we asked for a room above the th floor as wed been advised and the check in clerk advised us that we had booked a queen room but that they would upgrade us to a King room on the th floor  We got up to our room and were pleasantly surprised with the or of the room and the fantastic view of the Queensborough Bridge and the river beside us  Ive attached some photos of the view and our room so you can see for yourself  Our room was spotless and included a fridge hob and microwave in case you wanted to bring your own food back to the room  The bathroom was immaculate with plenty of towels and a very powerful shower We did not eat breakfast in the hotel not because we were advised not to but because on our first morning we went to the Ritz diner just down the road and loved it so much that we went there every day for breakfast  The menu is huge and very reasonable plus its open  hours  We went up to the hotels restuarantbar on the st floor one evening  Its worth going up there as the view at night is stunning  The menu wasnt very extensive but the food we ordered was very good  We did not use the mini bar in our room as if we wanted any drinkssnacks we found it was cheaper to buy them from one of the local delis and bring them back to the room  A tip thats worth mentioning is that its probably better money wise to book tickets for showssports events direct with the theatrestadium rather than through the concierge in reception as we found them to be rather pricey Overall we were very impressed with the hotel and would definitely book to stay there again the next time we go to New York  
N => Not a Rolls Royce    The Bentley well its not a Rolls Royce either  The best thing I can say about this place If you like high pressure showers youll love it  If anything else matters to you Id suggest you go elsewhere or stay home  The place is in a word stingy  How else can you explain   dont even think about using the word justify   these quirky surprises  One washcloth in the bathroom the day we arrived  None the next day so I tracked housekeeping down and asked for two  One the next day  Ditto for our last day  And only two bath towels each day   A sign on the in room refrigerator I have a photo so you know Im not kidding warns you that if an item is taken from the refrigerator for more than  seconds you will be charged for it   and if you place any item of yours in the refrigerator you will be charged too   An   plus tip breakfast buffet that is lhable even by New York City standards  Coffee juice toast min bagels mini muffins and three small bowls of fruit emptied and not refilled while I was there and some bananas complete the menu   which reads much more appetizing than it was The tired furniture carpet and non existent d cor dont add much to the st floor room which is about as interesting as the inside of an empty warehouse And speaking of d cor do not expect your deluxe room to look like the deluxe room showcased on the website  Our  deluxe  room was deluxe the fellow at the check in counter explained because it had a king size bed in it  I find that curious  What about size Closet space View Amenities I guess  deluxe  excludes those qualities and characteristics at the Bentley  The room was small even by New York City standards  The miniscule closet is a bit wider than its door  The light on the built in shelf counter cum desk was broken  The closest light to the reading chair was a table lamp with a dim fluorescent bulb on the nightstand  Fortunately the chair was next to the only window in the room so we could read by daylight  When I asked to be moved because I didnt like the room or the view the desk clerk told me he would call back in a few minutes  When he didnt I called him  He said he was busy  I went downstairs and waited until he wasnt busy and then asked him as politely as I could if we could change rooms  That was not possible he said because the hotel was filled that night Friday  I could wait until in the morning and see what was available unless I wanted to move to the second floor overlooking the gas station and sets of gas pumps and traffic that are part of the first floor of the Bentley  I lined When I had called on Thursday to confirm our pre paid reservations the Bentley had no record of us  Eventually I was told we had a standard room which I challenged because we had paid for a deluxe room a difference of  for three nights  When I talked to the desk clerk about my dissatisfaction with the room he told me it was a standard room  I disagreed and said we had paid for a deluxe room  He very quickly too quickly for my taste agreed that yes it was a deluxe room  Had this been a first class customer friendly organization I would have expected a call Saturday morning offering to move us to another room    any room almost There was no message On checkout the desk clerk attempted to charge us for an item removed from the refrigerator  We lined  We did not open the refrigerator for one second   let alone  As we walked away the desk clerk said cheerfully  we hope you will stay with us again   We looked at each other and responded quietly  not in this lifetime   
N => on the dark side The reception staff were very helpful as we had booked  superior double rooms that were not ready and they upgraded us to  suites  These were spacious with  bed and flat screen tvs in both the bedroom and adjoining lounge that had the tiniest wardrobe  The heatingair con systems are extremely noisy and the walls are paper thin The main problem was the lifts hallways bedrooms bathrooms and rooftop bar were so badly lit an exaggeration of the boutique hotel effect we felt we were in the twighlight zone and after  days we were relieved to be leaving  The first night we went up to the bar we could just about see the barman and struggled to see our drinks Also when phoning down to order some breakfast off the room service menu we were told that they no longer provided room service  The breakfast in the bar upstairs was not worth bothering with  As far as location is concerned the Queensboro bridge is literally a stones throw but just a  min walk to Bloomingdales  If you are not planning to spend time in the hotel other than to sleep then for value it is probably worth it  However I wouldnt rush back there  Yoko London 
N => Pleasant hotel My husband and i stayed at the Bentley Hotel late ember begining of ember   We had a large room which was fairly clean but the bathroom was so small pity they could not have made it a little larger  The view from the room was really good  We found one member of staff rather terse in manner  Beware if you do not have a credit card as they will ask you for a  deposit on your room  Other members of staff were all friendly and always cheerful  Pity the coffee machine was in the lobby though  We had a great time seeing the sights and doing a bit of christmas shopping  We did not find the lifts dark  We did travel on the subway which we found great fun  We would go back there again  
N => Just An Average Hotel  Great or Though  This hotel definitely has its pluses and minuses and in the end the minuses just out weigh the pluses to result in this being just an average hotel Plusesor We loved the modern or of the entire hotel  The lobby and the room were orated in a very modern theme similar to the quotWquot Hotels Windows We were in a corner room so we basically had two complete walls of windows  Good for nice views but bad at night when we had a voyeur with binoculars spying in directly at us and waiving  We just waived back Staff The staff was top notch from check in to check out MinusesLocation The website stated that the hotel was just a couple of blocks from the subway  In reality its over   a mile  Might not seem like that much until you are our there going to the subway a couple of times a day  Further than it sounds  Just be prepared Breakfast Continental breakfast  bagels and cream cheese each morning Fridge We were told that each room had a fridge it when we called to make sure  Upon arrival it was night to have a fridge in the room Room Service Ended earlier than most other hotels that we have stayed in Overall make sure that you are getting a good deal to make sure that the stay is worth the price  
N => great lynnescotland  our room was very clean but what we loved about this hotel was the view from our window when we returned at night time we didnt want to sleep as the view of the water with all the different boats going up and down and also the cable cars going to rosevelt island was amazing  the hotel was a we bit out of the way but the neighbourhood was quite and very safe we always walked back as you pass some lovely townhouses  the glass rooftop bar etc gave you a great view as well  we will definatly go back to the bentley 
N => away from the tourist traps We loved staying at this hotel  We like to walk around and explore cities so this was ideal  It was about a  minute pleasant walk from the nearest subway with lots of shops restaurants and bars on the next block  It was good being away from all the chain restaurants etc that all cities have staying here felt more like being a local and a bit more individual  I had stayed at this hotel before and was a bit apprehensive about recommending it to my boyfriend but I neednt have worried as he liked it too  plus we got a very good deal We were especially pleased as having arrived in New York all hot and tired after a  hour train journey from Toronto we were quotbumpedquot to a ior suite  We loved the view from the windows of the bridge and Manhatten  The bed was extra comfy  The air con was quite loud and we had to have it on all the time because of the humidity but we didnt mind as we both snore so it drowned us both out We didnt mind breakfast not being included as we loved going to the nearby excellent Ritz diner  
N => EXCELLENT CHOICE We stayed y   one Doble room  adults Reception was very friendly and always helpfulThe room was very clean  Bathroom although not very big was acceptable and had all the necesary requirments One miner setback was that we requested a non smoking room and the room did smell      we reported to the recption and when we came back that night the bad smell was gone completely In general our stay was excellent we highly recomend the Bentley Hotel  and the price was perfect   very good value Thanks to all the staff for making our stay Igor Mencos and familyMonterrey Mexico 
N => Great Value for Money My first trip to new york and I have to say it was brilliant  Hotel was great value for money very clean  Not the biggest room but good size bed and LCD tv what more could you want  Would def stay here again 
N => A Stones throw from Sloan Kettering My sister and I stayed at this hotel because our mother had surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering  We frequently go to New York and stay closer to Times Square but for our needs on this visit the hotel was ideal  The location to the hospital couldnt have been more convienant  We only had to walk a few blocks so we were even able to come back and take a nap while our mother was in recovery  Since we spent most of our time at the hospital we didnt mind that it is located a bit far from Times Square and other tourist attractions The complimentary espressocoffee bar in the lobby was really nice It made up for the over priced hospitality bar and fridge in the room  We had a great view and a very nice sized clean room  Since we got a special patient rate we were content with the price As mentioned in several other posts the lighting in the hallways and elevators is really wierd Its dark and metallic for lack of a better description  The elevators are REALLY slow too  The neigborhood is really nice and we felt perfectly safe strolling back to our room after a late night dinner at one of the local eateries Overall we were pleased  We would stay there again if we had to go to Sloan Kettering but we would choose another hotel to be closer to the theatre and tourist districts  
N => Not a thing to complain about Stayed in the Bentley for  nights at start of ch and have to say itd be hard to beat this hotel in terms of price and quality  The location was a bit removed from most attractions but it was well worth the cab fare for the views alone even if you dont stay in the hotel you should go up to the bar on the top floor to take in the incredible view at night it really sums up New York Our room was clean modern and spacious and the staff were very helpful  Dont buy breakfast in the hotel visit the Ritz diner and eaves drop on real new yorkers while enjoying a huge and reasonably priced breakfast I have already reccommend this hotel to friends and would not hesitate to stay here again myself  
N => great hotel and service will come back We loved it  We stayed there  nights large corner room paid  a night reserved through nychotels com  great service front desk person went out his way to make sure we were happy  we will be back soon  
N => Will never stay here again Arrived and unloaded bags then went out for dinner came back and room was flooded room  toilet overflowed the whole room there was no manager on duty of course they had no other rooms so the sent us to another hotel  I believe it was the ameritania that hotel was very nice  Service at the Bentley was very bad and they are very cheap no lighting you can t even see the buttons on the elevator Do not ever stay there   
N => Very ieving ieving     Pleasant doormen amp bag carriers  Nice lobby  quotDeluxequot room much smaller than advertised amp featured no quotcity or bridge viewquot as promised  Several interruptions during our stay  Inconsiderate staff  Nothing quotdeluxequot about the televisions in the quotdeluxequot rooms  Horrendous stressful parking situation  Not helpful at all Read on for details   The Lobby is nice and the doormen amp bag carriers even nicer  Very pleasant amp helpful  However this was ieving    We were extremely disappointed when we got to our room  We booked a quotdeluxequot room based on the pictures they advertised on the website we were booking from  We paid for a quotdeluxequot room but there was nothing quotdeluxequot about it  I think if we ordered the standard room it would have been the same  just cheaper  Deluxe rooms are supposed to feature beautiful views higher floors but we were put on the third floor facing an ugly building  no view at all  The website boasts that the rooms are quotover sizedquot but I would consider our quotdeluxequot room small  We were interupted many times during our stay     to be exact  We had a room all the way in a corner tucked away from other rooms amp elevators etc  on the third floor which we thought would be nice and quiet but we were awakened several times  It seems that when the staff goes into the quotemployees onlyquot staff doors all around the hotel linen closets electrical control closets etc  during the night and early morning when people are trying to sleep they are unaware that slamming the doors can be very disturbing to the guests who are trying to relax  Other than that the hotel would have been quiet but we just heard doors slam outside our room all night  There is nothing relaxing about that  The staff should be more considerate    The night before just as we were settling in two repair men barged into our room they didnt knock  apologizing saying they needed to fix the mini bar that we werent going to use anyway due to the high priced un worthy items like a can of amstel light for  yes a can  They spent about  minutes messing with it    Then in the early morning we were woken up by several quottestsquot and alarms to the communication system  Someone with a thick accent came on the very loud Public Address System announcing something  We couldnt understand what he was saying be because we were half asleep so we had to call the front desk to make sure there was no emergency  There wasnt but after that several more announcements were made about  minutes apart just as we would begin to fall back asleep how pleasant  Then an alarm  By the last interruption we just got out of bed and checked out of there  For a boutique style hotel there is nothing swanky or modern about the television in the deluxe rooms  It is completely out dated fuzzy and blurry  It gives you a headache looking at it  Overall the picture and sound quality is something Id expect from a tv in a Motel  The parking situation is also a mess if you bring your car  We pulled up to the hotel amp they took our bags inside for us amp directed us to the parking lot on the opposite side of the entrance to the hotel  When we pulled in we were told to quotcome back laterquot because they were full  Full I just want to check into my room amp I have to come back later because youre full It took us  minutes from when we got there to actually get inside due to the parking situation  The front desk was no help  Our bags sat there in the lobby for  minutes while we waited outside in our car  The garage is small and cramped  The hotel should take care of the parking of your car when you arrive for the price we were paying to stay there Ive never seen anything like that  Were a young well traveled couple in our mid twenties  We have stayed at many hotels   boutique  star and all in between  This was no gem I would never stay here again  Waste of money for what you get  Id gladly stay at the comfort in before going back to the Bentley which is really sad Hope this helps   take it from us 
N => A Great Deal We stayed at the Bentley from uary   for rates of    and  respectively  We also utilized the parking for  a day  Although there was no valet this was great for us because we just wanted to park our car and leave it for the duration of our stay  We had a quick and easy check in  When we entered our room we realized that we had been upgraded from a standard room to a suite We had a huge living room with a couch chair coffee table desk and television  Double glass doors lead to the bedroom which had a king size bed chair and ottoman television and two walls of windows that stretched from the ceiling down to our knees My husband figured out that all rooms ending in  and  we stayed in  are these larger suite rooms  Beautiful views of York Ave  and the Queensborough Bridge  The TVs are a bit outdated but we didnt come to the city to watch tv  The walk to the subway is a good ten minutes but again this did not bother us  We also noticed that the walls are a bit thin as we heard a crying baby  Finally York Ave  is very busy and noisy  I would not have wanted to stay any closer to ground level than we were th floor or the noise  have bothered us  Overall we had a great experience and would return without hesitation especially if we could get similar rates  
N => Never Again I checked in everything was fine until I got to my room  The minute I opened the door it smelled like puke and had water stains throughout  within mins the front desk clerk called to see if everything was ok and to offer a complimentary upgrade  I though great he had one of the bell boys who acted like it was a bother to show me  different rooms to choose from mins later they realize they put me in a non smoking room I had to be switched again  with no help from the bell boy with my bags he just stared at me struggling with my bags and with a look likequotplease hurry upquot finally Im in the room everything is fine  I ide hours later to go to go out come back room key doesnt work at all  I had to get new keys  Still I didnt complain because I was in a good mood and to me it wasnt a big deal and I got a much bigger room for the same price  when I returned home and checked my account they charged me again I called and was told it would be checked into and asked me serveral times if I was sure  Of course I was sure I even called my bank before hand and was told the day and time it was taken out The staff was no help and the managers even worse bad attitude  finally the person who checked me in remembered me and I had the bank fax the hotel while I was on the phone with them to make sure they recieved it  They did and assured me it was going to be taken cared of right away  It wasnt when I called yet AGAIN they denied they charged me again and said they never got the fax  Needless to say Im still waitng for my money and the fact that the staff with their couldnt careless attitudes and always have quick answers to brush you off is even more irratating than the whole experience  
N => Very good better than expected  This was a really good hotel and well worth the money in such a major City such as New York  The rooms were clean and views were great beds were comfortable and rooms were spacious  Only problems were the walk to the mainstream of New York as it is   minute walk to central park and even further to times square but that was not to much of a problem and i would stay there again and would recomend it to anyone who doesnt mind a bit of a walk  
N => Not bad Nice hotel quite expensive but thats NYC I guess    The room was quite large and comfortable with a nice view on the East River and on st avenue  Staff at reception desk was friendly and effective though we could not get the room any sooner than the official  pm i e   hours after we arrived  For breakfast go to Ritz Diner a typical new yorker place on St avenue not far from the hotel  Major drawback was the fact that it is not easy to access and thus not ideally located  The metro is quite far th avenue but you can take the bus on nd avenue  
N => NOT recommended    First of all the hotel is not even  stars  I am not sure how they got their star rating  The rooms are ent but not more than  star  I had to change  time to find something so it wasnt next to a noise elevator  I travel all over the world  This has been the worst experience I ever had  The hotel stuff Mostly Indian and Russianis possibly the worst I have ever seen  Very incompetent at best  They mixed up our reservations so bad that not even the general manager could fix it  They charged our credit card  extra which has been a nighte to get the money back  So I do NOT recommend it but If you have to stay here view your billing carefully  
N => ok on the east s ide Entire hotel coould use rehab  It would then have to increase tariff  Ask for wrap around big windows on corner  Almost directly under Roosevelt Tram  hotel at rd amp first  Check out several rooms first  st one I had had rusted shower and toilet water  type trying to be Ian Schrager type  Good staff  Restaurants  blocks  Ritz Greek  hour coffee shop on nd and rd Good to be away from tourista around times square  Like Europe no washcloths but you just ask  I paid   Large long room  Windows selling feature  A value if y ou like the east side  Forget the room service  
N => Not Worth It NOT WORTH IT It is all style if you can call darkness and dusty orations and continual air refresher style without substance  Small room thin walls you can hear the people next door  Beds just okay  Very limited storage space  Uncomfortable chairs  Overall shoddy feel  Hot water in the morning but none after that  Want a shower before dinner or before bed    not going to happen  And the management refused to acknowledge a hot water problem  Want your room cleaned up so that you can clean up before dinner or just rest  Not going to happen  Always out by AM but the room was never ready before PM and only after raising a fuss  One time they actual took the make up the room now sign off the front of the door opened the door and put it inside and then left withourt cleaning the room  Then there was no soap left no toilet paper only one towel  There is more  Every day at least on one attempt to enter the room the key card didnt work and then it was down tot he lobby to get new card  And the desk could care less    almost to the point of being nasty  This went on for FIVE days  Now I know why the online reservation required that you stay the full time booked or lose your money  
N => Disappointed memories    We stayed at the Bentley a few years ago and remembered a spacious designer corner room over looking the East River  So we are returning customers The feel of the hotel has not changed during the last six years It is classified as  star  The lobby feels comfortable and artsy  Free coffee amp tea and newspapers are available   The passage ways are nicely orated and clean We stayed this time for five nights  Having booked a non smoking room on line average of night we were somewhat disappointed to get a much smaller and even smoky room  Only because of the late hour and as we were tired we accepted but moved the next day to a similar smoke free room The room was much smaller then the one we had during our first stay but it was functional  The window ACheating unit has come to age and was a bit noisy  Beds were clean and comfortable but there was no hot water one morning before  am making a shower an adventure during this time of the year We suggest that mangement should consider a general overhaul and will probably try another hotel when visiting NYC the next time  
N => Enjoyed The Bentley We stayed one night at the Bentley at the end of tember  We arrived very early and the staff member at the front desk immediately paged a bellhop to take our bag  When we came back later to check in the bellhop promptly brought our bag up to our room  We saw what the other reviewers meant by quotdark hallwaysquot and quotdark elevatorsquot but we thought it was kind of fun  Our room was surprisingly spacious for NYC and it was very clean  The view was great as well   the Queensboro Bridge and East River were right in our view  The bed was clean and comfortable  The rooftop bar was not very crowded but the service was very friendly and the view was terrific  The only negative is that it is a bit of a hike to the subway  mins to get downtown and there is not too much to do in the immediate vicinity  The area around the subway stop is bustling however and its an easy walk to th avenue shopping Central Park etc  
N => Fab First Visit To NYC This was our first trip to NYC and did we have a great time Hotel was FAB lovely rooms and friendly staff Was about     min walk to the nearest subway station but you could always spen     bucks on a cab Rooms were very clean quiet with lovely views over the Hudson and Queensbrough Bridge Close to Central Park Would recommend this hotel  
N => Great place to stay This was a great place to stay We arrived at  am check in is at   They didnt have our room ready but said they had another one that had two double beds and we could have that one if we wanted it was  more but they said they wouldnt charge us anything for the upgrade  We took the room and stayed there for three nights  The room was very clean the staff were all very friendly and the location was great The rooftop restaurant has tasty food  It was neat being able to go outside and having an amazing view of Manhatten especially at night  The hotel was about an  cab ride to Times Square and a nice walk to Central Park Bloomingdales etc I would stay there again in a second 
N => Fantastic Theres not too much more to say about the Bentley  Just read previous positive reviews about this wonderful hotel  A very clean organized and well managed place to stay  Its staff is very amicable and they speak all the languages you want mostly eastern european  They help you in all your needs I had a special emergency and they did just great  The rooms are spacious and clean TV with a wide variety of channels most hotels have only the networks and a couple of quotbasicquot channels but they have more and wifi internet to make your business or pleasure trip to the big apple UNFORGETABLEIf I have to recommend a hotel in NYC I just have  words in my mind THE BENTLEY 
N => Average hotel We had booked online thru Expedia without any problems  The hotel does not look attractive from the outside its sited above a gas station and was dirty   Inside the lobby was airy and clean and the staff were welcoming  I did not get the upgraded room so had to stay in a standard queen size room the bed was comfortable but generally although the room was clean it could do with some reation the stand alone aircon unit was noisy and inefficient so I was glad not to be there in a really humid period  No mini bar or safe  Street noise was not a problem  The lifts and corridors are very dark and murkey although some might call it mood lighting On the st floor there is a bar and restaurant with fantastic views dont bother to eat there unless you love burgers ampfries Within a block there are some great places to eat at very resonable prices  Subway stations are a good   minutes walk away  
N => very nice but far from the subway very modern large size rooms clean bathroom we enjoyed very much our stay 
N => Fine hotel fine stay This hotel is fine  We stayed here as a family hubby wife amp yr old  We checked the reviews before our travel amp were a bit anxious but for no reason  Yes the hallways amp lift is dark but thats just sexy lighting that doesnt work  Location is not good if you want to be in the middle of a busy manhattern but very good if you want to escape the bussle of the city after a day out within a short cab ride  We asked for a high room that overlooked the bridge amp got it without a problem  Forget buses trams amp subway the taxis are  everywhere you seem to go including th Ave Times Sq central park   what more do you want They are very easy to flag down too  Ritzes dinner does good food theres a pizza place around the corner  liquer store for us alcholics that dont want to pay hotel prices  Great views amp we would definately stay there again  
N => Many Problems  Good luck staying here I would not stay at the bentley hotel again due to the following issues  Ran out of wash clothes and could not provide anymore until the next day   Room was not cleaned until I finally requested it around pm   Hallway too dark  Ice Maker was located in the stair case  floor down in an unsafe area   Manager could care less about complaints and really did not want to be bothered  
N => It was ok nothing special   not for sharing I went on a school trip to NY with some of my friends and other students  of us altogether  We arrived I thought it looked quite posh outside nice building  You walk in its nice and cool with the air conditioning theres free coffe and chairs to sit on The lifts werent very good they were very slow so my firends and I who were sharing a room ided to take the stairs carrying a heavy case up  flights of stairs was a bit tiring but not bad  The corodoors were dark too hardly any lighting  I used the keycard to get in to the room the first thing I thought was quotsmallquot   I walked in and there were only two double beds we expected singles or bunks    teenage boys sharing  double beds   not good We did complain but there was nothing they could do it was all pre booked by the school  they offered us more quilts and things to make us more comfortable which was good  We all had metrocards to take the subway and buses the subway isnt too far away   ask for directions we had a tour guide Overall   probably great if you are a couple of know what youve ordered bad if you are a student going with a group or something   but it turned out to be a nice place in the end  Email me if you want to ask something 
N => Hated this hotel There was no heat in my room no dial tone on the phone the alarm clock wouldnt allow me to change the wake up time and the remote for the television only scrolled down   nothing else I know these sound like small things but thats what counts alot And to top it off the attitude of the hotel staff was less than friendly and helpful as they would not do anything to help smooth things over ie reduce the amount of the bill  I would not stay here again nor recommend this place to anyone  
N => Not bad for the price but not great Reasons why the hotel didnt get a lower score  Friendly and helpful staff A  Rooms were very clean  Keen prices  Nice views if youre in the right roomsReasons why the hotel didnt get a higher score  Air conditioning is basically ineffective and very very noisy  Rooftop bar rarely seemed to be open  Showers only ok   hot water sometimes a problem  Bathrooms quite dated and dark  Although lobby is nicely orated   rest of hotel is miles behind   The dark  Reasonable location but still a distance from subways  First room we stayed in before complaining was quite tatty and shower was very weak Staff nicely upgraded us to a suite from what I can determine was a slightly larger room with more windows  On consideration wouldnt stay in the Bentley again   it certainly wasnt a find but didnt have any negative effect on our trip to nyc  Im sure there are many worse hotels in the city  
N => Very few complaints I stayed at the Bentley last ust and have to say that I was generally very impressed  The or was great and the atmosphere was just what I had expected from the photos  The twim room was quite small but the ac and hot water worked perfectly and the beds were very comfortable  I cant say I was aware of any noise from outside or from adjacent rooms nor did it cross my mind that the halls were dimly lit as per some of the other reviews The only slight negatives I had were that there was very little storage space so we couldnt properly unpack and had to live partly out of the suitcase and I was also slightly annoyed that there were no safes or safety deposit boxes available at all  Lastly when we checked out they tried to charge us for a movie that we didnt watch or couldnt have even ordered by accident given timings   but it was only when we challenged this that the staff differed from their usual friendly and helpful demeanour and eventually they did take it off the bill All in all I would definitely recommend it   these were just slight niggles in an otherwise brilliant stay  
N => Loved the Bently   would definitely go back My Mum amp I stayed in the Bentley Hotel from the   ch  and enjoyed every minute of it  Before we went I had read some mixed reviews on the Bentley from this website so we didnt know what to expect  On arrival check in was prompt and we were in our room within  minutes  The Reception staff were very friendly and helpful  Once in our room which was spacious we were delighted to note that it was very clean and the bathroom was all ble and again spotless with a good vanity unit and hairdryer  We had  double beds a table amp chairs a good dressing table ironing board not that I used it cd player TV and plenty of wardrobe space  We were on the th floor and had a great view overlooking the East River and the Queensborough bridge  The location on the Upper East Side was perfect  It was a  minute walk to Bloomingdales and about  mins to the Plaza Hotel on th Ave  From there it was a great stroll along to the other tourist attractions  If you dont mind a bit of a walk then this hotel is excellent and with being in a residential type area the walk up to th Ave was interesting  The only downside was that the hotel restaurant amp bar was being refurbished during our stay but was to re open on th ch  There were some good eating places only a couple of blocks away though  I will never think twice about booking into this hotel again it will always be my first choice in New York Book this hotel you would be a fool not tooDonna of Cheshire  
N => Terrible Stayed at the Bentley for  nights in il  The air conditioning in the room did not work and the register was noisy and sounded like it would give out any minute  The room at all times was very very hot and stuffy No hot water first morning they did deduct   from the room rate  While the location was convenient it was not a good experience at all  
N => Great Value Super staff  Ah    Christmas shopping in New York  Lots of crowds pushing and shoving but there is nothing quite like it Nice to have a quiet little spot like the Bentley to retire to after a long day  Rooms were most adequate and view was very good  Nice rooftop lounge but no restuarant  Staff very helpful  Cab necessary to most sites of interest to us  Good experience overall  
N => Dont get stuck on a low flloor I read the review that complained about the dark hallways and then read where another person said they didnt know what they were talking about  be it is different on different floors but as soon as I stepped out of the elevator I knew exactly what the first person was talking about The hallways are lit more like a nightclub than a hotel  I have good eyesight and I had to strain to see the room numbers  Its not a reason not to stay here but the halls are unusually dark for a hotel On the other hand at night my third floor room might have been brighter than the hallways  That was because there were bright lights coming from the windows of an adjacent building or section of the building and the curtain was not quite large enough  The top half of the bed was getting so much light that I ended up sleeping nearly horizontally king size bed to avoid it  It was also a little noisy but it wasnt all that bad  Some of the wood furniture had the finish worn off of it in places so dont expect anything especially posh On the plus side  the room seemed clean  the heat was fine  the bed was fine  the shower was great lots of hot water  there was wifi service   per  hoursI read that you can sometimes get these rooms for  on a weekend  If so that would be a bargain  I paid almost  a night and at that rate I probably wouldnt reserve unless I could get them to guarantee a higher floor  I should say that a whole bus full of people had arrived just prior to me and the desk clerk apologized for not having a room on a higher floor  My room was supposed to be a deluxe but perhaps that wasnt what I actually got  
N => Never Again I read many reviews about the Bentley Hotel but unfortunately only the worst ones came true All members of staff we met there were without exception unfriendly and even arrogant  The room was supposed to be quotDeluxequot but it was very small  The walls were paper thin so we were awoken more than twice because our neighbours were talking above normal volume There are no windows and no vents in the bathroom or the bedroomThe one thing we enjoyed was the spectacular views  Someone should tell their management not to promote Valet Parking as it is non existant For the rates offered this trip was more than a disappointment and we will not recommend this hotel  
N => Totally fantastic hotel Stayed in this hotel from ember    Was a little worried it would be too far out of the centre of Manhatten but it was just perfect At check in we got upgraded from a Queen to a King Size room for free We had a great view from the th floor overlooking the bridge and East River  Our bed was huge the room was spotless and was cleaned with fresh bed linen and towels every day TV in rooms with a huge range of stations which was great Staff were very friendly the door men were very helpful at all times nothing was too much of a problem for them Was just one block from st Avenue ten minute walk from Bloomingdales and a minute walk to th Avenue Taxi to Times Square cost about  or  Only disappointment was that the hotel bar and restaurant had closed two days before we checked in for reations its not reopening until mid uary  Reception supplied menus for local restaurants who delivered to the hotel free of charge though and were very apologetic for the inconvenience All in all a fantastic hotel 
N => Not Good  The Bentley Hotel is about  minute walk away from th Avenue and fairly easy to find   We found the reception staff to be awkward amp unfriendly  However the porters amp rest of the staff were pleasant amp chatty  I had phoned the hotel prior to our visit to arrange a room high up amp with a nice view I was told that it would not be a problem  When we arrived we allocated a room on the nd floor which is above a petrol station  The station is built in to the ground floor of the hotel with the pumps being outside  None of the photo s we had seen showed this  The hotel staff did arrange for us to be move to the th floor but told me that no one would agree a room with a view in advance  I didn t have the energy after the long flight confront this but felt let down straight away amp that staff did not care  The restaurant was closed for the five nights we stayed for a private function  This was disappointing as we had seen the pictures on a couple of websites which showed New York in the background at night amp they look spectacular  The hotel was clean amp the maid service is good  However the rooms are dated amp in need of some refurbishment  The wall near the window in your room is paper thin amp it is easy to listen to your neighbours conversation With the choice of hotels available in New York I wish we had looked a little further as we didn t find the hotel value for money  
N => Fair to middling First the problems    no hot water the first  nights Was given a smoking room when a non smoking room was requested   yes I am the bride from a previous reviewDespite asking  times for a plug for the bath we were not helped  Maintenance did visit out room to fix the heating but didnt manage to get a bath plug in the  days we were there Now the goodpoints   Location isnt bad just a  minute walk to the subway Great coffee machine in reception Great Diner one block up which serves excellent breakfasts Surprisingly quiet Excellent views from the rooftop bar The staff were either excellent or awful    the guys who man the door should be on the stage 
N => Not bad at the price We stayed in the Bentley as a large Wedding Party  Of the four rooms taken by my family I think we fared the best though none of us got rooms facing the Bridge  The suite booked for the bride was clearly a smoking room though a non smoking one had been booked could it be the last reviewer got their room Our room was clean and nicely orated  There was a lack of hot water during the first two days unless you got up early but the hotel apologised and this was fixed Coffee from the machine in the lobby was of good quality though it would have been good to have it in the room too and the bar had good views  Staff were pleasant and generally helpful to us As for the location I think the walk to Lexington Ave Subway took about  mins and really wasnt that much hassle All in all not bad for the price but they would appear to need to sort out their reservation system  
N => Bad Start When we arrived after a seven hour flight we were told that some people had ided to stay on and therefore there was no room and we would have to stay at their sister hotel near time square  This caused great problems as we had family on the upper East Side and wanted to be near them  A ent hotel would have told the former people they couldnt stay on  We said we would move for the night if they would upgrade us when we returned  We had asked for a non smoking room They said   certainly  no problem The sister hotel where we were sent was a dump with three hangers hanging in a corner which was the wardrobe  It was minute  When we returned the next day we were told there was no upgrade available for a non smoking room and an extremely rude receptionist disputed that we had been promised it It was only when we loudly voiced our opinions on how we had been treated that suddenly a non  smoking room was produced from no where  The hotel is in need of reoration it is clean there is a cupboard under the television which should house a fridge or mini bar but it doesnt  There is nowhere to get a coffee as there are no coffee  making facilities in the room and we were certainly not told of any available machines Altogether a bad experience and not to be repeated 
N => Good hotel but tendency to lose reservations The Bentley is certainly a very nice hotel but when we arrived after a very long journey from Ireland they had no record of our reservation despite being pre paid  The line its not our fault was given to me and we were put in a cab to mid town to a sister hotel cab at our expense  A gentleman next to us was told the same  Once I had contacted my travel agent it was determined that the hotel had made a mistake and we returned to an upgraded suite and complementary drinks in the Bentley  That was great but I find it strange that this scenario has been mentioned a few times in reviews and the same thing happened to the other man booking in with us   prehaps they give up reserved rooms after a certain timeI found having no breakfast option in the hotel inconvenient but otherwise it was a very pleasant place to stay  
N => From Norway   we loved our stay in New York Very good hotel  We had a room at   floor with a nice view to the bridge  We used the Subway to get around the Manhattan fast and easy to use  
N => Bentley great choice  My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel from ust st to th this year    we were pleasantly surprised when entering our room check in was quick amp easy  for it wasnt very spacious but very clean modern and very well accomodated  Bathroom was fantastic Bath amp shower clean towels every day we had ourselves a BIG kingsize bed television etc  Room  by the way  Our window looked down on the street with the river on the right no bridgeview  The rooftop restaurant has a spectacular panoramic view over the city     Beautiful at nightService was great very nice amp friendly staff subway was about   minute walk but we knew that when we booked amp it was ok  Delicious candystore amp Bloomingdales near the subway and very easy to get everywhere by train we would definately return there if we want to go to NYC again for we had a great stay  However if youre not a fan of walking a little bit we would suggest a hotel closer to a subwaystation  But again it was no problem for us  Thumbs way up 
N => too far from subway we were there in y      tooo hot                          the walk to the subway was a uphill walk for approx   blocks    very long hot walk   the hotel was ok  staff slow to respond to problems  at times no reply    
N => Great cappuchino machine It was a nice hotel looked better on the inside very clean  we requested a room with a view after reading reviews but did not have a good view  The location was not that great very far from most attractions although we got a cab most places it is very far from everything  Staff were helpful  d DONT GO TO THE CINEMA ROUND THE CORNER THE AIR CON WAS BROKEN AND THEY PUT EVERYONE IN THE WRONG FILM Dissappointing restaurant avoid like the plague poor selection and pricey  
N => NY Bentley was great Upon check in for  nights we asked for an upper room with a bridge view  The upper floors were taken so we were on the rd floor  I was worried the traffic  be loud but with the air conditioner on we didnt hear a thing  The staff was willing to move us up the next day but our room was so clean the air conditioning worked great and the bridge view at night was wonderful so we ided to stay  The room was bigger than I thought it would be  The staff went out of their way to answer questions bring extra towels and even brought packing material for an odd shaped package to check onto the plane  The only negative comment would be I forgot my toothbrush so went to the desk at pm to ask for one but they did not have any  They suggested I walk around the corner to the gas station for one     hum We used the M bus that stopped in front of the hotel and were able to transfer anywhere in the city  Even though the hotel was not in the most convient part of the city the bus was an excellent mode to get there  I would stay in this hotel again 
N => Call it no service and a bad stay Just stayed at the Bentley a few nights ago  The check in staff was very friendly and offered me a room with a river view and king bed  Upon arriving at my room a vacuum cleaner was at my door it stayed there for two days  The room was very clean  Good sheets and bed okay design  Just dont sit in any of the three chairs that were in the room  The chairs all had a wood frame but you sank inside the frame because the cushions were so old and worn  The or was not helped by the torn wallpaper   reminded me of Barton Fink Everything seemed to be going okay until returning to my room at pm to find that my room was broken into  Nothing was taken because I left nothing there but the dresser and closet ransacked  Called the front desk to complain and they told me that management would call me in the morning  Well management never called for the two days I was there  In fact the manager was never at the hotel  I asked to be moved to another hotel property or compensation for one nights stay  When I went to the front desk to ask why the manager has not contacted my they said he was not there but they were aware of my situation  The front desk attendent said quot whats the problem nothing was taken quot Also housekeeping never serviced my room until I called at pm upon returning from work  Well I cant recommend the Bentley   stay away  
N => Suprisingly good We arrived a few hours earlier than check in time and due to our alloted room not being ready we were upgraded to a fabulous sweet on the th floor  The room comprised of a bedroom area which was huge bed partictioned by double gass doors leading to a lounge area with suede sofa  It was brilliant  Unfortunately that week happened to be the coldest since  so the room admitadly was cold  We called down to reception and they told us all heaters were on full wack and all she could do was offer us some extra blankets which we accepted  We really couldnt complain at this though as it was particualry cold  The hotel on the whole was in good order and orated tastefully  It was a bit rough around the edges but defiantely accpetable  Would definately return to the bentley  It is a bit out of the way on the upper east side but still very easy to get around  In comparison to other hotels we looked at for the same price then Bentely was definately the best  
N => Great Service Bad Management My friends and I rented a suite for the weekend at the Bentley this past uary  We didnt have a vacation this past summer so we ided to stay in NY for a nice fun weekend  On our first day there we received excellent friendly service from the staff  To our surprise there was a major storm coming the day after so we ided to make our first night a night out  We went shopping all morning through the afternoon had dinner then came back to the hotel to get ready  Unfortunately our time there went sour when the vents stopped blowing hot air and the hot water ran out just as we are getting ready to go out at around pm  We called the front desk to see what the problem was and they told us the hotel was having problems with the hot water and that it should be getting fixed soon  The windows in our room began to fog up and even froze on the inside it was that cold  After an hour of constantly calling the front desk I ided to go downstairs and request to be moved either to a different suite that had heat and hot water or to be moved to another one of their hotels in NY with a comparable room They agreed to move us to a different hotel at pm and even paid for the cab ride  They checked us into a filthy badly orated tacky hotel near by and our room wasnt even a suite  It was  midnight at this point and we were exhausted and carrying all our shopping bags plus luggage  They couldnt move us to a comparable hotel because they were all booked so I asked for them to refund us our money and we would find a hotel ourselves at this point  After calling around NY for the cheapest place we could stay that wasnt dirty we found a regular room at a riott for about  more than we were going to pay for a suite at the Bentley  We got to the riott a little before am and we were so exhausted and hungry we ordered pizza then fell asleep to a movie  We didnt even get to go out to a bar or club because our second night there there was a huge snow storm and the third day we had to go home early because my best friends father had died of a heart attack the night before  Because of the huge inconvenience the Bentley caused us on our first night I spoke with someone from management and he told me he was going to see what he could do but after a month of waiting for his phone call someone else calls back and says that all they can do for us is give us  dollars off our next night there since that is the difference for what we paid for the riott  They couldnt do anything for us for the inconvenience they caused us  So to say the least I wasnt very pleased with how management handled the situation  Come to find out we werent the only ones that suffered from lack of heat and no hot water but everyone staying that busy weekend and some people even lacked electricity in part of their room  Weird but true The only good thing about the Bentley is its or and friendly staff so just pray nothing goes wrong so you dont have to deal with management  
N => a nice Hotel I stayed in Bentley Hotel for a week rd to th  with my family wife and son  It was our first time in NYC It s in a good location you only need to walk   minutes to get to the southeast corner of Central Park  In fact the hotel is close to everything and you don t need to take public transport every time you go out furthermore you can find nice restaurants and bars near the hotel to have a good breakfast or a quick lunch or dinner The room was big enough for us two king beds as we requested  The furniture wasn t new but in good condition  The temperature of the room was agreeable  The bathroom was clean and with a good powerful shower There was some noise from the street because York Avenue has quite a lot of traffic  We had read a few reviews about noise coming from other rooms but we didn t have this problem The staff were friendly amp helpful  They responded quickly if you needed anything and they kept a distance if you didn t need them We didn t spend much time in the hotel we only needed a reasonably comfortable base for visiting the city and we had it  We can recommend this hotel for this purpose  
N => Everything elese considered I would recommend the Bentely Hotel  We have just returned from four nights at the Bentley th thru th    I was a little worried about some of the reviews that people have posted about this hotel  As it was our first time in the big apple we really needed the hotel to be ok Indeed the hotel was ok if a little bit away from the bright lights of down town it was just fine The only problem we encountered with the hotel was that they stoped serving complementary breakfast on uary  we were attracted to the Bentley because of the breakfast but on arrival to our room we were greated by a note explaining no more breakfast sorryOther than this small set back our stay was pleasent The lobby is a little tired the coffee dock off the lobby was self service but a very worthwile addition on the cold days we encountered in NY  The rooom we had was on the fifth floor on the corner of York Road and nd traffic kept us company from am in the morning but was not too bad the room was a little dull but was friendly and inviting it was clean and fresh bathroom was brighter and very clean plenty of towles good powerful hot shower and complementary soap and shampoos The bed was very comfortable and the linens freash clean and overall excellent  You can walk to Fifth Ave and Central Park altough its a  minute walk we found the  day metro card was execellent value the number  bus stops outside the hotel each way and travels up and down th street crossing Madison Lexenton Fifth and Broadway just jump on and jump off great service you can of course use the metro  subway as well which we did and found it easy and safe to use Overall our stay at the Bentely Hotel was enjoyable If we go back to NY which we will I would most probley stay closer to Broadway and Fifth Very fine hotel just a littel away from some of the action Everything elese considered I would recommend the Bentely Hotel Thanks Tripadvisor great resource for the bewildered traveler 
N => Very accomodating When I arrived to check in I was told that they were all out of rooms with two queen size beds even though that was what I had reserved  Before I could even begin to panic the man at the front desk told me that he was upgrading me to a suite at no extra cost  The room was great 
N => What is your problem You get what you pay for The Bentley is in a great location   easy to get to Bloomingdales Barneys etc etc Great cinema very near by   independent not part of a big chain amp lots of good local reataurants used by Americans amp very few tourists The staff were friendly amp helpful but not too in your face  They spoke amp helped if you needed it but didnt gush when you didnt The doormen were particularly helpful amp offered maps cabs etc whenever we looked like we needed themThe room was not huge but was fine  The closet space was more than adeqate with additional draw amp cupboard space  The bathroom was not luxurious but everything functioned   the shower was powerful the water hot The rooms were well cleaned amp toiletries etc replenished regularly  The or trendy amp minimalistic   dark wood glass amp chrome The breakfast was a surprise A bit do it yourself   bagels amp cream cheese with toasters etc   but it was free which is pretty unusual in NYC be this hotel amp location wont appeal to people with young children but it was great for usNot a  star hotel I dont think but not at all bad 
N => Clean Great location compfortable Whenever traveling in a big city clean is hard to find  My room was spotless  The view was fabulous and I found the staff very friendly and helpful  The downfall was that it was hard to reach anyone by phone from the room but when I went to the lobby with requests they always immediately met my needs in a friendly professional manner  Great location quick walk to the subway and central park amp Park Ave  Not too busy of an area so it was quite easy to get cabs too  Cute places to eat and shop nearby  I would definately stay here again  Very cute stylish clean room for a great price  
N => BEWARE   personal information faxed to anyone Stayed at the hotel for  nights days  I paid with my credit card and the reservation was under my name My spouse called the hotel the following day at midnight and the hotel desk clerk faxed to him my entire hotel bill including my credit card number Im not sure why the hotel machine prints the entire number not just the last  for five as do most businesses with expiration date food bill movie bill and who knows what else  My spouse was NOT registered at the hotel nor is he an authorized signer on my credit cards  You wonder how the desk clerk even knew the person they were speaking with was my spouse  Plus my credit card was charged for the use of the fax from the hotel I called the manager of the hotel to speak with him regarding the situation he promised to call me back that was in   I have filed complaints with the BBB and the attorney general After  the new privacy acts including The Patriot Act have been put in place people wouldnt be faxing information to persons who cant be verified as to who they are  No information should be faxed to anyone UNLESS the person who was registered in the hotel can provide information i e  credit card number dates of arrivaldeparture  YOUR PRIVACY AT THIS HOTEL IS NOT GUARANTEED   BEWARE 
N => Good location shame about the service and or Im afraid I would have to agree with the earlier review quotweird amp creepyquot  Whilst the hotels location is good the staff with the sole exception of the guy who fixed our safe   see later were the most miserable bunch Ive encountered in any hotel Ive ever stayed at   it was our first trip to NYC and any illusions we  have had about the world famous American service standards were rapidly dispelled As far as the room itself went the walls were indeed paper thin  In addition to our neighbours lengthy and excruciatingly tedious late night discussion about their relationship and some relaxing rap music we were also treated to the unpleasant smell of their cigarette smoke wafting through into our room through a locked interconnecting door   not nice at all when youre trying to sleep  OK we were unlucky to have noisy neighbours but the fact that the walls were so ridiculously thin just made things twenty times worse than they needed to be The beds themselves in our room were clean and comfortable the bathroom was small and drab  When we arrived the safe in our room had no batteries fitted and therefore didnt work although someone did come and fix it promptly when we told the management  Our TV was crappy and the remote control didnt work Little things be but irritating nonetheless  Surely housekeeping should be checking stuff like thisBreakfast which was OK was served with a scowl on the top floor of the hotel   a space which could have been made stunning great views but was instead shabby and thoroughly uninviting  The overall impression one gets from this place is of a total lack of interest and enthusiasm from whoever owns this hotel filtering down to every level It seems a great shame that a hotel in such a handy location and with the potential to be a great place to stay is completely let down by its tatty or and unnerving staff  If you really just need a bed for the night then the Bentley might suit you however we were not impressed at all  Sorry guys but we wont be staying again  
N => A Nice Surprise I spent three days in New York at the Bentley  Id booked it without knowing where it was in relation to anything else and without having heard anything about it  Id booked it because it was cheapI ided to find out a bit more and found myself on this website where I read the reviews and whilst overall it seemed OK I was starting to get a bit nervous quotits too far outquot quottaxis dont stopquot quotthe staff are unhelpfulquot quotthere are bugs in the roomsquot all seemed to stand out far more than the good aspects I am a young woman so I like to thinkwho was travelling alone in a big city where I knew no one I had a corner room on the top floor but one overlooking the Queensboro Bridge  The room was large clean if a bit tired air conditioned with good linen and a spotless bathroom The staff were helpful friendly and very amenable  I could have checked in to the room already assigned to me but if I waited to check in until later in the afternoon yes I could leave my bags there and come back later they had a room available with a better view and why didnt I go with her now and see if I thought it was worth waiting for I did and it was  Whilst up there she showed me round the upstairs bar and lounge area where the complimentary breakfast coffee juice and bagels was served every morning with an outside terrace The lobby was an oasis of elegant calm where a coffee machine served complimentary coffee all day The walk from the hotel to Lexington took  minutes and Im very unfit so it wasnt that far out at allI can highly recommend this hotel as a safe pleasant place to stay I paid   per night including tax 
N => We were pleasantly surprised We booked the hotel on the internet   the price was good and the hotel looked nice  Then we found this site and read some of the negative reviews  We began thinking we made a mistake in choosing the Bentley  So before we arrived we shortened our stay at the Bentley to  days and booked two nights at a  star hotel in the heart of Time Square at about twice the cost  We just returned from NY and we were happier with the Bentley than the star hotel even without factoring in the cost  I was glad we were aware of the negatives of the Bentley  the Bentley is quite far from the subway but the bussubway combination metro pass worked great for us we enjoyed seeing NY on the bus  it is in a residential area attached to the gas station not very glamorous when you first arrive but kind of fun to be in with NYers and not just tourists all the time  we didnt eat at the hotel restaurant found a lot of good choices one block up on First St  free breakfast was only bagels not my favorite but at the star hotel   nothing was free  Their continental breakfast of bagels and pastries was personWhat we liked the room was spacious really a one bedroom suite with a door to close off the bedroom and two tvs great with kids  Room was clean with nice or no bugs View from top floor was great and we felt comfortable just hanging out there without drinkingeating  Hotel workers were friendly and helpful  We would definately stay at the Bentley again if we were going to NY  
N => Fine The Bentley was just fine   not overly luxurious but not horrible or scary  They messed up on my wakeup call the elevator was a little dodgy and the staff was definitely not friendly but for one night at a good rate it was fine  The bus stops right across the street and it will get you across town in no time Clean too  
N => Dont I booked this hotel on line  Description on website was good in reality the hotel was awful  We only stayed one night  Take my advise and dont stay here  
N => Hated the Bentley They have Bugs This hotel was horrible i found bugs on my mattress and i had to ask them several times to send me to another room  the service was horrible  i ended up having to go to a different hotel that night  the rooms are very small dont let the beautiful pictures fool you 
N => terrible I booked the hotel via the Internet  last minete com  From the description it sounded lovely  When we arrived we were allocated a room over looking the petrol station just under the hotel  The room was very noisy I asked for a quite room on the top floor the service was appalling the staff did not care about anything the restaurant was truly very bad indeed service food amp price Breakfast was a joke The rooms were dirty the lights did not work  The concierge leapt at you to grab your case to receive a tip  I say save your money go somewhere else 
N => One of the worst I had the unfortunate experience of spending a night in the Bentley hotel on th ch   On arrival we were quotgreetedquot by possibly two of the rudest doormen the reception staff were in no way better  I would definitley not recommend this hotel to anyone friend or foe 
N => Bentley is COLD We just stayed at The Bentley    One suggestion dress warm if your staying here in the winter For the price  we had a very nice room with a nice view  The King bed and  huge down filled pillows were the most comfy Ive ever had in any hotel  Our room was warm and cozy but everywhere else in the hotel was freezing  The hallways elevators lobby library amp top floor lounge were so cold  And were used to extreme cold living in SD The lounge would be awesome in the spring summer or fall but when its only degrees in   you needed a winter coat to sit in the lounge  One night we went up to eat ordered our food and  hour later and half frozen the waiter informed us the kitchen quotlostquotour order  So believe it or not we reorderd and waited another  minutes   and still no food    so we finally left  That was by far the worst experience of our  night stay  We went back up  nights later for cocktails but we definitely ate somewhere else before going back to hotel  The morning bagels amp beverages was nice  So I would guess that if the temp was warmer while in NY we wouldve enjoyed our stay very much Again very very comfy bed and pillows 
N => Very Average         I would not recommend this hotel  On the whole the staff were ignorant and not really interested in helping in any shape or form Hotel rooms were poor and we had to change rooms three times due to severe condensation saturating the carpets through to heaters not working Location was fine and there are some reasonable bars near by If I were to go to NYC again I would definetly NOT stay here 
N => Bargain A very pleasant hotel Clean and comfortable rooms and we didnt have any problems with noise considering we were above a petrol station and next to an animal shelter  The restaurant on the st floor had wonderful views of the Manhattan skyline  We had no complaints about the location as it was only a  min walk to Central Park and cab fares are reasonable if you want to go downtown  Very impressed considering we paid so little to stay in New York 
N => good deal reading some of the reviews we did not know what to expect  we stayed one night and found the hotel to be pretty ent  the location is not the most convenient but it is close to the Central Park  considering what i paid for it was worth the money  
N => Could have been much better  
N => Save Your Money  
N => Good  
N => good place  
N => No est  del todo mal   
N => acogedor y tranquilo no demasiado centrico  
N => buon albergo il bentley  
N => over priced  
N => Terrific Midtown Choice  
N => The worst  
N => Agr able Surprise  
N => Fulfilled its purpose Loved its location in Chelsea area of Manhattan  Easy walk to the subway stations as well as the shops restaurants etc  Chelsea ket was a bit of a disappointment thoughas far as kets go  Just as well it is very close to this hotel otherwise I would be a little upset if I had made my way all the way there from midtown uptown Stayed in a room on the top floor  The stairs are steep and creaks a lot No issues with the shared toilets which were kept fairly clean  Room was quite small but not the worst I have seen  The in room shower was a bit awkward to use Next time will probably pay more to stay somewhere more comfortable  
N => Would definitely stay again though it could have been better Stayed in one of the basement flats had requested a garden flat however was given street facing one this was a bit confusing because it had initially been confirmed but then was unavailable  Guy at reception who was dealing with this was not particularly helpful or apologetic about this  Room was very spacious air conditioned and had all amenities required  Had a charming kind of feel to it and or was reasonable  Due to street facing however was very noisy at all hours of day and night and as below street level was a bit dull even during the day  Daily room service was good and to a high standard  Good shower and excellent wardrobe space  Surprised at low level of security on flat door only small lock  the push in button kind  Security into the building however was better with at least two doors to get through Location was amazing only a couple of blocks to the subway and the neighbourhood felt very safe  Beautiful tree lined street very friendly area with good selection of restaurants and bars close by Overall i would recommend a stay here mainly due to space and location 
N => The Best Chelsea Lodge is hands down my favorite hotel  EVER  The fact that its situated in NYC helps but still its a great place to stay  Last ch it was our second time in NYC and the second time in one of the Chelsea Lodge suites  We felt like we were staying in our own apartment really a place to come home to after a day of sightseeing shopping or whatever you want to do in NYC  Chelsea is great neighbourhood we were there with three girls aged    and never felt unsafe  Our stay at the CL definitely added to our wonderful experience in NYC and were all hoping to return soon  
N => Absolutely lovely place in a great location I can only repeat what other reviewers have said good value for money safe area close to subway and interesting areas   you do feel like a local staying in a place like this Yes the rooms are small but lovingly orated and have everything you need be bar a bit more wardrobe space if you are mostly spending your time out and about which I suppose which you are bound to in NY  Sharing the toilet was no problem whatsoever hardly saw or heard anyone else shower worked perfectly bed was comfy  As someone else said a light over the sink would be helpful but otherwise no complaints  Friendly staff who helped carrying luggage upstairs  Would definitely come back to stay here 
N => I hesitate to Let folks know what a great palce this is In honor of beat Author Jack Kerouac and other adventurers  I would be happy to give this resting place a horrible review in order to save it for myself  but then that would not be fair Rooms are small we call them  modest  and there is no elevator  But if your purpose is to have a comfortable place to rest between city adventures whether theatre literature music or just walking around this is a great resting place  The nearby breakfast bistro is not small reason to stay here as well  Who does not need an excellent caf   in the morning  But did I say it was nice Nay  it is horrible  and we will enslave ourselves to it often  
N => Great value good staff good room but noisy cleaners We stayed here a couple of years ago in one of the delux rooms downstairs which we really liked  This time we were in the room next door DR I think which was a bit smaller but equally as pleasant  As with the last stay it was all great except this time the room was right next to the cleaners room  Which meant that every morning at about am we would be woken up by the cleaners clattering around and calling loudly to each other  The owner of the place would sometimes wander around singing loudly around this sort of time too  This is a minor gripe though as we probably would have chosen to wake up not too much later but it was a little annoying  Everything else about the hotel was fine Id definitely try breakfast at Murrays Bagels on th Ave between nd and rd St  The best bagels Ive ever had by a mile we went there for breakfast almost every day  
N => Great base to explore the Big Apple Just came back from a one weeks stay at the Chelsea Lodge  Me and a friend went to NYC for the st time and were eager to save money on accomodation to spend it elsewhere  After checking tripadvisor com it quickly became clear that the Chelsea Lodge was the place to stay  Having read all the reviews we knew what to expect  Of course this is not the Hilton but if we wanted that wed have to go there and pay accordingly  The Chelsea Lodge provided us with a cozy room waking up to bird song in the morning small but clean and efficient  We even cht ourselves saying quotLets go homequot when we wanted to take a break from sightseeing  The location is very nice Chelsea is a charming quarter and to explore the city there are several subway stations nearby  The shared toilets were never a problem the shower in our room had enough hot water and water pressure fresh towels were provided daily  We also liked the clean wooden floors in the room  There was not a lot of personal attendance but whenever we needed something someone was there for us and that was sufficient  If we return to NYC which I am sure we will we will stay at the Chelsea Lodge again  P S  Rooms are booked out early so make sure to book in advance  I reserved our room last ober for our stay during Easter and the en suite rooms were already gone by then 
N => Charm and value in NYC  We were absolutely satisfied with our stay  The staff was not overly friendly but I dont necessarily see that as a bad thing  The room was very small but comfortable  The shared toilet was not a problem  This is great for young couples who are not going to spend a lot of time in their room  Well worth every penny  
N => Loved it I live in New York long island and my husband and I wanted to stay in the city for labor day week end  We didnt want to spend to much and I found this lovely hotel and also the price was very reasonable  The room was small but considering that we wouldnt spend the week end in our room    it was perfect very clean and the staff was very nice  I would recommend this hotel  Also the emplacement was perfect near by everything   We had a wonderfull stay 
N => Fantastic We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge from   ober  We arrived by yellow medallion taxi from JFK airport cost around  including tolls amp tip  The taxi stand is just across the road outside the airport exit and even though there was a queue it is patrolled by a warden so it moves very efficiently  You will be hassled on leaving the airport to take a private cablimo to Manhattan however we were warned about this as the drivers are not always insured  A firm quotno thanksquot was all that was needed to let them know you are not interested It helps to have a note of the lodge address on a piece of paper just to hand to the taxi driver so that you end up at the right place The taxi journey took around  minutes   be prepared for some mad driving thoughThe lodge reception was lovely and welcoming and the man on reception was warm and friendly he helped us with our cases to our room  We were in one of the basement rooms with en suite toiletshower facilities  The room itself was clean and functional and better than I expected for the price we paid  There was a TV with cable and also plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe  The shower had loads of hot water  The bed was an average size but to be honest I would have slept anywhere after all the travellingwalking There was a noisy pipe in the room which woke us up every morning around  am however that didnt bother us as we wanted to be up and out early  The room was also really warm  There is a ceiling fan but we did have to open the window to let the air circulate  Our room was cleaned and our towels changed on a daily basis  Overall I loved the unique feel of the or and it felt more homely than a souless hotel chain Chelsea was a great base for our stay  Good handy places to eat were The Dish and also Lasagne Restaurante  We also liked The Stage Door Restaurant for breakfast which was on the corner of  Ave amp rd Street  The lodge is around a   minute walk to Time Square  We walked nearly everywhere so good comfy walking shoes are essential Also it is getting very cold so take warm layered clothing so you can peel off a layer or too if the sun is shining Fifth Avenue is a must for shopping however I did not like Abercrombie amp Fitch which was more like a nightclub than a clothing store be I am just getting old It is not comparable to any other AampF store that I have visited  The fact it was dark and mobbed didnt help I suppose  A taxi back to the lodge from th Ave cost   depending on the traffic We also went to the quottop of the rockquot Rockefeller Centre which was fantastic as it was a bright sunny day  It cost  pp and was well worth doing as you can see both the Chrysler Building and also the Empire State and even the Statue of Liberty  The views are amazing The Chelsea Lodge reception will order you a taxi for your departure trip to the airport and we did this as we were leaving at  am and the cab turned up timeously I would recommend you stay at Chelsea Lodge if I am ever lucky enough to go back to New York I would stay there again without hesitation  
N => Great place to stay I booked  nights at the Chelsea Lodge after reading the trip advisor reviews and was very pleased  For the location and price you cannot go wrong with it I would suggest confirming that you have a room on one of the upper floors  We were placed in the room next to the front door and recption which was a little noisy but not a huge problem  But they did manage to move us for our last night to an upstairs rooming overlooking the back which was preferable  I found it to be clean and well maintained  I would echo the advice of not to stay in Times Square  You feel like you are experiencing real NCY when you stay in Chelsea and it is so convenient for seeing the rest of Manhattan  
N => Wonderful Chelsea Lodge Chelsea Lodge was a great place to stay in the heart of New York  We found it to be great value for money  There were no shortage of places to eat in the immediate area and most attractions are within walking distance or a short subway ride The rooms were small but comfortable and very clean  We had no problem sharing the bathroom facilities though the initial thought of this was a bit scarey   We found the staff at the Lodge very helpful and accommodating  I would have no hesitation in recommending Chelsea Lodge to other travellers looking for good clean and affordable accommodation in New York  
N => Lovely hotel brilliant location I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone  Brilliant location loads of nice restuarants near to the Lodge and close enough to mid and downtown to make it easy to get everywhere else  Yes the rooms are small but they are perfectly adequate especially if you are planning to be out most of the time  Toilets were never busy and the whole place was clean and beautifully finished  I loved it 
N => Lttile gem in Chelsea We booked the room for our first trip to NY based on Trip Adviosr reviews and were not dissappointed or suprised  Being in the industry I have stayed in some pretty sweet properties but the price of the Chelsea Lodge could not be beat and the location was great  The room was small and the toilet was down the hall but as we were never in the room except to sleep it really didnt matter and the shower is in the room which was convenient  I think if the weather had been bad and we needed to hang out in the room more it would have been a real drag but there is so much to do in NY you just dont need alot of expensive space if your main goal is to just sleep and leave again  I would recommend it to singles or couples who are more focused on seeing the city and spending their money on great meals and fun stuff in a cool neighbourhood  
N => Just ok     Myself and my boyfriend spent two nights at Chelsea Lodge in ember    When we planned this trip from Italy we ided to spend only  days in NYC since we also wanted to go elsewhere along the west coast  We checked the hotels rates and we were so surprise on how expensive NYC hotels are so when we found Chelsea Lodge and read all the positive reviews on tripadvisor we felt lucky and immediately booked it  Once we got there we found that the entrance was nice the people at the front desk were welcoming and helpful the neighbor also has its pluses close to the subways restaurants etc   but we were so disappointed of the room It was very depressing   too small no place for luggage old run down furnitures very bad smell noisy from an old heater  The room was not also very clean either dust everywhere and hairs in the shower     especially if I compare it to the bathrooms which despite were in common were spotless Had no problems with them always available when needed despite the lodge was fully booked  The shower in the room was the worst    tiny water did not run well and it was impossible to have it simply warm   it was either cold or hot  Additionally after taking the shower the room had water vapor everywhere We did not expect a  star hotel but we expected some ent rooms I was so uncomfortable with the shower that the last day I did not take it and waited to get to my next destination hoping it would be better I cant say dont stay there but just dont expect anything and dont believe to all the positive reviews    there are more cons than pros in my opinion Unfortunaly I would not recommend this place as it this    they need to clean more reate the rooms nothing fancy but not s furnitures and change the showers 
N => ok  While the price and the location were great   I wasnt so happy with the lodge itself  The room was tiny   only a sink amp shower stall the bathroom was down the hall    not so convienent if you have to go in the middle of the night  It was just my husband amp I and we felt very cramped  We had a lot of luggage  carry on suitcases duffel bag amp  backpacks which left little room to manuever The bed was uncomfortable and there was no way to adjust the temp   it was fairly chilly in the room at night amp I about froze to death If you do stay here or in the area   you must go to the Lasagna Ristorante   its absolutely wonderful The best pasta I have ever had 
N => Charming rooms great value We stayed in Chelsea Lodge for  nights in ruary   If youre looking for a hotel in New York even hostels and budget things youve already found out that they are very expensive Youll have to spend at least around  USD per room per night  I would say give that money to something thats worth it and go to the Chelsea Lodge Great location in a beautiful street only  blocks from the subway and the avenues where you can find great delis there are some good breakfast places on th avenue  The rooms are small but it didnt bother us at all theres room enough for two people even a shower a reading table and your suitcases  The rooms are just adorable with charming colors and nicely orated not what youre used to in budget hotels even expensive hotels can look like quoto my god how could you ever orate a room this uglyquot  But more important they were spotless CLEAN  The bed and the shower were very good  The toilet was just across the hall was very clean and we never had to wait  The staff was not unfriendly at all to us  We did have an incident with the heater that suddenly made a lot of noice in the morning we had to call the staff to do something about it but probably doesnt happen to everyone all the time  Dont look any further and dont hesitate you found a great little secret in a fantastic city    
N => Great Location Great Price Bad for Sleeping In Stayed here for three nights in early ch and we were definitely glad to have found this little place Our room was small but quite clean and the toilet was right across from our room and never occupied when I needed it Having the shower in our room caused a little heat but that was easily resolved by opening the window a crack The street noise was not bothersome but the hissing radiator became our alarm clock reliably quotgoing offquot around am every morning  We had plans to get up early and enjoy our trip so it wasnt a big problem but those who visit this place in winter and plan on catching a few extra hours of sleep be warned 
N => Very bad room but other rooms probably better Pros  Clean  Shower and basin in room  Comfortable bedCons  Toilet in the hall although I never had to wait  Mixed quality of staff   I experienced one reasonably friendly and one extremely unfriendly person behind the desk  Street noise   no attempt to sound proof the windows at all Rooms are extremely small but that wasnt an issue However I was VERY bothered by the location of my room which opened directly onto the reception deskentrance hallway  I felt exposed and like I had no privacy because every noise could be heard through the door including all the conversations of people entering the hotel and of the reception staff  If you stay here make sure you are not given this room  I complained but was told no other rooms were available  I was concerned that I would be kept awake all night by guests entering the hotel but in the end was lucky I was only staying one night   this would be a big gamble though if you were given this room  I was also uncomfortable walking across the reception to get to the toilet Overall I am rating this hotel  stars because it was clean I was lucky enough that guests did not keep me awake the night I stayed and I imagine if you stayed upstairs there would be much more privacy 
N => Pros and Cons Pros Great place to stay  Great prices and clean This lodge gives the guest a feeling of living in a real New York City Apt  It is a great community located near the Subway Unique and differentCons Staff is not friendly or familiar with the area to help if needed  If they are they were not willing to assist  If you do stay do ALL your research before the trip or take a laptop  Sheets not changed each not   be not during your stay  If you leave something they are not willing to help you get it back  Just said quotWe do not do thatquot So   check all areas before you leave  Community restrooms  
N => Great Price We didnt check in until close to midnight due to flight delays but the staff was very friendly  They also let us keep our luggage there until  p m  when our flight left  The rooms were indeed small but felt very cozy with the homey or  I dont think you can beat the price and quality of this in NY  The room did get quite toasty especially during showers but we just cracked the windows to cool it down  We could also hear anyone in the hallway and next door which woke us up several times  
N => This place lived up to all its reviews I research many New York hotels before I came across Chelsea Lodge  I am so glad we found this place  It was so close to everything we wanted to do and see  The subway stop is only a few blocks away  It was a very easy walk  We will definately stay here again when we return to New York The room was just as described  It was small but had all we needed in it  We had a bed dresserdesk and TV  We didnt need anything else  The shower was in the room and the toilet just down the hall  No one was ever using the bathroom when I went to it so this wasnt a big deal  They have maid service to make the bed each day and provide fresh towels  We were only in the room to sleep  We were gone the rest of the time to sight see  I would definately recommend staying here  
N => No major complaints We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for the last  nights of our honeymoon in early ember   Location wise it was ideal only a short walk to the nearest subway station although we tended to walk most places to see more  Chelsea is a very friendly neighbourhood and I would highly recommend it  The Chelsea Lodge itself is a beautiful brownstone on a pretty street  Our bedroom was very small but clean tidy and had everything we needed  We had a shower and sink in the room and the shower was excellent  We had to share a toilet which was about  metres down the hall although I was initially apprehensive about this it was absolutely fine clean fresh and more importantly always empty  Our stay didn t include breakfast however there was no problem in finding excellent places to eat near to the Chelsea Lodge  My only grievance with the place was the owner and how rude he was  After previously coming from an excellent BampB in Boston where we had received superb service it was even more apparent  He was not very welcoming or helpful when we asked him questions about the area  When we returned back at the end of the day he would simply stare at us with no acknowledgement  We both found him incredibly rude and would not use the Chelsea Lodge in future for this very reason  We have visited NYC before and realised that customer service cannot be compared to what you receive in other parts of the US however in a more intimate BampB setting you expect better  Disappointing 
N => Loved it My boyfriend and I stayed in the Chelsea Lodge for  nights from the th ember until the th ember  We both thought it was totally fabulous  Great area to be apparently W th St has been voted on of NYCs third prettiest streets   I do not doubt it and really easy access to two diff  subway stations  Lots going on in the chelsea area too and we always felt very safe even late at night  Our room was lovely  On reading previous reviews I was a bit apprehensive about the size of the room but I was actually pleasantly surprised and thought there was more than enough room for the two of us especially considering we were there for eight nights  Our room was kept immaculate fresh towels and newly made bed every day  The room could get hot but the windows could be opened so no problems there  Our room was on the st floor and overlooked an elementary school  As we werent sleeping in late anyway this was no problem  For being in the middle of the city the street was very quiet at night which was great  The walls are quite thin and if people are talking loudly in the corridor which they do then you can hear them but really things like that cannot be helped  the shower in the room was fine   i had difficulties getting the water to stay at the same temperature throughout my shower but really we can blame my own incompetency on that and not chelsea lodge sharing a bathroom was fine we were right opposite the toilet and whilst that might be a downside to some people it was fine for us  Didnt have to wait once for the toilet one was always free which was great  All in all a very positive experience and I wouldnt think twice about recommending this to a friend or staying there again myself on my next visit if we are lucky enough to be able to get a reservation   this place is popular and rightly soOne of the major pluses about the chelsea lodge for me was how close it was to the west village   loved itstay here keep in mind it is budget accommodation and you will be more than thrilled with what you get  
N => Loved Chelsea Lodge Stayed at the Chelsea Lodge from th   th ember and loved itWe had one of the deluxe basement rooms with its own bathroom and it was great  The room was spacious nice wooden floors and charming or  Plenty of room for our  huge suitcases and other stuff  Bathroom was small but fine for our needs no bathtub but plenty of hot water in the shower which had great pressure  Towels a little thin and small but hey this wasnt the Plaza Rooms were cleaned daily and the entire place was spotless We had no issues with the people we met at the front desk   when we arrived the guy took our cases down for us and yes he  not have been the jolliest of people but he was certainly not rude or offensive They also arranged a car for us to get back to the airport and held our luggage for the day without any grumbles whatsoever One small complaint   the room was very warm but it wasnt a major issue because the windows opened  It might be too hot in the summer though Overall we had a great stay in a clean spacious room that cost only  a night   a third of the cost of any ent hotel this time of year This was our th visit to NYC and probably our favourite place to stay   feels like you are renting an apartment and not staying in a hotel  Well stay at Chelsea Lodge the next time we visit NYC for sure  
N => great deal in NYC What can I say that hasnt already been said This is indeed a great place to stay if you are looking for a clean budget hotel and dont mind being outside of the Times Square madness  Rooms are indeed VERY small    you will be sorry if you try to store a lot of luggage in your room    and service was practically non existent but it was spotless and comfy and an easy walk or subway ride anywhere we wanted to go  Shared toilets were not a problem although I felt sorry for the people in C because it was right next to their room and I wondered if they were bothered by the flushing  We did hear some hallway noise and noise from the kids at the school across the street but nothing that impaired our sleep  Quite frankly we were usually so exhausted by the end of the day that nothing was going to wake usOverall we would certainly stay at Chelsea Lodge all over again  I wish we were in NYC now in fact     To stay in a quotnicerquot hotel we easily would have paid an extra   per night and I am satisfied that money was better spent on dinners and theatre tickets  
N => Couldnt have asked for moe We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for  nights in the beginning of ust   When we arrived we could choose between a room next to the reception area or on the rd floor  We took the one on the rd floor and even though we had to climb the stairs every night before we could go to bed we do not regret it  It was very quiet and the toilets were always available and very clean  The only thing I heard when I walked down the corridor to the toilet was our tv We arrived with  suitcases each and despite that the room was a bit small we had no trouble getting enough space for our  suitcases  One thing that I had been worried about before staying at Chelsea Lodge was the size of the bed  I am used to a king size bed while this was only a queen size   so I wondered how much sleep I was going to get but it was more than okay  I slept very good and the atmosphere in the hotel was great  Nice people in the reception and very nice cleaning ladies The location was very good   blocks to the subway lines A C and E  And  blocks to bus number   It was a great relief to come back to Chelsea after spending some hours at the more touristic areas around Times Square for example  I loved the area the hotel and we will definitely stay there again when we visit NYC next time  
N => An excellent choice My girlfriend and I recently stayed  nights at the Chelsea Lodge  We relied upon the solid reviews posted to Trip Advisor in making our choice  At first I was astonished that there were rooms available when I booked about  months ahead  When we arrived the laid back manager carried my very heavy bag up to the rd floor  The room was as described small and cozy  The air conditioner was a welcome sight considering how hot it was during our stay  If you dont need more than the basic amenities and plan to spend most of your stay exploring the city Chelsea Lodge is the way to go We loved New York and when we return we intend to stay there again  
N => Great hotel Given Bubbavons very comprehensive review   there isnt really much to say Only that I echo his her comments Great hotel   great value I was on the third floor   there isnt a lift but it wasnt a problem I understand this place books up months in advance but Ill definitely try to get back in on future trips to NYC  
N => Loved the Chelsea    will definately stay there next time we are in NYC We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for one week in early urary   We could not speak more highly of the place We were lucky to have a ground floor room so no need to haul the cases up the stairs Being in the middle of winter the heating was fantastic   was a little noisy for the first couple of nights but you soon get used to it The shower in the room was great and we never had to wait for anyone when using the hallway toilet  You get fresh towels and your room made up every day   an added bonus given the relatively low price you are paying for an NYC room Have already recommended it to peopleback home  
N => Very disappointing The review of this hotel in Time Out New York was glowing but I beg to differ  Dont be fooled by the photos Even though its location is great I found the hotels desk staff surly the room I was in basement was tiny very noisy I could hear everything going on in surrounding rooms and it was so overheated I couldnt sleep  Staff said they couldnt control the temperature so I asked them to help me open a window but they basically refused  Every channel on the TV showed static  They were slack on the basics   I had an early flight out at am the alarm clock in my room didnt work they got me another one that was just as useless and didnt work either   luckily my mobile phone alarm went off Id say dont stay here if you want a quiet relaxing temperature controlled nights sleep 
N => great value for money  of us stayed here when visitng NY for the first time in ember  The hotel is great value for money and a brilliant location as it is close to the main tourist areas but also to Greenwich Village and Soho  In terms of what we wanted it for comfortable place to sleep clean good location it was spot on  We came with a wheelchair it is up  steps so not perfect and they gave us a room on the ground floor and somewhere to store the chair as well as being very patient storing the extra bags we had to buy at the end of the week to try and fit everything in They also let  of us stay in the room longer than normal check out time on the last day when we were hungover and had a while before our plane left  You have to share a toilet and the showers can be temperamental going from hot to cold but it was clean well cared for and nicely orated  I was ill during the holiday and had to spend a day in bed which I wasnt happy about but I would have been massively more gutted had I not had a nice bed to snuggle up in to get better quicker  If you are planning to stay in alot then youll want more but if you ARE planning to do that in New York you are in the wrong city Would definitely recommend it and or visit again  
N => Did not love the Chealsea Lodge First of all I rely on Trip Advisor for my traveling  The room that I stayed in was horribly small  The TV didnt get great reception the shower kept going from scalding to freezing and there was a huge pipe in the room that kept whistling like a tea kettle  The cleaning staff was very friendly  However when we explained to the problem with our room whistling pipe they were not willing to accommodate us at all  
N => Great place to enjoy NYC and still relax We stayed at the Lodge the first week of ember  Our experience was great  We stayed in room E  It was cleaned everyday fresh towels and everything tied up  Small room but enough for the time we spent in wich was almost just to sleep  The different persons we met at the front desk from the time we arrived were very polite and helpful  The neighbourhood is fantastic you can almost forget you are in the middle of NYC  Try the bagles at Murrays for breakfast and also find some time to try BetterBurger menu Our overall experience was awesome and we would definitely stay here again  
N => dont stay there     We made a request through their web site to stay there  We didnt hear back from them and sent another letter basically cancelling the quotreservationquot because we found another hotel  On our next CC bill we found that we were in fact charged for staying there for  nights  We contacted the management who basically said that it was our fault we were quotno showsquot and that they would not refund our money  Dont let these greedy sods get your money too       
N => Great New York stay We chose Chelsea Lodge based on price amp Tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed Our room on the first floor was small as expected but very comfortable clean and warm The location is excellent quiet street amp handy to subway shops restaurants etc Would recommend it as an excellent place to stay in New York amp very good value for money  
N => To be recommended    All the positive reviews of the Chelsea Lodge are fair and I totally subscribe them  My only small problem was the cold it was mid ober it was already getting quite chilly outside and also in my room and the hotel had the heating off  Told the guy in the reception but nothing could be done  
N => Great spot The Chelsea Lodge is our favourite place to stay in NYC  The location cant be beat   walking distance to many of the tourist attractions also close to subways and the food is more affordable because its a real neighbourhood not like Midtown which just caters to tourists wallets  The lodge is located in an old brownstone which has been brought up to date  The rooms are very clean and modern and you get your own shower and sink leaving you to have to share only a toilet  Hallelujah And for only  a nightWe travelled there last summer with friends and all of us stayed at the Chelsea Lodge  It was a great home base and everyone was happy with their rooms  The dude who worked the front desk did not seem to be capable of cracking a smile or offering up a nicety but he did let us leave our bags in his office before we checked in and after we checked out without a problem  Well be he gave us a little attitude but no worries  It definitely wasnt enough to prevent me from staying there again  This place is a real gem 
N => basic goodness This was a nice clean basic place to stay in New York at an excellent price  Rooms are small but if you dont expect to spend much time there it doesnt matter  The great thing about it is the location in a well kept street full of brownstones right in the middle of Chelsea close to the A and C subway lines  Theres a lot of barrestaurant activity in the neighborhood but the Lodge was quiet anyhow  We always felt safe even when we came in late  It is also close to a really excellent bakery Bergamote so your breakfast is not far away  I will definitely stay here again My one and only criticism is that they need to start replacing mattresses  Mine was not terrible but I did sense a little bowing in the middle  
N => Great Find What a find  From the moment I was greeted I knew I was in the right place  This is a small hotel with small rooms  The bed was very comfortable and the shower immaculately clean with plenty of hot water  True it doesnt have a WC in the room one was immediately opposite my door but I paid  for three nights so crossing the corridor was no inconvenience Ive always paid more and got far less in NY  If you can book early for this little gem  
N => Charming hotel nice neighbourhood but small room Got to agreed with all the previous review  We stayed during the week of y  and its so great to go back to a quiet neighbourhood after visiting all the busy tourist spots Besides the thin wall another reminder is there are  floors and they do not have a lift  Also if you are bringing a large lugge you might find it difficult to open it in the room Despite the above we will still consider staying here again  
N => Pleasant Place to Stay This is a great place to stay  We stayed here for  nights  The rooms were small but sparkling clean  The shared toilet was also always clean and we virtually never had to wait to use it  It is also in a really good location with plenty or reasonably priced restaurants nearby and also two subway stations within a short walk  We didnt find the staff to be friendly at all though actually unlike previous reviewers  They werent exactly rude but bordered on it with their quotbare minimumquot responses to our questions  But overall compared with prices of other lodgings in NYC I would say Chelsea Lodge is excellent value  
N => Certainly lived up to the good reviews If you are not looking to spend a fortune on accommodation in NYC the Chelesa Lodge is ideal  Well located in the fashionable and hip Chelsea but on a very quiet side street it is close enough to walk to the midtown sights or Grenwich Village Soho etc Rooms are indeed immaculate and not as small as I thought they might be  We had a garden view from the back which probably also made it quieter  To echo other reviews   the shared toilets really are not a problem Highly recommended for independent travellers who dont want the same old corporate chain hotel experience  
N => Best Deal Around We have recommended the Chelsea Lodge to several friends Location staff friendliness price Arrived at JFK from California on a red eye so got to the Lodge at am  Since a room was available we were permitted to check in immediately  Chelsea is a terrific walking neighborhood the staff gave us tips on where to eat  Recommend getting a gallery guide available from any of the many galleries in the vicinity You can find out where all the artisits openings are   normally open to the public   its a chance to meet locals  
N => Little Gem Excellent value for money  Staff were helpful the rooms were very clean and the shower was great   constant hot water Great area to stay and easy to get around New York from  Wouldnt hesitate to return  
N => Home away from Home Just got back from a long weekend in NY and this place made it We stayed in one of the Parlour suites  We would have preferred a garden suite but they were already booked even though I booked over  months in advance It was such a nice place to come back to each evening  The staff are really helpful when it comes to planning your days with great advice on any activity The only grumble I had was the noise from the people in the room above amp from the street but neither were a problem This is a great place and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to New York 
N => fabulous  my husband amp i stayed in one of the garden suites down the street with our own private bath amp kitchenette  it was fabulous fabulous fabulous it was very clean the staff was very helpful amp friendly amp the location cant be beat  it felt like we were living in Manhattan not visiting the bathroom was huge the only complaint i have is that it was a stand up shower making it really difficult for a girl to shave   the garden was huge by city standards  dont expect a football field amp so serene amp quiet    you could totally forget youre in NYC  we will definitely go back it was a great experience 
N => A clean bed not much more Convenient  Price was right but the bed was hard and sheets were itchy  Noisyish street  Look this is a no frills experince a bare step up from a backpacker  Still in NYC a good clean bed in a safe place is all I wanted and all I got  
N => A very nice experience at a low price Stayed here one night in early   I came into NYC just to see a concert and was determined not to spend a lot of money on a room  I paid  to stay here and could not have been more pleased  This was my first experience in a BampB type of place and initially felt a little weird about the idea of a shared bathroom  But I adjusted easily enough and so will you believe me  It felt much like I was staying in someones house    which I probably was come to think of it  Anyway its on a safe quiet street practically around the corner from a subway station  Lots of places to eat and drink in the area  The staff werent particularly friendly but they certainly werent rude  The room was small and I wouldnt call it beautiful but it was clean and comfortable enough  For New York City this is an excellent choice for folks who would rather spend their money on great food etc  rather than a place to sleep  Ill definitely stay here again on my next trip to NYC  
N => Good and Bad The absolute worst service Ive ever experience anywhere when we first got to the place  A grumpy overweight guy gave us the quotwhats YOUR last namequot as if it was a struggle to even look at us Besides that  the room was clean and well kempt though it was small  Didnt mind the shared bathrooms  Service got better  
N => Yup Another satisfied customer We took the garden suite and had no complaint whatsoever  Great location   our first time to NY and got to feel like a local  Well be back  
N => Nothing could be better on a budget New York was the vacation spot my wife and I have been dreaming of  We wanted to spend our money on enjoying the city and not on a hotel room  This hotel fit our modest budget  The room were small but clean and comfortable even for two  We upgraded our room to a double bed and a private bath The hotel was orated in a fun eclectic style that we enjoyed  Old photograhs and odd pieces hung in the lobby The location was perfect for us because we took the subway alot and it was close to two main lines one took us directly to Times Square and the other down to Battery Park What really made the stay at the Chelsea Lodge nice was the personable staff  Thanks guys Cons Its a budget hotel safe clean friendly and comfortable but dont expect the Ritz or the Plaza  
N => Clean but   We stayed in a streetside suite The place was clean but the entry hall looked like it had been orated in remnants from two different stores with no coordination The towels were of military grade There was no wifi which was touted on the site  Furnishings were fairly spartan and uninspired  The stakk we saw was nice the the location good  
N => Very Convenient We were in Chelsea Lodge last uary  and we had a great experience  We would definitely book again but we will try to chose a second or third floor room with views to the street   Good points convenient and cute location next to everything lovely street atmosphere helpful receptionists quiet lovely oration cosy very clean  I do agree with all the positive reviews  But     Not so good points small tiny rooms not suitable for long stays or large baggage not so good restoration although the building has been restored your bed might be affected by some the floors which are not horizontal its just a detail but very annoying one  We tried two rooms and both had the same situation very noisy heating ONLY in lowfloor room but we were changed into another one no elevator but if you stay in bottomfloor room you might get the noise from the people comming up and down the stairs   
N => Great for the money paid We stayed in New York for several days in ember  Overall we were really pleased with this hotel the staff were very friendly and helpful even condidering we arrived at  in the morning The room was small but sufficient as we were never there much  There was no road noise from the back room however our room had a pressure valve which made some odd noises in the night waking me and my partner on the odd occasion Overall this hotel is brilliant for the money you pay in fact it was the only way we could have afforded to stay centrally to all the attractions  
N => A Great Place to Stay Recently stayed at the Chelsea Lodge  Initially I was wary about the idea of a shared toilet but couldnt beat the rate in NYC  When I arrived I was very surprised at the place  Unlike any hotel Ive ever been to  The staff was friendly and as native New Yorkers they were very knowledgable about the neighborhood where to eat shop and have fun  Id highly recommend staying at the Chelsea Lodge  
N => A Great Experience  
N => MY Favourite NY Hotel  
N => somewhat disappointed  
N => Wonderfully small  
N => Enjoyed Chelsea Pines Inn very much  I only have good things to say about Chelsea Pines Inn  From the moment we arrived we were treated as guests should be  Friendly helpful with shows and resturant recommendations  The extended breakfast hours in the morning helped alot too  I was made to feel welcome and very well taken care of  Thank you to all the staff at Chelsea PInes Inn  I will definitley be back to see you  Regina 
N => The Perfect Location   Clean   Great Hosts The title says it all This place was spectacular Went to NY for a business class and wasnt sure where to stay  Checked homestay com and saw some great places for more money but Chelsea Pines kept calling to me  The reviews were amazing and the ease of location as well as concierge won me over  Cant say enough about the locale  On all other trips I have stayed uptown and it was such a pleasure to be close to everything all the time  The one bedroom suite was just as pictured and worked great for myself and my employee  The guys at the front desk were gracious from check in to check out even though we were accidentally stealing HO from their fridge  It became our home away from home and I will never hesitate to recommend others to or return there myself Thanks everyone   we had a blast 
N => Really NOT all that     Having read several great reviews of this place on trip advisor in Gay times and online we were really looking forward to our stay here but unfortunatley overall we were dissapointed and the reviews did not live up to the really thing  We always take trip advisor reviews with a pinch of salt and it takes alot to make us complain or moan but on this occassion when your spending quite alot of money on a room I think its neccessary  We opted for a deluxe room but in our opinion apart for the arty film posters on the wall there was nothing more deluxe about it than a Days Inn   it was on the th floor which meant a hard lugg of our cases up there after a long journey   no offer of help either  The stair wells and landing were tatty and also all rooms are named after a film star with a star plaque on each door   not one didnt have paint splashed all around it like it had been painted in a rush which looked really bad  On one occassion our room wasnt made up when we got back from a day out   didnt get much of an apology either just shoved afew new shampoos   There was nothing special about the staff   they did there very least really  HiBye kinda thing which when you read how great the staff are it makes you wonder  Breakfast is fine although they could do with more than one small toaster for the morning rush of toasted bagels  On a positive note   the location is excellent just metres or so to a metro station and right in the heart of the gay district for bars clubs and restuarants  We had a great time in NY but the Chelsea Pines Inn although perfectly comfortable but for the price you are paying really does not live up to the hype 
N => Very pleasant we would return We are a young couple who stayed at Chelsea Pines Inn for  nights in   We enjoyed our stay and would return to this hotel  In its price range it was significantly better than  other small New York hotels I have tried Pros  Our room was comfortable and clean and the film star pictures gave it character  The window could be opened for fresh air and a pleasant view of a courtyard  For a New York hotel it was pretty quiet with minimal street noise and only noise from other guests in the hallways as they went to their rooms not between the rooms themselves  Pleasant self serve breakfast though fairly minimal in options  Very well located very close to a subway station restaurants shops etc and walkable to quite a lot of tourist destinations  Great service   the staff at reception went out of their way to be helpful find restaurants etcCons  Air conditioner slightly noisy not a big issue  We were on the third floor and it was manageable but not pleasant getting in and out with our suitcases but I wouldnt recommend the upper floors to elderly or mobility impaired guests 
N => The perfect first time NYC experience We recently returned from our stay ober   at the fabulous Chelsea Pines Inn and I couldnt wait to write a glowing recommendation  We arrived at noon and despite our early arrival were almost instantly shown to our room Jay and Al were quick to show us around and ask us if it was our first time in New York  The answer yes garnered lots of good advice how to use the subway where it would be fun to stroll on such a gorgeous day here are this months shows if you are interested  The staff arranged tickets to a show a car to pick us up when it was time for us to depart and everything else we asked of them The room was lovely the space clean and the amenities plentiful  The garden and sunroom were the perfect places to start my day with a book and a bagel  And for a cat lover having Charlie mew good morning each day was extra special I cant speak highly enough of the Inn the staff or the neighbourhood  
N => Simply the Best It was comfortable amp restful  The full kitchen downstairs was amazing They had homemade orange peel bread one morning   wow Room was clean amp a little larger than expected  Front desk seem to not know a stranger I was treated like a guest in someones home and not like a customer  Will stay here again  
N => I have great time I spent  nights in ust at Chelsea Pines Inn I had a great time  People was very freindly and the hotel was very well located  I recommened have the experience also I suggest to have lunch at Chelsea ket just  minutes wak from the hotel CheersKaren GilchristChile 
N => Our first trip to NYC We had the opportunity to stay at Chelsea Pines while we were in NYC  This was our first trip to NYC and we were looking for a safe affordable place  Not only is Chelsea Pines all of those things it is much more  I cant say enough good things about them  They were friendly helpful and accomodating from the moment we arrived  They checked our baggage offered us breakfast and got us into our room quickly  Our entire stay was enjoyable  I felt like family and cant wait to return  P S  Charlie Chaplin the cat really looks like Charlie Chaplin 
N => Dont hesitate to book a room here We chose to stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn based on the very positive reviews we found on Trip Advisor  We werent disappointed and spent a wonderful couple of days there  Jay and his staff have created a very pleasant haven for visitors to New York  Our room was clean and spacious with nice amenities  Everyone on the staff was extremely helpful the night staff was especially accommodating of our early morning coffee request  Their restaurant recommendations were first rate too and they readily made reservations for us  It is also easy to get to and from the inn as it is a half block from the th street subway station from which you can easily get to almost any place in the city  We plan to stay at the Chelsea Pines again and have already recommended the Chelsea Pines to others  
N => Hospitality and coziness are the key words when it comes to describing Chelsea Pines Inn We certainly had a terrific stay at Chelsea Pines Inn  Not only was the staff unusually friendly and helpful the hotel itself was warm welcoming and charming  Being Europeans we value public transportation very highly  C P I  is located in a friendly neighborhood with easy access to both Uptown and Downtown  Even if youre not familiar with using the subway system the staff again is ready to assist  All in all we give our best recommendations  Susanne amp Anders Denk  
N => Great Stay  Conveniently Located  Lovely Hosts  No suprises at this fantastic B amp B  The recommendations provided by Trip Advisor travellers were spot on and we were very happy with our stay  Totally recommend for the younger travellers only because there is no lift access to get to the rooms and the stairway is quite steep  Pros Hosts were very friendly and helpful   min walk to subway  Dry cleaners across the road that provided clothes washing service  Lovely covered court yard to have equally lovely breakfast in  Room and bathroom kept clean and tidy  Strollingwalking distance to Meat Packing District and trendy cafes  Very safe area to live   though you will find Manhattan quite safe anyway Cons Small room No PC or laptop provided in common area for surfing the web  Toiletries were not topped up after a couple of days so had to resort to using  shampoo that I had saved away from another hotel stay   The climb to our room can be a bit tiresomefor older travellers no lift access  though the staff were very helpful and carried our luggage up the steep stairs to  our room  
N => Failed to live up to expectations I chose the Chelsea Pines Inn carefully as my only previous trip to New York  years ago had been ruined by a substandard hotel  Given the reviews online I was expecting it to be good The standard of the room was poor  I didnt expect it to be large I was only paying for the superior standard room or particularly well furnished it is a budget hotel  But I did expect it to be clean  The lavatory was full of waste when I arrived  The shower had not been cleaned and had pieces of paper stuck to the floor that had clearly been there for a while  The bedding although I think clean smelt like someone else had slept in it  The quality of the furnishing was also unacceptable  The bed was a spring Z bed so creaked everytime you rolled over and the handles were hanging off the wardrobe The pluses were the staff particularly Art who were great the included breakfast and the free wifi Sure Chelsea Pines is reasonably cheap but I am sure there must be better places to stay for the same or not much more  I wont be visiting again  
N => LOVE THIS PLACE This was my nd stay at Chelsea Pines and I did not think it could be better than the last but it was  I was greeted by the SAME staff as the last trip a year earlier  The lengths that EVERYONE went too to help me during my trip was above and beyond what I ever expected   I was there this trip due to a death in the family  The best attraction in NYC for me is this welcoming inn on th street  There is no other place for me to stay when I come to the City  You will love the staff atmosphere rooms and the breakfast  
N => Claustrophobic rooms I was expecting a lot more based on the hotels website  The room was pathetically small and cramped and not exactly a great deal  I think the owners have obviously made an effort to add some charm to the place but overall I would rather spend a little bit more money to not feel so cramped  with a queen bed there was be two feet of space on either side of the bed  It felt like a narrow closet  The bed was not very comfortable despite the website proclaiming that it had been redcorated or perhaps they missed our roomgt It is definitely in a great location and if youre just going out all night or are  years old you might not mind but dont expect a comfortable B and B  Splurge a bit and youll be happier  
N => Wonderful place to stay My friend recommended CPI for our first visit to NY  And I recommend or will to everyone else  The inn was perfect went beyond our expectations    Service from the very beginning the front desk was courteous professional and very quotwelcomingquot  Checked us in recommended restaurants places of interest and how to get around town  Jay I believe he is one of the owners even wrote out the directions for us no other Hotel and weve stayed in many coming from Vegas have NEVER had anyone provide this level of service  There should be an additional stars for rating   Room Clean well furnished absolutely splendid  Each room has a classic movie star theme I smiled my girlfriend just went quotsooooo cute quot Fresh towels when needed and none of that cheap thin rough kind  Bed was comfortable   even had an ipod station where we plugged in to listen to some tunes  Very modern yet homey  Great lighting system can dim to your preference  Awesome   Downstairs Kitchen   clean comfortable and fresh bagelsmuffinsorange juice in the mornings  Theres a backyard for outdoor sitting to bad it was too cold to enjoy it   Price very reasonable  affordable  My friends came by to take a look at the place and stated quotDude you cant get a room like this anywhere in NY for the price you paid quot  plus   we stayed the weekend   Accessibility near the subway   just up the street   Location We saw Manhattan and in all its glory  Chelsea ket right around the corner   very cool place to hang and get some great eats  Fun walk around the city  We went to union square empire state times square and up to central park to check out the MET learned a NY lingo  Basically places of interest are very accessible from Chelsea Pines    review was written by a third party   no gimmick   I have no affiliation whatsoever with CPI   this was an independent inquiry  
N => this is the best The best place to stay in New York City  You dont have to look any further this is where you want to be  Great neighbourhood quiet garden clean wonderfully orated old and new combined and best of all the friendliest people I ever met in New York  Helpful gracious and kind they do all they can to make you feel at home and comfortable  I came to NYC this time to accompany my dhter     she started an international fashion course in NYC in uary  Jay helped as so much to find our way I was moved  So I will be back with my husband my other dhter my friends     As for me I will never stay anywhere else in NYC in my life  This is a gem  
N => Giving thanks for Chelsea Pines Inn It was thanksgiving eve my boyfriend and I were desperately looking for a place to stay for we had arrived in Manhattan and were victims of a scam concerning an apt  we had booked over the internet still back in PortugalNew to the city and with little hope     a special vibe from the other side of the road cht our attention it said Chelsea Pines Inn We went inside we told our story and we were very kindly received at Chelsea Not only we found a fantastic place in terms of neighborhood but also in terms of comfort and sympathy We gave thanks to Chelsea Pines Inn and the great people working there The scam ended having benefits 
N => Great Location Wonderful bed Arrived on a friday evening to the Chelsea Pines Inn  At first we my partner and I were a little put off by the receptionist welcome wich was a little cold  The room however was very nice  We only booked a standard room wich was located on the th floor wich is really the rd floor for us Europeans so that was a nice surprise  The bed was super high and comfortable  Bathroom looked newly appointed and there was enough storage for clothes and such  The room even had a ently sized fridge  We stayed in the Jean Simmons room wich was located on the front side of the building  Although being located on a busy street we didnt have any problems with noise coming from the traffic  the room was cleaned daily and we got a change to have breakfast on saturday  The breakfast was really good salmon creamcheese fresh bagels and all kinds of breads  The only thing we didnt like about breakfast was that the breakfast area did not seem to be heated  it was very cold All the guys working there are friendly but not overly so  So if you expect the over the top fake quothi how are you you look so nicequotetc  etc  this is not your place  The people are friendly but real GreatThe Inn is in a really really good location Close to a main subwaystop and on the edge of Chelsea Meetpaking District and The Village  You are right smack in the middle of all the action wich was great as we liked to explore NYs nightlife All in all we had a really nice stay here and were feeling a bit sorry when we left  We will surely return to the Chelsea Pines Inn next time we are in NY  
N => Good location For ease of getting around NYC Chelsea Pines Inn is in a great location there are a number of subway lines servicing different parts of Manhattan  Overall though we cant help being disappointed in the overall experience  Our room on the second floor was excessively small even by NYC standards and with nowhere to store suitcases that left little room to move  I read previously that they had been refurbished but I think this room must have missed out  The room was stuffy and drab and the hot water in the shower unreliable  Being right on Wth Street also means garbage trucks and sirens   The staff were functional but not overly friendly not even a token offer to help carry a bag upstairs which we found odd having stayed at other much friendlier gampl accommodations  For US per night if you look hard enough there are nicer places to stay in the area for the same money  
N => In a league of its own I booked this hotel solely on the basis of reviews read here  We stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn for  nights in late t early ober  We are two couples in our fifties  We had rooms on the second floor with bathroom  The staff were either very helpful and friendly OR just did their job efficiently which was great  I expected small rooms this not being my first time in NYC but they were a bit smaller than expected  Beds linens towels hot water breakfast all good  We were very happy  Location was great  Particularly enjoyed the very warm weather and eating breakfast in the courtyard behind the dining area  I would like to make one suggestion to the owners Due to your very small rooms  I think ours was superior standard   Susan Hayward and very high ceilings perhaps you could give some thought to adding a couple of hooks in each room andor putting up a shelf to take advantage of the vertical space you have  Due of the small amount of floor space it was difficult to keep the floor clear of clutter  I would recommend this hotel to others and would return again  Thanks for a great stay in NYC Susan Deevy 
N => Great place to stay in NYC A cosy comfortable and clean litle hotel with a great location close to wherever you want to go as a tourist  Me and my three friends stayed for four nights and where very pleased with everything the rooms were clean the service was great breakfast was good  I have recommended Chelsea Pines Inn too all my friends going to NYC and I will definately stay there myself next time i go 
N => No CHILDREN Wanted I was planning a stay in New York with my wife and newborn baby  I read the wonderful reviews at the reasonably prices hotel  However when I called I was told the hotel quotwas not suitablequot for children or infants under  years old  I did not quite understand so I asked and was told that the quothallways were not very wide the bathrooms were small and the building did not have an elevator quot WOW I did not know that newborns needed these amenities  ONLY IN NYC 
N => It was GREAT NYC   thought Id hate it  Went with my wife for a gallery opening surprisingly the city was good  The hotel was great  very accommating helpful close to subway  galleries good restrauants etc When we go back well stay here again  
N => So pleased I stayed here I stayed here for  nights in ch amp booked this hotel after reading the positive reports on Trip  I was travelling alone amp had friends staying in a nearby hotel I have asked permission of those named below to include them by name I arrived after pm amp was warmly welcomed by Richard  Thank you  I was on the nd floor in the Troy Donahue room which was facing the street  The room was clean amp quirky with huge posters  I had chosen a room with sink amp shower but without toilet  The loo was just along the corridor amp I never saw anyone else go in or out  It suited me fine The bed was very large amp very comfy  The only slight drawback was that as the bed was so large it was near the far end wall amp I had to siddle past  Having said that it was great to have a big bed The shower was efficient amp towels replaced daily as needed  The complimentary toiletries were most welcome The breakfasts were good amp set me up for the day  There was a choice of orange juice coffee various teas  types of cereal fruit muffins doughnuts bagels amp cookies  The plates were fab  All themed around filmstars amp movies  Im a saddo amp I took photos of my plates each day having chosen different ones each morning My friend arrived to collect me on the first morning amp I had asked Richard the night before if it would be ok if my friend had a coffee amp cookie with me I would happily pay if he would added it to my bill  He said there was no need amp my friend would be welcome  What a warm gesture amp much appreciated Each evening when I returned to the hotel Richard was on duty amp we had great chats  He was really helpful over all sorts of info I wanted to know  Thank you again The other guests were quiet but we passed the time of day On the last morning I went to reception to ask if I could check in for my flight  Ric not Richard was on duty I hadnt met him before  Another total sweetie  He happily helped me to check in using his computer amp then printed off the confirmation sheet for me at no cost I also met Jay the owner on my last morning again another really warm helpful guy  When I was ready to leave he helped me with my bags amp hailed a cab for me  Thank you I really appreciated the warmth shown to me by Richard Ric amp Jay  They made a good stay GREATI would return  The location was excellent with the subway at the end of the street a minute walk away  All the cab drivers knew of the location which is a bonus If you like a good location amp quirkiness then stay here  There was reoration going on but every establishment has to maintain a property  It didnt interfer with my stay at all  
N => Liked this place ALOT Stayed here with my husband for seven nights  We found the hotel to be very well located with subway on the street and easy walking to the village soho chelsea and meatpacking  Hotel itself was fine the rooms were well appointed  we stayed in the Rock Hudson delux room and Anne Francis delux room both on fifth floor   quite a hike esp at the end of long days of walking manhattan but not a real problem after a couple of geritas   very clean and it was really nice to come back to someone having switched on the AC as NYC was having a really hot beginning of fall when we went with temps in s  Found the staff to be friendly and helpful but unobtrusive and have already reco the hotel to a friend who is planning a trip to new york in the not too distant future  Thanks Chelsea Pines Inn for a great stay I am pretty sure we will be back  
N => Just love the Chelsea area Trying to find a place to stay at the last minute in NY can be tough especially for a reasonable price  Which brings me to the CPI  Great location friendly and going through some updating to make the place even better  The room we had was on the smaller side Kim ak Room but who stays in their room  Rooms are orated w movie posters  Everything you needshower clean close to the subway amp includes a nice continental breakfast  This is a gay establishment but my wife and I felt right at home with the help of Charlie the cat No elevator and we made it up to our room with no problem even at our age mid s  Emails to the property were answered quickly amp professionally  I repeat Great Location Good Price Clean and a friendly staff  Thanks CPI  
N => What a Gem Just returned from a four night stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn and we had a brilliant time Staff bent over backwards to help us out even lent us a laptop to get some theatre tickets online  They gave us two restaurant recommendations for  and for Primitivo which has to be the best Italian meal Ive had in a long time and very resonably priced  Fantastic location really central and only a  min walk from Christopher Street  We stayed in the Paul Newman room with own bathroom and it was more than big enough and spotless  Ok so its not the Hilton but then you are not paying Hilton prices either and to be honest Id rather stay here for the atmospherestafflocation  Fantastic   we will stay here again when we come to New York  Big thank you to the member of staff who seemed to be always on duty in a supervisory roll and commands a very tight ship   Charlie the cat  
N => Really awful weekend  Avoid this place  What a dump I will never stay there again  I will sleep on a park bench in hell before I stay at this horribly appointed and smoke filled pit My non smoking room smelled like a bar  It was smokey and beer riddled  The staff was unprofessional and inept  The only good thing I have to say about this place was there was a really sweet cat that hung out in the lobby  
N => Love this place  
N => Stale smoke makes Chelsea Pines Inn lose its appeal  
N => Inn the middle of everything  
N => B  B from hell      
N => They call it an Inn  
N => ottimo hotel in posizione fantastica  
N => Great hotel but staff gives out incorrect info We stayed here for the nd time and will definitly stay here again  We liked it the st time and liked it just the same the nd time  You cant beat the price for this no frills hotel in a great location However a female staff member with a European accent tried to con us into taking a hired car back to JFK airport  Upon checking out she asked us if we want her to hire us a car for  plus tolls to JFK for later that evening  We were unsure and asked her if we could take a taxi for cheaper instead  She said that taxis dont have flat rates to JFK and its better to hire a car  So we did  But then when we were out for the day we asked several cabbies if theres flat rate to JFK and they all said yes  Not to mention its posted on most cabs that its a  flat rate to JFK plus tolls  So we called the hotel to cancel our car so that we could take a cab instead  We think she tried to con us into hiring a car from her quotfriendsquot company  We did not appreciate her sneaky business of trying to con money out of us for her friend  So if any of the staff there try to tell you that cabs only do fixed price fares TO Manhattan and not OUT of Manhattan dont believe them cuz its not true 
N =>  thumbs up Very Affordable  Great location  My husband and I were looking for a ent hotel right in the middle of it all without having to pay a ton considering we werent going to be in the hotel very much and we stayed an entire week which can be very expensive  This place was perfect it was so cheap about  night without looking and feeling cheap  The room we stayed in was very clean up to date comfortable and quiet  The front desk was quick to check us in and helpful when we had questions  We spent very little time in our room but it was perfect  We felt safe and really have no complaints about the place  Right outside just across the street is an entrance to the subway very convenient  Highly recommend if you dont want to spend a lot on a hotel  
N => Perfect Location My sister in law wanted to go to NY I had been a few times before and I thought it was perfect I planned the trip first by going to TripAdvisor as I had enjoyed hearing what others thought about a hotel an exhibit or a show in a specific city  We searched hotels knowing quotroughlyquot what we were willing to spend without having to share a bathroom or go to a full hostel  We were not adverse to sharing a bathroom as along as we knew our belongings were safe  Pretty much we did not want to spend too much on a hotel which we would not spend that much time in for our trip   imagine that  We weighed the options on cost for at least   weeks then finally due to availability ided on the Chelsea Savoy  In all fairness we would have spent more if we waited longer to weigh the options  From the other hotels we looked at both from TripAdvisor and via their own website and calling we got our hotel  When I booked the hotel I said to my sister in law it might just be quotit is what it isquot since there were some not so great reviews via TripAdvisor but my thought was not everyone is the same and their plans might have wanted more from the beginning  She was fine with that  We landed at LGA and proceeded to Super Shuttle as that was what we thought cheaper than getting a cab we learned going back to LGA  The Super Shuttle driver was super quite until we being the last drop off were the last fare in the Shuttle  He was AWESOME Totally took us through Time Square during a very busy time Prefect to see everything at a late night   Super Shuttle Set fare so we were ok with the sight seeing  It was perfect for our evening coming to the hotel  We got to our hotel which our SS driver brought our bags to the FRONT DESK Not the door  and checked in with two very polite gentlemen  I stated that our return flight was leaving later in the day of our check out  which they said quotwe can check your bag for free until you come back if you would likequot  Very nice to know without having to ask  They gave us our keys and we were on our way  Over our stay I asked for  things   More towels as I used my sister in laws set because I have a lot of hair   The extra towels came in about  minutes after asking and   I ran out of shampoo OMG the front desk was awesome we were coming back from a night out on the town and once we got back to our room it was about  or so minutes and they sent up about   shampoos amp conditioners for me  I was happy  The day of our departure we had wanted to do quotlast minutesquot which we did and ended up rushing to LGA  We found a cab driver Central Park about pm who made a point of reminding us of the shift change around pm so we kept the same cab from Central Park to our hotel to LGA  Bit of a rush checkout  Cab outside on the meter I run inside to get our luggage  When we checked out morning of that day we gave Chelsea Savoy Hotel our luggage to keep for about  hours at no charge I just tipped the guy as he was super fast   less that  minutes  That made me happy as we were on the meter and people were waiting  We got to LGA and back home and I made a point of making my story know as Chelsea Savoy Hotel was just fine  The price was perfect we had our own room and bath and the staff was the staff  If you want someone to cater to your every need   dont bother   but if you want to conserve you money and have a great stay with a hotel that gives you what a hotel is to do   A room   then stay here  Oh and the Chelsea Papaya is less than  feet away 
N => Horrible Service but Great Location Ill start off by saying the Chelsea Savoy is in a great location and was completely convenient for our walk to FIT  It also is close to the subway stations and has ent little shops and restaurants around it  However the customer service was absolutely horrible Ive never felt so UNWELCOME in a hotel  The staff never greets you when you walk in and when we approached the front desk to ask questions we even received dirty looks and this was before they knew what our question was It didnt matter what crew was working either they were all rude Our room keys got deactivated multiple times and in order to activate one they must give you a whole other set of keys very frustrating when youre in a hurry  One big aspect that added to this was when we first arrived it was too early to get in our room so we checked our luggage and ventured off  When we came back the staff member brought down the cart filled with our luggage and left it there for us to take up ourselves Mind you we are  younger women left with over  pounds of luggage to take up to the rooms  We are very capable of doing it but Ive never been to a night hotel that has left this task for the guests to finish To sum up the location was convenient for this particular trip but the service has helped me ide that I will never book the Chelsea Savoy again 
N => This place RIPS YOU OFF I bookedreserved my room  month in advance and was quoted a rate of   When I arrived They were charging me  When I complained that that was not the rate I was quoted ONE MONTH BEFORE WHEN I RESERVED  A woman that should be fired and who said she is the ONLY one who takes reservations   said quotyou dont have a reservation   oh wait   you booked it yesterday   oh wait you did book it one month in advance but I did not take that reservation and so it is the rate I am telling you  You want to stay somewhere else   fine be my guestquot When I asked to speak to a Manager I was told quotThere are no managersquot  I am not making this stuff up So   If you dont mind a staff that could care less that you live or die and is willing to steal your money  You should stay here Dont believe me Read a few of the other reviews here Since there seems to be nothing else I can do about this I guess I am trying to do what I can to let others know  
N => Great Value After reading other reviews we had some concerns but we had a great time  Not the Hilton but a great value for travelers who want to spend travel budget monies on something besides the room  The room was clean seemed recently remodeled bathroom was beautiful  Complimentary soaps shampoo etc which I did not expect for the price  Complimentary continental breakfast was not much but saved us time and money  Location was great on the same corner as subway stop and only a   cab ride back from Times Square  Probably walking distance to Times Square for those who like to walk  Front desk staff was friendly and had our reservation at the quoted price no suprizes  They were unable to extend check out but did not kick us out when we were still packing at official check out time  Definately will recommend  
N => Nothing Fancy But Very Clean  This was my first trip to New York and I was not sure what to expect  Turns out I love New York and the Chelsea Savoy is actually a great hotel I went with  friends and we looked at MANY hotels online trying to ide which to pick  The hotel was so reasonably priced compared to others I thought there had to be something wrong and wed find out it was actually a really scarey place when we got there  I am happy to report our experience was really good  The room was    The hotel is not fancy at all but it was clean and our room had space to spare with  double beds and one fold away bed we had asked for  The bathroom was a good size and had lots of counter space  The closet also was a good size and had a safe in it  The room did seem to have an odor of some kind    Like a new carpet smell   but we had no problems with it Each morning we had newspapers outside our door and the coffee and pastry found in the lobby were nice to have when getting ready to face the day The staff were friendly and efficient  They held our luggage after our checkout on the last day until we were ready to go to the airport I know Ill be back to New York and I know Ill stay at this hotel again  
N => Cheap ent but not without problems When I stayed most other hotels nearby were booked so I was happy to find a hotel for around  a night  I stay in NYC almost every month so I know it can be hard to find a good hotel for that price and I wasnt expecting too much  I had read previous reviews talking about a strong smell but they were from ey so I figured by ust the smell would be gone The room was basic and clean and actually quite spacious by NY standards  I think the ceilings are higher than normal too  No flat screen tv just a regular one but I dont come to NY to watch TV The main problem was that the room smelled like it was freshly painted  It was STRONG On top of that there were flies in the room presumably because they had the window open to air it out but the screen had a hole in it so flies came in  I have almost no sense of smell so it didnt bother me that much but my friend is very sensitive to things like that and kept having to go downstairs every hour or so to quotair out quot We asked down at the desk and the woman there said it hadnt been painted recently  Later after a shift change we asked the guy at the desk and he said it HAD been painted  He said we could switch rooms the next night but would have to switch back for the night after that   not worth the hassle so we stayed put left the window open with a magazine covering the hole  What sucks is that the Chelsea Savoy could be an awesome hotel instead of just average with just a little more attention to detail  Its in a great location just doors down from the famous Chelsea Hotel and its within walking distance of tons of restaurants  I would stay there again  Its a good value for the money just watch out for the paint smell  Hopefully it will be aired out by the time you have to stay there 
N => Watch out for EXTRA CHARGES I planned a nice getaway for my boyfriend and I for ust nd and we arrived to only find that we had no reservations for the night  They redirected us to the other Chelsea Hotel down the street  We ided to go back to the Chelsea Savoy Hotel to ask again if the reservations were there and they claimed that none were to be found under my name  So we ided to stay the night  The rooms are not a bargain for the price you pay  They are very casual and low class for a New York City stay  A month later after receiving my credit card statement I had found that they charged another  dollars for a stay for the next night  When calling them I found that we DID have reservations but for the next day which we failed to cancel because they said that our reservations never existed  As a very disatisfied customer I wanted to know if any compensations could be made  Monica who claimed to be the manager blamed the whole situation on us  After retelling my dilemma again and again she finally said that Debbie I guess the rightful manager was to return on the th she could perhaps make some arrangements  I think that this is truly an unfair trade for what turned out to be an unromantic night in a cheap hotel  If you are to stay here watch out for their ways with money  They are not on your side  
N => Hilton Prices Motel  treatment  Hello everyone  Im not writing to trash this hotel however I must tell the truth  I called to inquire on a room with a queen sized bed and I was quoted night  Upon checking into the hotel I was charged night and since I had no written proof of the original phone quote my fault hotel management would not budge  My partner and I both thought the room was clean however the overcharging tainted our view of the overall experience If youre going to stay here make sure you get an email or fax confirming the rate youre given on the phone p s  the free continental breakfast consists of day old muffins and dried out bagels  My partner took one sip of the coffee and threw the rest of the cup out  
N => Couldnt Recover from Problems Weve stayed at the Chelsea Savoy three times prior to our stay in y of  and it always worked fine  Its a clean safe ent sized room hotel in Chelsea  This time we booked the room for a non smoking king at  a night  Thats a great price for NYC and especially in a good location However upon getting to the room we started having problems  As other travelers have noted theyve recently changed the carpet and the smell is not at all subtle at least on the nd floor its not  You do get used to the smell but it smells none the less  And for those with a good sense of smell it would likely be almost too strong to deal with  The next issue we had was that our air conditioner didnt work  They sent the maintenance guy up to look at it  All he did was dial the temp down to deg and say it was quotWork OK quot Nevermind the error code that was flashing on the display or that deg is too cold to tolerate  They couldnt move us because there were no other rooms in the hotel  Finally the staff just didnt care   at all  Yes I realize its New York and were not paying for a  star hotel but they could at least show some shred of empathy or apologize but nope SO after all this were done with the Savoy  IF you get a room that has no problems and isnt right on the corner of rd and th then youll be a lucky guest  But if your room stinks or has an issue youll realize its time to check out somewhere else   Good luck 
N => clean  Flew to New York on a whim without hotel reservations  Remembered seeing this hotel on line luckily they had a room available  We couldnt have been happier for what we paid  The hotel has recently installed new carpeting was very clean amp the location was very convinient  After calling several hotels amp getting quoted over   we felt lucky to have found this one for    They also offer a contiental breakfast  Would definately stay here again  
N => nasty gross unhelpful staff terrible experience    for one night    checked in late went straight to bed woke up went to use restroom found used CONDOM left in bathroom would not do anything to compensate no manager to help not helpful at all tryed using website to reach someone website not good after further looking around found hairs in bed and they were not mine have photos as proof but wont post  BEWARE 
N => Not worth the money Greeting staff not friendly at all  The hardest beds EVER  The worst Air Conditioning system EVER  Smell from carpet be new overwhelming  The bathrooms are designed horribly  Even the receptionon the TV leaves a lot to be desired  No room service or bar  HUGELY overpriced for what you get  
N => Just what we were looking for My best friend amp I stayed at this hotel from   to    We were looking for somewhere clean amp not so expensive  Chelsea Savoy was great Rooms were clean altho be there isnt much life left in the mattresses  They have used toppers to cushion them amp they were comfy enuff to get a ent sleep  rolms arent huge but hey we were just sleeping there amp spending all day out amp about so who caresLocation was great On the corner of Wrd amp th with a great choice of places to have breakfast lunch or dinner  check out the Malibu   amp tell sweetie we said hi Pharmacy amp laundry all just a couple mins on foot   subway line is  paces away from the front door or walk along rd for all of  mins to get to other lines  Youll be in Times Sq in just a few mins   its only abt  stops  If u want amp feel energetic enuff walk east along rd amp then up th or Broadway  Youll walk past the flat iron amp parks amp things  Were both in our s amp not what youd call fit but we kept a nice pace amp walked all the way to the Empire State without needing to stop for a reviverThe neighborhood around the hotel felt safe enuff altho it always pays to have eyes in the back of your head amp be sensible Id certainly stay there again  I reckon its good value for money compared to other places nearer Times Sq etcStaff could do with a little more personality but then I didnt need to deal with them other than to check in amp out  This hotel should be on your short list for sure 
N => Wonderful suprise This was a girls shopping eating theatre and tourist trip  There were four of us and we all wanted to stay in the same room  Had a great deal of difficulty finding a room in NYC to accomidate all of us without spending a kings ransom  The Chelsea Savoy was the answer The room was clean well air conditioned and very comfortable  The location was convenient to all parts of the city  Plan on staying there again  
N => Ideal location Easy access to the subway plus being able to walk to many sites make the Chelsea Savoy an ideal place for any first timer visiting New York  The only suggestion I have is to change the shower head  The bathroom was very nice well appointed but the shower head did not spray well  Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would be happy to stay there again  
N => No frills but okay We stayed in this hotel as part of a round the world trip with our two children  and  in ember  We chose the hotel as part of a theatre ticket package but were also looking for something which was central comfortable and inexpensive  The location is good next to the subway  Our stay was quite pleasant we had a quiet though fairly bland room and all in all we had no major complaints  We probably wouldnt have stayed here but for the theatre package though and whereas I would be happy enough to stay here again I think there are probably other hotels in Manhattan which would have met our criteria to a higher degree  
N => A Pleasant Surprise  
N => This hotel sucks but it doent have to  
N => Shhhhh Dont tell anyone about this hotel  
N => Convenient locationclean rooms  
N => the staff could not have been less helpful we forgot our wallet back home in toronto but had plenty of cash and no credit cards on us  When we arrived to the hotel the manager at the front desk told us that we need a credit card and that he could not bend the rules for us  After pleading with him for ten minutes he said he will see what he can do and went to the back to make a call  When he left the other girl working at the front desk said that this happens all the time and she does not think that it will be a problem  Shortly after the manager comes out and says that he could not do anything for us  By than it was getting very late and we were very tired  to make a long story short our family back home had to come to our rescue and the staff were not accomodating at all  I would never stay there again and deff not recommend it to anyone 
N => Why stay here   there are so many other  star hotels in NYC This is a  star service and sized hotel trying to maintain a  star image   it just doesnt hang together  The Frontdesk check in staff were amazing   but then it slowing but consistantly fell apart from there  There were issues with the plumbing in the room as confirmed by the engineer the first night   but apparently the day manager new more about hot and cold water than I  I was to stay  nights   but left after  would have stayed only  but was too tired to move on the late evening of the nd dayDay Manager who also seemed to double as the doorman was rude   and ultimately why I left the hotel  Capitalism is great   and judging by the recent reviews I would say City Club now has a real problem on their hands  I have stayed at Jeff Kleins the owner hotel in West Hollywood the Sunset Tower   its amazing   but skip City Club it just not worth it  
N => Whats not to like I stayed at City Club in ust with some colleagues for a two day meeting  Honestly I travel alot for work  Im in hotels more than I am at home  So natrually Im not easily impressed  I have to admit I was very impressed with City Club  The staff was great  helpful upbeat nice and honest about where to go  The room was a nice size  I was in the front not where I usually like to stay because of noise  The room was bright and the bed was really comfortable  It wasnt noisy as expected    Great shower   Housekeeping did a great job and turndown was a treat  freshly baked chocolate chip cookies I got free passes to the gym which isnt in the hotel but on the same block  The internet was fast  the location was good but I prefer to be further downtown  Room service was prompt  Will stay again if my meetings bring me to midtown  
N => Disappointing  Location   central Reception   lots of attitude from most of the staff like we are a BOUTIQUE hotel Said and did the right things with our issues and concerns but with just enough willingness to pass for acceptable Room   well appointed  Dark colors and poor lighting   my wife had difficulty putting on her makeup  The bed was no good  We changed rooms on night  but this was no better  We ended up sleeping on the couchFitness Center   you have to pay  per day to utilize it    not sure that the site disclosed this at booking time I was not about to pay for the fitness club after it was listed as an amenity  Another let down 
N => Fantastic Hotel in a Perfect Location One of the few places a family of five can stay  It was so clean amp the room was large for NYC The service was great Everyone was friendly amp so helpful I would highly recommend staying here I actually already have to some familygt 
N => horrible experience we wont be back This hotel was absolutely terrible We were there for a one night stay over Valentines day  I had never been to NYC so I was very excited for our stay  When we got to our queen luxe room I was extremely disappointed  My fianc  opened the window shades and we had a huge brick wall for a view  Then we noticed that there wasnt even a TV in the room even though they say that there are quotpremium channels in all guest rooms including HBOquot and they offer a DVD library to choose from  However there was a DVD player in our closet I dont know what we were supposed to watch it on  Anyway the lack of TV didnt really matter that much to us since we were only there one night and werent in the room much It was very hard to sleep that night  You could hear every noise in the hall and other peoples rooms and the cover to the heating unit kept falling off of the wall Then to top off the experience I notice that my credit card had an extra charge of   on it  I called to the hotel and they told me it was for a bag of potato chips a small bottle of spirits and a half a bottle of red wine  I explained to Emanuel that we had never even touched the mini bar  I guess he thought that we ate chips and drank while watching a nonexistent TV and staring at the brick wall  So overall the experience was awful and they tried to rip us off too 
N => What a great experience I booked this place mainly based on location Its off the beaten path of Times Square but still walking distance Wanted a nice place to help celebrate a dear friends birthday I arrived early and was checked in dropped my stuff off  Room wasnt ready  So we went and brunched and were called as soon as a room was available Upon getting into the room the room was small  But it was so well laid out it didnt seem small in the least  What a most effiicient use of space The upscale bathroom amenties had my friend and I quotfightingquot over them  But since its his birthday he got them Between shows we were greeted by some amazing tasty cookies waiting for us in the room After the nd Broadway show we saw went back to the room to freshenup and hit the clubs  But the combination of walking around and the comfy comfy bed we called it a night Shame but next time I come back I am definfately staying a longer time 
N => In the middle of a battle field After my terrible stay at this hotel I wanted to check out the reviews about this hotel written by other users and I was really surprised about how others had good experiences  How could that be possibleI was in NYC for two days for business and had rather busy schedule  I stayed at City Club for two nights  Not being able to sleep all night on either night ruined my trip At first I was impressed by the design of the hotel  My room   was stylish and clean  The real story started after mid night when the huge AC noise from the next building woke me up  At  AM I thought if I got really tired I should be able to go to sleep despite the noise  However I wasnt able to go to sleep by  AM  So I called the front desk to ask him to check if the windows were open because the AC noise was huge  He stopped by to check the windows  They were all closed  So he switched me to another room on the th floor     It was a very warm room  There was also the similar kind of AC noise although not as loud as in the previous room  I figured I must turn on the room AC to cool down the air which would create more noise Therefore I stopped by the front desk to ask them to switch me to another room  They switched me to room   that faced the front street at  AM  I was able to go to sleep despite the growing traffic noise because it was not nearly as bad as the AC noise Then I expected the second night to be relatively peaceful  However I was completely wrongAt  AM a working truck stopped in front of the building with engines running and people talking for at least half an hour  It felt like a construction project going on  After the crew left I felt relieved because I wouldnt have expected another construction project coming back on one night At  AM another working truck stopped in front of the building with engines running and people talking I called the front desk and asked why there were so many construction projects going on in the middle of the night  The front desk told me they were garbage trucks collecting garbage  The one that showed up at  AM was to collect trash from the hotel right across the street  The one that showed up at  AM was to collect trash from this hotel Reason for my not knowing this the night before was that I moved to this room at  AM after struggling all night the night beforeIn sumy if you are able to sleep in a battle field  for instance if you were a soldier in Iraq and get used to sleeping during the wars this hotel is for you  However if you are as sensitive a human being as myself youd better off stay away from this hotel 
N => Good and bad points overall could be better   Just returned after a two night stay at this hotel  We had the Duplex suite which was pretty cool and unique with the HUGE ceiling to floor window covering two floors the beautiful ceilings and a great bathroom What was strange and annoying about this room was the heating The heater ventilator was very very loud and there was no way to turn it down  just off  That meant that the lower level of the Duplex was freezing but the upper level was usually extremely warm The entertainment systems in the room were perfectly functional but worn and outdated The service at the hotel was fairly good staff very helpful amp willing The bistro next door had a nice breakfast worth checking out Overall it was a fairly good stay but the hotel could use some refurbishing and attention to detail  
N => Private Classy Intimate Great Service My experience started with my reservation which I made via the phone the reservationist allowed me to use a web rate which was accommodating  I arrived  hours before check in to find out that my upgraded room was ready  From a petite to a Queen Luxe  Room size was fine especially for nyc  The bathroom was a treat  Lots of mirrors but not tacky  Only complaint was that the lighting could have been better for make up application  Excellent bath amenities Hermes shampoo amp conditioner and CO Bigelow soaps and lotion  Shower was fabulous  Bed was very comfortable  iPod docking stationclock didnt work but that was remedied within  minutes  CdDvd library is a nice feature but not a great selection and almost everything I wanted was out of stock it seemed like they did not have duplicates  The best part of my stay was the service  I was greeted by every staff member I passed  I work in a hotel in guest services so Im very picky about this aspect of my stay  Everything I needed or asked for was taken care of promptly  Entire feel of the hotel was intimate and cozy and a nice respite from the pace of Manhatten  Great Location too 
N => A New Years To Remember My partner was eager to spend New Years Eve in New York and I reluctantly agreed  All I could picture were crowds noise and tacky quotquot sunglasses  We made our reservation a few weeks prior and got a reasonable rate  The Hotel is close to Times Square but we ided to brave it and drive in  Surprisingly enough I recieved a phone call from an employee at City Club two days prior to our arrival informing us of the street closures in and around Times Square  She was very pleasant suggesting that if we were driving to leave early  not something I would expect from a NYC quotboutiquequot hotel  She even offered directions from New Jersey by train if we ided against taking the car I must admit this was a nice gesture  We arrived at City Club and were greeted by the bellman at the curb  The check in was quick and the staff offered assistance with dinner reservations and some suggestions on what was going on around town  We had already had made reservations so lined their assistance  before we knew it we were upstairs in our room  which was wonderfully appointed clean and comfortable in size  The water pressure in the shower was amazing  the beds very comfortable and the service impressive  I felt like I was part of the family right away Though our dinner reservations were not the best choice for us be we shouldve taken the offer for help at check in our stay at City Club was great Ive already recommended it to my friends and will stay again  And the best part was we didnt even feel like we were near Times Square 
N => really disappointing hotel We stayed for just three nights and was so glad it was only three The place was dark and dingy   no hermes bath products or frette linens to be seen  We had to wait over an hour for our room on arrival and there is really nowhere comfortable to sit and we then found that there were no twin beds and they really did nothing to sort ouf this situation and we ended up in a tiny room despite them saying they would do something the next day nothing happened  On the last morning the hot water went wrong and we had to wait over an hour for a shower  Absolutely terrible  The only good thing is the location  
N => Booking problems and poor staff training at the City Club Problems started early with our booking at the City Club  My wife tried to book online for our stay for two nights in a Queen Luxe  She called to book the rate available from the website but was told that the rate is only available for booking via the Internet otherwise its was a hundred dollars more in total  At her request I visited the website to make a reservation  However to my surprise the website was not secured read encrypted so that my credit card number was going over the open internet  I called the hotel again and they told me that they didnt have encryption on their website see the padlock in the bottom of the browser window  I asked the reservationist to take my booking over the telephone but she refused to give me the lower rate  
N => Nice Small Package We enjoyed our stay at The City Club Hotel during our last visit  However we found that the rooms were very small the air condition was rather noisy and it could do with brighter lightings  Just a word of reminder for those who are planning to made reservations to ensure that you have a print out of their confirmation with the description of the room  We were promised a room with a day bed but upon arrival we were assigned a room without the said day bed  Upon entering I immediately noticed the noisy air con and the missing day bed  The receptionist was kind enough to reassign another room according to the description on my confirmation after I raised my concerns  The new room was obviously bigger but still small and the aircon is a little quiter but still not the silent type that I would expect from a hotel of this grade Aside from the Hermes amenities the bath room was surprisingly spacious  
N => Noisy Design Lousy Front Desk Staff I checked into the room and immediately questioned whether the room was the one I reserved and was paying for  I had to show the bellman all of whom were very nice a printed reservation to convince him it was the wrong room  So I was put into another room only to have another guest try to enter the room a little while later as the front desk assigned him the same room The toilet was not working when I arrived  I removed the top and reconnected it which made it work although the flusher was pretty much hanging from a thread the whole time  I didnt tell the desk about this until I checked out since I had already been through the rigaole at the beginning  I was supposed to have  free breakfasts with my  room nights but I wasnt told anything about this upon check in  I had to ask the front desk clerk about it later and after some checking he realized I was correct  He said I would have to try to convince the restaurant host not to charge my room for the breakfasts because they werent used to not charging the room  Despite my trying to convince the restaurant staff not to put the breakfasts on the bill they did and I had to work that out again with the front desk staff when I checked out  Oh also there wasnt even a breakfast available on the third morning as the kitchen was closed  I mentioned all of this to the front desk staff upon checking out and they did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation aside from removing the two breakfasts from the bill  There wasnt even any refunding for the lost breakfast Lastly the hotel has some fundamental design problems in terms of noise mitigation  The hotel is dormitory like in terms of the way sound carries  That is due to the fact that there are no carpets anywhere or other sound abatement tools and also because the doors all slam very loudly  This  not apply to the suites as the rooms are probably set back from the hall but for most of the very small rooms the beds are not far from the loud hallway so if you are anything but a very very deep sleeper you will hear late night folks in the hall and returning to their rooms In short the trendy design and friendly bellmen could not make up for an otherwise poor experience and the front desk did not seem too concerned  
N => A Real Dump This hotel bills itself as a timelessly elegant boutique hotel  In reality it is a poorly cared for badly maintained property NEGATIVES  The hotel has a very quotcheapquot feel to it   Ridiculously small rooms even by New York standards   Dirty stained carpeting   Lumpy bed which felt  years old   quotCorkquot walls and flooring which are actually rubber stick on quottilesquot    same as you buy at hime depot for    I saw these tiles peeling off in my room and elsewhere in the hotel   View from room was basically an alleybrick wall   No central ac  Lousey noisey window unit hanging out over dirty alley    Halls dark and unfinished areas covered by black hanging cloth   Tries to evoke a tendy look but actually looks more like what you would see in a high school gym for a Halloween carnival   Price   per night  Just outrageous for this crappy little hotel with small dank rooms   Had to stand on bed to get into quotclosetquot POSITIVES Not many  ent bathroom with good Hermes toiletries   Location  Free internet access   Good on site restaurant  
N => Early check in   late check out FantasticLoved this hotel  More inclined to stay in Greenwich Soho etc when in New York but needed to be midtown for a night last week They were extremely helpful   allowing me to check in very early and allowing late checkout next day  Hotel was gorgeous room spacious we were upgraded from queen to king size  Beautiful large bath room with window  Very large comfortable bed Booked on lastminute for a reasonable enough price by New york standards Front of house were extremely professional and helpful 
N => okay but some problems We were not impressed with the hotel  Common areas needed to be refreshed  The entrance to the hotel and the hallways hold an unpleasant scent from the street where there is currently a good deal of construction which creates dirt grime and odors I would imagine this hotel was quite nice when Mr  Klein opened it in  We wish we had visited when it was quotnewquot Our room on the second floor was tiny but clean  The or is tailored and chic however there is evidence of wear and tear which should be addressed  We would not go back  
N => Ok not great Location is good if you want midtown west but busy block amp construction across street  King rooms facing front are ent size but there are no dressers and very tiny closets  Linens ok but bed uncomfortable  Good shower amp toiletries but smallish bathroom dark walls amp floor so lighting not great for women amp no tub  Hotel itself small amp quiet  No lobby to speak of so no where to sit or have guests sit if they arewaiting for you  Front desk personnel so so  Tried to charge us more money for rd night of stay than contracted for   luckily we had our confirmation from booking service Was initially put in room on floor    asked for room on higher floor   was told there were none  Room on nd floor had about  inches of hanging closet space amp it was front to back not side to side amp bar was over mini fridge so no room to hang anything long  Also no drawers or dresser in room Told front desk this was ridiculous   that we were  people in NYC for  days amp needed more space to unpack amp put away our clothes  We were going to go to another hotel as this was completely unacceptable Miraculously a room on Floor  became available and it had a ent size closet with a built in dresser and some shelves which made it manageable Allowed early check inlate check out which was nice  Usually stay at The Benjamin but wanted to be more quotWestquot this trip  Will go back to The Benjamin next visit  
N => much ado about nothing Tried  different rooms both with peeling wallpapertiny closets and no storage space  Larger rooms at back looked on to a brick wall small rooms in front had  tiny window and street noise Stylish or needed to hide the serious shortcomings in amenitiessizeconditionattitude I moved to the Muse less moneylarger rooms better condition ent storage     
N => Not as good as expected Have stayed in NY many times and these are the smallest rooms anywhere Staff were not particularly helpful and had the usual trendy boutique attitude  Rooms were stylish but not comfortable  Annoyed by things like not being able to switch on a reading light on one side of the bed but not the other   we both had to be awake or neither of us  
N => My favorite hotel in NY  
N => Would not be my first choice  
N => Ok but just ok  
N => Hmmm good but could improve  
N => These reviews are great I never write reviews but feel compelled because I read the reviews on this site and they were so helpful  I had a great experience  My room was one of the more noisier ones I was told but I slept fine without a problem  The room was clean and bed was better than most hotel beds soft pillows bathroom immaculate and location    awesome  blocks from Ferraros   yummy  Rooms a bit small but big enough for me View not so good but so what  Hope this helps you ide I totally thought it was worth it  Location East village on the right Soho all around what more can you want  
N => Perfect o We were taking our dhter to NY for her th birthday and wanted to get a feel of living in a big city  Solita Soho was a perfect choice Short walk  blocks to   train taking you straight to Grand Central Station walking distance to Little Italybut dont eat there   better Italian food anywhere else and Chinatown  After reading some of the negative reviews I must admit I was skeptical  Once we arrived I was thrilled We were on the th floor with a great view  We could actually see the tip of the Empire State Bldg  The staff was very pleasant and overly helpful  Room was small but fine even for four of us Who wants to be in the room anyway To all the women who didnt have a vanity room to hang of lay out there clothes Get a Life Needless to say my dhters th birthday trip was a huge success which she will always remember and cherish 
N => Painful and Itchy A friend and i checked into the Solita Soho on ember    We traveled there from California to celebrate the New Year  On the morning of our second day i noticed what i thought were mosquito bites on my arms and abdomen and i dismissed it as such  Later that evening i mentioned the bites to my companion and she told me she had the same thing  To my knowledge i have never been bitten by a bedbug so the thought of being bitten by one never crossed my mind until she told me about her bites After my conversation with her i told the desk clerk that i thought our room had bedbugs  He kind of dismissed it saying they would have the room swept the next day our departure day  Upon checking out the desk clerk gave me the name and number of the hotel manager Mr  Hakim and aked me to call him the following day After returning home i called the hotel and asked for Mr  Hakim  I was told he was out of the building and would return soon  I left my name and telephone number with the person answering the phone and asked that he call me when he returned  When i did not hear from him i telephoned the hotel again  This time i was told Mr  Hakim was ill and did not return to the hotel the previous day  I left a second message asking that he call me  To this day he has not called me backIn the meantime i went to Choice Hotels web site and left an email regarding my experience at the hotel  I wrote that i simply wanted the manager to return my call to listen to my concern  My guess is my email was sent to Mr Hakim because i received an email not a phone call from him  The email was an apology and it stated the hotel would refund   of my last nights room rate roughly  dollars I sent an email back to Mr  Hakim asking that he call me and telling him i thought his offer was unacceptableAfter returning home i went to a dor because the bites on my body were extremely uncomfortable and the skin around the bite sites was dying and peeling off  Upon seeing the bites the dor said he knew they were made by bedbugs After returning home i mentioned my experience to a co worker  He provided me with an article written in ember  describing the bedbug problem on the east coast as near epidemic  I have never written a review of a hotel or any other business in my life and i probably would have never written this one had i received a call from someone in charge at the hotel willing to listen to my concerns  Instead i was dismissed and ignoredBedbugs are disgusting littled creatures  I dont know if my reaction to their bites is common  It is now uary th and i still have evidence of the bites on my skin  The thing that concerns me the most is they could have gotten into my suitcase or other clothing and i could have transported them home  They can live up to a year without feeding  Once you have them in your house they are extremely difficult to get rid of I wanted soemone at the hotel to be responsive to my concerns they were not This was my second stay at the Solita Soho and it is safe to say there will not be a rd visit  In the past i have recommended that hotel to my friends this wont happen again either 
N => great staff but too noisy I am a private travel consultant who mystery shop for a major retailer  I recently had to stay one nignt at the Solita  Its location in Soho was one of the reason i choose this hotel  The room was small but comfortable  furnishing wasa typical hotel need upgrading  The bed was ok new mattresses needed  I stay in  and this room is located right above the night club thats in this hotel  It was a mistake to put a night club in the hotel I requested to move to a higher floor but none was available  The noise was unbearable went from PM to am the next morning  So if you book this hotel beware  The best part was the staff especially Emily and Lorelei who both went out of their way to help me  They turn an unpleasant stay to a pleasant one  
N => No hot water As a travel agent I have travel all oveer the world  Then i had the misfortune of staying at the Solita Soho Hotel recently  Upon check in the front desk agent seems preoccupied  I found out he was watching movies online So much for customer service  The room was not what they advertised  It was smaller than my walkin closet at home  The bed was lumpy  But the topper was that there was no hot water from the previous night The hot water did not come back until like AM the next morning  I was tired from my flight and I wanted to shower so bad that I couldnt  This situation is so pathetic  On top of all this the hotel have a night club on the ground floor and they must had one hell of a party because you could hear the music on the th floor all night long  So no shower and no sleep  When I complained at the front desk the next morning the agent just shrugged it off like its no big deal I ided to change hotel and and move down the block to the Holiday Inn Downtown where at least I had hot water and it was very quietI dare to say that I will not stay at this hotel again and I definitelywould not recommend this hotel to my clients  
N => Noise Nice comfortable room  Staff friendly enough  But the noise from the nightclub next door was incredible  Might recommend this hotel because of the good location and overall quality but you would want to get one of the top floors if you want to sleep before  am  
N => Location location location If youve stayed at hotels in Britain or Europe you know the rooms at this hotel are NOT small  Compact yes  Designed well yes  Besides youll only be in your room to sleep or change clothes  Very clean  Friendly and helpful desk clerks  Previous post recommends fifth floor or above we agree  We stayed on fifth still could hear the vibrations from the clubs music  Would not have wanted to be on third or second  Tremendous location  We walk and we could get to so many places in a half hour  Plus subway stops are nearby  Area is in transition meaning much construction but did not affect our stay  Plenty of places to eat on Spring and Broome Streets nearby also a Dean and DeLucas six or seven blocks away to buy fruit snacks sandwiches water  We will return to this hotel  
N => Make sure you dont get a room over the nightclub I had heard really great things about this hotel and some were true  The rooms were nice even though small the staff was amazing The only problem the nightclub the noise level was horrible even with earplugs They really need to invest in sound proofing  If ever you stay over for a weekend make sure to insist on being placed in a room as far away from the club as possible  After  sleepless nights I was ready and anxious to leave  
N => Not fitting for business travellers      I stayed at the Solita on  th I was booked in by my corporate travel dept while I was in the Big Apple attending corporate meetings  I found the hotel to be clean but the format was not to my liking  This has to be the narrowest of any hotel Ive ever been in  I stayed on the th floor and my room was barely larger than a suburban bedroom it felt more like a dorm room at college  It was roughly x clean but very basic no closet just a bureau sitting next to a small queen size bed which filled the room  The bathroom was small but clean  My window faced out to the brick wall of a neighboring building and there were construction noises permeating the windows from all around  My neighbors in adjacent rooms felt it necessary to talk in the hallway and party through the night so the doors were no barrier to the commotion that went on in the other  rooms on my floor  The hotel straddles Little Italy and Chinatown but the immediate area is devoid of all life and theres no activity  It was pretty scary at night walking around the surrounding neighborhood  All in all as a corporate business traveller I would not recommend this hotel to stay in  There are zero facilities and no amenities  I checked out the next morning and found another hotel in nearby Tribeca  
N => Front Desk Agents     We were checked into a dirty room when we notified the front desk her response was quotI was doing you a favor because ci isnt until pm   Because I was sharing a room I asked the Agent on duty that night    to add my name to the room  His response was quotwhy cant they just ask for herquot Well I work at a  star hotel myself and I was shocked at his response indeed because at first he told me point blank that he cant do it at all  Would I go back again  no  
N => Not worth it I have to agree the rooms are way too small and the manager is quite nasty  I have a billing problem where they charge me for an extra room seems to be a common problem and I have yet to resolve it  There are much better choices in NYC so definitely look for them  This hotel is not worth the money 
N => A ver y pleasant stay A small but clean and friendly hotel  Outstanding and courteus staff  Located in an area that is close to trains and major tourists attractions  Be sure that your taxi driver knows the area otherwise you will be given them driving directions  We will not hesitate to return to the Solita Soho each time that we fly to New York  
N => Not good    much worse opinion than other reviewers We just stayed at the Solita for three days  Our experience was poor  We were visiting family over Thanksgiving weekend  Ok the room was tiny just big enough to fit two full not queen beds    we knew that ahead of time  The closet sits in the room next to the desk taking up the small amount of remaining space  But I can deal with small    its NYC  And the room was clean also not a given in the city But they are trying to be something they are not  They have put in all these quottouchesquot that have the same style as actual nice hotels but with none of the substance or care  The fancy sink faucet hits your head as you try to wash your face  The faucet housing actually came unscrewed at first use    I screwed it in by hand  There were two shower heads but when anyone else in the building uses water that cheapo pressure balancing shower valve created this vibrating banging that woke me up and probably everyone else in the hotel you have to shut off the water and turn it on again to restore calm for a few moments  All the fixtures were akimbo  So all the touches with none of the actual care Maid service failed to leave soap on our second day we ran out or replace the toilet paper  OopsThe mattresses were nice and the linens and especially the pillows my hotel pet peeve were quite nice  However the duvet cover was so heavy that my wife and I  roasted  in the bed  There was no insulation on the windows and it was cold so cold drafts came in  The heating unit would come on loudly every half hour  So you were either freezing or roasting  So bottom line we got only interrupted sleep during our stay  So all the nice linens in the world dont make up for this  No attention to detail The lobby had the swanky lighting of boutique hotels except it was just a front desk and elevator  There were no valets bellhops or anything not even a reasonable place to park the car while unloading  The location is Chinatown    there is nothing within a block or two in any direction of interest  Its not a bad neighborhood but certainly not scenic  No drinks at the Solita    no bar no restaurant no room service no nothing  And nothing near really  The guy at the front desk couldnt even give me directions on where to park  Window dressing no substance We have stayed in a range of hotels from lousy that is with bugs   to really upscale  For an somewhat lower price a few years ago we stayed a few blocks west of Times Square in a cool hotel  The room was small and nothing special but the hotel lobby was a great place to relax and have a drink  And we did get a good nights sleep there  Not at the Solita And this place is no bargain  We paid after taxes  per night  Hell we stayed at the quotWquot in Union Square for our anniversary    that was a wildly better hotel in all respects and paid a little more than  per night for a huge room with all the amenities  Yes more but an order of magnitude better I really think you can do better than this hotel for the money and you can also get the same actual amenities elsewhere and be even a good nights rest at scores of other hotels  
N => Small but clean  
N => Could not ask for more  
N => Nettes Hotel  schlechtes Management  
N => Great location   not so great hotel Club Quarters is situated close to Wall Street and Ground Zero  We used to walk right up to Central Park nearly everyday which was tiring but you get to see parts of Tribeca and Soho that you wouldnt see normally Most Cab drivers didnt know where this hotel was which was a problem when trying to book a cab  Our cab for the airport never turned up and we had to flag one down on Wall Street There is just a lounge here no bar or restaurant Our room was tiny but clean and warm we got  inches of snow when we were there but our view was of a brick wallWas ok if you dont plan spending any time in the hotel but I wouldnt go back  
N => Nice for a single business traveler but not quite   star I bid on a hotel through Priceline com and wound up with this hotel  My friend and I were on a budget so I thought going through Pricline would save us money  We were in NYC to see some broadway shows and attend a talk show taping which is all located in BroadwayMid Town Manhattan  This hotel is located quite far away in the Finanical District  A cab ride from Grand Central to this hotel was anywhere between      I called before we arrived to request  doublequeen beds  They said because we paid through Priceline they were not sure they could accomodate us but would put a request in the system  I was pleasantly surprised when we got to the room to find  TWIN beds  The room was small like all the other reviews on here said  It had a TV built in desk wardrobe and a stand up shower it felt like a modern dorm room  The beds were very small but comfortable  The hotel only provided one pillow each and I had to go to the communal closet in the hallway to find another one  I thought the room was very clean which was my main concern  The staff was very accomodating and friendly  We asked where to get dinner and they directed us to Stone St which had restaurants lined up and down the street  I would recommend this hotel for a single business traveler but if your coming to the city for a leisure trip I would pay more money to stay closer to all the action in Mid Town  The money you save on this hotel goes out the window because your now paying for cab transportation back and fourth to everything  
N => The Best Experience We are from Northern California  Our trip to NYC was a once in a lifetime experience  Our stay at Club Quarters Downtown during the first two weeks of y of  exceeded all of our expectations by a large gin  It was simply fabulous  Even though we made our reservations through Priceline we were treated like royalty  They were able to meet all of our requests  We were especially moved by the hotel manager s personal gestures of providing us with a free room upgrade a free bottle of wine and a free bag of chocolate covered almonds upon our arrival  AmazingAll of the staff from the Guest Service Managers to the bellboy to the housekeeping personnel to the restaurant staff provided us with the finest customer service  One evening my wife and I were arated and she was out of our room without a key or her purse  She went into the bar and happened to sit next to the restaurant manager  After striking up a conversation she explained her situation  The manager gave her drinks on the house  OutstandingAfter reading reviews and viewing photos on tripadvisor com travel yahoo com and insiderpages com we had some concerns regarding out stay at Club Quarters Downtown  Not one of our concerns surfaced during our stay  RekableWe hope as many travelers as possible read this review and ide to stay at Club Quarters Downtown  They will not be disappointed indeed they will be thrilled  We  not be able to return to NYC but if we do we hope we can stay there again  
N => ok hotel awful staff Arrived at hotel from Europe  Check in is to be done through a computer  A hotel staff firmly said that had be done through the machine  My corporate visa premier was lined  and I was said quotguests are expected to have a valid international credit cardquot before I could hand any of three others I had  At breakfast no one was attending the door so I went to a table  Somebody told me without a greetings that I was to wait outside  There was then a mistake on my bill and I was firmly prompted to sign it and that they would fix it  I refused and asked to talk with the manager  The waiter refused  After wasting  minutes of my time they printed the correct bill  When leaving the automatic checkout did not work    I was never given any invoice that I needed for accounting  Stay away from this place unless you are ready to cope with bad service and rude people  
N => ent business hotel No frills place with small but clean rooms  They only have wireless in the rooms so youll need to go to the lobby if you dont have that  Unlimited free bottled water is nice  
N => Its hard to say something nice about the CQ    I wanted to like Club Quarters downtown especially because this hotel has an ideal location just steps from Wall Street the New York Stock Exchange and many of the other sites and amenities in Lower Manhattan Unfortunately I dont have a lot of positive feedback about my stay there  I was there as part of a two day conference nearby and its fair to say that I wont be back Why For starters the room was not properly cleaned upon my arrival  This includes the bathroom Secondly amenities in the hotel were lacking    such as a bottle opener Finally on the second day of my stay while I was away from the room in meetings one of the service staff took it upon themselves to take the gratuity I had left for cleaning from my room    without cleaning the room Needless to say I came back to my room to find the money gone but a room that hadnt been touched  After my complaint to the front desk a manager was dispatched to my room to explain why this happened apparently some cleaning staff will go into your room to check the air conditioning or turn up the blinds    and theyll take the money in advance but this didnt really add up for me When all is said and done staying at the Club Quarters was really a drag on my whole trip  
N => No curtains weak wireless used bedspread and cheap toiletries Before I left for New York I called Club Quarters to make sure they had my companys credit card info squared away which they did  By check in however somehow they had lost it  I had to hand over my personal credit card until they heard from my company  A rough check in but no big deal  Then I saw the room  It was high off the ground and away from my elevator so it was quiet as I had requested  It was pretty clean    a bit dusty but tidy But it lacked the comforts you feel you need after a day doing business  The window had only a valance and blinds making the room bright even at night  The bed had only two crappy pillows and the bedspread was the only blanket available  Most hotels give you a blanket under the bedspread since bedspreads arent changed as often  Toiletries include two cheap soaps some mouthwash and a tube of quotconditioningquot shampoo  The wireless internet service was down in the mornings and evenings  All in all its tidy clean and quiet but if youre sensitive to light harsh products and need to do some work for business I would say go somewhere else  
N => Vrey satisfied We spent two nights at this hotel in a double room on the third highest floor cant remember the number and were very satisfied From the fire exit plan our room appeared to be the smallest on our floor but was still far more spacious than I had expected given locationprice etc  Room and bathroom spotlessly clean as to be expected Bed very comfortable free water bottles next to the dispenser on each level useful as we were budget tourists and didnt acquire a taste for NY tap water whilst there  The extras in the closet next to the water were useful too irons and ironing boards pillows blankets coffee tea sewing kits etc  It was also good to have a proper hair dryer in the bathroom rather than the ones attached to the walls you sometimes get I was disappointed that the room only had a coffee machine and not a kettle   I drink tea and the machine wont give me the necessary boiling water   but I understand this to be standard in North America Free internet fantastic   one computer in the club room better than the other thoughStaff on the front desk were very useful in helping us book excursions give us information about transport etc  Cant be faulted The location was good for us as it was near a number of underground stations and was quiet we stayed over a weekend so the room wasnt disturbed from external noise  Unfortunately we could hear people when they talked outside the lifts which was somewhat annoying We didnt eat at the hotel as the restaurant timings didnt match our schedule Ifwhen we return to the city we will use this hotel again quite happily and have already recommended to friends that they do so as well  
N => Fantastic Stay for the PriceLocation I was in NYC last weekend on the way back to Kansas City a business trip in Boston  I had never stayed at a Club Quarters before and was not sure what to expect  Upon arriving the staff was very kind and I had no issues with check in  When I got to my room I was pleasantly surprised  Although small compared to other hotels the room was very nicely appointed and efficiently arranged Oddly enough the quotKingquot bed was actually two twin sized beds pushed together like they sometimes do in European hotels  Im not too picky when it comes to beds so I didnt mind but some people might not like that  My only other point of dissatisfaction was the fact that I did not receive my requested wake up call and therefore missed my flight after waking up   hour late  If I would have received that wake up call I would have rated the hotel perfectly  
N => Oh so tiny We stayed at the CQ in ober last year to meet up with some friends from Montana  Overall it was OK however the room we had was tiny but that said that was the only fault  The price was keen by NYC standards and the place was clean and well serviced  The staff were friendly and overall we had a good tiime  
N => Great hotel We stayed  night at the Club Quarters Downtown  We really enjoyed this hotel amp found it to be a great choice for NYC lodging We did have a difficult time finding the hotel as others have commented however there was construction amp  of the streets our mapquest directions had given us were completely closed  it seems that it wouldve been easy to find if those streets were open Parking we ended up finding for free on the street Cedar St just a block down from the hotel  We were there on a weekend amp there is no charge for parking during that time  The room was spacious in NYC standards amp super clean  The computerized hotel check in was fast amp easy  We used the complimentary hotel guest computer area to check into our flight with no problems  We got great use out of the free bottled water We didnt use the subway but a cab was only  each way to the villagechelsea area  We were also an easy trip back across brooklyn bridge amp up the LIE to LGA for departure   we were back at the airport in less than  min I got a great price on priceline so not sure if ill ever get such a good rate again   but id definitely recommend this hotel again 
N => Clean and with a good location My husband and I stayed at the Club Quarters Downtown NY for a few days since it was our first trip to New York  We checked a lot of Hotels online befor our trip and were shocked about the prices and when we read the reviews at Tripadvisor we were even more shocked how much money you have to pay for such fithy accomodations So we ided to book the Club Quarters since it had good reviews and the price seemed to be okay for a room with private bath Actually we really liked it  It was not above average not for that price but it was clean it was comfortable and had a good location  We were just a few steps away from Wallstreet Broadway and Ground Zero The check in was a bit strange though  They had an electronic system which didnt work So it was not possible for us to check us in ourselves  A staff member had to do the check in for us and was not too happy about it  But at least you dont have too much to do with the staff The restaurant in the hotel is the same  The food is okay and the breakfast is not too expensive If you go to New York and you dont want to waste too much money on accomodation but you dont want to stay too far away from the city Club Quarters is a good choice If we come back to NY we might stay there again 
N => Families traveling with children   BEWARE We pre purchased a room at the Club Quarters Downtown for  people   my wife myself and our children  However when we arrived at the room we found it to be small with only  queen sized bed   for all of us  When we advised management thinking it was merely a mistake we were told that there were no other rooms available to accommodate us  When asked how they would accommodate the number in our party management said they would provide a full sized rollaway  While not what I paid for and not what I would expect in a smaller than normal room we agreed to give it a shot  What arrived was not a full sized rollaway but a twin sized rollaway to sleep two children When we inquired about the full we were told that the twin was all that was available  Going to another hotel was not realistic as we had already pre paid for our room through Hotwire and finding a suitable replacement was not practical in downtown Manhattan at such short notice   Despite the size and lack of proper beds the hotel in general was well located for our needs and we found the rooms nicely appointed   appropriate for a three and a half stars  However I would say that service fell far short of that designation  For example   Housekeeping was far from adequate  Not only did the housekeeper fail to clean the room in any real sense shehe inexplicably failed to make up the twin quotbedquot every day  Further shehe never once provided us with the proper number of towels for the number of occupants  Each day we would have to ask the front desk for more    Prior to our departure we checked our bags at the hotel for the afternoon as our flight was not until evening  The morning staff was more than pleasant in assisting us but when we returned in the afternoon the staff was less than helpful  It took over  minutes to retrieve our bags and when we inquired about the delay we were told quotpeople dont realize we have over  rooms and so it often takes a while to retrieve the bags quot This comment only served to make us more angry about the accommodations we were given   with over  rooms one would assume that they could have adequately accommodated our party with the room type we reserved    But most importantly at no time during our stay did Club Quarters apologize for not adequately accommodating our pre paid reservation or do anything additional to attempt to accommodate us Essentially Club Quarters Downtown is a nice hotel in a great location with poor service and is apparently not suitable for parties greater than   FAMILIES BEWARE  
N => Fabulous Stay We planned our  day stay in the Club Quarters D T  after the research on this site  PriceQuality match very well  Its a business hotel but tastefully orated  Actually for NY standards the hotel was above average otherwise you have to pay double  We booked a standard room but upon arrival we asked if we could upgrade to a suite and paying for the extras on the last night of our trip as it was for us a romantic weekend NY  The friendly assistant told us the suite was available for the whole weekend and we could take it for all the  nights we were staying and all this for no extra costs  We were speechless but loved the deal  So we strongly recommend this hotel for their excellent serviceAdditional info see other guest reviews as they are all true    Location is fine as you need to travel with subway or taxi anyway to go places  
N => Great Place to Stay After doing much research as to the best place to stay during my weekend trip to NY Im happy to say the Club Quarters Downtown was a GREAT choice To begin with the front desk staff was very helpful amp courteous upon check in amp check out  Upon entering my room I was pleasantly surprised  Even though it was small it had everything you needed   Closet big enough to hang clothes amp store your bag a desk club chair and a very nice comfortable bed  The bathroom was also small but still nice The only downfall to staying at the Club Quarters Downtown during the weekend is that the financial district is DEAD   Literally You will have to be resourceful with planning your daily activities or either take the subway to Times Square or China Town  Other than that I think you will definitely enjoy your stay 
N => club quarters hotel downtown Lived there nd to th of    Good standard on our two rooms  Nice staff  Excellent location  Two minutes walk to subway  Deli within reasonable walkingdistance We had a very nice stay would definitly stay her again 
N => Cancellation Warning Club quarters at least according to the manager I spoke to today will not allow non members to cancel reservations  Ever  Never mind that a blizzard is preventing us from reaching NY or that our family has spent over two weeks there in the past two months  This is definitely a quotmembers onlyquot club and non members booking through web sites show stay away  
N => Great stay  Very good value  Nothing at night  We paid top dollar thru Priceline due to high season in NYC but was well worth the expense  The staff was courteous and efficient upon arrival and throughout and we got bumped up to a Suite and early check in  We found the hotel to be very safe clean and very quiet The bed is comfortable and the rooms were perfect for relaxing and enjoying the views we had  Guests can serve themselves purified water in bottles provided unheard of in NY  Our only issue was finding our way around  The Financial District is a maze  If you are patient and have a good map youll do just fine  If you have a GPS bring it Plenty of private security and police on foot patrol at night so with a little common sense you have nothing to worry about  Note Theres nothing to do in the area after business hours  Be prepared to find food and drink elsewhere or order in from menus available in the rooms  
N => Just OK Clearly not more than a three star hotel if that  The check inout process can be described in one word Dumb  I cannot figure out what management is thinking in having this quotself check inquot My room was supposed to be a suite  On the door it said quotExecutive suitequot  It was a long room about the size of my garage with taller ceilings  There was one bed and a love seat which was supposed to be a sleeper sofa but was not  No furniture to speak of   strickly a suitcase on the floor place  It was relatively clean a stain or two on the bed covering is all  There were  towels no washcloths and one shampoo  The shower was good perhaps the one good point  The noise from the street was incredible th floor  There was free bottled water in the hallways a plus  And then there was the parking  Terrible  The garage across the street and around the corner was completely inconvenient and horribly expensive  You pay each time you get out  On one day we had  in charges and it could have been higher had we not planned less exits  Most hotels have high daily fees but at least you can get your car out whenver you want  The hotel gets a discount there  It is a miniscule discount  Also there is no place in front of the place to even stop a car for a moment  Chestnut is a busy street so unloading there is out of the question  Better plan on trudging your bags from the garage  Bottom line   it could be so much more  Not terrible but not a place I will look for again  
N => Great value great room I was really impressed with CQ  The room wasnt huge but if you want huge in Manhattan you need Trumps bank account  We had two people and a fair amount of luggage and I didnt find the room cramped at all For less than Id pay for a standard motel in the suburbs of Melbourne we got a very clean quiet room we even had a ent viewStaff were very friendly and helpful  Only downside was having to loop the block a few times to find it Would definitely stay there again  
N => Great hotel great value Stayed at the CQ in ch  for a quotcity weekendquot   dining sightseeing etc  Booked through Priceline for  per night   Hotel was clean rooms were spacious as compared to a couple of the trendier hotels I have stayed in in NYC although mirror space was at a premium two women trying to get ready in  room might end in a catfight but my husband and I managed to work around each other location was excellent  Not a luxurious experience but certainly would return  Bathroom was small not a lot of storage space but the bedroom was large clean and comfortable for us  We did not spend any time in the room other than to sleep and get ready to head out for our next adventure  Another bonus was the location  While we were away from most of the popular tourist destinations the Wall St  area was a ghost town during the weekend so we were not overwhelmed by crowds  We could get a cup of coffee or a beer without waiting forever stores were clean and empty so you could browse etc  Then when you want to hit mid town or uptown the subways are really convenient  Staff was helpful and friendly  For the price it was a great place to stay I would definetly stay at this hotel again as a home base for an NYC weekend  
N => Had better in NYC My husband and I visit NYC quite often  On our most recent trip we ided to use the points on his credit card to save money  We chose the Club Quareters Downtown steps away from Wall Street as it was in a familiar location to us we typically stay at the Millenium Hilton  The hotel itself is average  The front desk staff is fairly pleasant and check in was quick  We were in a hurry after check in so I did not make much of the fact that when we got off on the th floor it smelled of smoke  I figured that it must be a smoking floor but not all rooms are smoking  We dropped our bags off quickly not really surveying the room at left  Upon returning very late that night we realized that the room was itself a smoking room outfitted with an ashtray etc and definitely carrying the odor of smoke which highly irritates my sinuses and lungs although nothing like the hallway which might as well be a lounge pre smoking ban days  Given how late it was and how exhausted we were we just went to bed  Aside from the the fact that the room smelled like smoke it was fairly ent  The size was average for a NYC hotel room and it had no frills as it is priily designed for a business traveler  We did have to call down for additional towels because although they knew there were  people to the room they only had just enough for one person  I did not sleep too well due to the smoke that first night and also because the light from the hallway shining in from underneath the door kept bothering until I threw a towel down to block it out  Lastly the noise from garbage trucks also contributed to the fact that I slept little The next morning my husband went downstairs to ask for a different room NON smoking  THey were very accomodating and we found ourselves in a smaller room but one that did not irritate my asthma so I had no problems  That night proved to be much better than the first and I actually slept  I would be somewhat hesistant to recommend this place for the following reasons      fairly dusty rooms not a prime location for those who want to be in the middle of the action and not an entirely helpful staff when it came to leaving our bags for the day in the bell closet they also charge  a bag  The smoking room issue was further irritating as my husband had called the previous day to make sure that the room we had was NON SMOKING  Of course during that phone call the front desk confirmed that we were in a non smoking room  In my opinion you can do better for the same price or slightly higher  
N => Cheap and Cheerful I booked Club Quarters from the reviews on trip advisor and because I wanted a hotel I could afford in Manhattan over the Christmas period  I travelled with my parents who are quite old so comfort was a priority for me  Check in was quick and easy  I was a bit worried after reading some of the other reviews that I would get charged an additional  a night as we had  people in our room  As booked the hotel with expedia I did not have this problem and we did not incur any extra charges  Make sure you confirm this before checking in as they will charge you for every extra person in the room  Rooms were very spacious with  of us in the room there was more than enough space to move about  The bed was nice and comfortable but unfortunately I found the pillows a bit too soft  Facilities in the room were useful as they provided a fridge microwave and cutlery for when we ordered take out to the room  Beware with ordering takeout to the room as it can take up to an hour to arrive  Bathrooms were a real disappointment compared to the size of the room the bathroom is tiny  There was no bath tub and there was barely enough room to move I think they could have used the space more wisely and made the bathroom bigger  Location of the hotel is good Wall Street station is on the next street but as my parents are old we took a cab everywhere and they were easy to find  The only problem we experienced was that cab drivers could not find the hotel when we used to come back in the evening and I had to end up directing them If you do take a cab back to the hotel then tell the driver that the hotel is on William Street on the intersection of Wall Street and they will be able to find it  The area is very quiet and its nice to get away from the hustle and bustle in the evening and even though it is quiet we never felt unsafe  It was easy to find something to eat for breakfast during the week but most food places are closed over the weekend so finding somewhere to eat  be a problem  There is a grocery store at the end of the road which was very convenient when we were looking for some food for our room  Don t eat in the restaurant in the hotel as they charge a lot of money and do not offer you an A La Carte menu  All in all I found my stay at club quarters very comfortable and would definitely consider this hotel again if I was looking for a cheap and cheerful stay in New York  
N => Fair price and good location The rooms of this hotel seems to have been recently refurbished nice modern clean with reasonable price for NYC  Conveniently located near wall street metro station from where you can easily go to midtown  
N => Comfortable Stay This was a comfortable place with well orated rooms  The staff were friendly and willing to chat  The location was convenient and the price was excellent value  
N => A great place to stay for a great value Will stay again I booked this reservation through Priceline for the weekend of ember th and th  I ran the NYC athon and didnt want to spend a ton of money to stay a couple nights in NYC  I was hesitant about this hotel from the beginning because of the difference in price compared to other hotels in NY  I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived Saturday to find a very nice hotel located in a great area of town  The room wasnt large but was perfect for what we needed  It was clean and had a flat screen TV with plenty of room to dress and relax  The bed was extremely comfortable  The bathroom was small but fine for the  of us  The staff at the front desk was very helpful with any advice you  need on getting around NY and the best places to go  Check in and check out took less than  minutes  The location was perfect  I have read that downtown isnt the best place to stay but I found it relaxing on the weekend and any subway stop you want to get to was less than  blocks away  We used the subways all weekend with much ease  I highly recommend Club Quarters downtown and will be staying there again on my next trip to NYC  
N => Very clean good value hotel We were very happy with Club Quarters Downtown as a value type of hotel  We were glad to have a quality place to stay in NYC without spending a fortune  Yes the room was not big but not tiny  This is New York not exactly the place to spend all your time in a hotel room It was extremely clean and had a recently reated feel with a flat screen TV  The bed and the pillows were superb  The staff were friendly and happy to help with directions  There is a living room space on the lobby level that is comfortable  We would stay here again  
N => Fantastical The hotel was wonderful  It was beautiful the bathroom was clean and nice  The bed was comfotable  The television was great  The room was very spacious  Snatch this hotel up before they relize that they can up their prices  The location was good safe area great local resturants  Great guest service right when we walked in the door very very very nice  
N => It was good I liked my stay at this hotel  The only problem that I had was when I reserved the room I told the lady over the phone two people would be staying and I wanted two twins  When I went to check in they said they had a Queen bed and a rollaway bed and that they were going to charge me an extra  because there were two people  I was mad She didnt charge me but it was frustrating because I didnt get what I asked for  Oh and another thing the guy at the front desk didnt tell us to use our key to use the elevator  So we got on the elevator all confused and it took us to the th floor and we had to use stairs to get to our floor  To other people it would have been common sense to just use the key but we werent use to that  But other than that the room was clean  Small but clean  When I came on here before I stayed at the hotel I really took for granted when people said the rooms were small  I mean they are literally the size of some bathrooms in other hotels  
N => dont let them put you in the penthouse and dont try to sleep in There is always at least one disgruntled customer on these review sites and I am that person  I did not expect this place to be a five star hotel and I know you get small rooms in NYC  For those who ide to stay there anyway you can find a ent quick breakfast around the corner on Pine or Wall depending on what you want  I didnt eat at their restaurant but it looked overpriced to me Also the location is great  Very close to two subway lines The desk staff were kind and helpful  Now the problems I thought I had scored when they gave me a room on the penthouse floor  It turns out that the rooms up there are the same as anywhere else in the hotel  But there are some hassles  Only one elevator goes up to the penthouse floor and when you are up there and call it sometimes it wont come because it is also the elevator they use for linen service and other things  I was told that I could call the front desk if I needed the elevator but I usually just walked down to the th floor  It looked like I was up there because many of the other floors of the hotel appeared to be under construction They have these new automatic water saver toilets in the bathrooms  I will spare you the gory details and they were but trust me when I say that I wished theyd save just a little less water than they do TV reception was spotty which is odd for a cable hookup  Im not a big TV guy but I do miss ESPN up in Canada  Wireless internet was hit or miss regardless of where I was in the room  The quotprint from your roomquot feature was also a complete failure Now I realize Im not your typical guest in this hotel  I was in as a guest speaker at a local university and all of my engagements were in the afternoon or evening which meant that I wanted to take a very rare opportunity to sleep in  This hotel does not really allow for that  I asked if there were quotdo not disturbquot signs to put out  The answer was no that cleaning staff would put their cards in your door a yellow light would go off and they would leave you alone  The first morning I was there around am I awoke to the sound of a card going in the door  In a very loud voice the woman in the hall annouced to her colleagues that someone was in the room  They go clean next door and proceed to have a LOUD and lengthy conversation about someones personal life while slamming things up against the wall between the two rooms I have no idea what they were doing but it was quite unusual  This finally ended around  at which time the card was slipped in my door again  I realize that businesspeople on Wall St  are going to take off but some of us actually enjoy the Manhattan nightlife The second night was worse  Before retiring to bed I made arrangements with the man at the front desk for a pm car service to the airport the next day  He said pm I said pm I even saw him write down pm  So at am my phone rings with someone calling from the front desk to let me know my car service is here  He did apologize but nobody made any effort to make it up to me  am knock on the door and the keycard goes in twice just to make sure  More loud conversation though thankfully no furniture throwing this time These all seem like easy to fix problems so I hope that they are  I certainly will seek other accommodation on my next trip to the Big Apple and if you wish to sleep past am I recommend that you do as well  
N => Good hotel but they cannot charge right I stayed there for three nights in ember  and was wrongly charged for those nights as my partneer had paid for our stay  After a few days my card was finally debited but then again in ruary  my card is charged again for the  nights They had to reverse the charges  Now Im checking my card statement today    and guess what Again a new charge to my credit card on the anniversary of my stay for the same three nights of one year ago  Unbelievable but true Three wrong charges in one year  Will they continue to charge my card every anniversary of my stay 
N => Not bad for the price Room was small but clean  Deadbolt did not work on door and TV reception wasnt the greatest  However it suited our needs and was within walking distance of alot of things  Subway is close  Wall Street is around the corner  Not alot of eating places open in the evening but can walk up a few blocks  Staff was friendly and helpful  Internet access was available so that was handy  
N => Look Elsewhere  As stated in almost all of the reviews unless youre traveling solo do not stay here  This is without a doubt the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in Ive stayed in   star hotels that were much better then this place  When we arrived and went up to our room I was shocked  The bathroomtoilet sink and shower stall only no exhaust fan anywhere as was evident by the stale mildew smell throughout the room  TV on one end of a desk with the dorm refrigerator under one side of the same deskrefrigerator broken Tried several times to call the front desk housekeeping wake up call and every attempt failed  I even tried calling at am same result  All lines were nothing but busy signals  Tried from my cellphone thinking be the phone was also broke but I still received nothing but busy signals  Do they take there phones off The only way to talk to anyone is to physically go to the front check in desk and that was a nighte  I asked several times to talk to management only to be told by  different shifts that no management is on the premises  How convienent  I tried in vain to tell the staff of all my problems with the room and how dissatisfied I was  The man actually shrugged his shoulders as to say quotoh wellquot  Also worth noting the staff actually shuts off your heat or air condition while youre gone  That was pleasant to come back to  Please it is not worth the aggravation  Stay anywhere else but here  
N => Good value for a place to sleep in Manhattan Pleasant place for a weekend trip to NYC  Very close to Battery Park Statue of Liberty and South St  Seaport  Had th Floor room   no view or light  Rooms smaller than average but clean and quiet for sleeping  Easy check incheck out  Stay here for the value not the hotel experience  If on a budget this place lets you spend more on the unique stuff NYC offers  
N => Was fine   nothing special Stayed at Club Quarters uary nd  Was fine   the location is a little TOO quiet there by wall street for us vacationers   next time well stay closer to downtown Manhattan  I liked the free internet available in the club room  Room was very small but not unpleasant  
N => Great Find Highly Recommend Spent an early summer weekend in NYC for a concert  After searching through way too many hotels this one stayed in my mind mainly due to the price  I was a little nervous due to people complaining about room size but hey it is NYC and the rate for the room is fantastic And the rooms are not actually as tiny as people would liek to think  be you can get a bigger room at the Holiday Inn in Suburbia USA but once again remember you are staying in NYC Check in was a breeze hotel was not hard to find at all  The parking garage flat rate   day was hard to find though At least for me   My biggest complaints are the key you have to use it to get the elevator to work and the fact that the rooms dont have irons  ironing boards in them  You have to go to a closet in the hall to take them    so naturally i grabed then and kept them my whole stay Didnt use the gym  Computers were a nice touch although they were usually taken but nobody stayed on the computer for more than  minutes   But once again the room size is ok  Are you really spending that much time in a hotel room anyways The room was VERY clean  Neighborhood is dead on the weekend but subway is literally  steps away and cabs are very easy to get  This is probably among the best finds for a trip to nyc  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
N => Unless youre a pain    to travel with no problem  
N => Getting away  
N => Could be handled a lot better  
N => bonne surprise  
N => Bello e tranquillo il Club Quarters  
N => Will not say Good     just OK types Travel Time ember Reviewer  Gaurav KuI happened to Stay at this hotel during a business trip to New York  I stayed here for about a month  It was convenient for me to stay at this hotel as this was very close to my office which was at  Avenue of the Americas The location of this hotel is excellent as it is at walking distance from Times Square plus being in Manhattan has a lot of eating options around it The was comfortable although the staff wasnt very courteous at times even rude  After Check in I discovered the phone in my room was not working properly  I was unable to take calls in my room On complaining I was told that this is a problem which only the IT could handle and the next two days being a holiday it would be done only on the third day They could not change my room as no rooms were available in the category in which I had a booking  I had to run down to the reception to take calls  Anyways after two days when the IT guy finally came in I was told there was some wiring problem which would take another day or two  I finally had to put my foot down and after a lot of arguments I was finally upgraded to higher category room  Leaving this aside the stay was OK  
N => Well stay again We have just spent  nights in this hotel after completing the Trans atlantic crossing on board Queen y   This was arranged through booking com Our first impression was the great location near to Fifth Avenue Times Square etc  all within walking distance  We were given a free upgrade on the th floor in the Executive Suite with good all round facilities and a arate lounge  There was a comfortable public lounge downstairs with free WIFI and computerprinter access complimentary cookies hot snack and chilled water  One minor criticism is the unhelpfulness of the Barman in refusing to serve us drinks while we were in the lounge  We had to go up to the bar to get the drinks ourselves All the Receptionists were friendly and helpful  We would regard the place as good value for money thereby enabling us to have a great time in NY  We would have no hesitation in recommeding it to others  
N => Excellent location for theater average hotel experience I stayed for a girls weekend in this hotel with my companys corporate discount which was about half price  I dont think Id be happy if Id paid much more for it but for what we needed this was fine  We had a quotDiplomat Suitequot which I think simply meant two twin beds  The bathroom as mentioned is tiny  There isnt enough shelfcounter space for two women to adequately spread out  Plenty of linens though and we had no problem with hot water  We were less than  minutes to the theater and the restaurants where we had made reservations which was helpful on the terribly rainy nights  You can walk to just about anywhere of interest and subways are nearby as well The room was average size and clean except for a stain on one of the comforters  One elevator was out of service and the tiny barely holds two people with luggage second elevator was constantly in use so we waited a lot to get to the th floor  There is free WiFi throughout and free use of the computers in the lounge with printers for printing your boarding passes etc  I found the front desk staff to be friendly but didnt really go out of their way for anything  When I had trouble hailing a cab to LGA they offered their car service for  but would not call me a cab  I did finally hail a cab which cost  total on a Sunday evening Id stay here again only to save money but wouldnt recommend it at full price to either business or leisure travelers  Ive stayed in more agreeable hotels in NYC  Visitors would be well advised to remember this is a no frills business hotel first and foremost first time visitors to the city  be put off by the lack of tourist amenities and personal assistance  
N => Nice hotel great location  Too bad there was NO HOT WATER Cant beat the location of the Club Quarters Midtown and the hotel is a good value Nothing fancy but clean and modern  Service is minimal but thats how Club Quarters operates  My room was on the Penthouse level which was nothing special except it was the top floor  Room was small but quiet and the bed was comfy  I was totally happy with the experience until I went to take a shower  No hot water  Called downstairs and they told me to just run the water for about  minutes until it heated up  Well it never heated up   minutes later the water was tepid to warm so I took a quick uncomfortable shower  Figured it was a one time deal but no  The next day the same thing happened  Again I ran the shower for  minutes trying to get it hot  The irony is that there are signs all over the room about being quotgreenquot ie saving water by using your sheets and towels more than once  I could have washed about  loads of sheets and towels in the water I wasted trying to get a hot shower  Might just be the th quotPenthousequot floor that has this problem but its a pretty fundemental flaw when you cant even take a hot shower  Hope they fix it but Id request a lower floor next time  
N => Excellent Location This hotel is in an excellent location only minutes walk to times square  Rooms  I had booked a studio and ended up with the executive suite th floor room  amp  which in essence were two identical rooms with queen size beds in each room amp a desk they had erate doors and then a single outer door which we did not have a key for so this was a bit strange and annoying as when we went out you had to clip the outer door open and close both the room doors having two keys   We asked to be moved but they could only offer a much smaller room than just one of the rooms we already had so we had two rooms and pinned open the doors to move around between them more easily We overlooked the air con units which were quite nosey and our air con in one of the rooms was faulty but staff fixed it asap when informed The rooms were very dusty but bed made by staff and clean towels every day if you wished Staff appeared miserable but they did help if asked  
N => Not terrible but impersonal I am currently staying here The pluses   low price as I do my part to save TampE expenses for my employer great location delivery menus for nearby restaurants in room clean room free wireless interenetThe minuses   impersonal   staff do not reply when I say good morning  I was directed to a computer to check in  OK with me  I do not need the staff I guess  No closet in room which is small even for NY standards  I do not like hanging my clothes from hangers on sticks protruding from the wall and have no choice   Temperature control on air conditioner is there but ignored and I freeze cheap poly blend sheets and pillow cases I wake up itchy  Maid does not replace or add new soap or shampoo so I have gone two nights so far with my mini supplies If you are on a super budget and get a good price stay here   otherwise skip it  I would pay the difference out of pocket next time to be more comfortable  
N => Great Hotel Location Love it We stayed at CQ for  nights walked in and service was great  The employee at the front desk was very friendly  I was a little worried from other reviews but he was great  Showed us how to use the self check in    Went up to our room on the th floor  Got to our room it was lovely    Everything that I had thought it would be and more  The room was a little small but I expected that  There was a cute  not working fireplace against the wall    the washroom was clean    was a great deal The first day we left the shower matt on the floor which attracted ants we call the front desk and within minutes there was someone there cleaning them up and getting rid of them They never returned Other then that    which really wasnt a big deal the hotel was great On the last day we did the self check out and they took our bags as we were flying later that night  They advised to return at least  mins before we needed to leave so that they could go get them    we returned    no issues    did not cost more money  GreatThis hotel is awesome Walking distance to everything small enough that you feel like you are in a boutique hotel The room was clean comfortable    I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone and everyone We had a wonderful trip to NYC Thank you CQ   Head down to Hells Kitchen on th Avenue for dinner    its only a few min walk and there is some amazing food 
N => Horrible Experience Terrible customer service overbooked on rooms flat out lying  Lots of better more reliable hotels nearby  
N => Perfect Location Could not be happier with our stay at Club Quarters Midtown  The location was perfect  We were just a short  block walk to Times Square Grand Central and shopping on th Avenue  Having everything at our fingertips made our weekend in NYC very enjoyable  I would def  recommend andor stay here again  The room appeared to have been recently updated  While it was a small room and bathroom we were not in the room except to changesleep so it suited us just fine  Very similar to European hotels we have visited before  
N => Okay   nothing great nothing horrible The room was clean halls smelled though of insecticide   just like my old apartment building when I lived in Manhattan  It was small but certainly adequate  Location is good  Service is non existent  When you can get someone they are not the most polite  If you get a great price great  If not you might as well go somewhere with an actual staff  
N => Couldnt believe they charged extra for my husband We stayed in this hotel on Valentines weekend  We had reserved the small suite as my dhters were with us  On check in we were told that there was a per personper night charge for my husband and two dhters That increased the price an extra amount and we could have stayed in a much nicer place  The suite was tiny bathrooms were tiny Good thing we had lots to do  Wont be staying here again 
N => Very good location and price rocky start I stayed at the Club Quarters Midtown New York from   to th and I would like to say that the hotel was a pleasant surprise due to previous problems with acommodations in NYC in most famous locations  However I was a little bit worried when arriving since the room I booked online on the hotel own website was not available  I was told that the previous guests had not left when expected and that I had to stay in a smaller room cheaper  I said ok but could not lie that I was worried about this rocky start and the possibility that I was not going to be able to get a room after a  hour flight   After this small inconvenience however the stay was extremely good and the hotel services quite upstanding  In NYC it is very hard to find good hotels with reasonable prices and quality rooms service and housekeeping and the Club Quarters provided it all  Also the location is perfect for work and leisure  
N => We gave your room away    sorry Made a reservation on a major travel website for the new years eve at this hotel  When we got there we are told the hotel is completely booked and our room was given away They offer to relocate us to a different CQ with a  for our trouble saying that it will cover a weekend night at a CQ while the regular night runs for  bucks  At this point all we wanted was a room with a queen bed we are a couple and non smoking in the other hotel which they confirm true  Once we get to the new hotel we are told the only rooms they have left are either one with two twin bed which quotwe can push them together if you wantquot or queen bed smoking      Seriously Keep in mind we paid close to  for  nights     a TOTAL RIP OFF 
N => Would not recommend not   I had never heard of this hotel until my bid was accepted through Priceline as a   hotel  This is definitely NOT a   hotel  First the staff was very rude and unhelpful numerous times throughout our  day stay  The elevators were small and rickety holding a MAX of  people and that was squished  Then when we got to our floor we couldnt find our room right away because you had to go into the stairwell to get to it  Then in the stairwell you had to go through another door and there were  rooms together  I think this is a safety issue I would not have been comfortable if I were alone  The room was tiny but the bathroom was even worse  There was only a shower no tub   people could not fit in there at one time  There was no where to put a suitcase  Although it was in close proximity to Times Square thats about the only good thing I have to say  And the quotfitness roomquot was  treadmills a stairmaster and an eliptical trainer in a tiny room with the ice machine and a coke machine  Not what most people have in mind  When we checked out no one said anyhting to us not even thanks for staying with us which normally is said during check out  I know they are independently rated and they are over rating themselves as    I would not recommend this hotel  
N => Terrible serivce   Not close to normal CQ standards Have stayed with Club Quarters in both London and Phillly and had extremely good experiences so this was very disappointingThe good location is great  pricing VERY variable but reasonableThe bad The serivce was terrible from start to finish  The lobby staff were shouting and boisterous with each other when we arrived and made us feel like an imposition for needing check in  We booked and re confirmed early check in normally a  service with CQ but it was unavailable on arrival the staff acted like we were crazy for even asking  We had booked a suite and adjoining room but had to be put on erate floors The phone in one of the rooms wasnt working  Despite asking about it  arate times and being assured it would be fixed immediately no one had even come to look at it  days later when we checked out We had to check luggage when the room wasnt ready but when we finally got into the room it took  minutes  phone calls from my cell phone see above and  returns to the lobby to get the luggage back again There were several other other smaller annoyances such as trash left unmoved on a table of the sitting area for  straight days Finally when I asked to speak with the manager I was told that I couldnt  The desk person insisted that I had to tell him the problems again    Thats a new one on me 
N => Taking Care of Business This stay was a quick overnight for a business trip  I was familiar with the Club Quarters business model having been in their Philadelphia and London properties  small rooms no fancy lobby or breathtaking views but all the basics for business travelers  This is a very good location  short walk to Times Square and Grand Central  My room not surprisingly faced an air shaft but that meant no street noises  The free Wi Fi signal was a little weak and I got dropped a couple of times but it was easy to set up and use  My wake up call came as requested  There s a reation in progress but the only effect on the guests that I could see was that only one of the  elevators was working during my stay  Check out was a little troublesome the machine took my credit card but then stopped dead and the desk clerk had to check me out from his computer  I also asked him how to get to Grand Central I m directionally challenged and was under time constraints so I didn t want to make any mistakes  First the clerk told me that it was at th Street and I should get a taxi  Well I knew it wasn t there  I told him it was at nd  He then told me it was a  minute walk  Well true but not very informative  I headed out  in the wrong direction of course but eventually corrected my course and got there  The young woman at the desk the night before was more helpful when I asked how to get to the nearest subway station to get a particular subway line  The hotel has an adjoining restaurant  looked to be a bit high end for my taste but this being NYC there many options all around the hotel  The Club Quarters Midtown is a good choice if you want the basics  a clean quiet room in a good location  
N => Snug little spot in midtown Manhattan We were in town overnight for a fantastic show and needed somewhere fairly close to Madison Square Garden to rest our weary bones before heading home  Well its good thats all we planned to do because there wasnt space for much more in our room This  be comparing apples to oranges but I got a  single  that was almost this size in Amsterdam last fall for less than  the price Pros friendly staff parking nearby good location clean  Cons room size lobby under construction few amenities  If youre looking for someplace to sleep shower and change and arent looking for any luxuries this might be your place  If you need lots of amenities or room to stretch out and use your laptop keep on looking  
N => Fine location for New York trip Club Quarters Midtown is located very conveniently to midtown venues Broadway theatres Times Square and to subway stations that access anything in the city  Desk staff was friendly enough though we didnt need to talk to them much  Free internet was accessible through a computer in a public area which was great but since there was only one computer there was sometimes a wait  Dont know if there is wireless access because I didnt have a wireless device with me  The room was clean and the air conditioner worked after you gave it a little while to rev up  No view from the room an air shaft but we were not there to gaze out the window   we wanted to go to shows etc  Our room was located across from the two small elevators and we could hear the elevator bells and people talking pretty distinctly from our room but that diminished overnight as foot traffic slowed down  We would definitely go back  
N => Great Location and Recommend Just returned from a  night stay at Club Quarters Midtown  A couple blocks from Times Square and Fifth Ave  Booked through Priceline and got an excellent price  Hotel was not a typical hotel with the small entry area serving as the lobby  The staff was very nice  The room we had was small but once we got used to it and moved in we really enjoyed it  Yes it could have been larger but all and all it was great  The orations were updated the room was clean bed comfortable shower was nice   no tub though   not much storage place for clothing or hanging items  With this said we would definitely recommend this to our dhters and friends  
N => Lousy service matches bargain price Stayed at Club Quarters last week in New York and I must say that the price is very good for a location thats so close to Times Square  Thats all the positive comments I can provide  When I got there the wi fi that they advertised was not working  I called the desk and was advised to quotgo out into the hallquot to try it  I took this advice and it still didnt work  Over the course of the next five days I asked the hotel staff six different times about the internet access  Each time they promised to check into and get back to me  They never did  Luckily my conference was at the Hilton and I was able to take my laptop there and quickly get online  We requested that the hotel schedule a cab pickup for us the day of our departure  They instead called a car service  We were  minutes late getting back which was completely our fault but then we waited for another  minutes for our luggage to be brought down  When we asked about the length of time it was taking the indifferent concierge said quotit takes  minutes quot When the employee kept coming down with partial or incorrect luggage I asked if I could go up to help him identify our bags  They agreed and sent me to   get this   our room Thats where they were keeping the luggage  Instead of  minutes it was a short walk up the stars on the nd floor  The car service tacked on  for their wait and the total cost was  to get to La Guardia  Terrible terrible service  
N => Worse Service EVER Got to hotel   seemed fine  Got to our room tiny by even NYC standards and found that we had only a queen bed  Now we are  ried friends on a girls shopping weekend  We immediately contacted Reception who promised something would be done       to cut a long story short and after  conversations with Reception staff we were left to share the bed for the  nights we were there   if this wasnt bad enough the water wasnt working in our room   this took a further  calls to Reception to sort out  My dhter emailed me our flight boarding passes through to the hotel to give to us   these were not given to us  I also left some items in the room by mistake   these also mysteriously disappeared   my advice is to not touch this hotel with a large bargepole 
N => Great stay It was very suprising to find such a great rate at such a great place  The staff was very friendly and always courteous  The room was bigger than I thought and was VERY clean  They had computers for guests to use down close to the lobby  One was out of comission when I got there but the other was working fine and was very convenient  They have a  minute limit which is very good that way you wont have to wait long in case you needed to use it  There wasnt much to see around the fin  district but we walked  blocks to get a cab they do not call cabs only car service as there never seems to be any that go by that hotel and it is about   dollars for the taxi to take you to Time Square  So not bad I thought its much cheaper to get this hotel than to pay  bucks more a night and stay in times square  So you still save money  Last time I stayed at the Westin hotel in times square and it was very noisy even though we were up high in a club room  The Club Quarters hotel is so quiet at night I loved it I could actually sleep there was no construction no noisy people no anything to keep me awake thank goodness I very much enjoyed my stay  They also have a binder which has several restaurants one was a  hour deli on Water St  which has some awesome hamburgers and fries they also serve sandwiches and have a ton of bakery items  This is a good place in case you get hungry in the middle of the night although its like  blocks away but its worth it  
N => Never again with Club Quarters It was my first amp last experience with a Club Quarters hotel  The rooms were clean although relatively spartan  Customer service however was horrible   months after my stay an additional fee which was essentially a quotcancellation feequot for the time I was there showed up on my credit card  Attempts to remedy the situation over the phone were met with resistance from the hotel  The main office insisted first of all that I had actually not showed up for my stay and then when I proved I had said I had booked twice   months later and they still wont credit my account for the errant charge I would avoid this place like the plague  Ill never stay at any of their hotels and encourage the rest of you to avoid it as well  
N => like others here had item stolen from room The room was fine until checkout when my ipod was nowhere to be found  I had put it on the desk after going running two days before  Looks like other people here have had the same problem with jewelry and electronics going missing My experience with the hotel was fine otherwise but would never go back because of this  Front desk people were not helpful  
N => Minimal customer service I have been to NYC many times but this was my first time at the Club Quarters  I will not return  When we arrived to check in the tiny lobby was extremely crowded and lines were moving very slowly  We had to wait outside on the sidewalk  When we finally got checked in we found out that one of the elevators was not working  As a result there were long lines waiting for the other elevators and taking the stairs wasnt the best option since we were on the sixth floor and I was traveling with my sister who was pregnant  The staff was somewhat appologetic about the elevator and the fact that they were ALWAYS full when they stopped on our floor  It seemed as if Club Quarters staff could not handle adversity and they were overwhelmed by the broken elevator  They could have offered a discount on the rooms or complimentary snacks  
N => Good Hotel Club Quarters Midtown was a very nice place to stay We were on a long weekend daynight stay in NYC to do all the NYC Christams stuff  The Club Quarters was very clean the room was of an average size not as small as I thought it was going to be  We did not use the hotel resturaunt or other immenities   so a lot of what people are saying on here did not apply to us  But we were in NYC to see the sites and plays so those things were not important to us  We were only in our room to sleep and shower and for that it was perfect We had a king size bed TV good hot shower and the room was clean even by my standards They even stored our luggage until check in and after check out until time for our flight to leave  With the exception of one staff member everyone was overly friendly and helpfulWe will definately stay there again 
N => Ok hotel for business bit eerie for me Stayed  nights at the CQ Midtown a few months ago for work  I usually stay at the QT but I thought I would switch it up for once  I should have probably stayed on the beaten path At check in I was pointed out a machine to complete my check in with fine by me prefer not to deal with humans unless I really have to    you know what i mean  Upon entering the room it was a bit drab dark with inadequate lighting and no closet for belongings  Room was small  but doesnt particularly bother me if Im traveling alone  comfortable bed and clean bathroom  At this point I would say my stay was ok for a business trip  However things took a sharp downward turn when I asked for the ac to be turned off as it was freezing in my room after two morning attempts this did not happen  I had a friend come to visit me one evening and they gave her a key card to be able to ride the elevator up to my floor without phoning me or me giving them previous permission  Slightly worrying   All in all it was an okay stay but I will probably not return  
N => OK for Business Travel Only I travel to NYC for business purposes a couple times a year  This time we stayed at Club Quarters Midtown as the price was very affordable fo NYC standards and the location is very ideal  We were pleasantly satisfied with the finishings and overall look  Free fresh fruit at the front desk is a nice touch  Our room was small but not Tokyo uncomfortable  Bathroom was clean  Bed was comfy too Service is quite hit and miss  Dont expect   star hotel service  Their staff seem to have been trained only for the business crowd  You will be greeted with quotcheck in at the kiosk please quot Be sure to have your confirmation number or your check in will not be swift  We did encounter a few really nice staff members but they seem to be above standards there I do not recommend the buffet breakfast as it is a sparse selection and pastries do not seem fresh  Its also quite overpriced and in the midtown area there are many many alternatives for a quality bite grab If you are flying red eye note that they have an early arrival option  This is good but only if you know about it in advance unlike us  Most hotels allow for red eye arrivals if youve booked for the preceding night as well  If you were to follow the same method with CQ their computer system many things automated at CQ will consider you as a no show and give up your room and charge you for one night  As you can expect with overly automated places the charges from this required a lot of man hours to resolve  Their management did not return any of my  voicemails all of which were polite in tone the front desk staff tried to help as much as possible and was understanding  On one attempt to reach management I actually got her live  Imagine my delight  However when I explained who I was she said quothold onquot and transferred me to her own voicemail Had to deal with my credit card company instead to finally resolve erroneous charges Additionally we think our bose QC headphones were taken out of our room  We had left it by the desk in the room but didnt see it when packing up  Unfortunately we only realized they were missing when we wanted to use them the next day and had already checked out  The front desk tried to be helpful and even checked the room even though someone else had already checked in If you can manage to avoid out of the norm transactions keep your valuables safe and not require too much service I think CQ could be a good experience  Price wise and location wise they are hard to beat  Due to the incidents described above though I personally would be really cautious and might begrudgingly book them a second time if I had to  
N => Mattresses should be upgraded Considering most guests are staying for business more than one night I was surprised they didnt have more sense to purchase new mattresses when they were reating at least I assume it was reated recently  It seemed like most things were new ish for an older building in NYC  The mattress sank in the middle  as if we were being folded in half vertically  Though the thermostat seemed fairly new it did not work well  At least the room was freezing as opposed to hot  Shower was fantastic though  Got a corporate rate through my company but did not realize they would add  for more than one person  Would look to stay at one of the hotels that can guarantee a good new mattress and nice sheets i e  riott  Street outside was also quite dark at night for those nervous about walking alone  
N => wont go back We were in town  night only and stayed at Club Quarters  We attempted to check in at pm and were informed by the apologetic staff that our room was not ready quotits being cleaned now itll be just  minutes quot  minutes later we found dirty sheets on the bed in a room obviously not vacuumed  We complained to the staff who promised to have it cleaned again  Upon our return an hour later the room had been more thoroughly cleaned but we found a huge wet spot in the carpet near the ac unit  Since it was late we placed an extra towel on the floor we had  towels for  people and found yellowish stains on the towel the following morning  The room thermostat was flaky and could not hold a consistent temperature the bed was uncomfortably soft sheets didnt entirely cover the bed leaving a gap of uncovered mattress pad at the head  Bathroom was clean but a little shabby  The staff gave us a voucher for a future one night free stay and apologized for the dirty room but I dont intend to return to this hotel  
N => Comfortable We had a one night stay at Club Quarters  It is generally oriented to self reliant business travellers  The room was small but the bed was very comfortable  They have a small exercise room in the basement with one bike  treadmills and a stairmaster  Check in was quick via a computer  They have free internet in the lobby for those not travelling with their own computer  It was a safe and very easy location  
N => Nice Room The room was small but nicely designed and completely functional for one person  I appreciated the free wireless connectivity in the room  I was staying on a weekend and there is no food service then  I went down to find Sunday continental breakfast to no avail as well Location is terrific  I paid  plus fees off of Hotwire  
N => Noisy worst night of sleep Ive ever had Just stayed through work my nd experience at a CQ hotel  First experience DC was great  This one didnt meet expectations  Location was good except as others noted th street between th and th leaves a little something to be desired re cleanliness etc  internet access in lounge was great and for the most part staff were friendly and tried to be helpful  But there were problems too  When I entered my room double bed room size of single college dorm room I immediately noticed an odor musty but smelled most like urine  However I realized it was coming mostly from HVAC system so probably not urine  Anyway it was unpleasant so after a few minutes I called front desk who said they would send someone up  After an hour no one came up and I went downstairs as I was having difficulty overriding the thermostat was reading  but room was quite cold  They took care of that immediately  I also noted that the bathroom wasnt as clean as it could be sink had some residue I wiped down myself for example  My next problem came later that night  When I attempted to fall asleep I kept being woken up by an occassional chirping noise outside somewhere  I kept heat on for warmth and to try to drown out the chirping but in regulating the temp the automatic HVAC system kept turning itself off and kicking back on   VERY NOISILY  In addition to its kicking on it regularly produced other loud banging noises  So throughout the ENTIRE night every time I was almost asleep I would get woken up either by a chirping or by the HVAC banging  kicking on  It was AWFUL Worst night sleep I can remember   When I left in the morning I noticed that the chirping was actually coming from the open stairwell outside of my room many rooms are off the stairwell on multiple floors  I think it must have been a smoke alarm needing a new battery  I notified the front desk of the chirping and noisy HVAC system and my resulting awful nights sleep on my way out  They were nice and seemed to feel badly but did not offer anything for my troubles  This wouldnt be my first CQ choice next time  
N => Great Location nice sized room I wasnt expecting much after reading some bad reviews  I did however request a quiet room after reading some of the reviews  My room was a very nice size clean and the or was modern and not chinzy  From the pictures some of the rooms seem smaller than others so I think I was lucky enough to be in one of the bigger ones To be honest I didnt spend that much time in the room but it was everything I could have asked for really  My only quibble was that the air conditioning unit outside was loud at times but to be honest Id be so tired by the time I got in I slept through it The PCs downstairs were useful as it meant I could check in online for my return flight  Id certainly book here again when I return  
N => Wheres the Weekend Special Rates I like this hotel like the staff very much  However the hotel advertises special weekend rates but every time I make a reservation they tell me that those rates are not available even when I call six months or more in advance Are they lying Are they lying to my company when they quote these special corporate weekend rates for my company 
N => Brilliant Location  After reading various reviews my friend and I were a little nervous to say the least on what we would expect to find on our much planned vacation  However we had a very positive experience   good size modern room with our requested two single beds plenty of suitcase space nice sized bathroom  The room was next to the elevator but because the air conditioning was on a low buzz throughout the night we never heard the dreaded dings of the said elevator  Good mostly friendly staff and access to two pubic computers although this was restricted a couple of times as there was a conference going on in the same room as where the computers were situated   would have liked them in a arate room for complete access  My only other gripes would have to be that it was a bit hit and miss with getting hot water in the mornings and as it is a business hotel there was no bar at the weekends  Two blocks from Times Square though with all the buzz of being in the middle of this great city  Very highly recommended and good rates  
N => Good Location  Miserable Experience Lukewarm water in a room with a filthy dept  store air conditioning window unit  Grout missing in tiled shower floor was replaced by mold  After checking in and going straight to bed I did not discover the above until morming  Desk clerk refused to adjust room price or fix problem  He was barely conversant in English  Only response was quotdid you run the water long enoughquot  Priceline picked this hotel for me  Dont pick it for yourself  This place must be scheduled to be converted to private residences or something  No sensible hotelier would let this place get so run down  Did I mention the hallway was stuffed full of banquet chairs and tables making it navigable only while walking side waysOh but the location is great  
N => Be Careful When Making Reservations My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night with  other couples  To our surprise when we got there we were all booked with rooms with one twin sized bed  My friend who booked the room said that it wasnt mentioned to her when she booked the rooms one month ago  She didnt even know they had twin size bed rooms  The hotel was sold out as was the location at Rockefeller center and we didnt want to stay Downtown near Wall Street  We ended up having to use the mattresses from a roll away bed on the floor the bed frame wouldnt fit in the tiny rooms As far as the hotel goes   it is very convenient to Times Square and all the major sites  I didnt have a problem with the elevators at all  The staff was moderately nice  The room was small but it would be ok for one person  The bathroom smelled like mildew so we had to keep the bathroom doors shut  Very little storage space if you were staying more than a day or two  We paid  for the night   not sure if it was worth my husband sleeping on the floor but we all made the best of it  
N => good deal for the price I paid I stayed  night at the Club Quarters Midtown on y   I stayed in a twin bedded room for  plus taxes  For a room in midtown I think it was a very good value  The room was actually larger than I expected  There was a good sized desk and the room had apparently been recently reated  The bed was twin but it was comfortable enough  If you are a big person you  not be so comfortable  The bathroom was fine  Just a big walkin shower small vanity and toilet  The shower was a little bit moldy but not terrible  The air conditioner was very loud but I like the sound of a fan to sleep so it was OK for me  If youre a light sleeper you might want earplugs  There was also a bit of noise from the corridor doors closing in the early morning There was absolutely no view at all  But I just needed the room for a place to sleep and take a shower so it was fine There are lots of places nearby to get food and Times Square is just a couple of blocks away  The location really is ideal  I dont understand the people who complained about all of the Asian people in the neighborhood  Its NYC the most polyglot place in the world so of course you will see all sorts of people  I couldnt get the wireless internet to work but they have two terminals in the lounge that you can use Overall it was a tremendous value for my one night stay  But if I were staying longer I might splurge on a nicer place  
N => surprised I just returned from a weekend trip to new york i booked the club quarters via hotwire and was very nervous after some of the reviews   However it wasnt as bad as i expected yes the room was small but we were hardly in it it was a clean quiet comfortable room  The location is ideal only issue we encoutered is that we had to park a block away from the hotel and it was quite chilly   Check out was quick and easy  
N => Well Be Back    Ignore the bad reviews and stay at the Club Quarters Midtown  Very friendly and helpfull staff Comfortable and clean rooms  Rooms  be small but it was not uncomfortable Excellent location with many good restaurants and cafes nearby Dont be afraid to try this hotel  Well be back  
N => ent My boyfriend and I stayed at the Club Quarters Hotel during Presidents Day weekend  Upon arrival we were surprised by what it looked like from the outside  It looked pretty plain compared to other hotels weve stayed at such as the Belvedere  However once we entered the lobby we were a little more hopeful because it looked ent  The front staff in particular a lady by the name of Grace was not very helpful  We had some difficulty with the self check in kiosk  Grace walked over and spoke to us condescendingly as if even a little kid could figure out how to use the machine  The elevators are VERY small  At most be two people and their luggage can fit comfortably at a time  The hallways leading to the rooms had multiple doors  We had to go through two doors just to get to our room which was the fourth one on the floorThe rooms look modern as if they are straight from an Ikea catalog  However they are very small  The free wi fi was a redeeming quality  The bathrooms are a bit small as well  When showering the water splashes out to the floors because there is a cheap shower curtain Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are on a tight budget and dont plan on spending a lot of time in your room  Times Square Rockafeller Center and the subway are within readonable walking distance  
N => Perfectly Satisfied My husband and I stayed at the Club Quarters Midtown from   and did not have any complaints  I was really worried after reading the negative comments but we ended up very pleased with everything  We found the staff very friendly and helpful  Our room was small but clean  We loved the location When we go back to New York we will definitely stay there again 
N => Pleasant stay We enjoyed our visit from      The room was freshly painted bright and clean  We reserved our room through Priceline    one room one price  No opt  to upgrade etc  While it was true there was only one washcloth when we asked for two and the housestaff realized there were  people in the room from that time forward we had  washclothes We thought the room was about the normal size for NYC  Regardless the convenience and central locationth street far outweighed the need for a larger room  I do not understand why there were several negative reviews about this hotel  We certainly got more room for the buck than expected  We would stay at this hotel again  
N => Pleasantly surprised I was very concerned when my dhter and I were due to stay at this hotel last weekend after reading the reviews  However we were very pleased with our stay  We had only paid  dollars per night plus taxes etc as we had booked mentioning our sons employer as it is a members hotel  When we arrived they informed us we were on the penthouse floor th Floor  Our room was very large and well orated with a nice bathroom and except for one man we found all the staff very helpful and polite  They offered to store our luggage for us after checkout and booked our transport to the airport for us  Slightly more expensive than taxi but we were leaving during the rush hour so would have had problem getting taxi  The position of the hotel was brilliant and it all added to our very enjoyable stay in New York  
N => Rather pricey but still good Stayed at the Club Quarters Midtown over the weekend of ober     The directors room on one of the high floors we were given was really spacious and well appointed  Having stayed in other NYC hotels we didnt have very high expectations of the service standards so the prolonged wait during check in didnt really irked us that much It was rather pricey and without breakfast but we figured the fantastic location   blocks from Times Square was worth it  
N => Pay more for a real hotel The room the first night was awful  It was incredibly loud from outside noise the air conditionerheaterfan did not work so we couldnt even block out the noise and the clock did not work  The bed was incredibly uncomfortable as we both rolled to the sag in the middle Around  am I approached the front desk clerk who said hotel was quotsold outquot so he couldnt give us another room  Plus he said he wasnt authorized to do so  I waited in the lobby for the am shift to arrive because the front desk clerk said they would be authorized to change our room for the next three nights  At am the new front desk person arrived  At first he said the hotel was sold out and he couldnt change the room  After pleading with him he gave us a new room assignment and said someone would be to our room at noon to pick up our luggage to transport it to the new room  At  am as we were laying in bed A HOTEL STAFF MEMBER UNLOCKED OUR DOOR AND WALKED IN OUR ROOM He said he was there to transport our luggage to the new room  We explained to him that the front desk clerk said that would happen at noon and to please come back   especially because we were still in night clothes and our stuff was still unpacked At  pm I finally called down to the front desk to ask where our escort was The same front desk clerk who gave me a new room number a few hours earlier said he had given the room to someone else  He said we missed our opportunity to have it and that now he really couldnt do anything for us because they were sold outHe put me on hold so we headed down the the front desk to make a scene   yelling in front of the other guests  He still insisted there was nothing he could do  After not letting up and continuing to make a scene he made a phone call and spoke to who we thought was be management He smirked to the person on the other end of the phone that we thought the room was noisy  They finally gave us a new room higher up in a better location  The room was still small drabbly remodled everything worked in it and it was quiet  The rooms are teeny tiny  The bathrooms are like closets  No tub only showers  The rooms that they call Executive or their quottop of the linequot rooms are regular size hotel rooms  Also we asked for more pillows the next day and we were told they were all out Basically the customer service in this hotel is awful  I dont make it a habit of screaming at anyone to get what I want  I dont appreciate that thats what I had to do to get us a ent nights rest for the next three nights The hotel is inexpensive but you get what you pay for  
N => Horrendous I had the misfortune of staying at this hotel last week and I can easily say it was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in  I normally dont write reviews on hotels but in this case I am compelled to let people know this is not a good choice  The rooms are small and dark and noisy  There was some kind of loud buzzing noise that would come and go usually about amthat would wake me up every morning  Tha hallways are barely wide enough to get your luggage through and the elevator is the size of a small closet Upon check out I was told they were unable to check me out  Saturday morning because there was some kind of refund on my bill and the person on the desk wasnt authorized to handle that  So it is now Monday morning and I have no idea how much my bill is or even if I have been checked out at all nor do I know which credit card the whole fiasco will be charged to  Upon calling this morning to find out I have been forced to leave my name on an answering machine and as yet have had nobody return my call I must point out that I read all of the reviews on this site before I went and all I can say is are you sure you reviewed the right placeThis is absolutely not a hotel I will ever visit again  
N => Pleased   to check out I stayed here for  nights  Thats a long time in hotel years  RoomOur room was small noisy ugly and uncomfortable  We paid for a room for  adults but got a standard double with a horrible unsupportive wire based cot squeezed in  The cot was not even unfolded on our arrival  When we unfolded the cot we had to climb over it to get to the bathroom  AppearanceThe or in the room was uninspiring  Dark mismatched worn out and dreary  The air con fridge and springy cot were very noisy and we could not unplug the fridge  The real bed was comfortable but only a double  The view out of our window was brick Dont tell yourself youll spend your time in NY outside and not in your room  Where you wake up and come home to every evening matters a great deal  This place completely lacks charm style or comfort  Service cue the tumbleweedsThe attitude of the manageress was far from friendly or helpful   rather begruding amp virging on rude  We repeatedly had to request towels for the  of us although we booked a room for  people  A fax sent to me at the hotel was not delivered  I prefer to stay in hotels where guests are valued customers and their comfort is important to the host Elevator problemsThe building has two tiny elevators only one of which was in service for part of our stay  This meant climbing stairs as the wait for the working elevator was too long  Guests on higher floors were not impressed at having to walk  As an added bonus a housekeeping trolley blocked the stair well  The upsideGood location th St is a bit messy but a short walk to nicer ones  Internet access in communal areas  Cheaper than some other midtown addresses  Take it from meStay in a real hotel   not here  This Club Quarters location doesnt feel like a club nor a hotel  If youre in town for a night or two alone or with another person you will be ok here if you are willing to cut corners for a price cut   star it isnt  If you want a nice hotel I suggest you go to the Benjamin a world apart

N => Superb customer service great location and rooms My partner and I arrived at Club Quarters late one Wednesday night due to a flight delay  We arrived at the hotel and were met by two charming young staff members one of whom said  Would you like the good news or the bad news  She explained that the hotel was overbooked but that they had a room for us in the new Club Quarters in south Manhattan  They would pay for a taxi ride to that hotel and for a return trip to the Club Quarters Rockefeller Center where we would have a very nice suite for the next three nights of our stay I said that we would prefer a different option in the nearby area as I had an early morning business meeting the next day and had selected this particular Club Quarters because it was only  blocks from my meeting  We had arrived in the middle of the UN opening week traffic was chaotic and I didn t know the subway system well enough The staff members said that they would try to find an nearby alternate  In the meantime they directed us to a nice all night deli nearby where we could grab a bite to eat  When we returned they informed us they had found a room at a nice boutique hotel just five blocks away  Because we had prepaid the reservation they ided to give us exact cash for payment of our room the next morning  They gave me an envelope stuffed with cash They also gave us  for a taxi ride to the alternate hotel which we pocketed as it was an easy walk  And they gave us a gift certificate for  nights lodging at any Club Quarters in the US  They then concluded with an assurance that we would have a very nice suite when we returned the next day for the last three nights of our stay We got to the alternate boutique hotel and discovered we were checking into a room with a  per night rate  But the Club Quarters staff had given us exactly the right amount in cash to fully payfor the room the next morning We returned to the Club Quarters at  PM the next day  Our suite was ready  It was on the th floor and as promised was a corner suite with a lovely view of St Patrick s Cathedral The room was spacious nicely appointed very clean  We appreciated the complimentary bottles of water near the elevator on our floor  There was a computer and printer on the seventh floor available to us on Sunday morning to print out boarding passes There were a few quirks a small lobby a quirky elevator and a bit of a delay in getting our luggage from storage on a different floor than the lobby  But all in all this was a very nice place to stay  And I must commend the management for empowering their desk staff to deal with an overbooking in such an imaginative though costly way  We will speak highly of Club Quarters to many people and already have and will definitely plan to stay there on our next visit to NYC  
N => Nice place close to everything Priceline is always the luck of the draw  Your never sure where you might be put up  This time we lucked out  The place was definitely a great buy for NYC  Check in was quick and friendly  The room was clean modern small but for NYC I would consider it average in size  The view from the room faced th ave and looked down upon St  Pats  The bed cart was requested at check in and was brought up within  minutes  Checking out we requested they hold one bag so we could walk around the city  They did so graciously and charged us nothing  My only complaint and this is really trying to find something wrong with the place but it would have to be the elevator and using your room card to access your floor  Once you got use to it and choose the floor quickly after inserting the card you were all right   but it takes something to get use to  If your going to a play on Broadway or just looking to hang around Mid Town you can go wronger here  Highly recommend  
N => um   ok not exceptional This place is ok not great  The location is perfect for people who want to shop and do broadway  The hotel just has some frustrating aspects  It seems silly but number  annoyance is the elavator  You have to use your card to get to the floor you want which I understand adds a level of safety but it doesnt actually work  How many times I had to go up and down al  floors to get to my floor you wouldnt believe  I wasnt the only one too  Also the ladies who do housekeeping talk no yell back and forth across the hallway to each other from different rooms early in the morning  Not fun when you are trying to sleep  
N => Disappointing We usually stay at the Club Quarters downtown by wall street which is very quiet and reasonable priced on the weekends  We chose the Rockerfeller Center location for this Saturday night because we were going to the theatre  I was extrmemely disappointed  The room was clean and comfortable but even smaller hard to believe than the CQ downtown  The HVAC did not work and the walls were so paper thin we could hear conversations in the rooms on either side of us  Even the bathroom walls WITHIN our room were so thin you could hear everything  The elevators are EXTREMELY slow  At check in we arrived at  we were told they were still cleaning rooms and we should have a seat  Another couple walked in immediately behind us and were given their room  I stood and asked if we could get OUR room and they said quotOh surequot If I hadnt had asked who knows how long I would have been sitting there We will go back downtown next time  Worth a long walk or subway ride  
N => Great spot to perch in midtown Small but efficient and spotless room  Was upgraded at check in and got into room early  Good service on several requests  TV remote was missing but they sent one right up  
N => Great location great access My Wife and I visited New York to celebrate our th Wedding Anniversary and stayed at Club Quarters  We had a wheelchair to deal with and the location from this point of view was great  Minutes from Times Square St Patricks Central Park Broadway amp shopping in th amp th avenue not forgetting the Rock itself  Even with a wheelchair the trip to the top of the Rock was tremendous and a Must do We didnt spend much time in the Hotel restaurant as the choice all around is one of the pleasures to savour  We also had the wheelchair accessible room which was big enough for both of us to move around without bumping into each other  
N => Offers so much but lacks on delivery The hotel offers so much   great location great facilities e g  free internet printing lounge kitchenette in some rooms great price for a New York hotel but   the staff need more training in customer service and the lift takes for ever  I had problems with my room   blocked toilettelephone didnt work distinct smell of previos occupant a smoker or pet owner  I had to complain  times before someone finally fixed the toilet  I complained and was upgraded but the staff didnt tell me about the telephone messages received when my phone was not working  A few hours before final check out my toilet was blocked again and so was the only public access toilet in the hotel  I was offered another room for my last  hours there   nice offer but all I wanted was a toiletThere were lots of unhappy people riding the lifts  This hotel offers so much potential but fails to deliver  They need better trained staff and need to maintain their facilities especially the lift service and toilets to a better standard  
N => Highly recommended Just came back from a  night stay in this hotel  Selected the standard room with queen bed rate was US  This was a holiday for me and my wife and this room suits us fine  Room was clean and well maintained and facility was good  But room was quite small we had two pieces of luggage and that was about all the room can accommodate comfortably Apparently you can request for fridge or even microwave to be sent to your room for your use without charge but I wonder where they are going to place it Location was excellent nothing much to do at night but this is well within walking distance to all tourist sites   Central park Times Sq even Macys Do avoid the SushiAnn Japanese restaurant unless you are planning for an expensive and raw dinner They do charge US  for each toll free call that you make  
N => Quiet Hotel Just Outside Everywhere  My wife and I needed somewhere to stay in Midtown for our rd Anniversary weekend and after an exhaustive search on TA AMEX Travel Hotels com etc  I picked the CQ in Rockefeller Center  I wanted something that looked fairly new wasnt outrageously expensive and was close to everything in midtown  CQ hit all of those points easily  The hotel is literally  seconds from Radio City and Rockefeller Center by foot less than min to Times Squaremin to the theater district close to Grand Central and a doable walk to Central Park  th and Park Avenues are about mins away as well After booking via American Express Travel I called the hotel and requested an early check in  Normally pm we checked in at around AM Check in was easy via kiosk but there was an attendant close by if we needed her  It lasted all of  minutes and we were on our way to our room  When we got off the elevator the first thing I noticed was that there were only like  rooms per floor  As a result it was very quiet the entire time and I never even saw another person on our floor  Upon entering the room we noticed it was quite small but new and pretty clean  There were a few dust bunnies roaming around the desk and end tables but it wasnt so bad  The LCD TV was nice and was out of the way of everything else  There was a VGA connection to hook up your laptop to the LCD TV but the front desk said it wasnt operational yet  The room had a ent cordless phone as well as a provided Ethernet cable  Free internet was provided and for you business travelers VPN worked great The bed was nice trendy with a duvet  Air conditioning controls were bedside  We did keep getting some weird oder from the bed and I think we narrowed it down to the headboard  It is covered in a satin like material and I guess with everyones head grease it started to smell after a while  Not horrible though  The bathroom was small but clean and the sliding door really didnt do much for sound isolation  No safe in the room so we opted out of maid service and locked our laptops in out luggage  Extra towels and small freebie items are available on every other floor in cabinets by the elevators  There are also fill your own bottled water stations as well by these closets  No problems sleeping or with noise Wst on this block is very quiet at night  Room service was ent not too pricey and you have the option to order to a couple different places outside the hotel and have the food delivered to your door  and added directly to your bill FYI the outside Italian place stunk  One club level dining option with limited hours but we never looked into it as we had all our other meals planned around the city  Checkout was a breeze  We will be returning here as soon as Christmasof this year  Its a new hotel that isnt too expensive has exactly what we need and not much of what we dont  
N => Great location but that is it We stayed at Club Quarters in ust   On my only previous trip to NYC we stayed at the Embassy Suites   a wonderful place but too far away from the Theatre District  We were referred to the hotel by a local university that we were visiting for my teenage dhter  The first Club Quarters we tried was sold out so we were referred to this location  There were three of us   me and my two teenagers  The location was excellent   just a block from th Avenue and a few blocks from Broadway  It was an easy walk to anywhere  I was very disappointed with rest of my stay  The room was very clean but very tiny  I knew the hotel was meant for a business traveller but they should not even allow  in a room  With a rollaway bed and paying a premium for the third person there was no room to move  You had to climb over the bed to get to the bathroom  Service was only fair  We were without the complimentary internet service for  of our  days  The exercise area was closed due to remodeling  It was our understanding that the breakfast was not free but person  We had to find extra towels for ourselves  Like the other reviewers elevator service was poor and there was no view out of our window except for the building next door  Noise level from the street was loud even  floors up especially when the Today Show was having a free concert Overall I would not stay here again unless I was alone  The location was convenient but I would rather stay a little further out and get a larger room  
N => Price isnt everything We stayed for  nights at the Club Quarters Hotel in first week in ch  The location is perfect right across from Rockefeller Center between th and th avenues We booked an efficiency room which is slightly larger than the standard room and includes a wet bar micro fridge and a very small sitting area with one chair  Any requests for extra pillows towels etc were answered in no less than  minutes  There arent really any drawers to speak of to store your clothes and the bathroom is tight for two people  Lobby is very small and the front desk people are not at all efficient in handling the back up The restaurant is the Terrace Club on the th floor and it is PRIVATE a fact which no one informed us until the rd day we were there  Everytime we got on the elevator and tried to use our key to gain access to the restaurant we had trouble usually there was another hotel guest on whose key worked  On the rd day when no one was on the elevator to help us we went down to the lobby to complain our key didnt work  We were informed that we were staying at the Rockefeller Center Hotel floors  through  are open to the public  Floors above  you have to be a member of Club Quarters to stay there  No where did our confirm say we were staying at the Rockefeller Center Hotel and not the Club Quarters  Since we were not members in order to dine at the restaurant we had to pay   a day extra for that privilege  Meredith at the front desk was snooty and rude to say the least upon delivering this message and treated us coldly the rest of our stay  We were also charged a second person fee nightly for the room  Also not disclosed on the confirm or by reservations when booking the room  We have been coming to NY for  years and have stayed at the Waldorf Palace Carlyle and Pennisula Hotels so the hidden charges werent too much for us to pay it was just how the information was not known until we encountered problems  And how we felt as if we were second class citizens because we were not quotmembersquot  To save   per night it is not worth it to us and we will not be staying here again  
N => We Loved Club Quarters Rockefeller Center We just returned from a stay at Club Quarters Rockefeller Center      The hotel was perfect from start to finish  My husband and I booked two rooms as his parents were joining us for an extended weekend in NYC  I contacted the hotel a few days prior to our arrival to request the rooms be close to each other  They assured me they would be and our wish was granted   the rooms were right next door to each other  We checked in at  pm and did not experience any of the trouble discussed in other posts on here  The lobby of the hotel is very small but that is to be expected in NYC  The check in process was less than  minutes and we were on our way upstairs  Each room was very spacious for NY standards and our room even overlooked the skating rink   Rockefeller Center  The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was spotless  I was very impressed with the rooms for the night we paid  The room was clean each day before we returned  One note about housekeeping in the bathroom there is only one washcloth unless you ask for an additional one  We had no problem with one but my inlaws found this weird  To each his own I guess  One of our favorite aspects of the hotel was the lounge on the th floor  Here you can enjoy high speed internet at the computer terminals or watch TV on the flat screen  Also we ordered food from the bar to eat while we rested on Sunday and cht our favorite football team It was very neat  There is also a fireplace in the lounge as well as a terrace  It was too cold to use it to eat but there were great views for picture taking Check out was also very smooth and we even booked a return car to the airport via the front desk  Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and cannot wait to return  We have stayed at Club Quarters Midtown on th street and it pales in comparison  We would definitely stay at this location  
N => Worth the money   but check in early We stayed in the Club Quarters Rockefeller Center the first week of ober First we checked in late and just like the other gal who posted here and checked in late   we were booted Our experience was awesome however  We were sent to a nearby hotel that was much nicer  In addition they handed us cash which more than covered taxi fare  They also gave us a certificate for a free room for a future date at any Club Quarters in the USA The hotel is very utilitarian  Not at all fancy  A little disorganized The lobby has a single desktop to greet customers  the staff are nice but the hotel overbooks and then the front staff has to deal with irate customers  They were extremely nice and brought my ire down very gently   I admired these folks  We checked in at PM   the LAST thing I wanted to hear was that our pre booked and pre paid room was given to someone else Seems if you check in late this  not be an isolated incident   so think twice if you cant get here early The rooms are clean and efficicient  Not fancy  But all we wanted was clean and a good area and this hit both benchks just fine The Terrace on the th floor is awesome  Great view  Comfortable TV area with couches and chairs  We used the computers their every day to rest and check emails  My son played video games which he appreciated after we toured the city all day long The location couldnt be better  Central to everything extremely safe   even walking around with my son at am Overall things worked out well  However I am fairly flexible They were VERY generous to quotmake things right quot I appreciate that  But even though our replacement hotel was AWESOME   it was still a bummer moving all our stuff to a second location and back the next day  
N => Girls weekend best place to stay As a first time visitor this is a perfect hotel easy walk across the street from the grayline bus tour the Lion King  blocks and Carmines lt block from Lion King  Everything was right there  We even had a craving for Chinese at pm and the fromt desk directed us to a nice litte Chinese Restaurant Pearls a block away  With room having fridge and microwave we got water at ket a few blocks away and carried our own water  One thing I found out later to see Ground Zero in  t you need to go up into the rd floor of McDonalds to see the actual site due to the curtains around the sites  Hotel was great location to be near all the Broadway shows and have room for  to stay in  room and have a great view Just get the king premium view to get a good view  You can request high floors but to actually get one you need to get the premium view when you book accoording to several others in the elevators  There were no other hotels as close to time squareon time square  We could see the ball from our room  But could not hear any noise while in our rooms  It was perfect not a thing I would have asked to be changed  
N => In the heart of the action You are in the heart of the Broadway district at this hotel  Right across the street from the discount theater tickets booth  We didnt need to take a cab anywhere we felt we were close enough to walk to all our destinations  The food is pretty expensive nearby but we did find a diner that locals got to about  blocks away  We had a room up high the view was great  Be aware the bright lights are lit all night long and shine in to the room   the price you pay for a great view  The room was clean and comfortable  We didnt eat the hotel but greatly enjoyed the warm chocolate chip cookies available anytime of the day  We would definately return to this hotel on future visits  
N => Expensive st Central Clean super efficient We stayed in this very clean super efficient hotel  We had a premium king on the nd floor and there was a sofabed in the luvingroom which was very comfortAble  Security aS good location was great  Drawbacks Super Douper expensive even booking  months in advance  
N => Location and space cant be beat I concur with the other reviews   good room size comfortable bed and pillow and dark curtains that blacked out the neon signs  The pull out couch had very dirty cushions but the bed portion was fine  The bathroom was fine not super clean but sufficient  Good AC  The brunch was nice but expensive  
N => Sweet Summer Deal not sweet for us We ided on the Sweet Summer Deal for our trip to NYC with our granddhters  The information on the web site did not state if the childrenage  would need to order from the childrens menu so I called the hotel to ask  I was told that they could order anything from the regular menu  On our first night the waiter told us that the S S Deal required that the children order from the childrens menu  I explained that I was told that the children could order from the regular menu  The waiter said he was sorry but that was the rule for that special  I went downstairs and spoke with the manager  He also told me that the deal required the children to order from the childrens menu  I pointed out that the rules did not make that clear so I had called the hotel before making reservations  The manager then agreed contact the restaurant and tell them that the children could order from the regular menu  Im not sure if the food we received was a result of going to the management but our rolls were too hard to cut with a knife and the smoked salmon salads consisted of a small thin piece of smoked salmon with two little greens on top  We went to another restaurant later that evening for dinner  We ided that we would not eat lunch or dinner there for the remainder of our stay  The bottom line is we paid more than the basic cost of the room for the SS deal thinking that the girls lunches and dinner would be included  Because of our experience the first night we had our meals elsewhere  We did not get what we paid for  I wrote a review to Doubletree but they have not bothered to reply  The hotel was fine and the breakfast buffet was fine the lunch and dinner deal was a waste of money  
N => Awesome experience Youll LOVE it Just got back from a weekend stay at the Doubletree  We are a family of five and had plenty of space  We were able to check into our room at  pm  All of the staff from front desk to bell service to restaurant servers and bartenders and to security were top notch  Fantastic location   right in the heart of the action    but quiet and very comfortable when you are inside your room  We enjoyed a suite on the nd floor  Fantastic view We would definitely stay here again 
N => location is spot on stayed  nights on our second visit to the big apple awful check in rooms not ready etc eventually got our key   hours after arrival and after complainingrooms are spacious but it is a suite hotel so you would expect this or a little tired everything else average nothing special but then you dont go to NYC to sit in your room the whole timewould recommend pureply for the location but the service leaves a lot to be desired im afraid  
N => Dealing with the front desk staff was a pleasure Daniel Dais Jenny and Stanley are great assets to this hotel Friends and I stay at this hotel every year and we are all Hilton Honors Members  We could not accomplish anything dealing directly with HHonors prior to our trip  Once we got to NYC and explained our dilemma to Daniel at the front desk he immediatly without any hesitation told us what to do to be able to use our points for this stay  He saved us  dollars and was happy to do it This pattern of excellent service was evident all weekend Jenny gave us her quotquot pins just for fun     Stanley in security lhed with us everytime we asked him to take our photos    and we cannot forget Dais It all started with Daniel   Hilton should know these employees definitely have the companies best interest at heart We hope they are there when we return next year 
N => Excellent Hotel in Fantastic Location with Exemplary Service My wife teenage dhter and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square ust     We were greeted quickly by a valet who ensured our car was parked quickly and then were greeted at the reception desk by Michael whose professionalism and wonderful attitude are very worthy of commendation and recognition  Since we were unfamiliar with this property and the room layout and locations we let him select our room  We could not have been more pleased  The corner suite on the th floor was fantastic  The room and bathroom were very clean and housekeeping did a wonderful job making up the room quickly when we went out rather early each morning  I could not speak more for the overall hotel staff everyone we met was very helpful  In fact returning late from the theatre on Saturday eve we were very thirsty and asked a woman at the front desk if there was anyplace we could purchase water  She offered to have it sent up to our room  Im so sorry I didnt get her name but I know the manager reads these posts and I hope she is recognized  By the way the fact that the manager reads these posts shows itself a commitment to exemplary customer service  The security at the hotel was fantastic  You had to show a room key before you could gain access  We always felt very safe and secure  The location was incredible   central to everything I highly recommend this property and would not hesitate to stay again  
N => Great place staff and location We stayed here ust  amp    From the moment we were greeted at the door by the security guard to the receptionist on the rd floor everyone was very professional  Our only knock we arrived at  a m  and was told our room would be ready by  p m    We came back then we have a  year old and he wanted to rest and the room was not ready they kept pushing back  minutes  We went to restaurant host sat us down brought us great warm cookies and water shortly after Diana from reception came and got us  Our room was ready by  and it was a great room corner looking south on Broadway  Room was very clean and comfortable  Though it was a non smoking floor only the th is for smoking the room had the smell of smoke  We called and they said they would switch us our spray the room  We stayed and it turned out o k  Highly recommend this place  Right in the middle of Time Square and everyone was very nice  
N => Huge room great location and free cookies Spent  nights at the Doubletree Suites in Times Square with husband and  kids  amp   Booked  nights with points and paid for  night at a AAA rate  Got a  room king bed suite on a premium floor actually the top rd floor  Kids slept on the sofa bed which was actually quite comfy for them and we had the bed in a arate room  Shared bathroom with access from both rooms  Tremendous amount of space for NYC amp heart of times square location  Really enjoyed our stay and everyone slept great  And couldnt beat what we paid Check in on Thursday was a chaos but the hotel handled it well  Arrived at the hotel around pm to find the lobby full and a long line to check in  Apparently the hotel had a large group taking up the toppremium floors that werent expected to check out until pm so they didnt have many room available for checkin  As an incentive to get us to come back later to check in and get our room they offered us a free upgrade to a premium floor th floor and up I believe versus the night upgrade Id pre requested plus breakfast for the  of us for each night of our stay  Breakfast buffet was day for  adults children so that was the real clincher for us  We took the offer and checked our bags until after dinner when we were able to check in for real did have to wait in line again and get our rooms and free cookies  The hotel did offer water fruit juices and cookies to everyone waiting in the lobby for rooms so that was nice of them We had  reservations given the nature of our stay points  paid and they were able to link them together at checkin so we didnt have to switch rooms  It did create a hiccup with the free breakfast on the nd day but we were able to get them to adjust their records easily  I had a  coupon towards food and beverages that I got from their website which is good during a reward stay but we ended up not using it since the breakfasts were covered and it didnt apply to tips  But it would have been handy if we hadnt gotten the free breakfasts Check out on Sunday morning wasnt bad but the hotel had given everyone checking out a note that checkout was supposed to be hectic and no late checkout requests would be honored  There was a running race going on when we left that meant we had to walk to th avenue to get a taxi but it wasnt too bad otherwise  We never had problems getting a taxi during our stay though if heading uptown it  be better to walk to th to get a taxi since the drivers have to go so far out of the way to turn back north around times square  
N => Excellent Times Square Location Large Rooms   Good Hotel Our e  stay at the Doubletree Times Square was the nd time Ive stayed there   but for a variety reasons it will probably be my last  While the Doubletree Times Square is in a fantastic Times Square Location   right across from the TKTS booth   its just become too crazy of a location for my tastes   Especially with all of the Grayline Bus Tour Hawkers swarming people as they are walking down the sidewalks Grayline Tours solicting there must be new in recent years as I dont remember this  This just leads to the sidewalks getting backed up and causing more mass confusion  Perhaps since Ive been to NYC a number of times in the last  years Im now more open to staying off Times Square   however   still would like to be in the Theatre District   but more near Hells Kitchen etc  Anyways if you are not one for being thrown into throngs of people as soon as you exit your hotel   I do not recommend staying here   but I do have to say that the Doubletrees room size is very large compared to other NYC hotels  Tons of space which we liked since we were in NYC for  nights  Another downside we experienced was due to the fact that we used Hilton points for our stay and this was the first time we ever experienced with a Hilton propertyriott property trying to put us in a sub standard room just because we used points and a lot of points at that  The front desk treated us like we were country bumpkins and put us in a pretty crummy room   and acted like we were suppose to be grateful   well after us giving pushback they relented and moved us to the room that we expected when we booked   telling us the whole time that the problem was that we booked our room though the Hilton Honors line and not though the hotel directly blah blah blah  Basically I agree with many of the other reviewers that the Front Desk staff was off putting and I dont care if its NYC or not   the bottom line is that NYC Tourism is suffering like everywhere else in the US and they are not booking all of their rooms which was definitely the case while we were there so they  want to take some customer service lessons from Disney Publix etc  However the other staff members we ran into the restaurant staff engineers bellmen housekeeping etc  were awesome so that offset our snooty check in staff  We basically ate in the hotel restaurant every day since we had free breakfast due to hubbys Hilton Honors status and we found it very good with lots of variety   but not sure if we would have eatten there often if our breakfast wasnt free since it was approx     per person for breakfast   which is a standard price at NYC hotels   we would have eaten at delis or at PAX  Would I stay here again Perhaps if the room was free   like it was this time   or it would have to be a bargain compared to other hotels   Oh other complaint is that it didnt have free internet access in the room   could have free access in the business center or lobby  However this is like many of the other NYC hotels   which is another NYC tourism issue  
N => Hard to find similar hotel in NYC I visit NYC every  months and have stayed in so many different hotels by now  We booked Doubletree Guest Suites this time to celebrate a birthday and this hotel just beats them all Having so much space in a hotel room in New York is a rare sight  Service was excellent  The location is unbeatable  Cant wait to go back  
N => Drivers Beware The hotel was roomy enough for us and quite comfortable  We never waited for an elevator and any staff member that we encountered was helpful and friendly  It was convenient to the subway and there are tons of places to eat  I personally wouldnt stay in the location again I dont think just because I couldnt stand the crowds around Times Square  But that has nothing to do with the hotel  We ate at the restaurant once which was really good but expensive  My biggest complaint was in trying to find either the self parking no mention of location on the site or valet the site tells you to pull up to the loading dock on th St which doesnt appear to exist  It also says dont pull up in front of the hotel  After a trying time in driving around the city twice I called the hotel and found out that the self parking was a non descript garage down the street that said  hour parking  Okay how was I to know that The valet parking was available in front of the hotel where the site tells you not to stop  Well between the taxicabs loitering in front of the hotel and the few cars waiting there to loadunload there was no place for us to stop anyway  We traveled the streets again and ended up at the self parking garage which was fine  Perhaps if staying there and driving you might want to call the hotel first to find out what the latest parking instructions are  
N => Best Hotel Stay Yet y    y   we had a wonderful experience at this location  The staff was great On our first night there was a problem with the TV  We called maintenance and they came right away and replaced our TV with a new one  When the TV went out it left a smell dying TV smell  We asked if it was possible to change rooms  They sprayed this room and we could have stayed but they had a bellman there in less than  minutes to move us to another room  They were very professional kind and accommodating   no questions asked  The staff is to be commended  Throughout our stay the restaurant staff beginning with the hostess waiters and food prep staff went out of their way to make each meal pleasant  We had breakfast there every morning  My son looked forward to going it was a very warm and inviting atmosphere   that says a lot coming from an eleven year old  The food was great as well  Housekeeping did an outstanding job  Our room was cleaned expertly every day  We requested extra towels and they were left daily without an additional request  The room was spotless upon our return  The bellmen were very helpful and were always asking ways to assist the guest  The concierge ladies did their job  They however did not exhibit the same warmth as the other hotel staff  There was a gentleman there on Saturday who was very helpful and greeted and assisted us with the same kindness as the other staff  The ladies did their job and were efficient but were not helpful  They answered your questions with yes no and I dont know responses  They also had nothing available from the hotel highlighting daily events in the city as most hotels offer  I had already mapped out most of our trip so it was not a problem but I guess I was looking for the inside scoop from someone who lived in the city and who had experience directing guest to less advertised places  Overall we would rate our stay as the best hotel experience to date  We travel frequently and have stayed in many grand and great hotels but the service and staff at this location are superior  Thanks for making our vacation memorable  
N => Not a great experience Upon our arrival we were welcomed with warm cookies and upgraded to a king bedroom  The beds were comfortable and comparable to quotMy Bed Sofitelquot The rugs were stained and old from the hallway to the bedroom  The bathroom was dirty the paint was peeling and the grout was old  Mildew covered all corners of the bathtub We were charged   extra for a minibar that we havent used before  The satff was rude Overall not a good experience and I will not return  
N => Great Hotel Made Even Better By Daniel We had put off going to NY all these years because we heard the people in NY were rude and unfriendly   but we took a chance for  days on our way to Europe  Well we ided to stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites based on their wonderful reviews   and hoped for the best  The very first person we encountered in NY   after our taxi driver   was Daniel at the front desk  He was charming funny welcoming and we truly appreciated his AMAZING room upgrade to make my th birthday celebration even more wonderful  We are Hilton Gold VIP members   and are supposed to get a room upgrade when one is available   but often the quottruequot upgrades are saved for the quotdiamondquot VIP members   and we are left to feel less like quotgoldquot and more like quottarnished brass quot But Daniel set the tone for our entire trip  He made us feel like VALUED family members   and the hotel itself is clean spacious and a welcome respite from the noisy world of Times Square just outside their door  Do take advantage of the fantastic proximity to all of the world class Broadway shows within walking distance from the hotel  And by the way we LOVED all the New Yorkers we came in contact with   so   dont delay It was a most enjoyable trip 
N => Good location for first trip to NYC    big rooms     service could have been better We were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was huge with a bedroom and arate living area  Unfortunately it was RIGHT next ot the lifts our door looked like one of the lifts  This wasnt a big deal though as you couldnt hear the lifts at all from the room  However the room became a problem when it started to stink of cigarette or cigar when we arrived back one night  This happened to us at two hotels in the US whats that about  We told reception and they acted shocked and gave us the key to another room on the corner of the building which had a much nicer layout and therefore seemed even bigger  But when we went into the bedroom area the window was open and there was a packet of cigarettes on the windowsill and someone had had a little lie down in the bed  Back we went to reception where again they were shocked  It was getting old at this point so we said they need to go and inspect the room before they give us the next key which they did  We got another corner room on a higher floor which was perfect  The rooms have a kitchenette which was really useful and the location is great you look down over times square you cant hear anything though so you dont experience the downside of the location  If we were to return though we would probably not stay in times square because its so busy and you get a bit sick of the salesmen all over the street  
N => Absolutely fantastic hotel lovely staff best location Spent a week here at Easter  Had a one bedroom suite  adults and three children  Reception area was bright and modern staff could not be more helpful  The room was spacious however the double beds were a bit on the small side  The room was on the th floor looking out onto Times Square  It was spotless clean and well equipped with a fridge microwave  A useful addition would be a kettle instead of the coffee maker but this is only a minor complaint  The location could not be better its right in the heart of Times square  We didnt use the bar or restaurant as there was much better value to be found outside  We will defnitely stay here next time we go to NY  
N => Fabulous Place Fabulous Location We arrived and were greeted by a very nice check in attendant  From that moment everything went flawlessly  They assisted with tickets to the theater recommended a couple of different places to eat and best of all they had a quotpure roomquot  Since I have asthma it was a no brainer to try this place and we were not disappointed We will be back  
N => Excellent Location We stayed here for  nights in il   Couldnt have picked a better location  Right in the heart of Times Square and right next door to a subway station LocationBeing right in TS the outside doors tend to get a little crowded but nothing major  You have to get on an elevator to get to the lobby then another elevator to get to your room  That become a little annoying after a few trips Lobby  Amenities  StaffThe lobby feels a little crowded and looks NOTHING like the pictures on Hiltons site  I didnt notice any construction but be that is the goal    We didnt use the fitness center but walked through and it was pretty small  The business center was very hot  I used it to print a few items and had some minor problems which were resolved fairly quickly I used the pre order feature which allows you to have items extra towels pillows toothbrush etc  to order a dental care kit  That wasnt in our room when we arrived but I called down and they delivered it within  minutes We ordered a cheesecracker tray which was good but VERY overpriced  Staff was outstanding overall  We had an issue with  employees one front desk one bell boy but everyone else was extremely helpful and friendly RoomWe had some HHonors points so I cant speak to the value but we were on the th floor with a times square view  We were on the corner so we could so both ends of TS and the water from our room    It was outstandingAll of the corner rooms are right next to the elevator but I didnt really notice once inside  I only heard them in the bathroom but not at all in the living room or bedroom  The room suite was on the smaller side compared to other DoubleTrees Ive stayed in but probably very large when compared to other NYC hotels  The beds were extremely comfortable  We havent slept that well in a long time  We couldnt really hear any noise from the ground level unless you opened the windows Bathroom was half remodeled but the shower was very old  Overall we couldnt have imagined a better location and overall experience  Definitely recommended Especially if you have HHonors pointsWe had very low signal on the wireless internet in our room  I never brought this to the staffs attention but it did get quite annoying on again off again  
N => Exellent view of Times Square Great Suite and Value Upon arrival the front desk had our reservation wrong but quickly corrected the problem  We really enjoyed the suite having  tvs and a corner room conference room which gave multiple views  Good location  Rooms were clean  Enjoyed the cookies  We did not go to the restaurant  Be careful with the minibar as it mischarged us and had to get the bill corrected  Overall we would definitely stay here again  
N => Excellent Service Stayed here for my second trip to NY The check in was quick amp simpleefficient whilst still friendly At our last hotel it was slowindifferent amp we had to change roomso a big plusWhilst there one of us was ill amp we asked for the cleaning staff NOT to disturb our companion confined to bed What impressed us was that they knew the room hadnt been cleaned amp rang in the evening to see if we would like it doing then Alsothe concierge confirmed our flights for us amp checked us in   a welcome load off our minds when trying to do this from abroad At all times staff were attentivehelpfulsmiley   without being insincere sounding What with thisthe location amp quietness of the roomsI wouldnt hesitate to stay here again Only slight niggle is that from the British perspectivea kettlenot a percolator amp some crockery wouldve been niceWe like our teaBut this is the fault which made the whole stay perfect   very minor 
N => Clean Modern Rooms Nice Stay Stayed  nights on a Hotwire deal and paid pn inc  Check in painless suite on th floor was nicely refurbished comfortable sofa bed nice to have the  rooms good size bathroom we were expecting  double beds but they were just oversized singles although very comfortable so we utilised the sofa as well  Great location  As per other reports we had the same problem with the wireless internet but persisted and it finally worked  I would recommend at the sort of price we paid but wouldnt want to pay rack rate  
N => ent hotel experience I stayed at the Doubletree hotel for a week in ruary  In general it is a ent place to stay the room was pretty big  bedroom  living room clean the bathroom also quite big  We booked a room on the th floor so the view was also pretty ok  The location was perfect  The only weak point was the service we have booked a room with the internet which didnt work at all during the entire week we were always told to go down to the lobby to use the free wireless  It was pretty disappointing because we payed for the internet already   After many discussions we were offered breakfast instead which was a nice but pretty late gesture though  Also the concierge was a bit weird we wanted to make reservations in a restaurant and were told to call the restaurant ourselves after some discussions the concierge allegedly called the restaurant and booked a table but when we showed up at the restaurant they did not have any reservation under our name   this being a concierge guy   the lady however was really helpful and adorable Overall it was a good stay which could have been even better with some minor adjustments  I would recommend the hotel for a NYC trip because the location is just outstanding 
N => amazing location amazing staff amazing hotel We recently took my dhter and her friend on a weekend trip to Time Square to celebrate her th birthday  It was something she always dreamed of and the trip was everything we imagined  We drove to New York from Virginia and it was a nice drive  We never experienced any major traffic issues until we got closer to Time Square but even then it wasnt that bad  i would do it again Upon pulling in front of the hotel we were truely welcomed by Vinny  He was so helpful and funny which made the stress of the traffic not noticeable  He assisted unloading our bags out of the car and escorted us to the front desk  He was very helpful in explaining everything about the hotel  We did take advantage of the Valet parking and it was well worth the money  Upon getting checked in we were helped to our room by a bell boy  We had originally had reserved the queen suite but at check in was upgraded to the king suite at no additional charge  The room was on the th floor and was amazing although we had a side view from the window it was beautiful  The bed was the most comfortable bed ever The teenagers slept on the sofa bed but slept like angels  The rooms are very comfortable spacious and well taken care of  Not only is this a beautiful hotel it was affordable and in a great location  Outside your doorway you will find the heart of Time Square but yet at night you never hear any of the city sounds and will sleep like a baby  I would recommend taking the bus tour worth the money to see all of the sites of New York  For someone who has never traveled far from my hometown this was a big adventure  And i have to say it was well worth all the memories we experienced  I look forward to planning another trip to New York and plan on staying at Doubletree Time Square again Also dont forget the delicious cookies 
N => Good experience We stayed at the Doubletree Times Square from uary   MLK weekend  Our first confusion was finding out where to park  We called the hotel from the car and ended up valeting right in front of the hotel on Broadway  When we checked out we went and got our car from the lot on th ourselves and saved  per night in parking charges  Check in was a breeze very personable especially for NYC  We had a king premium room on the th floor for only  per night AAA through the hotel website   they did not check my card  We loved the location though be warned it is right in the heart of Times Square which on the weekends is a bit crazy The room was great   plenty of room comfortable beds including the pull out  We could not figure out how to get the small refrigerator to work but everything else was in good shape   obviously recently reated  There are  flat screen TVs  Note that the kitchenette really just a mini fridge and microwave has no utensils or plates so pick up your own  
N => Misleading We stayed at the doubletree from   th     and it was not what we were expecting at all    First off we booked this stay on these specific dates because thats what date their website claimed there new lobby would finally be finished  Not only was it not finished but the carpet was totally tore up and there was very loud drilling going on for the first  days we were there  It honestly looked like a construction zone  Not to mention that even when it does get finished its a VERY small lobby and you often find yourself trying to fight through people to get to the elevator   out of the  times i ordered room service it was cold and didnt taste good at all  The one good thing i had was an outstanding pizza that might have been top  Ive ever had in my life Oh and if you want any sodas or anything like that you have to get them from the mini bar because the entire hotel does not have  vending machine You heard me right not one One can of coke costs   and if you dont feel like fighting the thousands of people on times square to get a coke then the mini bar is your only option    Also the maid service had to be reminded dailey that the mini bar needed re stocked otherwise they didnt do it  Very annoying   The shower heads are pathetic  A normal shower that would usually take me  minuets took me at least   And its goes from boiling hot to ice cold without even adjusting the temperature There were other little things here and there that happened to make me write this poor review but ill just leave it at what i wrote One amazing thing about the hotel though is the beds I have never slept so good in my life  In Fact i slept so good on this bed i ordered one the day i got home from doubletrees website where you can purchase all beds and furniture the hotel uses httpwww doubletreeathome comThe security guard Brian downstairs was one of the nicest guys you will ever meet  We would have been completely lost without him and we even wrote a letter to management about what a great job he did  
N => Great location and everything else Although I prefer more exclusive properties we ided to save a bit and go with Doubletree suite  We booked with Expedia and upon arrival got a free upgrade which was lovely  Location is simply great Great great great We walked all over the place but it was quite cold so often hurried back to relax and warm up  The room was very clean although the rest of the hotel was not kept as good but I do not expect that in such a huge place  Everything was in order in our room and the bed was perfect  Will probably stay there again   I am just too afraid of all those tiny rooms everyone is talking about when talking about NY hotels  
N => Great location thats about it The location is the best thing this property has to offer  We were aware of the lobby reation prior to arrival so we expected that not a big deal  We preordered a pack and play for the baby when we checked in they assured us it was already in the room  When we got to the room  PM it was not there  We called down they said they would bring it right up  By  Pm we still had not received it called down to the front desk they told us it would be right up  We stopped by the front desk at PM because we still had not gotten it they said it would be sent right up  At PM I went back down to the front desk and and told them we preordered it had been told several times it would be right up and that currently we had a  month old baby sleeping on the floor  Not once did anyone say they were sorry we had not received it  It was delivered about  minutes later by a very pissed employee  Every time we left the room and came back the keys did not work  Every single time  Which meant we had to go back down stairs to the front desk and wait in line to get new keys  We did not encounter one employee who smiled not one  For the price we paid for our hotel room   plus tax fro  nights you would think they would be more accommodating  
N => Perfect place for ladies shopping  A group of  women stayed here on our recent trip to NYC  It was a wonderful place to stay You can fit  adults in a suite  There are  sinks in the bathroom and one at the bar area  There is a arate fridge from the minibar  We all enjoyed the free cookies at check in but even better was the service from everyone  Rhonda at the front desk was awesome She was so patient getting all of us into rooms together  adjoining and all so quickly  The bellmen even came up to weigh our luggage so that we would know what to take out before checking in at the airport The lobby is under reation but no matter  The location could not be better nor the service  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone I plan to return  It was clean safe comfortable and affordable  
N => Great Experience Two girlfriends and I just returned from a three day trip to NYC  We stayed at the Doubletree and our experience couldnt have been better  We arrived early but were allowed to check in and go to our room  The hotel lobby is under construction but we had no problems at all  The staff we encountered were friendly and helpful  Our room was on the nd floor no special request or extra charge and it was perfect for three women traveling together we had two double beds in the bedroom and the pull out sofa in the living room plus three sinks  We heard no noise at all and had no problems with our beds they were extremely comfortable  We flew in and out of LaGuardia and had no problems with the doormen trying to get us to take a car instead of a taxi to the airport  The location of this hotel is perfect for Broadway shows and shopping  We are planning on staying here during future visits to NYC  
N => Bed bugs as well   They told us same thing never had them before Woke up aftr the first night and legs had welts on them Found it odd Next night found same problem Called housekeeping they brought another matress for the pull out in our Suite  The last night OMG it was AWFUL  The bed was full of remnants fromt he bed bugs I called housekeeping the one girl said she was sorry that the mattress they pulled from storage had not been preserved She said she would tell her supervisor of our problem The supervisor came later and said they have never had bed bugs and that it was just lint BS I took pictures of everything with a copy of that days newspaper etc THey said we will deduct the breakfast from your bill I said no that does not make up for what i endured She said that is all we can do Well I still have a bottle with those bug carcasses that i took pictures of and I will be sending them in   But now i find out another family had the same problem and they were also todl this was the first time I emailed them and they said the response the management posted to their complaint was PURE RUBBISH  She said one occurance was forgivable But two was not  And the second stay she kept the bug in a glass and they tried to tell her it was a beetle They said NO WAY  So if anyone else had to endure this problem with the doubtree on Brodway in NYC please come forward  I do not feel I or anyone else should be paying their prices for a bed bug ridden Suite  The location was great and had it not been for the bed bugs it would of been well worth it But it took two weeks to get rid of the welts on my body plus all the discomfort Dont let them lie to you or ruin your Stay In the BIG APPLE 
N => Would gladly stay here again My husband and I stayed for the first time in New York City for  nights  This hotel was right in the action of Times Square which we were not sure was a good idea  However we were pleasantly surprised with the Doubletree  The planned reations did not start until the morning we were checking out  So we did not have issues with noise dust etc  We were on the th floor and each night we slept very well  We never over heard other guests traffic staff etc  Great bed  room suite clean huge bathroom and updated or  Loved having a microwave free room safe and wet bar  We were able to have quotdinnerquot one night in our suite after shopping at Whole Foods  The hotel restaurant provided tableware for us without an issue  This hotel has the fastest elevators in town We had a spectacular rate through the hotel website and got more than we paid for  If we ever return to New York and want to be in Times Sq  we would choose this hotel  
N => Busy quiet crazy calm Yes Yes YesThis hotel is great  Clean quiet and next to all the chaos of NYCThe room which had two beds and a sofa bed was a ent size and fitted four adults  The sofa bed was a little soft but was better than sharing Being on the nd floor it was also very quiet The bathroom was also good the shower being really good and eased out those long hours of walking I did The concierge was very helpful we where able to book our bus tours and outlet store excursion there without any problems  They also offered theatre tickets but you could find a tourist centre located very close to the hotel which offered a better variety of things to do The laundry service was a little expensive considering what I had cleaned underwear etc The breakfast was expensive save your money and venture out to the many places located around the hotel When you stepped out of the hotel you where welcomed by the frenzy that Times Square is madness but I loved every minute of it Ideal location ideal hotel ideal holiday 
N => Great place to stay great location We loved the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square  The location was convienient to all Broadway Shows  We could walk anywhere we wanted to  The suites are large and clean  We will definitely return  
N => Corner rooms smaller If you like to be able to have a lot to do at night then Times Square is the place to go  and Doubletree Guest Suites is a great location  This area felt fairly safe for a woman too  Dont expect to be wowed by the entrance and lobby though  Both are pretty bare bones  The bar area was also dead  The room was clean the staff was nice and the bed and pillows were really soft  Our corner room was smaller than our friends room  Better views but noticeably smaller  This and the riott Times Square are the most conveniently located hotels that I saw while in New York  I would definitely go back  Make sure you try to get a better rate than what they quote you  
N => Poor Service Excellent location for those visiting NYC however there were service issues  Agent at check in desk took a long time to as she put it  find us a great room  it was there standard room with no special features  view corner etc  We were told it would be a  minute wait to take our bags to our room  the lobby was completley overwhelmed with carts of luggaget  It looked like baggage claim at JFK not a  night hotel We carried ours up  Security was extremley lax  we were only asked for our room keys once  Bathroom tile was cracked and the furnishings looked a bit outdated  When checking out we asked for help told they would be up in  minutes after waiting  we carried our own bags again  Improvements in staff service would greatly improve the quality of stay  
N => Family of  LOVED the Doubletree Guest Suites Our family of  recently enjoyed a great stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square  The room was large and the beds were comfortable  The bathroom was also large and clean  We didnt notice any signs of disrepair or neglect of maintenance and our suite was always very clean  The location was wonderful and centrally located  We knew we would be arriving at the hotel early so we called the night before check in  They asked us to call the hotel when we were on our way so when we arrived our room was ready  We were also allowed to check out at  on our departure date since we had a late flight  
N => Rude and Careless It appears our terrible recent experience at this hotel was shared by some more recent guests per these reviews  The positive is the location  The negatives are the rude staff for example we booked and paid for two rooms for a family of  four months ahead of time because of flight delays we were late to check in and were kept waiting at midnight for almost  minutes after a  hour commute only to be told our rooms had been given away but to try again the next night      and tired rooms  I could give another ten instances were the level of service was appalling we were charged again on checking out even though we had paid before  and yet whenever our kids asked for a cookie at reception they were reminded that only  per guest per stay was the rule but suffice to say   we have never experienced the contempt for customers we received here and will never ever return  
N => Gets Worse Every Year Check in was unpleasant  The bathroom sink drained very slowly and the room was dirty  This place gets worse every year  We will not be back  
N => CleanGood Value Ok So just got back from a five day break with the family to the Doubletrees Guest Suites Hotel in Times Square First the negatives Thankfully few  Only one TV remote for two televisions   to be honest this was not enough of a problem for me to even bother the hotel management Coffee making facilities whilst potentially great as others have mentioned the cardboard cups were a bit of a disappointment  Also on one day the milk appeared to be quotoffquot Did not try food   so cannot comment on this aspect of hotel  On the plus side   location is of course great whilst we were there my girls  and  joined a large crowd to try to catch a glimpse of Usher at the MTV shop over the road and then on our last day there appeared to be some sort of TV showaudition for the lead in Legally Blonde which was in the theatre next door Although we were in the heart of Times Square our suite on the nd floor meant that there was little to disturb us by way of traffic noise etc  The drapes did a good job of keeping out the walls of neon just when you needed them to I should also like to congratulate the hotel on its levels of cleanliness   the maids really do a good job and the rooms were spotless  Whilst returning to the airport in a shuttle we were taken to some of the other hotels used by International travellers and believe me I was glad to have chosen Doubletrees Guest Suites  
N => Horrible Upon checking in we were told we would have to wait until  or  for the room that was assigned to us check in is supposed to be at   unless we wanted to take a different code for quotless desirablequot room  We had paid extra for a room with a view of Times Square  The room itself was shabby and filthy  There were black hairs on the white sheets and on the bathroom floor  The bathroom does not have a fan so the entire suite smelled damp and musty  The people at the front desk are extremely rude and unhelpful  We have stayed here before and every year it gets worse  We will not stay here again  
N => NY Weekend The location is great if you want to be in a very busy area and its within walking distance of theaters shopping etc  We stayed the weekend Fri Sun on the th floor very quiet room but poor view  The front desk staff was very courteous quick to respond to requests and the bell staff stored our luggage until check in and at check out one bell person was rude at check out but he seemed to be having a bad day  Our room was not entirely clean   dirt on sheets hair in the bathroom   so we had to request housekeeping clean the room again which they did  The room size was adequate for  adults considered large by NYC standards but this was our first visit so hard to judge but lighting in the bedroom was below average and the bathroom lacked an exhaust fan  We plan to return to NYC next year but will probably not return to this hotel mainly because wed like to be on a less congested street and considering the costs   taxes per night we can stay somewhere nicer for the same amount  
N => Great location but sketchy service    Went to NYC for a Girls Weekend  ided to stay here for location even though much more pricey than other hotels Check in was great  Very helpful at the front desk and the concierge desk  Bell hops and restaurant staff pretty rude as we were not treated very nice  Breakfast buffett is a joke  Had to beg for silverware and they had run out of clean napkins  No one there yet had to wait  minutes for a table  Restaurant is drab and food is bad The beds are comfortable but the showers are dirty  Would probably stay somewhere else next time as way to busy area are too loud outside to sleep    
N => Paid the price to enjoy Manhattan We visited Manhattan this il and searched for an inexpensive place to stay  Tripadvisor reviews for inexpensive hotels were so terrible that I ided to go for a higher level hotel  Found great reviews for this hotel and ided to pay  per night for a family of  Turned out that it was a good deal   we got a clean well maintained and service oriented place to stay right in the middle of Manhattan so we could stroll easily to most of the attractions we were there to see  We arrived very early to the hotel much before official check in time and were given our room right away plus a warm cookie as a welcome present small gesture but pretty effective  
N => Fantastic Hotel in the middle of everything We just returned from a short stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square and it could not have been any better We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was terrific to have the extra space  We arrived at  am and our room happened to be ready even though check in isnt until  pm  Our luggage was delivered within  minutes  We booked the American Girl package and my dhter received a special bed blanket and pillow for her American Girl doll  She was thrilled The room had a microwave and small fridge which was nice to have when traveling with children  The staff from the doorman the guest services representative concierge to housekeeping were friendly and helpful  We ate dinner one evening in the hotel restaurant and the food was very good  This hotel is right in the middle of Times Square and you can walk to just about everything  We will definitely be back Check out the Evergreen Diner around the corner for a great breakfast 
N => Central position ided to stay here as we were travelling with two teenagers  Times Square was a great position for the teenagers but too busy and crowded for me and my husband  It would have been really bad in the summer  Having said that the hotel was fine and the staff helpful  Rollaways are not available which meant my husband had to sleep on the not very comfortable pull out couch Had a two bedroom suite in the Eastgate Towers last year which overall I prefered  
N => Falling Standards Stayed again in  this year we have stayed several times before but I think it will be the last time  Used to be our hotel of choice in NYC but the standards keep falling  Possibly the worst bit was a truly awful room service meal on Valentines night and the lack of any real desire to sort the problem  The size of the rooms are on the large side but there are better places in NYC for the same money  Sort yourselves out Doubletree  
N => Awesome ONLY way to do Times Square  This was a stay surrounding a long weekend to see a play and go shopping  It was amazing Great service and a BEAUTIFUL view of Times Square  Go for the Square view it is worth it tenfold  Comfy bed great amenities   walk right out into the action of Broadway and everything else NY has to offer  The staff was courteous and the room service was delicious  Enjoy We even ided to add a night and the staff was great enough to keep us in the same room even though it was already booked  Thanks Doubletree 
N => Accommodation I went to New York with my  year old dhter for the first time in ober   We were originally allocated a king suite on arrival  While it had a lovely view the sofa bed was unusable as the springs could be felt through the thin mattress  I complained to reception and was reallocated a room with double beds as I had paid for   but no view  Apparently the room type is not guaranteed if not booked directly with the hotel  The sofa bed was better than the first one but far short of the comfort of the bed  The result was that my dhter slept in my room  I found this extremely inconvenient and made the accommodation poor value for money   at around    per night I expected to be able to fully use both rooms as bedrooms and I could have saved a lot if I had been prepared to settle for a suite with both sleeping in one room  On check out I reported that my dhters MP player was missing  I followed up with an email complaint when I got home   but they did not even bother to reply Good location but could have done better for the money  Safe was very awkward to use at it was at the bottom of a cupboard   but dont be tempted to leave valuables out P S  We still had a great holiday  
N => Great Location But Is It Worth It There is no doubt Christmas is the best time in New York especially for this warm weather Texas couple  We wanted to stay on Times Square because of the central location lights and just plain interest in doing so first time  We knew the price would be high    per night high floor Times Square view but we also expected some value for the dollars spent  The good things Excellent concierge service especially for directions  Very central location   everything is easily in walking distance including a great Irish pub just around the corner  Metro is right next door  Hotel is clean with all suites we had a problem   more below our friends did not  The bad things we left the hotel each day by mid morning and each day when we returned   late afternoon   the room was not made up  A daily call had to be made to remind the hotel we had been forgotten   even after late afternoon returns  When offered a room off of the elevator banks I should have known better DO NOT accept the offer even if promises are made this is an excellent suite  It is not   more hallway than room no room in the bedroom and no room in the second room   great view but NO room to move around  One would think the elevator noise would be overpowering   it was not   didnt even hear it thus our reason to stay in this room foolish us  Yes ask for the view on a high floor   its worth it but do not accept a suite behind the elevator banks  You will need to leave the room just to make up your mind  Prices are high in the lounge but to be expected  Bring your own computer     a minute is a bit much in the business center  No need to eat at the hotel   just not worth the price or effort as there are way too many great eateries close by  Also forget the door man in front   too busy to get you a cab dont know why but thats not their thing  We did like the security and the resulting peace of mind  Would we stay again Really once you have stayed on Times Square there is really no reason to do it again  There are plenty of great hotels in Manhatten and its so easy to get around so why pay the price to stay on Times Square Got to do it once though and if you want a suite two rooms the Doubletree is okay albeit the value is just not there  Perhaps the W across the street has a better feel for how to take care of their customers   certainly having to ask the Doubletree front desk to clean the room each day   sometimes twice in a day   after some hard walking sightseeing and shopping is not our idea of great servicevalue for the price paid  
N => Spectacular Location Big room for New York standards  Close to everything but can be a bit hectic getting there due to all the traffic in Times Sq   Breakfast was included since Im a Gold Hilton Honors Member  Pretty standard stuff but nice since it is free  Rooms were clean and comfortable  Two room suite definitely helps you spread out a little especially after fighting the crowds just to get to the front door  Great for the first time visitor to NYC since everything most people want to see is within walking distance  
N => Poor value and poor response to complaints I stayed here for  nights in tember  with my two sisters  We arrived very late in the day after a long flight from London  I had specified that we wanted two beds plus a sofa bed however the sofa bed was broken  We called the reception desk but they didnt have any solution to offer  There wasnt even any bedding for the sofa bed in the room so we had a very uncomfortable first night and were unable to unpack  The next morning we were allocated a different room to which we moved ourselves  The very nice lady on reception offered us complimentary breakfast for our entire stay to make up for the bad start  We thought this was fair and accepted  The breakfast is expensive and we had not planned to eat in the hotel otherwise  By the way with taxes the cost of our stay was  USD  So I was annoyed to find on departure that my credit card had been billed for breakfast for three for the first two days of our stay   another   USD  We probably wouldnt have spent that for the whole week There was no one on reception when we left at  a m  so I have been trying ever since to get a refund  Its been promised more than once but still no show  Every mail I send seems to sit around for at least  weeks before I get another hopeless response  I just ided to stop wasting any more of my time and share my experience instead  I wouldnt use this hotel again even though its a good location  I feel it was very expensive for the standard of service we received and Ive been more than disappointed by the lacklustre response to my complaint  
N => Mostly Good My family and I stayed at Doubletree Time Square for  nights a few days ago  This was our nd stay at this property  Our first stay was in   I must say that our first stay was a better one  Although I would still recommend the hotel there are a few things that I would want others to be aware of  We asked for a Time Square View and we got one  We were given a corner room which sounds great but the room was much smaller than the typical  room suite  I would recommend that you stay away from the corner units if you are traveling with children and are hoping for the extra room  The view though was pretty good  The room we stayed in wasnt exactly the cleanest room  A few lights were out  Im sure they just needed a light bulb  Some of the outlets did not work  The hair dryer did not work either  All of these things are just minor inconveniences that could easily be corrected  The main negative was the lack of space in our room  This room would have been fine for  people but we were traveling with  children and it was very tight quarters  Also you lose the nd vanity in the corner rooms  Overall though you cant beat the value  
N => Great hotel What a fantastic hotel great location and super views over times square from our th floor Super size suite but sofa bed not that big but okay for kids No free wireless in room can pay  gym was good and all hotel staff helpful  I liked the idea that everyone had to show room card to enter hotel felt very safe Straight out door onto Times Square but in room no sound could be heard great peaceful nights  Super fast lifts As another review stated we found fridge was defrosting when arrived and shower curtain was smelley but only minor things We would stay again Great place for breakfast round the corner called quotEvergreensquot we went there every day  Also use underground trains to get around  dollars for any trip  
N => Great City  okay hotel Having already been to NYC my husband and I thought it would be fun to bring our  girls to NYC for a family vacation  When my husband and I went a few years ago we stayed at the riott quis which I will do again next time I go  Trying to save money we booked The Double Tree Suites this time  What they call a suite is tiny for five us although we were told we would be comfortable  We thought we could put our  and  year old dhters on the pull out couch to sleep   it was very uncomfortable We ended up pulling the matress off of the pull out couch and put it on the floor for them to sleep  We were told we would get a suite with a view of Time Sqaure   what view      I looked at an office building from my window for  days Which was very disappointing since the view we had at The quis was fabulous   and my kids really missed out Speaking of windows they looked like they hadnt been cleaned in a very long time The room as a whole was okay clean just smaller than expected  The staff was okay and prompt when asked for extra things such as pillows  
N => Exceeded My Expectations We booked the Hilton Doubletree on Times Square not expecting the highest level of service and room accomodation but boy were we wrong On arrival at the reception desk we were pleasantly greeted and were informed that our room was ready and due to us being a Hilton Honours Gold member were immediately offered a free full house breakfest for the duration of our stay We were also delighted with our room which was located on the top floor rd  On setting up my laptop in the suite I was also given free wireless internet access due to my gold membership with hilton The views from our room were great overlooking times square and the room itself was well presented with a coffee machine microwave minibar and safe  Having stayed at the W Hotel on times square which is also supurb but now having stayed at the Doubletree Suites I will definately return here or another Doubletree establishment  The only issues we had was queuing for breakfast in the morning but as it was holiday season this was understandable  Overall would recommend to any family wanting to stay in new york  
N => Double the fun at Doubletree It looked like this was going to be a bad review  It was my twin sister and I first time in New York Our room was spacious and the beds were heavely but the room had a slight damp odor  When we came back we saw why  the air conditioner had leaded in the room  They cleaned up the mess  We went out and came back again  Still an odor  Always speak upWe called the desk and they changed our room   to a room with a horrible view of an air condtioner unit  Complained we were not paying this hotel price for such mess  They upgraded us to the conference suite Nothing more to add  It was utterly amazing with a wrap around view of Times Square in this huge suite It was a major plus for such a simple thing but getting a freshly made warm chocolate chip cookie at check in or any time you requested was such a treat The only thing was the doormansecurity and if he JUST saw you go in and out he still insisted on seeing your hotel card to go in   they didnt even do that at the quotWquot  
N => Great Place to Stay in NYC Great place to stay in NYC  We were a family of  including two teenagers who were in New York for their first time  The sofabed in the lounge was fine for them while we grown ups enjoyed the privacy of our own bedroom with a very comfortable bed  I cant recognise some of the other reviews   the suite was very clean modern and nice  I couldnt fault the maid service  The fridge was a great plus  The receptionists were delightful and very helpful as was the concierge directing us to the best place to buy i pods  We had free local calls and wi fi which we found very useful  It wasnt cheap   which is why I wouldnt give it a    but I was very happy in terms of value for money and would certainly go back We used Grays open top bus tours based in Times Square and found them great and good value  We went on the downtown uptown and night tours   all excellent  Although we HATE getting up in the morning we managed to do so on the Sunday and used the subway across the street to travel down to catch the first ferry   to the Statue of LibertyEllis Island  No linequeue at all   even in ust   and we walked straight on to the boat  When we got back we couldnt believe the length of the linequeue in Battery Park Cabs were cheap and easily available everywhere  Our highlight sad to say but be understandable after all the walking we did was the  minute chinese massage available on SatSun at the street kets on th and th  There was never a  better spent  FantasticBefore we went I googled an internet site which gave me half price   and first class  rows from front in the stalls   tickets to Les Miz which we all absolutely adored  The only problem is finding a table for a pre theatre meal  My advice is to try to book in advance  
N => Great Place We just got back from a four day trip and stayed  nights at Doubletree Time Square  The check in was no problem  We got there at  a m and the room wasnt ready but then we didnt expect it to be so early  They checked all our luggage and away we went  We we got back in about  p m  they sent our luggage up and of course we got  hot cookies to take with us  We stayed on the th floor and although we didnt have a view we werent in our room much anyways  The rooms are spacious and CLEAN  If there were bedbugs they must have been asleep on the comfortable beds and pillows  The entrance is busy but thats to be expected where its located  Loved that they checked for room key everytime we tried to go up  My  year old son couldnt even get up once after he went sightseeing without a key  Check out was fast and they held out bags while we finished in NYC  Would definately stay here again  
N => Great central location if you want to be in the middle of it all I recently stayed at this Doubletree property for the second time and I highly recommend it if you want to be in the middle of it all My mom who is a senior accompanied me last year but we were staying in a hotel closer to uptown  She had some trouble with all the walking so this year I booked us right in Times Square and it was the perfect location for us We had tickets to quotLegally Blondequot which was right next door and also quotThe Drowsy Chaperonequot which was basically right across the street  We also used the hop on and off tour buses which are good for  hours as our quotpublic transportationquot and they boarded right across the street too We were pleasantly surprised with our room since we happened to get a corner room with two views overlooking Times Square and we love the suite set up The bed was extremely comfortable and we were not disturbed by any noise from below  We were on the th floor  We wished they sold the chocolate chip cookies there Too bad you only get them at check in Heck   those cookies alone almost make it solely worth staying there We also really appreciate that you have to produce your key card to access the hotel itself  I generally feel safe when traveling but you can never take too many precautions either  And yes you do sometimes have to work your way through the crowd to get into the hotel but again if you want to be in the center of it all then this hotel is a perfect choice 
N => Bed Bugs Galore Stayed here for  days during the st week of   very noisy and extremely crowded but good location Shower curtain had mold and the smell was unbearable it got replaced on nd day  Blood stains around toilet but the worse thing was the bugs our whole family got bitten and developed small infections on bite areas  Try to complain to on shift manager Tito but he had  no time right now  security guard took some info but made us feel like we were the contributors to the problem  I have worked in the Health and Safety field for over  years and never seen such poor hygiene in any hotel  Service Hotel personnel was good and helpful at times  We had to discard our luggage to avoid bringing anything home  Warm cookies were a nice treat upon arrival  
N => Pricey but Roomy and Great Location First of all this hotel has real suites  I have been to other hotels where the name quotsuitequot is used if there is a sofacoffee table sitting area  Our suite had a arate walled in bedroom  I was traveling w my sister and her dhter  While looking for accommodations I thought I would need two rooms because quotthe girlsquot especially my  y o  niece would want privacy  As this was their first time to NY I wanted a hotel right in the thick of it  In the theatre district during the high season  y it was difficult to find an acceptable  star hotel offering rooms under nt  I was prepared to do one of two things Get one ent sized hotel room for nt and tell them they would have to sacrifice privacy or go down to a  star and rent two rooms The Doubletree offered a compromise  It was almost nt but it was roomy  The sofa sleeper was comfortable  I cant vouch for every sofa in the hotel but the one I slept on was great  It was big enough for  adults who dont mind getting cozy  Plus the cushions could make a bed for someone under  ft  When we closed the door to the bedroom there was complete privacy for me and them  We each had our own t v  I had the quotkitchenquot and they had the bath  Privacy was never a problem  Oh and my sister wanted a smoking room  Some hotels are exclusively NON smoking  Our floor was a smoking floor and you could tell but I did not smell smoke anywhere else and I am a non smoker  All in all it fit the bill  It had location quality and lots of room  
N => Dont stay here my room was small and dirty  The only thing good about this hotel are the cookies and the location  The staff was friendly but my room was not that clean and it was on the small side  The windows in this place were so dirty you could hardly see a view  The business center was so expensive that it was ridiculous I wont be staying here again even if it was free  
N => very pleased We stay at the Doubletree from y    We were very impressed  Two adults and  children  stayed very comfortably in one room  We lucked into a room on the nd floor  Ocassionally we could hear other guests in the halls but we never heard the noise of Times Square  The two double beds were very comfortable  The sofa bed wasnt the greatest but it was just a sofa bed  The little refrig and microwave were very handy for a lite bite to eat  Check in was painless  The entire process took less than  minutes  The concierege was well informed and always helpful No real compliants just a few minor issues One tv remote did not work and never got fixed  We were only given af coffee in the room although once requested regular coffee was provided and the nline to speak with the concierege did get long sometimes  Overall we were very pleased and would not hesitate to return  
N => Excellent Stay   Will Go Back Again We just returned from an extended weekend  days nights in NYC at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square  What a great location    subway right outside our door    easy access to Times Square activities restaurants theaters  Room located on high floor provided excellent view of the City  Overall check incheck out excellent    staff friendly polite and willing to help out wheneverwherever needed  Room clean spacious for family of four  We were able to move with ease throughout the City from shopping along Fifth Avenue to attending a Yankees game in the Bronx to visiting Lower Manhattan Statue of Liberty and the South Street Seaport area to traveling throughout several other great Manhattan neighborhoods  We saw everything we wanted to see in NYC and then some    we only had  planned activities and we let the rest quotjust happenquot and found that we had more fun and actually got involved with more with the City and its inhabiitants  There was actually more going on than we could ever attend  Check as many websites and order a New York Travel Guide before you go to help give you an idea of whats going on while youre there  Everywhere we went people were great    very willing to help us out when we looked quotlostquot trying to find the right subway train    once you get on it a few times you start to get the hang of how the lines work  Highly recommend getting a car service to take you tofrom the airport cheap    spent roughly  per way for a town car with Carmel Limousine    they also offered us  coupons on each stay by going to      It made getting to the hotel and out of the city so much easier  Cant wait to go back  
N => Clean Convenient BUT SUPER SMALL  Guess Thats Normal for NY Stayed here for our yr anniversary  In comparison to other hotels in Manhattan which are expensive it was relatively reasonable though still expensive YET expected  Hey its Manhattan Located a few blocks from the subway which made it perfect to travel anywhere We even took the train from the airport straight to our hotel via the AirTrain   A LOT faster and A TON cheaper than taking the cab  so this alone made it worth while Staff was helpful but the hotel is TINY Looks like they carved it out from a side of a building  Their lobby area is small so it wasnt too much surprise that our queen bed room was equally as small  Literally once we opened the door the restroom was half a foot to the right about   steps straight was the bed and probably a foot and a half between the bed and the TV  The place is so small they didnt even have room for a regular closet so they had a arate wooden closet unit in the room  We made do as we werent there to stay in the room even if we wanted to it was way to small to do the quotromantic lounging in the room for a day  but that made us get out  SO overall it was good for the location clean and safe  BUT if youre looking for an average size room or a romantic ambience to your room OR a place to comfortably lounge in during your stay THIS IS NOT THE PLACE  But if youre going to be out and about and just want a place to crash or having a big room is not a big deal   then youll be fine here  
N => good find not the biggest or most luxurious but room was good sized very clean and very comfortable brand new beds  staff was very pleasant and helpful  could use another elevator as there are only two that serve quite a number of floors  good location   close to macys empire state building madison sq garden city hall and  minute walk to times square  close to lots of good asian restaurants  really good value for money  
N => Super Friendly Staff I was there with my wife and my brother and his wife for two days  We mentioned when we checked in it was my brothers th Birthday when asked if we were celebrating any special occasions  The staff for the next two days was calling us by name and wished my brother a happy b day everytime they saw him  The chef sent up cake for  when we asked him to chill the bottle of champagne we brought with us  The location is centrally located so youre close to everything  We love going to the Village so it was pretty close as was Times Square  But its not too close to Times Square which is what we preferred  I would stay here again in a New York Minute  Our room even had a view of the Empire State Building  
N => Slow elevator and slow receptionist  But they allowed my dog Spent one night in this hotel with my husband and month old bulldog  They allow dogs less than lbsParking is validated at Edison Garage about   blocks down from the hotel  My advise is to bring rolling luggage  Attendants were accommodating when we asked to have our car accessible for items we might need later  Check in was at pm and we arrived at pm  Room was not ready until pm on the dot  Lobby was crowded with people who also had to wait for their rooms to be ready  Check out was similar slow and inefficient In room  I liked the variety of complimentary toiletries by Neutrogena which included a face cleanser and face moisturizer  Room also included a blowdryer  Pillows were plentiful big and fluffy I had to take my dog outside to urinate couldnt wait any longer so ided to walk down  floors from my room  On our way up the lobby was full and I was in line for the elevator  When the elevator came some ignorant tourist cut in front of us with her big luggage  So I had to walk up  flights back to my room  On my way I saw the elevator dropping people off at the rd floor  I think I was going as fast as the elevator because it kept stopping at each floor  At least my dog got exercise  Bottom line we stayed here because they let dogs under lbs stay  We will not return because my dog will be more than lbs soon  
N => washcloth was only towel in room for  days checked into the hotel on sunday  could see immediately the hotel was understaffed the entire lobby was filled with luggage waiting to be checked ampthere was only  poor sweating bellhop trying to take care of everything  one the second day my room was not cleaned amp after numerous calls to the front desk amp promises that it would be taken care of immediately it never happened  This was day  of drying myself with a washcloth since it was the only clean towel in the room  Day  my room was cleaned but no towels in the bathroom  again calls to the front desk amp to housekeeping  needless to say by the time they were finally delivered it was day  of drying myself with a washcloth  My newspaper was not delivered on the second day amp when i told the front desk i was told to walk down the street so i could buy one  i actually asked the front desk if i was registered as a guest in the hotel since i wasnt getting any service and i was informed i was  
N => What a Great Place to Stay in Midtown I was fortunate enough to have found this hotel on a whim  What a treat  The rooms are execellent with flat screen TVs adnd essential amenities  Ive stayed in many hotels in Midtown but for the value and location just off th Avenue within walking distance of Times Square this was a great choice  The stay was great  We even received warm cookies at check in  The only problem is the slow elevators  But the place was great  
N => A good find I was tempted to stay at this property for two reasons  it was brand new and  it was very close to Penn station a few minutes walk as I was planning on taking the LIRR from JFK I was on the th floor and even had a view of the Empire State Building The room was small but being a new property was spotlessly clean and very nicely furnished  The bed was comfortable and the towels fluffy  A couple of negative points but these would not put me off staying again  The sound insulation is not great from the corridor  The building is tall and thin with only a few rooms per floor  As the hotel only has two liftselevators a busy times I suspect you could be waiting a long time for a lift  
N => Great Food Superior attitude I found myself re located to the newly opened Doubletree On  th street as the result of an inaccurate booking elsewhere  I was delighted to have been quotwalked overquot to this warm and cheery spot  I was starving and was directed to their restaurant quotCheltonsquot where I met the executive chef who greeted me at the door  At Chef Michaels suggestion I had the rack of lamb with sweet potato puree  It was astounding and done to a turn medium rare  The whole staff really made me feel at home and the food was delightful  My only dissapointment was in the fact that they do not as yet have their liquor permit   
N => Housekeeping broke into our room and stole our stuff Do not stay at this hotel Housekeeping broke into our room and stole our money as soon as we left the hotel and the staff did nothing to help us out and instead the manager told us it was not their problem We had to stay up all night and report it to the police  who told us the hotel needs to help us with the problem but the hotel did not care BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU CHOOSE TO STAY HERE 
N => Go elsewhere The hotel is currently under reations they fail to mention this  The rooms are small and cramped but worst of all no particulary clean  It was so hot I had to ask for a fan  To top it all off when you cehck out and ask to leave baggage they cgarge you  per bag 
N => Great location but not really worth the price I was disappointed with this hotel  The location was awesome as you could have walked from there to most of the great sites nearby  The staff were not that friendly which was a bit of a turn off  The construction going on in the hotel took away from the ambience and the lobby was always pretty busy since the wifi was free there but not in the rooms  I had to let the water run at a near trickle for it to stay hot which was annoying  It was an okay stay but for the price I expected better than okay  
N => Good location for price Good location for price  Walked to Central Park Times Sq th Ave shopping Empire State Building Radio City Hall Rockerfeller Ctr plus more  Staff was not very friendly but a few made up for that  Under CONSTRUCTION so not very pretty inside  Room was small but we only needed to sleep there  Beds were very comfy  Bathroom needs a re haul pretty clean  Overall clean but felt useddated  Take advantage of parking package   its totally worth it  
N => helpful and friendly We had a very enjoyable stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel in NYC  The staff was very helpful especially Keith Homes from guest services who helped us resolve a small issue with our room  In addition he went out of his way to make sure that we were satisfied with everything during our stay  Staff personnel like this truly make a difference when traveling  
N => Great place to stay with baby and family We spent Christmas here with our  month old and my mother in law got a room down the hall for  nights as well  We loved having so much close by   but this was my first time to NYC so not unique to this hotel Im sureA cot was provided for our baby and we were able to tuck her in the corner and not disturb her when we went to bed  There were also blankets so she was warm enough  We faced away from Lex so there was no noise to worry about  The breakfast was great and the concierge gave us good recommendations for places to eat including Christmas dinner  Our one complaint was the fridge how they charged us for taking things out to store our leftovers and babyfood in there but this was eventually settled on checkout  We also made use of the free Wifi during evenings when our baby was sleeping and we sat in the lobby  
N => Great deal for Manhattan and excellent service From the minute ice Ryan at the front desk checked us in our experience was good  After explaining to her it was our sisters first trip to NYC and also her birthday she insured our rooms were special  We had a partial view of the Chrysler Bldg and my sisters room had a complementary fruit basket  The manager introduced himself Keith Homes with a small box of chocolates as a bday suprise  The desk staff was helpful throughout our  day stay and the cookes were always a welcome treat when we returned tired after touring NYC  Our luggage was stored both upon arrival and after cking out with out any problems We all felt the Doubletree certainly added to our wonderfull NYC trip  
N => a good deal We got a great deal on this hotel room   it happened to be an quotaccessiblequot room which made the bathroom layout a bit odd but the room was big the bed very comfortable and overall the place was pretty quiet  Location was excellent We would stay here again even though the lobby and rest of the place was just so so  
N => If I knew this was what I was getting for  I would have paid  to stay somewhere else We drove up to this hotel and found that they had a garage around the corner that had discounted rates for hotel guests  Since we have an oversized truck they charged us extra  no problem  When we walked into the very small and cramped lobby of this hotel everything looked ok  We didnt know we were in for it until we walked down the corridor to our room  It was a hotel straight out of a B movie where the hotel is dilapidated and everything is old and outdated or  We got into the room and it went from worse to terrible  Now keep in mind when we got this quotdealquot through priceline we believed we were getting a   star hotel for   We walked in and there was a musty smell right off the bat  We would have gone down and changed the room right there but we were running late for dinner  So we stayed there and surveyed the damage  Bathroom looked like they had a mold infestation  The closet had a musty smell in it which caused me to avoid using it  The rug was torn up in the corners the wall paper peeling off in corners  The best part was finding someone elses eaten quotparfaitquot  in the corner of the bathroom  The staff never cleaned it well so there was a nice running chocolate stain running from where the cup and half eaten dessert laid  Baseboard in the bathroom was falling off and thats just the bathroom The air conditioner was one that you find in a nasty old motel    but OLDER than anything Ive seen  Really I am too tired to go on but you get the idea of disaster  
N => Great weekend at Doubletree Metro Hubby and I just returned from a weekend at the Doubletree Metropolitan in New York  Our experience was lovely  The location was perfect for us  The only drawback is the fire station across the street  But it never disturbed us  be we lucked out  The room was not huge but big enough  Clean lovely modern or  I loved the stainless steel round sink in the bathroom and the contemporary features  The bed was sooooo comfortable with crisp sheets a pile of feather pillows and a snuggly feather duvet  I turned down the temp in the room so I could use it  We wanted to take the bed   linens pillows and all   home with us  We arrived early but they had a room available so we didnt have to wait  Everyone was very friendly  We had a drink at the bar  Expensive but a nice spot to relax  We didnt eat in the restaurant so I cant give it a review  The location is just far enough from Times Square to not be in the thick of it but close enough to walk to as well as walking distance to anything in Midtown  Theres a subway entrance right next to the hotel and others very close by  My only complaint was the business center  I went to print out our boarding passes which you can do for no charge  But the connection is slooooooooowwwwwww  And I had to reset  computers just to get one to work right  But it eventually worked so a minor frustration The room wasnt perfect  The desk had a chip in it  The bathroom is small and someone used too much caulk in there  But those are very minor  The price is reasonable and the bed alone was worth it  We will definitely return to this hotel  
N => Run down dump It should have been a clue when there was a line at the check in and everyone was arguing about something  Or  of the  desk clerks were actually serving customers and the other just stood there  Or when another disappointed guest came up with his spouse completed distrht about having to pay for quotfree parkingquot  Needless to say the suite was not like in the picture or anywhere close  Clearly this suite was very run down the roll away was not made up the safe did not work and we did not have enought room  The last straw was when they came in to make up the roll away and my dhter laid on the bed and was pained by the springs coming through on the mattress  We had enough and packed up our bags and left without spending any of the  days we had booked  We were never so happy to pay more money for a real hotel where the service and the amenities told us the management cared and were on top of the details  
N => Great location    everything we needed Really enjoyed my stay here  It is right on the subway line which was extremely convenient  Didnt need much help but the staff was great to get what we did need  We booked a rate to get the complimentary buffet which was very nice to eat at the hotel before we got out since we are early risers  Beverages werent included in that but coffee was reasonable  lt     Id be cautious about whatever price they charge for juice though FYI The sink area was not in the main showertoilet area which was nice since it was for a montherdhter    wouldnt want to be in the bathroom together  The cookies are awesome as always 
N => Pleasant surprise Our stay here was terrific  Staff was prompt with our requests  Had a complimentary breakfast buffet  Warning    still have to pay for drinks at the buffet which were reasonable  Rooms were nice for New York especially for the rate  Right across the street from a Subway stop which was very convenient  Had a street fair right outside on Saturday when we trying to leave which would have been a little inconvenient to get a cab if you were carrying much  
N => We thought it was very good     Stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for one night at the end of e  with my Mother  Managed to get a really good deal by booking direct online and then rechecking weekly until we left for the US   got a twin room with breakfast for  which in the centre of NYC we thought was excellent  Our first impression was excellent spacious lobby and staff falling over themselves to help chatty and friendly but professional  Room two queen beds on the th floor was quite small but very clean with good quality bedding and towels  Free wi fi internet in the room  Breakfast was excellent   hot and buffet both available   with no request refused  Our luggage was stored for us after we checked out the cost of  per bag was explained upfront which was very useful as we didnt leave for the airport until late afternoon  All in all an excellent stay  
N => Not too bad Stayed here for  nights over th of y Weekend  I booked though a certain low fair website that doesnt show names  It was worth that price but not much more  ProsLocation    train right outside the door one stop from Grand Central E and V trains  blocks north  Rockefeller center is a  minute walk away  It isnt even too unreasonable to walk to Times Square although the E train to nd streetPABT is faster but just  stops  Rooms Good size for Manhattan  Private bathroom but a small one Parking Attached garage offers discounted night parking for guests  Just get your Valet ticket stamped at the front desk  ConsClimate control Couldnt find a thermostat  Just had a choice of High or Low Overpriced amenities Roll away bed for night glad I bought the air mattress which the maids were even kind enough to make up every day  Dont even touch the minibar or the stuff they leave set out  There are sensors  Internet would have been an arm and a leg  Fortunately I could connect to the Cornell Medical School wi fi from my room  Elevators In the morning I had to wait  or so minutes before an empty enough elevator made it to the th floor to go down  Should have just taken the stairs  A minor inconvenience but still  I didnt go for room service or anything else so I wont comment on that All and all its a room that would only cost  or less outside the city  Keep that in mind before you pay   
N => Not bad nothing special   A ent place to stay ONLY if you get a good rate If you are looking for a great NY hotel experience this isnt it  Rooms are a bit tired but okay  If you just need a reasonably priced place to stay in a good location this is okay but you  well be able to do better  The room I had was a ent size especially for NY  It wasnt particularly cheerful or nicely furnished but then again youre not paying much either  My shower had almost no water pressure making washing hair a lengthy process  The TV remote control batteries were dead but they responded to my request quickly  However service to colleagues from Africa was not good  Their luggage didnt arrive with them  They informed the hotel that they were expecting their luggage to arrive arately and to notify them when it did  On the second afternoon of their stay after the hotel had told them again that the luggage had not arrived they went out and bought a change of clothes  That night they discovered that the hotel had had their luggage since morning  The cost and quality for room service was poor    no small salad available    cheapest salad was  and very basic lettuce with tomatoe  The pizza was totally bland  
N => Recommended We bought a package deal which included this hotel for a very good value  Being a package deal I wasnt expecting much   so it was a pleasant surprise to find a hotel with friendly staff and adequate facilities  We were in the th floor facing th St  and it was a bit noisy especially the fire station in the next block It was not noisy enough to trouble us   we slept fine and the bed was very good  The room was not huge but accommodated two persons with two large pieces of luggage  Room was clean and well maintained being serviced every day  My only complaint was the cost of WiFi in the room although there was free access at the lobby  The checkout process was a breeze   no time at all  I would certainly stay here again  
N => Do not stay here From e  through e   I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel in New York New York  After booking my hotel fare through Priceline I called the hotel to make a few requests for my two hotel rooms  I asked the reservation attendant if she would include in my reservations that if possible I would like two rooms with double beds views of New York as this was my first visit to the city and early check in  She explained that she could not guarantee any of these requests but that these types of requests can usually be accomodated  When my traveling companions and I arrived to the hotel on e  we were told that the rooms were not ready and that there were no double bed rooms available  I expressed my disappointment to the front desk attendant and explained that we had two males and two females in our party non couples that would not feel comfortable sharing a bed  She offered us two cots for the two rooms for  per cot per night  This would be an additional  for our stay  When I asked why the cots were so much more the front desk clerk merely shrugged her shoulders and did not reply  At this point I felt that she was being rude and asked if I could speak to the manager  When the manager came over he seemed immediately confrontational and hostile  I wanted to tell him that I understood the hotel s side but felt upset that I would be charged so much more to keep my companions comfortable  Instead he kept repeating  what do you want me to do about it  So I suggested a discounted rate for the cots  He said that he would ask housekeeping if he could discount the rate but that he wasn t going to make any promises  At this point other guests were watching our interaction and I was becoming embarrassed by his demeanor  So I said that would be fine and that I would come back in two hours to see if my rooms were ready  When I returned only one room was ready so all four of us went up to the single room to change for dinner  When we returned from dinner the desk attendants had switched shifts and we were helped by a different clerk  He told us that there was a double bed available for the second room which he gave us  On the last day as I checked out I asked the clerk if there were any additional charges for the room  She told me that there was an  fee for the mini bar for an item that I did not purchase  I explained that I did not purchase an item and she gave me a disbelieving stare  She said that she was going to send someone up to check the mini bar in the room to confirm that nothing was missing  I told her that would be fine  She then took the keys from me told me that she took the charge off the bill and waived her hand to dismiss me  At this point I requested a complimentary cookie because I had not received one during any of my check ins  She handed me one bag and then waived her hand a second time to dismiss me Although I fully understand that my requests were not guaranteed I don t feel that I received the customer service that I have come to expect from the Hilton brand  I also found it very disrespectful that during my interactions with the hotel staff I had the clerks iterate to me and the manager during the initial confrontation that I was a  Priceline customer  as if this had a idedly negative connotation  Beyond this lack of service the hotel also had some amenity issues  The first room was directly adjacent to the Fire Department and did not have a cot  The second room also did not have a cot and smelled like smoke even though it was on a non smoking floor  The first bathroom smelled like mildew and the sink would spray water everywhere  The other bathroom had a screw where the handle for the shower faucet should have been  Lastly when we tried to call for the much advertised  breakfast lunch dinner  room service we were told that they were not open from am until pm  Based on the last encounter with management I chose not to complain in person again but instead filled out the survey that was left in the room  I dropped the survey off on the morning of my second day and included my name address phone number and hotel rooms on the card  However I was never contacted regarding my concerns  Also the cot situation was never followed up and it wasn t until the last day that I was sure I wouldn t be charged for them  
N => great location   awesome beds Started here went to Tribeca Hilton Garden Inn   and came back to this hotel because we preferred it  Excellent staff did not get the breakfast option on our return and found two great breakfast places over on rd   Morning Star and another just a few doors down  Rooms are quiet beds so comfortable subway right there one of our rooms had a bigger bath than the other but no complaints Oh coffee in the room would be nice to get your day going  Internet is only free in lobby which seems silly 
N => NYC trip   Stayed at Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel New York City Everything was good except tht the room did not have a refregirator to keep the beer chilled   
N => First visit to New york   good base to work from Overall the experience of Doubletrees was satisfactory  Nothing special but acceptable The room was small amp clean with a queen bed  We were there to see New york so the room facilities were OK as we were out early and back late  We were on the th floor and the side of the hotel we were on faced a sky scraper so we had to look quotstraight upquot to see if it was sunny or cloudy The hotel was well placed to get about  Situated in uptown Manhattan the hotel was right next to the Metro and   blocks away from th amp Maddison Ave  The edge of central park was a  minute walk  Be prepared to walk  Comfortable shoes a must  Dont have breakfast in the hotel  Right next door from main entrance is a dinercant place the name that serve breakfast lunch amp dinner  Good fresh food at ent prices even at   to the pound New york was fantastic  New York in  is cold but the queues for the attractions were small  Generally people in the street were very friendly when asking directions or assistance  We found that staff in diners bars amp restaurants were chatty amp helpful amp gave a good service but we found shop assistants in most shops going through the motions  But the worst were staff on the metro and at the port authority bus station    public employees They were either asleep or prentending to be or reading magazines or papers  Trying to get help was like pulling teeth  All these guys need retraining 
N => Great Location We stayed here for  nights at the end of ch   We got an excellent rate for this hotel through hotelpaths so we booked it  We did read some of the other reviews of this hotel so we ided to be prepared for the worse  We had a short wait before we checked in but the front desk was staffed by  other people  We were given our room keys and warm cookies  We got to our room opened the door and there was another guest already in there  She said she had just checked in shortly before us so she rang the front desk and got little satisfaction so we had to return to reception only to have to wait in line again for someone to help us  After a  hour flight we could have done without this  When we finally approached the girl at reception and told her our predicament I expected her reaction to me more apologetic  It seems that werent the only guests with this same problem  We got our new room keys and when we got into the room we checked for the bed bugs that were mentioned in previous Trip Advisor reviews but were glad to see no sign of them The room was clean  The beds were very comfortable  The bathroom was small but clean and had a great shower and we supplied with nice toiletries  This hotel is in an excellent location only  mins walk to Times Square  There is a subway next to the hotel which we only used one because everything is in walking distance  They have luggage storage facilities at  per bag  
N => I would not stay here again I picked this particular hotel as it was recommended by a colleague from work We arrived late in the evening and there was only one staff at reception  We were checked in quickly and went to our rooms  The negative comments about my room was that there were no tea coffee making facilities and the paint in the bathroom was peeling off the ceiling The worst experience of this hotel was with one of the desk staff on the day of check out  I received a room statement for my room although it was addressed to my room the hotel confirmation was not the same as my hotel confirmation number from my expedia booking and i was shocked to see that there were so many charges for the mini bar that i went downstairs to reception to explain that there was a mistake as I hadnt used the mini bar at all and that i had been charged for someone elses use  When i went to reception i spoke to lyn who asked me if i was checking out i said i would be checking out later on in the morning she said she would deal with it then At  am my family and i went to check out it wasnt busy in reception and it was lyn i spoke to again about the room statement  Her attitude was really poor she wasnt interested in helping me resolve my problem she asked me if i had moved items around in the mini bar as there was a sensor in there i said no  She did not confirm whether or not these items would be charged to my VISA Card but she told me to ring back in the next few days to check my account or to check my own credit card statement  I felt like i was being dismissed i was getting nowhere with my problem all i could do was to take down the desk clerks name and the time that i checked out  Talking to lyn took less than  mins   not great customer service  I left the hotel feeling very angry and worried that i would have to ring my credit card company over the next few days Next time i visit New York i will not be staying again at this particular hotel Location wise this hotel was right next to the st Number  Metro line which was very convenient to visit all the major sites  
N => Good location adequate hotel Typical overpriced New York hotel smaller room than expected but location was very good with nearby subway and easy walking to many many sights  Would not necessarily stay here again but would consider if price was right The staff was very friendly and helpful both at front desk and in restaurant  Restaurant has reduced hours so beware  Not open very early and even then opened  minutes late one day  Room service horribly overpriced with all add on fees  Restaurant buffet breakfast which was included in our hotel price was excellent in quality and ample  Only problem was trying to charge young teens  each for joining in  This was resolved with front desk offering more vouchers and restaurant insisting that only two vouchers per room was permissableRoom was very clean but bathroom was sadly deteriorating broken toilet seat leaky faucet mildewed shower curtain peeling paint broken seat drain broken door lock chipped tub etc  Clean but shabby Lobby is a joke a clash of styles so it has absolutely NO charm but who cares We didnt entertain there and it was humorous  Great TV in room although seldom used  Nice soaps and shampoos  Expensive mini bar with no price list and a warning not to use mini fridge for personal items and no coffee maker in room  Quiet we were on side away from fire station  Very comfortable bed  Wonderful chocolate chip cookie when we arrived  Concierge a bit snooty but helpful  
N => OK but dont expect too much Stayed for  night  Not the cleanest place although the filth isnt that which would deter such a quick stay   the lobby for one needs improvements to the dinged up worn and dirty furniture  The room was seemed cleaner than the lobby by far and was OK on comfort but nothing exceptional    definitely only what the price tag of the stay reflects bed sheets feel cheap and scratchy but pillows were ent  Horribly busy firehouse across the street from the even numbered rooms and the there was only an option for heat amp no fan setting on the thermostat  which meant we had to sleep with the noise of the firehouse from a cracked window in order to avoid sweating to death  Staff friendly although a simple concern was transfered on the telephone  seven  times  They also try to rip your bill for the MiniBar  I accidentally nudged the sensor protected shelf of goodies with my hand and the next day had  oo worth of charges for fooddrink not consumed  they took care of this though not very willingly  Internet access in room wouldnt work  
N => Perfect stay great location The Doubletree Metropolitan in New York was everything we could have asked for  The service was great and the room was comfortable  Our luggage was lost on our flight over so they made sure to supply our room with extra ammenities we lost on the plane such as toothbrushes deodorant etc   They even gave us two free drinks at the barThe location was great and we were able to walk right int the heart of Times Square in just minutes  The room was modern and the flat screen TV was a bonus I only have two complaints though  We did find some mold growing on the vents in the bathroom and the dinner at their restaurant was less than desirable  Despite this I would still recommend staying at this hotel  
N => Great all the way around My girlfriend and I went to New York City to see a play  I chose the Doubletree first for its proximity to the theater and second it received overall good reviews on Trip Advisor  We flew in to La Guardia  cab ride to the hotel  We had quotcarry onquot size luggage so the bellman never even approached us   I prefer to deal with my own luggage  This trip was a rewards certificate from Hitlon Honors  points for two nights  Kathy M at the front desk was super nice and honored my request of a high floor    Im just a traveling country boy so I thought the lobby looked nice never crowded but it was Super Bowl Sunday  The Hotel Bar quotThe Metquot was bad on so many levels  I went in one night and Abdul the bartender was so engrossed in TV he didnt notice me for several minutes  A Guinness and another beer was   tip   The or in the bar was a hodge podge of a s flea ket   It seemed dirty lots of food crumbs on the floor and hardly any customers  The Staff from the maid to an Assistant Manager were friendly   I was shocked that the maids in the hall went out of their way to greet you  My one issue was in my opinion being lied to or at least misled by a female Concierge  Upon arrival we asked about going to the Statue of Liberty she tried to dissuade me by saying it would be too crowded on the normal ferries  She was much too quick in whipping out a private cruise boat and trying to get me on their cruise  I opted to go to Battery Park and check it out for myself  no lines quick to get tickets quick to get on the ferry and off we went  The rooms are small but functional the beds were great and did not get too much street noise  theres is no coffee service in the room  As Hilton Honor members we got a certificate to go to the th floor for breakfast  It was nice mainly carbohydrate type breakfast muffins fruit cereals etc  Sunday morning that was closed and the front desk gave us vouchers to eat in the restaurant  Those guys were amazing the way they moved people around all with a good sense of humor   it was a complete hot breakfast Pros Nice location friendly staff great bedsCons Concierge misleading us hotel bar is nastyId stay here again 
N => NYC After checking previous reviews I was a bit worried about the room condition but when I actually checked in on  all my concerns vanished  The room was tiny we stayed for only one night so it did not bother us but clean  The furniture also looked very new and pleasant I guess some guests were unlucky to get non  reated rooms so they felt the rooms were worn  The bed was comfortable and the shower and everything else in the room functioned properly  Besides there were several lamps in the room so it was very bright which was really a plus  We chose this hotel because of the good location and the cheap price and we did not have anything to complain about  
N => Enjoyable My partner and I stayed in this hotel for  nights in uary  We were upgraded to a king room which was greatly appreciated I had no complaints about the room it was cleaned thoroughly every day sheets changed as often as you wanted  The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a nice big tv not that youre going to be watching too much tv when youre in New York We were on the th floor and yes there was a fire station across the road which could be quite noisy   but really not a big deal We never had to wait long for the lifts and they moved quite fast so again no complaints there Most of the staff were very friendly and we found the concierge very helpful  The location was great   th Avenue Times Sq  Rockerfeller Central Park St  Patricks all within easy walking distance   but the subway is extremely convenient right outside the door very easy to use and very reasonable   try to get a map early on and familiarise yourself with itThe only real complaints that I had about the hotel were that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room or even in the lobby after a long day of sightseeing it would have been very welcome  My other complaint is that if you wanted to store your luggage not only did you have to pay a dollar to leave each bag in   you had to pay another dollar to take each bag out Why did they not just charge  per bag This to me was a matter of principle after staying  nights at the hotel I felt it was a bit cheekyIn all though   I had gotten a very good rate on the room and felt that it was well worth what we paid I would consider going back there if Im lucky enough to get back to New York  
N => Good Hotel Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel from  st to  th We originally only booked for three nights for over New Year but because of the great location and price online at Opodo we extended our stay here I would say that the whole hotel seemed nice everything in our room was clean the carpets werent worn and the bathroom area was in perfect condition  We had no problem what so ever with the lifts being slow at any time of the day  Staff were very helpful from checking inout to giving information and directions on places we wanted to go  At the end of our stay we had a bill for the minibar for three items when we had not even opened the fridge nevermind take things off the ultra sensitive shelf but the staff removed them off the bill without any fuss  Our room was also facing the fire and police station but I think we only noticed the sirens be three times in our stay no problem at all When we extended our stay we changed rooms we were allowed to stay in our room past check out time until the next room was ready which was before pm and we were upgraded to and king size room for free which was just that bit bigger then the queen but it made a lot of difference as the queen was ok but a bit small with the suitcases in I would say the one downside to our stay was being next to nosiy guests in the st room which was next to some very noisy teenagers who had no respect at all for the other guests twice security was called to quieten them down i personally think they should have been thrown out the nd time as they would come in around  am shouting screaming down the corridors and in their room  It would seem the walls were a bit too thin As i said great location only a walk away from times square th avu etc or just as easily get the subway as the station was right next door and you can get a day pass for only  bargain We ate at Pax for breakfast which is just around the corner as they had breakfast specials which were cheap enough and good quality but also try Ess a Bagel and Metro cafe next door for the sandwiches and salads Overall a good hotel in which i would stay again 
N => LOVED NEW YORK  Great Stay Our stay was   thru    Never been to New York and was a little worried  Our room was a little small and we had no viewbut we didnt come to New York to stay in the room  The Staff was friendly and helpful  Only problem was when we purchased tickits for quotWickedquot we overpaid by    each When we complained they told us it was the brokers prices  Would of liked to have know the prices before hand but they said they would make it up to us   still waiting  Over all our trip was great  Subways are easy to use and cheaper then taking a taxi everywhere  But taxis are great when the weather gets bad  Hope You Have a Great Time In New York  
N => Average Hotel As from other reviews yes the Doubletree is abit dowdy after the front desks but the rooms were bigger than i expected there was no problem with traffic noise even with a fire station almost next door  the good point about the doubletree is its location easy walking distance from Times Square  Central Park and many other places I trully did not rate the Metro Grill next door I hate picking my breakfast from a model on a plateThe free Cookies are excellant We only got ripped off by the Yellow cab going back to JFK being charged for the Tunnel toll when we did not actually go through itwe appeared to go via all the back streets our driver knew very poor compared to the taxi who took us from the Airport to the Hotel the charge was  each way includeing tolls 
N => doubletree fine my wife amp I stayed at the Doubletree the first  days of ober amp found it ok amp nothing more It was the start of our th wedding anniversary tour amp we wanted something nice to start with so we thought being part of the Hilton group the hotel would be nice let me say now the HILTON it isnt First impressions are good apart from porters working in a relay team with your bags ie   demanding tips yes I know its there culture but being a true Yorkshire man I found it nothing short of begging  I mean one porter unloaded taxi held hand out passed to another who took to reception deskmts held hand out who then passed trolley to a third for there final journey to our room bad bad start  However I di gress the room was clean with a comfy bed amp an adequate bathroom amp a ultra sensitive mini bar  Found the receptionconcierge staff quite helpful amp pleasant  Location of the TREE is great thought the price after looking at others again to be ok  O had a late pm flight to Vegas so had to leave bags with porters charged  for each bag           WAIT        that was for dropping amp then picking up ie  in total arghhh would we go back Try somewhere else first now we know the area but if nothing available yes the TREE would be booked  
N => Room smelled bad I stayed at the Doubletree for one night thank goodness it was only one night when I went to Manhattan for a business trip  My room was unpleasant  It smelled like a dirty musty restroom  Seriously  I didnt want to touch anything  I wore slippers the entire time and never touched the floor  There was no luggage rack for my suitcase so I used the ironing board to place my suitcase atop  The carpet was too gross to leave it on the floor The room was small the tv was tiny  I am a Hilton Honors Gold level member and I was placed on an executive level floor but the room didnt reflect anything special  It was tiny and the desk was very small  There was a free breakfast in the Executive Lounge the next day   the usuals of ceral muffins etc I wouldnt stay here again if it were my choice  
N => Great rate great location cant wait to go back We planned a trip to NYC at the last minute three days notice and got a great rate at the Doubletree Midtown  Subway stop right outside the front door   took AirTrain from JFK to the E train which connects to the  station The place was obviously doing good business   always a bustle in the lobby  We used the self check in kiosk   no problem though talking to a desk clerk might have got us a room higher than the nd floor and not near the elevator  Room was recently redone and as big as any non NYC hotel rooom  Really  No lie  Big room  Bathroom was all redone clean and stylish and thank you for the sunscreen too  And even with the proximity to the hall traffic very quiet Some people have complained about the NYPD and NYFD right next door   the sirens werent any louder in our room than any where else in the city Booked through the Hilton website with AAA discount   tax a night for a Fri Sat stay  Well definitely be going back  
N => Housekeeping terrible During our stay we were surprised that the duvets are not covered with a duvet cover but wrapped in a sheet that only goes round the duvet  We found this very strange and resulted in you sleeping under the actual duvet rather than the cover which we found very unhygienic  The housekeepers did not give extra shampoo and products for the shower either on the second day of our stay they only gave replacements for the facewash considering how much you are paying it should not be too much to ask to be able to shower on the second day given that with the handluggage restrictions we had not brought our own shower products  Laundry was also left on our floor from am until late of both days and we got stuck in the lift on the first day of our stay the doors would not open at our floor I would not stay here again  
N => Good Location Good location for most of the main attractions   subway adjacent but we used yellow cabs or walked most places Hotel room adequate king size and clean although next to the lift and a request to move was not well received   the alternative offered was even less attractive  Not too many friendly faces amongst the staff and the general New York attitude of quottake it or leave itquot dominates  Breakfast was included in our deal and had a good buffet selection but plenty of options for this locally at a cheaper price  Dont bother with the concierge service unless you wish to pay a premium for theatre tickets or the airport taxi service  We got a room extension till pm on the day of our departure at no extra cost   anything later is charged at full day rate  
N => New York        Amazing place   We went to new york for a  day trip for our anniversary average hotel lobby was nice and clean check in efficient good location Rooms were just average nothing special  Breakfast better to eat out at one the great cafes nearby  Most tourist places are within reasoable distance  Overall very average must be better hotels with same price tag would not stay here again  
N => Just okay My husband and I went for a  day getaway to NYC  We just wanted to find a relatively reasonable priced hotel that was clean and in a good location  This hotel was moderately priced and we figured that the Doubletree name was good The location was good  There is a good cafe for a quick reasonable lunch or breakfast located adjacent to the hotel  The room was very disappointing  It had a gym smell to it  We got moved but the next room was the same  At that point we had no alternative but to stay  The fitness center was also poor Wi fi is available for free but you need to use it in the lobby  It costs to use it in the room Overall I would not recommend this hotel  
N => Convenient stay at the Double Tree We stayed at the double tree for  nights over the labour day weekend  It cost us  dollars which i thought was fair for the hotel  The rooms were clean and not terribly outdated as some complain but I can see how they did quick fixes when quotreatingquot the rooms  We stayed in room  which faced lexingon and you could hear noise from the street but not loud enough to keep you up at night  I also agree that the bellmen were not pushy at all  I found the reception was helpful she got us  of three rooms when we arrived at am long before checkin time pm I also tipped her for doing that and then only mins later she called to say the last room was ready and was upgraded from a queen to a king  The one thing that i didnt like was how cheap the hotel was  They wanted you to pay for everything from the bottle openers to using the fridge in the room to the internet service  Considering they werent a low end hotel you would think they could bend and offer some complimentary services  Checkout was extremely simple we didnt have to speak with anyone  Overall this was a great average hotel to stay at those who are complaining must have paid more than we did as i feel for New York City we got our moneys worth  
N => Striclty OK needs a refurbishment Stayed at this hotel on a Sunday night  Got the rate of  all inclusive  Room was pretty small but thats par for the course in NYC  The rate was ent considering it was New York  Located on Lex Ave and st St  Subway station is next door so the city is accessible  But the hotel is in desperate need of reations  The rooms must have been at least  years old  The less said about the bathroom the better  The hotel was overall chaos  You walk into the lobby and there were people waiting everywhere to either check in or check out  I was lucky I stayed there for only  night  I checked out at  in the morning and needed to keep store my luggage as I had to finish my meetings  They charge  per bag to check in and another  to collect I mean I know its NYC but after charging me almost  bucks they cant keep my bags for free    Shows the cheap mentality of hotels in NY  I returned in a rental car to pick up my bags and it took then almost half hour to find the luggage that they had stored  The luggage was kept completely hapazardly  Overall this is an inexpensive place to stay but is SURELY NOT doubletree standard hotel  
N => Perfect Location Recommended  Location was ideal  Price was good  Room was a good size as was the bed  No real noise from the street   we were on the th floor and on Lexington Ave   but take earplugs in case the sirens start wailing Bathroom was on the small side but I didnt visit NYC to sit in the shower all day  Didnt try any meals in the hotel as there were so many other places to choose from over the city  One thing I noticed was that the bell hops werent pushy unlike other US hotels Ive been to  If you wanted them to help youd ask them  If not they wouldnt bother you Unique Qualities Location is right on top of the subway routes  E and V which can take you most places  Walking distance to the main shopping streets and plenty of places to eat in the vicinity  
N => Good location but the staff werent friendly We stayed at the Doubletree for  nights in early y   The location was great really with the number  subway right outside your door  The cookies were very welcome on arrival and everything felt as if it was going to be good  The room was as we expected   small by US standards but hey this is New York so no different to London really  Having no teacoffee making facilities was a pain and there was no friendly sure we can sort that from the reception staff   On the Reception staff well what can I say    Not one of the receptionists was friendly or helpful  We took US travellers cheques with us and each day we played a game of how much will they change as every day depending on their mood depended on how much you could change if you needed ID or if you could change  lots in one day We were even told by one who refused to change our cheques that no one in th eUS took them any more   strange as all our evening meals and main purchases in shops were done using cheques Each day different rules     The Conciege was also not very friendly  We asked him what was the best way to get back to JFK for  people and he just said quotget a cabquot  No smile no explanations that was it  We wanted to get tickets to a ball game but it appeared to be so much trouble we couldnt be bothered and went to the theatre instead The Porters   When we booked out we were charged  for the storage of our bags and then another  for collection  When we went to get our cab the porter tried to get us to get a hire car for  more  I think the porters are on a bit of a shady number here However with this in mind I would stay at the hotel again as it was such a great location  I will just have to remember to be as indifferent to the reception staff as they are to you  Although I do recall there was another hotel across the road   The Waldorf I think 
N => my stay i stayed at the hotel for a week      hotel was going through reations but to be fair we didnt hear anything we had requested a smoking room and was given a non smoking room  the restaurant was closed due to the re work so we had to go out to eat breakfast  i found the staff to be nice and friendly  and for my first visit to new york i was impressed by the location  i would stay there again 
N => Perfect  Although our stay was short  days we will definitely return to the Doubletree  The price was right   the location was key midtown manhattan Check in was seamless    I had booked online    it took less than  minute    the staff were so on it and available  As we walked to the elevators we passed the loungebar and it was filled with young people having a drink chilling online etc  there was a sense of quotsubdued hipnessquot which we liked in case we ran out of things to do in the city Not  The rooms were clean quiet and comfortable  The concierge recommended a great steakhouse Old Homestead since our first  choices were booked  Be careful with the minibar   theres a peculiar rule    if you so much as move not consume one of the items within you will be charged  My curious husband incurred such charge but it was taken off since we explained nothing was taken   Great experience 
N => Great value in Midtown Manhattan On a recent trip to see friends in the NYC area we ided at the last minute to go into the city for a night  It was y  weekend but we had no problem finding a room  I had stayed at plenty of hotels in Manhattan on business but my wife had not been to New York in several years  We wanted something centrally located clean and not too expensive unlike places I stayed on the company dime  That is exactly what we got at the Doubletree Metropolitan Our room was good sized for New York   not suite sized but enough room to open both suitcases and still have lots of space to move around  The bed was very comfortable linens clean and no nasty comforter made of unknown fabricmaterial The bathroom was small but not horrible  ble flooring new sink and a new or refinished tub  The water pressure was excellent  Stainless fixtures were new and of ent quality  The staff was extremely friendly  They were everywhere and constantly asking to assist  A nice touch considering the typical staffing at other hotels in the area Cons   for internet access  I guess thats how they can afford to sell you a room for less than  a night  Not good if youre there on business for several days but we werent  Small lobby but last time I checked I wasnt sleeping in the lobby Overall we were pleased with the Doubletree and will probably stay there again when we come to New York later this year  
N => ent place with bad AC This DoubleTree has a good location fairly close to Grand Central Station  Check in was easy  Room was small but thats fairly typical in NYC  The AC never got the room cool   but it was not bad enough nor did I have the time in my schedule to demand a new room  Breakfast was ok  The rates in NY are simply throught the roof but it is all relative  I would stay here again but cant give the place a strong recommendation  
N => Nice hotel with a great location I visited this hotel with a few girlfriends on a weekend trip to NYC  We found the value to be exceptional for NYC and the accomodations comfortable  We arrived early and were unable to check in but we were able to check out bags and the front desk clerk was able to direct us to a nice place to have lunch  Additionally we were in need of a place to have dinner one evening and the concierge suggested a nice steak house a few blocks away   Bobby Vans  We had a great timeLastly the warm chocolate chip cookies on check in were just a nice added bonus  
N => Amazing  Amazing service  When we arrived  our room was not ready so we were moved to another room almost immediately  Staff were super friendly Room was very clean  It was small  but big enough for two Great stay Would reccomend to everyone Loved the Doubletree would definitely stay again  
N => Too Many Problems to Stay Again The positives of this hotel are the location and the beds  It is very close to a subway very close to walk to great tourist and shopping areas it is easy to get to almost any spot from the hotel  The beds are very good and the pillows are great  The room is a little small for more than  people but was adequate for us  The bathroom is newly remodeled and while small very nice  Another positive was the doorman at am  He could not have been any nicer or more helpful The negatives be too many to write all  I booked and paid for the hotel about a month in advance  I asked for an upper floor with a view got the fourth floor with a view of a wall and air conditioning unit  Called and asked for different room and was told all Lexington Ave rooms were private apartments and nothing else was available  We were not able to check in at pm and had to place our bags in quotstoragequot for a   per bag  Since we were going to walk around we placed backpack and large overnight bag so the total was    Imagine our shock when we came back in and had to pay another   to get them out of the closet  Not a bellboy bringing them to our room but us walking into the closet and getting them  Just the beginning of the nickel and dime charges we experienced during our visit  We were not offered cookies and someone wrote about free bottled water well we were not offered anything that was free I had asked when I made my reservations if there was a fridge in the room to place insulin and was told yes  There is a fridge but it is so full of items that  vials of insulin kept knocking a beer off to the side and were charged   numerous times  I asked if we could have someone take out the items and leave the fridge for us to use and was told no but if an empty fridge became available they would bring it up for a charge  They did take off the charges of the beer when we checked out sort of My dhter had arrived before I did and she put up a credit card for incidentals  Four days after checkout her credit card was still holding  pending charges   a day plus the mini bar charges I was told would be taken off  They took the items off when we called to ask about the pending charges and they said the  a day incidental charge would come off the next day  Wow holding this money for  days is really not acceptable to me You have to pay for Internet access to the amount of   a day which is very unusual these days  I cannot think of anything that came as complimentary  I would really check around before staying here again and figure in the price of the things that are usually free at other hotels  I think this hotel was about  a night cheaper than the other  in the area and with the extra charges probably came out to be about  a night more expensive  The concierge was VERY rude and quite insulting when I asked for a map of the area  I suppose because I was not booking anything through them he assumed it was ok to be rude  Once again not what I was expecting  We were going to see if we could book a play through them and then ided we would plan everything else ourself so as to not be in a position to tip these horrid people  Overall it was not a good experience  except the location is great but there are other hotels in the exact area  We will try them next time  
N => New York City Weekend at a Doubletree Hotel Overall the stay was fine  The Hilton Hotel chain took over this hotel within the past three years  Prior to this it was a Loews Hotel  On arrival around noon we found out that we were going to be upgraded to a mini suite Diamond HHonors member but our room wasnt ready  We checked our two bags and a backpack  We were told that it was a   fee for the three bags  OK we would have tipped that much anyway  On our return we had to pay another   to get the bags back  Im nitpicking but my feeling is that if you are a guest waiting for a room there shouldnt be a charge in and out to store luggage  Room was nice with  plus feet of windows overlooking the street  Bed was comfortable bathroom was very small cable tv was ent internet access was   a day Hilton Honors lounge was opened only in the morning  Light breakfast items available Overall hotel is a s style hotel but modernized and updated  Location is close to everything we wanted to go to  Mass transit was nearby  Taxi to and from LaGuardia was around   
N => Loved the Doubletree We really didnt know where to stay for our first visit to NYC  We thought we wanted to be in Times Square but are glad we did not because of the amount of people noise etc there  Our room was nice and clean and the staff are so friendly  What we liked the most was the location next to a subway stop   this was a pleasant surprise for us when we arrived at our stop late at night    tired    just wanted to be in bed  We would definitely book here again The hotel is within walking distance to the Rockefeller Center Central Park NBC studios th Avenue think Prada Gucci LV YSL and so on Located right next door to the hotel is the Cafe Metro that serves up breakfast fresh fruit yogurt bacon amp egg wraps lunch wraps pastas salads dinner and late night munchies we had pizza  
N => Best place to stay This trip was intended to be a nice romantic weekend with my boyfriend that was also my birthday weekend  We had a BLAST in NY and the hotel just made it even better  It was a very retro modern hotel great style very clean  The bed was absolutely comfortable and the room was a good size with a huge window  The only downfall was the bathroom was a little awkward pedestal sink no counter space but lots of floor space so I ended up using the floor for my hairdryer and other girl bathroom stuff  Everything was very clean though and I was extremely please wtih the atmosphere  I would definitely recommend staying here if you are thinking about a trip to NY and Times Square  We ended up taking a cab everywhere but if it wasnt so cold we would have walked  The price was great too  
N => Very Disappointed with the Metropolitan Doubletree Inn New York City New York City Metropolitan Doubletree Inn Lexington Ave  Date e     Very Very DisappointedWe came to New York e    th to spend our th anniversary and were told that the Doubletree Inn on Lexington was a great place to stay  Boy were we fooled  When we checked in everything seem great hot cookies for both of us  When we got to our room we lhed  My husband actually asked the bellman if they made a mistake  The room looked like it belonged in a dump motel  Actually the motel room would have been better  We paid  a night to stay in a room that we could hardly move around in  They moved us up a couple of floors to what they thought was a better room  Not so  The bed was comfortable but that was all  We had to complain again and were finally offered  off our final bill  That was a joke  I couldn t believe that other registered people were paying that outragious amount for a terrible terrible room  If we were to go to New York again or if someone were to ask us about the hotel we would never stay there again and would advise that person not to stay there also  The location was great but the hotel was disgusting  
N => Will Not Stay Here Again We received no housekeeping the first two days of our stay  Even after complaining the first day that the room wasnt clean they still did not clean it on the second day  we asked for the room to be cleaned for us while we were out in the evening we returned to find it had been cleaned but some of our items were missing  The rooms are described as being reated but ours was already run down with peeling wallpaper and paint clogged drains and moldmildew all over the bathroom walls ceiling and shower curtain If anything touches the snack box above the minibar your room will be charged and it can be a bit of a surprise to find dozens of minibar charges when you havent taken anything on the bill you receive the morning you are leaving The hotel manager whom we eventually dealt with was very understanding and was good to work with to satisfactorily resolve most of our concerns  However we did have to spend a lot of time talking to other staff who were not so helpful or courteous before our concerns were finally resolved  The only good things we experienced about this hotel was the location as it is right on the Lexington Avenue metro line and very easy to get anywhere in Manhattan including all major attractions  The deli cafe metro just outside the hotel is great for fresh quick and affordable breakfasts  
N => Ideal Stayed here for one night with my wife and young dhter and was a bit worried reading reviews on this and other hotels in New York  I was expecting to have to pay a fortune to get a ent hotel The check in was very smooth and quick   no queue   even though it was about pm  Staff very kind and helpful  Cookie each was most welcome The room was a ent size perfectly acceptable especially as we spent most of our time out and about  The minibar was a bit dusty   curious as the rest of the room was very clean  Perhaps it was because no one uses the minibar as it is expensive We had a wonderful time here and would definitely return  If we had to find fault and this is being really picky it would be that the bathroom is slightly on the small side  Definitely recommended 
N => They went the extra mile Wonderful Experience  Great front desk outstanding manager quotTonyquot kudos to him he made all the differenceThe first night we stayed in the room AC was not working properly next day I went to the front desk to let them know when we returned from our day of sightseeing wed been put on the th executive floor   very nice room by the house manager at the time quotTonyquot he also threw in  days of Breakfast Buffet  The staff from the front desk to the resteraunt were very nice Id definitely return and recommend 
N => Okay but no coffee maker The location is very good   just a few blocks from Grand Central and other attractions in the city  I have never seen a hotel in New York that did not offer a coffee maker in the room however and the halls were not very clean  Housekeeping was slow not arriving to clean the room until after   The room was serviceable if spartan  Would we stay again We would check other places first  
N => Wheres the coffee We stayed at this hotel for  days     Arrival was great  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful not only for us but for our friends arriving the next day as well  The free welcome cookies are great and have everyone commenting  Its a great hook The room is just average the bathroom on the small side but for the price we paid this is New York deals are hard to come by it was all good Two problemsOne there is no in room coffee  This is the first North American hotel weve stayed in that did not have a coffee maker in the room  Dont know if this is a New York thing or a Doubletree thing but we are accustomed to making coffee in room first thing in the morning  So then we thought make our own with a french press   but they apparently have NO kettles to loan guests either So you are forced either to have breakfast in their over priced restaurant we did not   their loss or go elsewhere Fortunately there is a MacDonalds and a couple of reasonably priced cafes offering breakfast in the same block  They got our business instead  Sorry Doubletree but if youre going to give this business away thats your problem Two The porters and quotsecurityquot staff  One night we arrived back at the hotel to return to our room around  p m  I would not consider this late by New York standards  Had to show our room key to a security guard at the elevator entrance  I have no problem with this   but some notice like when checking in to expect this would have been nice  As well the porters were in such a hurry to make a tip and hussle us out the front door when we left that we were in the taxi before we realized that we had forgotten to check out  Fortunately we had paid our bill in full already  The driver was returning to the hotel so he returned our room keys we called and checked upon returning home  However it seems to me that rushing guests out of the hotel lobby quite so quickly could cause several problems  It might be an idea for the hotel to ask their porters to at least make sure guests have checked out first 
N => Convenient Yet Quiet Location We just returned from a long weekend in NYC  We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan at st and Lexington  The check in process was fairly slow but the bell staff was on top of luggage storage   perhaps because they charge bag to store and bag to retrieve each piece I found that to be a bit over the top  All in all the hotel was great  It was just a short   block walk to Rockefeller Center and the subway stop was just around the corner from the hotel  The breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about  Im just not a fan of buffets  It was adequate but not worth the  they charge for it  Who wants to eat at the hotel when youre in NYC anyway    right A few random notes The hotel towels were above average quality  We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to get the elevator    and we were on a high floor  The recent remodel was a success  The rooms are nicely appointed and the lobbylounge are modern looking  The hotel offers Neutrogena bath products including facial cleanser and facial lotion  You can actually open the window in your room about  inches to let in the sounds and smells of the city if you dare  If you are looking for a convenient reasonably priced hotel in Manhattan but dont want to be in the Times Square area you should definitely consider the Doubletree Metropolitan 
N => Very Handy Hotel   Hotel is in a very handy spot and within walking distance of the NBC studiosCharming hotel on check in they give you a complimentary warm cookieRoom was a ent size well used but cleanAlthough the room was warm and at a constant temperature the heater was broken which prevented us giving the room that little extra boost of heat thats nice in the eveningsThe view was magnificant although it was my first time in NY so it was rose tinted glasses all the wayOh yea   the first night of our stay it rained buckets   Umbrellas were  dollars in the hotel shop a little overpriced if you ask me 
N => Wonderful Stay Observations My wife infant dhter and I stayed here for a weekend in   We arrived before the normal check in time but the front desk was extremely accomodating  Our front desk agent Alexandra  was very friendly and made us feel very welcome  Our room was clean and nicely furnished  We had requested a crib and this was brought fairly promptly  My wife wanted some ice and as I was wandering down the hall with the bucket a housekeeping staff person went way out of her way to direct me to the ice machine and to give me an extra bag to get some more ice as the bucket was on the small side  Once I arrived back at the room we received a phone call from downstairs asking if everything in the room was ok  I definitely appreciated the effort the staff seemed to put in to making sure we were taken care of  Lastly on the day of our check out the bellmen their names were Luis and Reginald were very helpful in arranging a car service to the airport for us at a reasonable price  Location This is in a great location literally right above the  train and a short walk to the E also  Complaints Not many and not major in my mind  But here they are   Concierge desk went to ask for restaurant recommendations and they did not seem caring nor did they really want to take the time to describe anything give me a map offer to make a reservation etc  And there was no line behind me either  I found them rather snooty    Minibar snack items on the desk were dusty  I didnt indulge in any items and was charged for one  However the charge was promptly removed no questions asked when I brought it up to the front desk  
N => A great choice For my hubbys birthday we booked a  day trip to the Big Apple  The hotel was great We loved the retro feel  The room was small but clean and comfortable  The bathroom was good  The night we arrived there was a warm cookie waiting for us and it was a really nice touch  The towels were changed promptly every day and the hotel offered little bottles of Neutrogena products like shampoo lotion etc  The location of this hotel was ok but it was a ent  minute hike to Times Square We did not eat breakfast at the hotel but opted for the little breakfastlunch joint next door called Metro Cafe  Absolutely loved it So fast the food was good and prices just right 
N => Exceeded Expectations When I found out that my company had booked me into a hotel that was under  a night in NYC I was nervous but the Doubletree exceeded my expectations  I was able to check in early around   No rooms with one bed were available so I took two double beds  Although the beds took up the majority of the floor space the room was definitely larger than expected and equivalent in size to rooms Ive had in other cities whereas I ususally find NY rooms to be miniature  Desk set up was also functional and flat panel TV was nice I found the beds to be extremely comfortable  I was on the th floor  No real view looked out onto some lower rooftops but away from the street so it was very quiet  I also didnt hear neighbors on either side not sure if hotel was full but lobby was busy  I found this to be one of my quieter hotel stays and slept better than I usually do in hotels My only complaints are that the hotel room was a bit musty and temperature did not seem highly adjustable although I did like that you could leave the unit on for venting and background noise  Only serious problem was that the bathroom smelled VERY strongly of mildew and mildew was visible between tiles and on the bottom of the shower curtain  Given the very small size of the bathroom this was quite unpleasant I thought the location was good  An easy walk to Times Square and even walkable to Herald Square shopping  Not as convenient to restaurants  This is kind of away from both the tourist areas and the neighborhoods in more of a business district so I guess it depends on what kind of atmosphere youre looking for  
N => Yes the rooms are small   and there are other small issues  However    I am a picky traveler   no two ways about it  I was dubious about a hotel in NYC for  a night not to mention that their parking is only      compared with upwards of  most other places  However I was pleasantly surprised     my requested room type was arranged without hesitation from the staff the front desk clerks were VERY friendly and helpful The room is small but it was a one night stopover en route from Philadelphia to New Hampshire so space was not a requirement  The room was comfortable and well appointed NYC chic  I did take issue with one thing however  Per the terms of HH Diamond membership Doubletree properties are supposed to provide internet free of charge to members either that or breakfast  When I contacted the property they indicated that I would have to pay the  access charge for the internet     I found that to be irritating but would not stop me from returning  The location at th amp Lex is right in the heart of things with a subway stop literally right outside the door  The staff was able to direct us to a great little area for a late dinner midnight on a Sunday night called Little West th St in the meatpacking district  VERY hip and trendy  Overall a pleasant experience  
N => Average stay We were booked in to the Doubletree for four nights at the beginning of ch and had a pretty average time  When we arrived we were greeted by a very pleasent receptionist who was extremely helpful and polite  We checked in with no problems and were handed our two warm cookies  The room itself was fine   not massive but we werent expecting it  A big highlight for me was the bed   we had two doubles in our room and they were huge and extremely comfortable especially the pillows The bathroom was clean and we were given Neutrogena products every day  The hotel restaurant staff were great and even let me have whatever i wanted on the breakfast buffet even though i only paid for scrambled eggsNow for the bad points   no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms  I know there are more coffee places in NY than you can shake a stick at but when you fancy one as soon as you wake up you dont expect to have to pay ridiculous money for room service  Also the concierge was so unhelpful   either hed had a bad day or he was just plain miserable but we found him rude and unpleasent  We were also allocated a room at the back of the hotel which meant our view consisted of an ugly tower block  All in all the hotel was okay   fab location and a good nights sleep but dont expect anything more  For a little bit extra i would recommend the riot quis on Time Square   ive stayed there before and its a class above the Doubletree no cookies though    
N => Good Location Close to everything  Had a great time in NYC the hotel staff was friendly and the room was just right for two people  A good place to stay with your family because there was so many places to eat and the food prices were reasonable   you can walk to Time Square or take the Subway that was at the corner of are hotel  Will stay here again   
N => Good location but nothing more to say  We stayed here for  nights recently and the hotel itself was clean and had been recently updated in the front lobby area  bearing in mind you had a bit of a reality check once you reached your floor and saw the tired looking corridorswalk ways  Having been in Toronto for the previous  nights though we realised how spoilt wed been with that hotel On arrival to which we were early we were unsure whether we would be able to check in and didnt expect it however we were greeted by the receptionist who must had a bad start to the day and had a right face on her On checking in she confirmed to us that we were booked in for  nights which we stated at the time was incorrect and that we were actually booked in for  this she argued until she actually gave me chance to show the hotel voucher which stated   She then proceeded out the back to which my husband and I expected this to have been dealt with on her return to which we got an all ok and she checked us in gave us a cookie without no have a nice day or nothing The room was small which i expected but clean and fresh looked at the mini bar but didnt actually touch it realising you only had  secs also some of the stuff looked like it had been on their years Bathroom was ok small and relatively clean with good assortment of shampoo etc  Best thing was the hairdryer didnt even unpack mine as this was so good The crunch came when after  nights stay we woke up to find a checking out form underneath our door My husband phoned down reception who were adament that we were only booked in for  nights and we were checking out that day  Never have i got dressed so quick to resolve this having already contacted the company whod organised our trip who confirmed the booking and emails confirmation all stated  nights The receptionist different to the one on check in just kept stating quotour system shows  nights and youre checking out todayquot as you can understand things started to get a little strained  Luckily a deputy manager was near and overheard there was a problem and he informed the receptionist what to do and how to approach it it was then we explained that wed thought the problem had been resolved on check in and didnt expect this half way through our stay  At this time the hotel excepted no responsibility for the error whilst they had no proof of the booking document to which i then spent the next hour on my mobile phoning the UK to get the company to fax over the necessary documents  Even they stated that the hotel were not too helpful as they were ringing them to try and confirm that this had been received Finally the DM told us not to worry about this and we should wait till later to see if this had been sorted  A complimentary voucher for breakfast was given as a goodwill to try and appease us but to us it was a little too late  After this i wouldnt give the hotel the satisfaction of giving them any more of my Overall after this i was really disapointed with the way wed been treated and i would have to think strongly about returning here  
N => Value for money but not perfect Location is great  just walking distance from th avenue and central park and even times square is not that far away if you are not used to do everything by car Room was spacious and we sat on a corner where the fire cars passed but they didnt make enough noise to awake you  We had a room with a connecting door and that was irritating because you hear everything in the room next to you  So make sure you do not have that We were on the th floor Bathroom wasnt cleaned very good hairs in the bath tub  But overall it was ent We had dinner once because of the bad weather but I wouldnt recommend it Given prices in NY it is value for money but I think there are better options  
N => The pictures on the web site are very different to the hotel This hotel was under renavations when we went there but having said that the hotel badly needed to be renevated  This hotel is  blocks from Times Square and is not really in the centre if things  The staff are not very accomadationg and unless you show them money they are not willing to help you  You do have to pay a certain fee to leave your bags into storage while you have checked out of the room  It costs  doller per bag and  doller per bag when you are taking the bags out plus tip  Its a joke  We choose a double King Size room non smoking  The duvets that they have have no covers on them so we desided to ask downstairs at reception and they said that they wash the duvets each time but why was our duvet filthy  They replaced the duvet with no cover We had dinner downstairs and Breakfast it cost   dollers for  of us for a breakfast And for the dinner it cost    Everything was fried that was on the menu amp very expensive We were not impressed with the Metropolitan Double Tree New YorkGlad to go back home 
N => Theres better places to stay in the City    We booked this through Expedia so the price was right night for a Saturday but we would not stay here again  The hotel itself wasnt bad a little run down at least the th floor was but the room wasnt ready when we checked in at pm and they charged us  to hold the bags  Yes I did read the reviews ahead of time but sometimes you can talk your way out of things although not this time The bellboy told us that charging for luggage is a new trend in the city however I have not come across this at any other hotels in New York or anywhere worldwide  be its a Hilton thing because they dont already have enough money right Must be why the prices were so reasonable  That and the bathrooms were literally the size of a small closet with no exhaust fan  No complaints about the room other than the ones other reviews mention  Great location though but unfortunately I would not recommend this place to anyone  
N => Beware of Extra Costs After staying in various hotels on the west coast i booked this hotel after reading pretty good reviews on Trip Advisor  Let me say right now that be all NY hotels run this way but i was shocked at all the extras i had to pay what seemes a lot of extra   which i did not find in any of the west coast hotels we stayed in on our trip  The room itself was ok the bathroom tiny and the or in the bathroom poor peeling paint on ceiling etc  Having spent a week in L A i was used to tipping but this seemed crazyHere is a list of costs        Mini Bar broken    anything we wanted we had to order from room service      and tip the staffNo water in the room    small bottles  dollars free in all the previous hotels on our stayInternet    hours  dollars free in all the previous hotels on our stayNeeded to print  page of a receipt for a tour of NY    dollars free in all the previous hotels on our stayLeave bags at hotel as we had a later flight after check in   Had to pay to leave the bags and pay to pick them up againfree in all the previous hotels on our stayAs i said before  perhaps this is how hotels work in NY but to be honest it left a sour taste in my mouth as it felt like at every turn someone wanted to make a quick buck out of us  The hotel itself is not great  nice reception and ground floor but once the elevator doors open on your level     its a different story I know it is confusing on Trip advisor    one person says great   the other says        but trust me      NY has better places i am sure 
N => OK stay Service and lobby was nice but room was small hot and needed remodeling  All of this made the price I paid ridiculous  However I sent an email through the website about my problems and they deducted a good amount from the bill  
N => Great hotel would go back again Me and my husband have just come back from new york  It was my first trip there and our stay at the doubletree did not disappoint  Upon arrival at pm we got checked in very quickly and even got a room upgrade free of charge we were very happy that our room was already available for us as we were early  The hot cookies on arrival was a really welcoming touch  Our room was on the th floor and had a great view over lexington avenue  The room was spacious and extremely clean and considering how close we were to the front of the building noise was not a problem for us  Of course there is noise you are in new york after all but we had no problem sleeping especially with such comfortable beds  It is right next to the subway which is great to get to anywhere in the city  The staff were very helpful and gave great advise on things to do and places to go  On return from a long day our room had been cleaned and fresh towels in the bathroom  Bathrooms are a bit small but what else to you need to do apart from shower in a clean and tidy bathroom  On our departure check out was quick and easy and one of the door men had organised a car to take us back to JFK airport for about  which saved us getting a taxi and gave us a very comftable ride  In hole we will have no hesitation in staying in the doubletree on our return to new york  If you are looking for things to do the hotel gives discount on things like helicopter trips which was fantastic and they will book any trip you want for you and also make reservations for restaurants  I would recommend trying out a place call serendipity we had a lovely meal and you have to try one of there famous frozen hot chocolates they are gorgeous  Also the Olive Garden in times square is a really good place to eat if you like Italian food  If you are wanting to see a show get your tickets from TKTS beside the riot in times square they do great prices but can be busy they open from  pm  
N => I loved this place and Im very hard to please First of all let me say    upon reading the reviews I serioulsy dont understand some of things people complain about seriously  A hotel is not going to be perfect   It is not your home I had booked with the Wellington NYC but from reading the reviews and getting messages back from my fellow trip advisors I cancelled my reservation based on the information I received in concern to rodents and roaches  That is one thing I will not tolerate  So we booked the Doubletree Metropolitan  We loved it The location was excellent and we walked to Rockefeller Center Times Square and even Central Park  Upon our arrival and stepping off the taxi we were wecolmed very warmly  We were tired from a delayed flight and we were able to check in upon arrival  Everyone was so friendly and attentative  I had my fingers crossed upon arriving to my floor which was the rd  I heard a lot of negative feedback about the rd floor so I was hoping it wasnt true  The room was great The room was roomy but the set up of the beds and desk made the room seem a bit crowded but from the door to the beds there was a wide open space  We had two double beds  The bathroom was a bit small but seriously what do you need   Its not home The room was clean it didnt smell  The bathroom was exceptionally clean  Our view was of the quotFire Dept quot everyone complained about  We were never in the room and at night when we slept it was not even an issue   its NY you are going to hear sirens anywhere you go  Make sure you take off your DO NOT DISTURB sign because Housekeeping will NOT come if you have it on  which is excellent   we forgot to take it off but they came later on that day and cleaned it with no hesistation  The staff was very helpful and gave us cookies whenever we asked  Upon check out we were able to leave our luggage and our bags while we ventured out to the Empire State Building  They even arranged a car for us instead of having to catch a taxi  The cost was   to LaGuardia which is good because the taxi was about the same but you get the luxury of being in a comfy car rather than an icky taxi  When we returned to get our luggage our car was ready for us  Everything in the hotel was great   people nit pick about the most ridiculous things    yes there was bit of peeling paint on the wall but I would rather have that than dirty rodents mold or anything of that nature  The room for or received an A for effort for me  It was worth it to me to spend a bit more money on a clean place to sleep  The only negative about the room was the mini bar and the snack tray  The snack tray and mini bar have sensors that can track if the item has been touched or moved and they are super sensative  The snack tray was located on the long desk and we put our luggage on top of the desk near the snack tray  You cannot even open the fridge because you will be charged you cannot store items in there either  Upon checking out we had   in mini bar charges but they took them off with no hesitation  They told us having items near the tray and the vibration  set off a sensor as they are very sensitive  So just be careful of that  Upon checking out we were offered more cookies so that we would have snack for later   How sweet was that I would definately stay there again  
N => Nice but noisy in NY We stayed for  nights  The hotel staff was very accomodating  We stayed on the th floor  only  floors we had to move rooms after the first night due to some reations on the top floor  We ended up being in a balony king suite there wasnt a view just buildings across the street  The room was nice toliet shower area is very tiny The bed was very comfortable  The door to the balcony didnt block out much noise  I was woken up  times by a fire truck and police cars there is a fire station down the street from the hotel  I was woken up also by banging etc above us not sure if it was construction but it almost sounded as if someone was dropping shoes or something above our room  The breakfast at the hotel was just ok the hot food was cold and the cold food milk was warm  We had  free coupons for breakfast but its isnt worth the money if you do pay  Overall the staff was helpful and the rooms were clean  
N => Rooms disappointing everything else good Stayed a few nights at the Doubltree Metropolitan  The rooms are just not nearly up to the price point of the hotel although the rest of the hotel was nice  Details   GOOD  Workout facility is pretty nice  Staff were friendly and helpful all around  Common areas and facilities are well kept  Location is excellentBAD  Rooms are just not in good shape  Oddly they look like they attempted to remodel the rooms in recent years but it seems like they only did it half way   Bathroom had some BLACK MOLD which had been partially painted over   The furniture walls fixtures and carpeting all need work  SUPER THIN walls particularly if you get a room with an adjoining room door  I could make out normal conversation from the room next door For the   a night this place costs this time of year its just not worth the money  Youll want to stay elsewhere  
N => Highly Disappointed To say the least I was extremely disappointed and soooo very glad we only stayed  nite  I was traveling with my  dhters  Our check in was wonderful  Very nice and helpful person checked us in  She alleged she was giving us an upgrade to a deluxe rom but if it was deluxe I would hate to see the standard room  It was extremely small even by New York standards  Cleanliness was so so  We were in our room a few minutes and preparing to go and visit the city when an unknown man entered our room with a pass key and quickly excused himself when he realized someone was in the room  He did not have a uniform or identify himself as an employee  I immediately called the front desk and they had security contact me  They took my information and said they would check into it  Over the next few minutes I found a maid and located who the man was  He was working for the hotel but not wearing a uniform and had no ID on him  I went downstairs and located the head of security  He had done nothing to try and found out who this was  Luckily it was an employee because they did not to care about our safety  When we returned later that nite around  pm and in desperate need of showers to go to bed we discovered the shower did not work  It took over an hour to get it operational and I had to be extremely demanding with management  A very long day for  young girls  They were not cooperative with trying to find us an alternate room until after they confirmed our shower was repaired  I had requested additional towels and they forgot to send them up  Needless to say when we moved to the Hilton New York the following day for our remaining  nites we were elated  We had only booked this  nite at the Doubletree because the Hilton New York was sold out that nite  Never again  Beware 
N => Great hotel  Great Location My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our first trip to NYC  We thought the hotel was great  The rooms were clean and comfortable and larger than what imagined  The hotel staff were very quick and friendly upon check in and check out  We liked the contemporaryretrto chic or of this hotel  Although our room faced the street we were surprised that we didnt hear too much street noise  Bathrooms were tiny but probably comparable to most NYC hotel rooms  The hotel was in a safe area and walking distance to Times Square Rockafeller Plaza and Central Park  Subway station was right outside the front door and we had no probelms or any wait to get a cab I just got done reading the other reviews of this property  The other reviewers obviously had high unrealistic expectations for a hotel in the heart of Manhattan  Yes hotels rooms are small in the city  Yes sometimes you can hear the street traffic  Yes all mini bar items in any hotel room in any city are going to cost you a small fortune  Anyways who goes to NYC to sit in their hotel room and eat from the mini bar I would recommend this hotel over Times Square hotels because you dont have to battle crowds to get in and out  You also are not battling other people for cabs and are not sitting in bumper to bumper traffic once you catch a cab  We were very happy with our room and would stay here again in a heartbeat  
N => Not great  Just returned from a  day trip to New York  When we arrived our room was not ready so the four of us had one drink each in the hotel bar which cost a fortune Eventually got to the room and was disappointed to find no coffeetea facilitiesapparently learnt later the hotel is taxed if you have this in the room a free token to use at the cafe bar next to the hotel wouldnve been nice  There was however a minibar and a tray containing pringles nuts bottled water and chocolates  all at a cost I hastened to add  Our room was on the back of the hotel looking straight onto the kitchens of another hotel where hotelkitchen staff hung out for their breaks so we had to keep the blinds down for privacy  The room was small and the bathroom tiny  The shower was a nighte to use  To add insult to injury on the last day I was billed for two items from the snack tray which I had not had  Receptionist told me the tray the items were resting on had sensors and had I read the note nestling among the items  I wouldve been aware should you remove an item for more then  seconds it assumes you have purchased it I explained I had not had the charge items in fact they all items were still on the tray I got the items removed from my bill but No apology  On the last day they even charged you to put your luggage in the luggage room   A charged was made for each bag left in and they charged you to get them out again  Needless to say this sums up in my opinion the ethos of the Hotel nothing was free not even a cup of coffee  Have a nice Day 
N => Doubletrees Metropolitan Hotel Grows Rotten Fruit My Review of Doubetree Metropolitian HotelStayed one night in t I unfortunately ided to stay at this hotel  It seemed like a good deal at the time  A little over  for a hotel in Manhattan  One with its own bathroom  Not bad  But alas many things were wrong    I was told I had a room with a view  Unless you consider a large building blocking out all the sun and anything else to see a view I would strongly disagree  A park thats a view  A landscape of city lights thats a view  A river thats a view  A slab of concrete Not a view  Also I should not that when I did open up my blinds there was a scotch taped sign on the window that read something to the effect of quotConstruction is going on outside this building  You might want to keep your blinds closed because construction workers will be looking in quot So even if there was a view   they were trying to get me not to see it anyway  Hey be they thought the scotch taped sign was the view It did have nice font    The air conditioner wasnt working  So I do have to admit I did have a sauna in my room which was an unexpected treat  Well not really much of a treat since the sauna was the entire room  They never sent someone up as promised and wouldnt respond to my request to change a room  be the entire hotel was just rooms of saunas    The next morning upon check out to find a better hotel which would at this point have meant a park bench I spoke to a quotmanagerquot he had a tag that read quotmanagerquot but considering his inability to manage be he got them at a a real manager at a hotel he stayed at the way a kid gets those plastic pilot wings from the real captain on a plane  This quotmanagerquot had a quotso sad too badquot attitude  He actually tried to tell me that the room I had did indeed have a view  quotSlabs of concrete are very popular views in New York City  Youre very lucky to have had a room with that kind of viewquot When I told him about the sauna he tried to charge me extra because I was not supposed to get a room with a sauna  He didnt even realize any of their rooms had personal saunas  Okay I exaggerate a bit  But this next part I dont  He actually asked me if I knew how to turn on the air conditioner  That perhaps I didnt know how to switch the button from quotoffquot to quotonquot and it was my fault and not the hotels  Granted Im no rocket scientist but I have learned how to do that  Even the desk guy was shocked at this question probably because the quotmanagerquot had the nerve to ask it twice  Possibly he thought I could not only not turn things quotonquot but that I didnt understand the english language  Sure I speak with a NJNY accent but I was in NY and I have a very good command of NY language  I can say quotNot for nothinquot and quotare you gonna eat thatquot with the best of them  And I can most certainly understand lame questions because I know live in LA  My suggestion to anyone wanting to stay at this hotel is to check yourself into Bellevue first because you need to have your head examined  
N => Good place to stay in mid town No questions   this place is good to stay compared with other places around  
N => Nice place nice location Just got back from a weekend trip to the Big Apple and enjoyed our stay at the Doubletree in Midtown st amp Lexington  I had a tough time finding a hotel in this area for under  a night   the Doubletree was just under that about  the pictures on the website looked nice and the hotel reviews seemed pretty positive so I went ahead and booked this hotel  Im glad we chose to stay here  The room was spacious for a Manhattan hotel in this price range clean well orated modern bath fixtures the bed was VERY comfortable nice flat screen tv great massaging showerhead  Warm cookies at check in was a treat  Staffed security guard at elevators after dark asked to see our room key before allowed onto the elevators nice to feel safe  Shortcomings   for internet access lacked in electrical outlets limited counter spacestorage spaceplaces to hang towels in bathroom fire station down the block  Great area of Midtown to stay though  Easy walk to United Nations Rockafeller Center Fifth Ave shopping little further to Times Square but still walkable  I would stay here again  
N => An industrial hotel If you dont mind industrial accommodation   its quite all right but if youre seeking a little more homey feeling in a hotel   you wont find it there  Small rooms staff that underscores the feeling youre just one of their thousand guests and past century oration  Considering their rates   its not a good deal  
N => Great experience for first time NYC trip This being my first trip to NYC I wanted to stay in a pretty nice hotel but not too expensive  When checking in the lady at the front desk was super nice and asked me if I would like to upgrade my room for no charge but me being scared to be taken for a sucker advised I would just stick w the queen size bed I had reserved  The cookie they gave me was terrificjust what I needed after my first crazy cab ride through the city The room was very nicea little rough around the edges but the bed was SO comfortable  Given that I had carried on my luggage and with the rules about taking liquid on the plane I was very happy to see the Neutrogena products that were provided in the bathroom  The only negative thing I can really say about this hotel was how thin the walls are  You can hear everything a person is saying in the next room  The most positive thing I can say about this hotel is the service  excellent My flight was not until the evening and they offer to hold your luggage and have a town car take you to the airport for the same amt that a cab would cost It was absolutely wonderful to not have to worry about lugging my suitcase around the city  I would definitely stay here for my next trip to NYC which I have planned for ember but the price for that time of year is double what I paid for in y so Im afraid Ill have to go elsewhere due to costs Wonderful experience for a first NYC trip 
N => Avoid this hotel Computer system was down all day so we could not check in until after  and that was after waiting in line for an hour  No offer of a comp of any type  Room was dirty  Discovered this after we got in at  AM  Sheets were stained and the bathroom had not been cleaned  Had to change rooms at  AM with no assistance with luggage  Were not told that we had breakfast included  New room had broken lights that were never fixed during our stay despite calling the front desk  The remote had no batteries and this was also not fixed despite calls to the front desk  When we checked out we werent even apologized to much less given any type of discount for the filthy room and room switch at  AM  Many better places to stay in NYC  Do not stay here  
N => Not What We Expected This being our first time to NYC my boyfriend and I really wanted to stay at a nice place  We were there from y th to y th  This hotel being in an quotidealquot location and looked very nice we were sold  Upon arriving we were pretty impressed  Our room looked nice the service was great I even boasted to my boyfriend how great of taste I had  Unfortunately later on he would have the uper hand  The first night we found out how noisy it was  You heard perfectly the people showering above us  We cant really complain about the noise outside as it IS NYC but I do not recommend staying on the Lexington St  side  Going through our room and walking down the hall we were really let down  The wall paper in the halls were peeling and the siding was falling off of the wall  Our room had water damage and beside the sink vanity looked like it was never cleaned   we got that taken care of after  calls   Our large lamp also did not work and even after the housekeeping lady tried it infront of us it was never fixed  Also the ice machine and quotvending machinesquot which was a single pop machine was the scariest site we both saw  Located in a dark dirty room by the service elevators and itors closet there was garbage old mops and broken equiptment everywhere  I definately did not go back and made my poor boyfriend make that quotlovelyquot trip  Our quotanti slipquot tub was anything but after my boyfriend took a nasty spill and still has the lump to prove it  Please get the bathmat offered if you call  Though the room service was friendly the food was HORRIBLE  We had breakfast one morning and then went to the restaurant the next and both were very bad experiences  We left our room on the rd day by am and when we returned at pm that evening our room was not cleaned  If we didnt have a broadway to go to that night we would have to wait outside the room while it was cleaned or wait until the next day  Our quotstockedquot mini bar was never stocked even when we called  times  Unfortunately the only real quotplusquot we could think of for this hotel was the cookies  They are delicious haha but other than that we left unsatisfied  The hotel looks wonderful and the rooms amazing until you really look at what youre paying for  Perhaps if we coughed up the money to stay in a guest suite or one of the larger rooms  we had a queen non smoking  but I wouldnt risk the money  I only wish I took photos to back up my experience  The photos already taken though give a good impression on what it is like  The rooms are nice looking but falling apart  
N => A pleasant wonderful stay     We stayed from y    y   I read some of the Tripadvisor reviews before I stayed and knew a few things to ask for ahead of time  When we got there I asked for a non smoking room that was not on the side of the st street that side apparently has a fire station not one next to the elevator and one on a higher floor  I was given a room upgrade to a deluxe and given the choice of floor  or   There are  floors total  I chose floor  and stayed in room  and had a great view of the Crysler building by the way room  was next to the elevator  I know it seems demanding but if you are nice to the the front desk people and just explain that you called ahead of time with these requests they are more than happy to oblige  Our room was wonderful  It was better than I expected and I was really worried because I never stayed here before  The room was a lot bigger than I expected especially by New York standards and came with a chaise lounge chair however we were upgraded to a Deluxe room so be that is why  The bed was very comfortable with soft sheets pillows and comforter  The room and bathroom were immaculate  I am picky about bathroom cleanliness there was not a hair to be found  Soap facial moisturizer lotion shower gel facial liquid soap vanity kit sewing kit and shower cap were provided and made by Neutrogena  The shower worked perfect and I tested it immediately when we entered the room I read that someone had poor water pressure during their stay  The air conditioning was perfect and could be adjusted from low medium to high but not shut off completely  It was over  degrees every day so this was not a problem we love air conditioning We did receive  delicious cookies at the check in and it came in handy when I got the munchies in the morning When we checked out we left our bags with the hotel storage for  per bag  each bag in  for each back out We hung out for a few hours afterward and then returned to the hotel to retrieve our bags without a problem  The only criticism I have about the room is that the sink drained a little slow but was not a great concern for me  Also some of the wallpaper near the window had bubbled out a bit but again was not a great concern for me  We did not use the internet and only watched a little TV so I can not really comment on those services  We did not order room service  However on our second night our neighbors next to us room  had two kids and they kept opening and closing their doors after pm  We called security and they came immediately and spoke with the people and it stopped  We had the same problem the next night called security again  They came immediately and took care of the problem  After that we slept like babiesBy the way we had breakfast at the Luncheonette restaurant around the corner  But you can go cheaper at Oxford Cafe I highly recommend this hotel for a vacation or a weekend away  We had a great time and I look forward to our next visit  
N => Adequate  No more no less New York Doulbetree Metropolitan AdequateDate e  Pros Good location next to subway so we only had to use cabs getting to amp from LaGuardia no problems with AC or enough hot water  We did have a small problem with the shower faucet that was turned so extremely tight we had to call the front desk to send someone to correct it  After the second call a maintenance person came right away to loosen it  Beds were very comfortable Delicious hot chocolate chip cookies were given to us on check in which by the way they let us do upon arrival around   Staff was pleasant and it looked like they went out of their way to greet guests enterting the hotel  We stayed four nights  We had to show our room keys before entering the elevator after  so we felt they were concerned about safety Their Mets Grill was pricey  for a baked potato the size of a tennis ball that only came with sour cream but the food was nice enough Also there is a PAX Wholesome Foods place around the corner on nd where we got great takeout food including a wonderful spinach quiche and fresh salad made to order  Reasonably priced too Cons Bath was indeed small  Bed linen was never changed during our  night stay with no mention of their trying to help the environment  One night we had to call housekeeping for washcloths which they delivered right away  They never cleaned the ice bucket or changed the plastic bag insert  The ice machine on the th floor is located in what appeared to a room that was formerly an elevator shaft  It was a bit dark amp scary  One night we noticed they were still cleaning rooms on our floor at  at night Overall I would probably stay there again   with better rates  
N => Pleasantly surprised We were solicited for a Hilton vacation club presentation with the incentive a  night stay for a greatly reduced rate at this hotel  We LOVE NYC so we ided to go for it  We were a little concerned because of the mixed reviews  We arrived at about PM early for the typical PM NYC hotel check in  They are working on the buildings exterior so there was no place to pull the car in front to offload our luggage  We had to go around the block again no mean feat in mid town weekday traffic go directly to the parking garage then schlep our luggage on foot to the lobby about  a block  Other than that no problem no wait warm delicious quotwelcomequot cookies and right up to our room As others have mentioned its not a huge room somewhat below our experience of average size by NYC mid range standards but clean with a truly excellent bed and linens  Hair dryer iron ironing board provided but no coffee maker internet access costs in the room although its free in the lobby and no premium channels on the TV unless you pay for them  For what we were paying it was just fine  Probably the friendliest most helpful staff we have ever encountered in NYC including at hotels with higher rack rates than this  And we go to NYC a lot  They really impressed us  And they all spoke excellent English which trust us is not always the case We had a room service breakfast only because we were given  worth of vouchers at the presentation which had to be spent on this current stay and could not be applied to the room charges or parking  We would never eat in in NYC otherwise  A full room service breakfast for two came to   including  each for bacon eggs  juice toast home fries and coffee plus    sales tax   automatic gratuity and  room delivery charge but to be fair all this is spelled out in the breakfast order form left in your room  The food was OK but honey no bacon and eggs is worth  even with freshly squeezed juice Do yourself a favor and walk to a diner unless someone else is paying for it Another nice thing check out is noon as opposed to the AM at most other places weve stayed  Made for a much less hectic morning  
N => Yikes   bad far out number the good I read some other posts here before I went to this hotel and I agreewith most of the negative reviews  upon our arrival we were put into a room on the nd floor  with a huge fan or exhast vernt of some kindinches from our window   since I could not be near that loud noise I asked that they move us to antoher room   we were told that we woudl be getting an quotupgradequot and that we were on a higher floor  Once we got to our new room it was just as big as our quotnon upgradedquot room but with a smaller queen bed I didnt want to spend my whole first day whinning to the front desk so I ided to just take the room small bed and all   but then I went to turn on the AC unit   YIKES it sounded like there was a dying animal inside   it made such a terrible noise most likely from the belt  So once again I went downstairs this time to cancel all together refund or not There was a man working the font desk no manager around and he offered to once again upgraded me and this time garanteed it  Thank goodness this time it was an upgrade  We were mvoed to the th floor and had a room with a balcony It really was nice to have an outside area to hang out with out all the street nonsense The room did still have major cosmetic issues just like all the rest there was peeling wall paper and paint   the window sills were all cracked and the tub was scratched and dented   Although the final upgrade was ok I walked over to the Waldorf when I was having issues with this hotel and found out that they were actaully better priced I would not stay here again   and I would not allow my friends to stay there either 
N => Choose the Hilton Time Square Not that it is a bad hotel but to me it was not worth the hassle  I like to have a quotcoolquot as in temp room  This hotel had horrible air circulationconditioning  I would actually get dizzy in the rooms If I opened the window it was better but having the fire station across the street made it impossible to have the window open at night  The or was updated but in a cheap way  Bathrooms provided little storage space and found the desk chair cheap and uncomfortable  You can certainly do better for the money  Doubletree is a nice brand but not this location 
N => Pricey but it was OK  I would like to start saying that eventhough I was in the city for business I found myself very confortable staying at this hotel I have to comment on a few things as you have read in the previous comments  for example  Pricey yes but who isn t in NY city   Hotel definitively needs some work mostly in the bathrooms  They are very small and not well kept  I really did not like the bathrooms   The rooms are not as small as everybody say I found them to be very good size and they have wonderful beds  Beds are the highlight of the room   Location is perfect good neighborhood   Cookies at check in are a great touch    Noisy yes you pretty much hear everything in the rooms next to you however it did not bother me Overall I liked my stay staff was not very friendly but again I was on business so I did not need that much pampering If I have to come back to NY I will keep this hotel within my options  
N => No Air Conditioning I stayed here because I always stay at Hilton properties and I wanted to use my Hilton Honors points  As soon as we entered our room we noticed the air conditioning was not working  After three calls to complain we were told there was no air in any of the rooms because of the outside temperature was not hot enough and we would need to open our window if we were hot  The outside temperatures got up into the mid s and still no air  Try getting some sleep with a fire station and police department directly across the street not to mention the hotel restaurants vent blowing food stink right into the window  Their website states the rooms come with air conditioning and quotin room climate controlquot  I would have overlooked the dusty furniture dirty bedskirt clogged sink and hair in my bathtub and on the toilet if I had only had air  My stay there was absolutely miserable 
N => Jsut Alright for a Double Tree As a Hilton HHonors Gold member paying full price not my favorite Double Tree  Great location and pretty lobby although staff was stiff  I asked for be a better room that didnt blow smoke in every morning I was told I was in the nicest room and they would check oozing cig smoke smell problem  I stay at lots of hotels this was more like a old Hampton Inn  
N => Great location but not first rate Stayed here one night in uary on business  Only picked this hotel because this is where my client was staying  It turned out to be convenient but I dont consider this a great hotel  The roach walking through the hallway was a bit of a turn off The lobby has very little seating so its a difficult place to wait for someone  The room was comfortable enough but you couldnt sit at the desk comfortably because the chair gets jammed against the bed  The bathroom was okay but small  My client never had tv service during her entire stay and overall service was less than stellar One bright spot was breakfast downstairs in the restaurant  Excellent service good variety of offerings and very modern or  Not the worst place Ive ever stayed in NYC but I wont be back here unless I have no other choice  
N => Good Location BUT     The location of this hotel is super and I will stay in the same area next time Im in NYC  Having said that the hotel rooms are poor  Ours was small and there was mildew of the walls It was impossible to keep the room tempurture comfortable  Still it was good value and I suppose if you are in NYC you not going to be spending much time in you hotel room  The location probably outweighs most negatives 
N => Below Par Our assigned room would not accommodate a rollaway bed as promised  The second room was still so small that there was no space to walk to the bath room wo stepping over the rollaway  Our room was beat to death and ceiling was peeling  Front desk staff was aloof  Concierge was good which was the bright spot  
N => Mildew Overall not bad   but not great either  I booked a good rate I know you get what you pay for    Bathrooms had no ventilation whatsoever wallpaper was peeling and the entire bathroom stunk of mildew  I went to CVS and bought a can of Lysol which helped somewhat  
N => Okay stay Two night at Doubletree was pretty OK location great friendly front office staff comfy beds    Not so great security anyone could walk in to the floors in the middle of Manhattan this is not safe The carpet was filthy dusty and the room was small but thats understandable for NY I would go again but I really wish they would do something about the security  
N => Wheres the coffee I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for one night on business in    Great location in Manhattan and was upgraded to a king sized room on check in which was nice Room size was OK but the room was a little rough around the edges  Service was excellent as usual for the US  However the stay was let down by a lack of coffee making facilities in the room  As a brit only in the US for  days it was pretty much guaranteed I would be awake at some dreadful time in the morning  Unfortunately room service seemed to stop between pm and am meaning I had to go h without coffee after I woke up not a good thing  For the price you pay for a room in this hotel this seems a little crazy  
N => Ok but security is a worry Location wise this place was pretty good but the hotel was long overdue an upgrade  The public areas away formthe lobby were in dire need of a makeover  Our room was small be perfectly adequate beds were comfortable and the shower was great   albeit a bit on the cold side But the BIG problem was security  This is an hotel in which you MUST follow the advice to keep doors locked and chains on  On two occassions both at the dead of night someone tried surreptitiously to get into our room only being kept out by the chain  I dont know whether this was staff members or someone with a keycard but I suspect that it was someone who had worked out a way to bypass the electronic lock e g  with a slim jim or something flexible  Whoever it was was undeterred by not getting into our room becuase they could be heard trying doors up and down the corridor  I shudder to think what would have happened had they got in  
N => So so hotel worth it if you get a good deal  Firstly the location of this hotel is excellent and for most people you will spend more time out enjoying NYC and not cooped up in your hotel The hotel is also very clean and the rooms while small not tiny just on the small side are very comfortable  So if you just want a good base and you get a ent rate this hotel is a good option We did have a few problems however  We had booked directly through the hotels website so we could make specific requests twin beds connecting rooms which travel agents could not guarantee  It was a little more expensive but we thought worth it to be sure of what we would be getting  Upon arrival at  p m  we were told if we wanted these requests filled we would have to wait for our rooms which we agreed to do  After  minutes I returned and was told  room was ready  We went up to the room to find it was a double with no connecting door We returned to reception to be told they had no record of our requests despite the previous aknowledgement  We ended up stuck with non connecting double rooms for the duration Overall I found the staff reception bar staff and concierge to be rude and unhelpful  I complained twice and asked a manger to contact me but I never heard from them  Disappointing  
N => not impressed We arrived earlier than told to but were able to store the small luggage we had in the holding area near reception I was excited to check out the room and hotel when I realised it was part of the Hilton family however I did not feel it should be in anyway relatedThe room was clean and spacious  We were given free cookies after collecting our luggage to properly check in  However when we got to the room there were no facilities for making tea and coffee in the roomThere was a can machine in a room down the corridor which looked like it was part of staff quarters and not the most appealing room We only stayed in the hotel for  nights but did not spend too much time there We did however visit the bar on the nd night which were there was a waiting service however the waitress was too busy talking and sitting at a table by the time she came over to our table my partner was already on the way back from the bar with drinks Nice tini though  Probably the only good thing about the hotel I would not go back 
N => Great Location Well for starters I showed up at the wrong time to check in it was right at pm and I think everyone was checking in at that time  Even had lines for the self check in computers  No big deal was not in a big hurry  Very nice lobby which is always a good thing when you walk in to somewhere in NY  When I got to my room I did not know whether I checked into a match box or a hotel room  But come to find out I got stuck in a smaller room could have been because of the stairs right beside my room  Other then that it was ok  Internet in the room was per day  Bed was soft pillows were ok  Crappy view of the condos right next to the hotel  I do not recommend buying a drink down in the hotel barlounge unless you are ready to pay for it beer   mixed drink  be I just got the wrong bartender  Of course it is Manhattan  But in all the hotel is nice 
N => one moldy and rude hotel I booked this hotel through Hilton web site  Looking by the past reviews in which if I had a had chance to read before going I surely would have cancelled this reservation Front desk personal awful Charged total stay two times to my card andwas told I would have to take it up with my bank  They would not tak care of it  I had to wait for the holiday to have the bank cancel one of there transactions  Moron at front desk when I was asked for a cookie states you already got one at check in  Now this is true but every Double Tree I have stayed at which have been many gives out cookies upon requests  When you pay   a night I dont think asking for a extra cookie is a request that should not be honored  The bathroom had mold on ceiling  Walls are paper thin  We could he our neighbors show they were watching  Problem with toilet in which we reported to housekeeping but they never fixed it  So we took it upon ourselves to fix  Paid   per person for dinner at the restr  Ha gourmet food is was not  Took us two hours to have dinner  Stayed thirsty the whole time because servers never came around to find out how your food was or if you need any refills  Had to go hunt someone down to even get our bill to pay  Then the bill was incorrect Do not stay here  There are many other hotels to choose from  
N => Not the Peninsula   the Doubletree and it was okay  We booked a Friday night stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan ember is a notoriously busy month for hotels in Manhattan and although we normally prefer to stay at the W   the cost was prohibitive right before the Holidays   We thought  for a king executive room was ent and the hotel was not disappointing  The room was standard size for a Manhattan property it was clean the bed was comfortable the bathroom was ent there was no fan so the paint was peeling from the ceiling   but there was no mold and as I said the room was clean  The Doubletree is not a  star property it is a  star and a good one at that  Ive stayed at several other NYC hotels paid more and gotten far less  If I were a traveler on a budget Id definitely opt to stay here again Pros cheap eats right around the corner  Cookies at check in  Comfortable beds and linens  Convenient to GCT a couple blocks to Radio City subway station right outside  Cons peeling paint from ceiling in bathroom no fan in the bathroom  
N => Poor Poor Poor I picked this hotel to celebrate my th birthday because the hotel website said it was newly reated the hotel staff said   We noticed the carpet had stains near the elevators  When we got to the room it was even worse  It looked as though the new cheap wallpaper was on top of the old probably cheap wallpaper  The IKEA furniture was already chipped  Some of the bulbs in the IKEA lamps were not working  The bathroom tile had mildew  The bathroom ceiling was peeling  The bathroom vanity was probably also from IKEA and was not custom fitted pipes were sticking out of the sides  We asked for another room and were quotupgradedquot to an quotexecutive roomquot with a king bed instead of a full  This room did not have the peeling bathroom ceiling but everything else was the same including the already chipped IKEA furniture and the mildew on the bathroom tile  I grew up in New York City and now live  minutes away  I booked this hotel hoping to have a special evening  I was very very disappointed  There are so many hotels in New York to pick from  Do not pick this one  
N => Really bad What a disappointment I booked the hotel because of its location  The price USD  was not very good for a Doubletree   I could have got to a W for the same price My room was a catastrophy there was weird smell in the room the airconditioning did not work the traffic noise from the street was way too loud the walls are of paper   I overheard the arguments in the next room   and the bathroom was old and paint was getting off the walls  In the morning pleased that I had only one night I was going to have breakfast  The breakfast room was so crowded and hot that I could not eat there but had to find another place Never again  
N => Great hotel    What a great hotel  Location was central to all the major Manhatten attractions  Check in and concierge were helpful and professional  We contacted the front desk once due to a faulty air conditionner unit   this issue was resolved within  mins Our room was on the th floor and was a good size for New York modern and clean  We were situated over the back of the hotel overlooking a policefire precinct Thought this could be noisy sirens etc but this was not the case    Bed was v v v  comfy and shower was warm and refreshing  Did not use barrestaurant at all so many over good places to explore in the city     
N => Definately not a Dream We stayed at this hotel as a change from our usual hotel in NY from the website it looked pretty cool      wrong  Our room was not what I would call luxury we were there for one week and were unable to unpack our clothes as the wardrobe space was made fro people less than ft we were unable to even hang up our coats  I am sorry for this price I expect to be able to unpack  The room was not just minimilast but bare have been in better travel lodges No offence to Travel Lodge but at this price we could have stayed at the London  We arrived on Halloween and there was a party going on in the bar downstairs that had spilled onto reception that was OK it was a holiday after all  little did we know this was an omen of the noise we were to expect nightly  We had a small window with a view of a brick wall  The door of the room did not close properly and we had to put something in front of it at night from the outside it did not look as if it was closed it had not been hung properly and did not make us feel as though we or our valuables were safe  The lighting in the room was absolutely rubbish it was impossible to put your make up on and there was no full length mirror  It was noisy and the sky bar  I am sorry I live in a city if I want to look into peoples living rooms I will go live in a high rise  When we had recovered from our jet lag we checked out early it was very difficult to get a hotel room and went to the Radisson where the service was much better and the internet was FREE and we saved over  The only plus side was the location but this place should be had under the trade descriptions act  I work in partnership with a lot of quotboutiquequot hotels and I am sorry this was not what I was expecting from the description in website or Time Out  If you are young and a clubber and perhaps only use your room to sleep for a few hours and dont want a nice hotel bar and luxury on your holiday then this might suit you  Oh yeah the ship in the reception we only spotted it on our last day it is tiny and as far as we could make out the spa was not in the hotel but around the corner  We didnt let it spoil our trip but would never recommend this hotel  
N => Great location cool hotel but overpriced  Great location close to Central Park  The room was good and big enough  The AC was noisy but since we stayed there in ember it was ok to keep it turned of  We were on the third floor were the noice from the street was a bit disturbing  Im sure it would have been nicer further up in the building  All in all a nice enough hotel but not a good value  
N => great location great hotel Spent six nights in Dream hotel with my husband before spending a further  nights in New Rochelle  We loved our stay  Our room was perfect small but was kinda prepared for it to be far smaller so we were pleasently surprised when we COULD swing a cat in it  Im mean its not like you spend hours and hours there  its meant for sleeping  We had a closet and a few drawers which was great  we got to unpack completely  We used the Spa for a massage  it was slightly expensive but WELL worth it it was probably the nicest massae I ever got  The location is ideal  its pretty much walking distance from everything but if your tired or lazy there were times the th Street Subway is right outside  I would recommed this hotel to anyone and we intend to stay here the next time were back  loved it  
N => DO NOT STAY HERE We had booked online excited at the magic the hotel website promised  We arrived a few hours prior to check  in and the two ladies at the front desk were friendly and prompt  Surprisingly they didnt turn us away but got us into a room right away  Husband and I were happy to see three working elevators  The lobby is very chic with a constant hub of guests or drivers  Our room was on the th floor with a wonderful view of th street  We didnt mind that the room was small but the bed could have been more inviting No kidding Im quot and my husband is     we both had a difficult time sleeping here  Immediately noticed how HOT the room was  It happened to be  degrees in the city this weekend and our room was  degrees No Air Conditioning so Hubby had to prop the bathroom window open  Bathroom had only a shower  After checking in and dropping our luggage we spent some time shopping only to return to a room that had been quotfluffed quot They left two bruised rotting apples and a room service menu on our pillows   could they please skip the beat up apples If you want a place to pass out in after boozing up the club this is your place   for the money we paid we expected better 
N => Nice view of an airshaft Stayed at the dream over the Columbus day week end  Traveled with my wife and another couple  We stayed  nights  After reading different reviews it seemed nice but with small rooms  I also signed up to become a I prefer member which offered free upgrades if available Our rooms were indeed small and ours  was smaller than our friends and the view out of both of our windows was an air shaft  Expressed our displeasure in this otherwise interesting hotel to no avail So if you want to spend from  to  dollars for an undersized room with a view of an air shaft this is the place in New York to find it  
N => Dont stay here Rooms are small noisy and air conditioning does not work very well  I stayed in two rooms because after the first night my first room was ransacked and several valuables were stolen  Not a good place to stay if youre on business  Concierge and other staff is run by kids who seem like they want to be on the roof top bar or anywhere other than where they should be to help  With all the people coming in and out of the hotel to go to the rooftop bar your room isnt safe  
N => Just OK for couples We had booked on Hotwire which we will never do again we didnt know we were booking a quotboutiquequot hotel  We were spending  nights with our  year old dhter and her  year old cousin  This is located in a very good central spot in Manhattan   very convenient  The rooms are very clean but extremely small which usually doesnt bother us but this was ridiculously small  Our room had a view of another wall no sunlight ever entered the room  The bed was very comfortable we had a double bed which took up the entire room  There was literally no room to walk around or put your luggage  The lighting was so dim I felt like I was in a cave or a cell We needed to use a printer to print boarding passes and found there was no business center to do so  The concierge was pleasant but could not accomodate us as the printers were not working at all and the technician was working on the problem  I thought this was very odd for a hotel of this class to not be able to accomodate this request The lobby is not impressive and the staff was the same  Not rude but just disinterested and not helpful The hotel would be fine for a young couple just looking for a bed to sleep in  Definitely not good for children or teens  Hotwire labeled this as a   star   I would not rate it that high  
N => Excellent Experience I was skeptical to stay here at first because of all the mixed reviews  But with a great deal on Priceline I just couldnt say no  The hotel staff was extremely courteous and happy to share their knowledge of the city  The roofk and lobby bars were cool but expensive its NYC get used to it  The room was small but large enough to stay in for a few nights without getting freaked out  Overall this trip was great and if you want to stay in the perfect location directly in between Times Square and Central Park then stay at the Dream  You have my reccomendation  
N => Great Location No Problems Front Dest allowed me to check in early  I really appreciated that as I wanted to rest up befora a function at Lincoln Center which is walking distance  Had fun at Italian restaurant on first floor  Met nice locals who gave me advice about getting around and where to go  The club on the top floor was not a good place for singles  Music was very loud and no way to strike up a conversation  Carnagie Deli around the corner  This was my first stay over in NYC so cant compare to other hotels  I imagine most rooms are small  More important to be clean and well located  
N => Dont stay here    your room could be a closet Stayed two miserable nights at the Dream     Our room HAD to be the smallest in the hotel    literally quot of walking room around the bed we measured  We asked to be moved to something at least a little larger and they would only accommodate us with a  dollar a night additional charge  Room doors dont block out any noise  We heard every word and every step even flip flops flapping of anyone in the hallway within  rooms of ours  Theres a nightclub on the ground floor so folks were going to their rooms at  and  AM and we knew it Not to mention the boom boom noise emanating from the floor below Dont believe the photos  The lobby is fine and so is the location but the room we got was absolutely unacceptable  The fitness center was not open during posted open hours  Room Service is from nearby hotel and has limited very expensive choices even for NYC  
N => Rude and unaccommodating staff noisy aging slow elevators cheap or and impractical furnishings  I waited  minutes for an elevator when I arrived  The staff were rude and unhelpful I was traveling with my mother and they would not provide a room with two beds  They explicitly indicated that because I reserved on Priceline I could only have a room with one double bed not even a queen  At first I was told no other rooms were available  even though I checked in at  maids were barely finished cleaning  After repeated inquiries they finally admitted a room with two beds was available  But it would cost  more  Since our stay was short we ided to stay in our original room  But they had no cots And the room didnt even have an arm chair  The dim lighting didnt hide the cheap or  Noise was awful  The room was so noisy I could barely fall asleep  
N => Good location funky hotel staff not so good We stayed in the Dream Hotel for a birthday trip about  months ago  The hotel is a few blocks from Times Square so a good location and just far enough off to not be too noisy and busy  The room was of an adequate size and clean st design with crisp whites and silver furniture  Turndown service included a weather report and fruit which was a nice touch and the toiletries in the bathroom were of a good quality  VERY COMFY BED There was strange lighting which took us a while to work out how to turn off it was blue Also the bath was not full size which was a bit frustrating if you wanted to have a relax after a long day in the city  The hotel is funky with a pretty exclusive bar on the rooftop and a st restaurant on the ground floor  We didnt use either during our stay  The main downside is the service  My boyfriend had ordered a bottle of champagne as a surprise for our birthday the following day   the surprise was ruined as when we arrived it was already there not even chilled  We had it on our birthday and asked for an ice bucket   twice   what we got was one of their plastic bedroom bins with ice in  Then we realised when drinking that the bottle was actually sparkling wine  When we enquired we were told quotthats what champagne is in the Statesquot I dont think so They billed us for champagne and it was a real struggle to sort it out before we left  But a ent hotel with an interesting atmosphere  
N => This Dream can turn into a nighte This is a very trendy hotel with serious flaws  First of all the staff treats you like you are bothering them  When we checked in we were told we had the best room in the hotel we are i prefer members  They forgot to tell us that the room was right below the night club which is on the top floor of the hotel  The bass boomed so loudly in our room until   AM every single night that we couldnt sleep  One night one of the hotel managers reluctantly called up to the club and they agreed to turn the bass down but that was after I made  calls to the front desk  The next night another manager crossly told me quotthe club is a arate business I cant do anything  You should have changed your room we had one of the bigger rooms in the hotel and we were not about to go into one of the closet sized rooms that seem to populate most of the hotel   I told her that if they wanted to pack up our things and move us we would and she just blew me off  No quotIm sorryquot no apology no nothing  That was the overall attitude of everyone in the hotel except for one front desk person any time we asked for anything even to be connected to room service they connected us to their restaurant instead  They constantly brought the wrong newspaper they forgot to clean our room one day the lighted mirror in the bathroom didnt light and the door to the terrace we had wouldnt lock  Even a maid acted angry toward us because we werent out of the room for her to clean by  AM one day during our stay  The phrases quotcustomer servicequot and quotservice with a smilequot are mostly unknown here  if youre young hip bring earplugs and like dealing with rude people youll love this hotel  If youre a seasoned traveler who has experienced really good hotels and service you might want to stay away from this one  
N => Not worth the money This is a boutique hotel located close to Times Square  The location was fantastic as it is very close to most of the tourist attractions  We checked in on Saturday  st  The hotel lobby is very cool and trendy looking with a large fish tank in the center  We were on the first floor and had a double bed room  The room was small but had a cool trendy feel with blue lights under the bed in the desk  The furniture is mostly white and showed wear and tear Trying to figure out how the light switches worked was an ordeal  The main switch turns off the blue light in the desk   while other swtiches are used to turn of the main room lights  The room was too hot and we turned down the thermostat to cool down the room and left for dinner upon our return the temperature had not changed  We called down and was told someone would be up  hour later we had to call again  The technician finally arrived and played with the switch and finally got the AC to work On our second night we moved to a King Suite and experienced the same issues with light switches  However this room was too cold and we called to have the heating fixed  The technician arrived and told us that the hotel had turned off the heating option and all we would get is cold air and suggested we ask for additional blankets to keep us warm  Checkout time was noon and we called to ask for a later checkout of pm and was told the hotel was sold out  We left our room at noon and forgot to check out and went out to have lunch  When we came back to collect our luggage an hour later we apologized for forgetting to check out and was told it was not a problem this did not make sense since we were told no when we asked for an extension  The hotel staff did just did not care I would not recommend this hotel  We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in NYC and I would recommend you check that one out 
N => Nice but overpriced Its blue its neon its trendy   just pricey Room was small but thats New York    
N => Excellent lovely modern hotel    had a perfect stay at the dream hotel My boyfriend booked  nights in new york at the Dream hotel as a surprise christmas pressie for me We went over easter from th arpil th il  At first i was a little worried with all the negitive reviews i had read however i couldnt be more happy with my stay at the dream hotel When we arrived hotel staff were very welcoming gave us free drinks vouchers for bar next door and checked us in quickly  our room was the th floor and happened to be a corner room which was very spacious with lots of floor space prob because it was a corner room though so we were very happy with this as i know new york hotel rooms are said to be on the small side  Lovely modern crisp feel to the room very clean and simple and to our taste  bathroom again ent size lovely and clean shampoo and conditioner products for us to use and towels changed everyday  large plasma tv on the wall and plenty of storage space for clothes and fluff bathrobes not great view from the room but we were more interested in going out to see new york anywayGreat location starbucks across the road close to central park th avanue times square also lots of small eating places near by for breakfast and lunch Subway at the corner of the block which we used to get to places a little further away defo the best way to get around taxis are too expensiveOverall FAB stay at the dream hotel no negitive comments or any problems in the  nights we spent here and we will defo be going back and would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends 
N => Cute hotel terrible customer service The hotel is very cute and funky  Room was nice but very tiny  I had a problem that was not solved to my satisfaction  The manager was pretty rude to me  I even brought it to the attention of the parent company and was also met with rudeness  They are not a customer based organization  I travel quite a bit and will not be staying in this hotel again Although the Chopra Spa downstairs is absolutely AWESOME 
N => Hot Room And I dont mean that kind of Hot   Temperature in room was  degrees and could not get air conditioner to come on  All we wanted was a comfy place to sleep for the nite and we were not comfortable at that temperature  I suspect the air conditioning has not yet been turned on which is why I did not bother to call the front desk  We got in late and I did not really want to play that quotwell send someone upquot game  Small room soft bed The bathroom was clean and nice  The restaurant  Serafina was great  Will not go back here  I like things to be comfortable without asking  
N => Great Location Could not fault it As we had never been to NYC I was nervous as what to expect esp with the hotelRoom was a medium queen it was a nice size Not massive for the money but it was clean and comfortable and had all we needed I was impressed the toiletries provided were LOccitane which are fab Every day the room was cleaned fresh towels and if you wanted your bed could be changed Very central location subway round the corner Roof top bar good but priceyStaff very helpful and pleasant from door men to reception to handymen The adjoining restaurant Serafina is lovely too good food and reasonable We stayed for a week and we are a young couple and both pleased 
N => Sexy but small I stayed here during the holiday season  By joining the preferred group of hotels I was able to get a ent deal on the room which was what they call a quotmediumquot size room  The room was about as big as my closet  I actually changed rooms after the first night which had its pros and cons  The first room was extra tiny and overlooked some kind of generator or something  No view and no daylight at all  But it was pretty quiet  The second room on the th floor was slightly bigger and faced Broadway but really didnt have a view unless you consider looking into other peoples apartments a view  And the noise level from the street was unbelievable  I had to sleep with earplugs and I could still hear all the street noise especially the taxis honking their horns That being said the room was very very clean and very sexy  The blue lights added a little something extra to those moments with my guy and the bed was super comfortable  Not sure if I would stay here again though  I dont think it was worth the price  
N => Well positioned hotel Just came back from New York and wanted to add my opinion on this hotel  Before we left we checked other reviews and ided to book despite the mixed ratings  We are very happy we chose this hotel after all  We book a large room with a big bed and we highly recommend it as the small room is really small  The bed was very very comfortable and the service was very good  The hotel is very well positioned in New York close to many attractions metro lots of cafes restaurants  For New Years Eve we just had to step outside the hotel on the th Ave and we had a very good view of the Times Square and the ball  The only one thing we did not like was the noise  This was not the noise from the inside as the rooms were well insulated and we could not hear other rooms or people cleaning the corridors  It was the outside noise from the street   especially when the garbage was collected   and there was a lot of garbage  Since we had experienced before the same issue when visiting New York in other hotels we were prepared with ear plugs   so we highly recommend them if you have a room facing the street  
N => Nice hotel Shame about the staff Me and my Fiancee booked to go to the Dream hotel for our first trip to NYC we booked it as it looked like something different and very nice Upon arriving to the hotel it looks nice but it is fairly small but well maintained We had booked our trip with Expedia and had paid for the hotel upfront on the voucher we presented it clearly stated all we had to do was present the voucher and our room would be given as we had paid for everything in advance so we started to check in with no worries when one of the Front desk staff asked for a credit card for incidentals which is usually ok as they take a copy of the card and all is fine But this hotel was different they advised we would need to have a credit card that had  per night we stayed on it for pre authorisation We stayed nights so that was  they said they wouldnt check us in if we couldnt provide this I was totally shocked I understand they need some sort of back up but  per night I didnt have that sort of money and nowhere did it state that we needed to do this as we had already paid upfront for the room for them to advise me I couldnt have the room I had already paid for if I didnt have the money they wanted on my credit card I only had a switch card with money on it as I wasnt expecting this and they refused this They also advised cash wasnt acceptable in the end we managed to put down  is cash for first night as we arrived on a saturday and then my mum back in the UK had to send a copy of her credit card which also we had problems with as they advised they didnt receive it then they found it just lying around and they blocked our room once also even though we had sorted this  The staff I found quite rude and their attitude was they were doing us a favour even though the room was already paid forIn regards to the rooms we booked a Medium room thank god we did as this was still very small so the small room must be tiny The rooms were spotless and they have an evening cleaning service so if you need it towels etc and your bed would be redone in the evening which was nice Although we were there nights and the shampoossoaps were never changed we never got any new although we had pretty much run out of this The hotel location was amazing a really short walk from Times Square and all the Theatres etc also very close to Central park  Cant knock the location is fabJust be careful of hidden charges on room 
N => Great location Great location walk to lots of attractions  Service pretty good rooms small but comfortable  Good restaurant  
N => To hip or not to hip We have just returned from a week at the Dream Hotel  The hotel is in the list of the hip hotels of New York however it is definitely not that hip  In fact the only hip thing about it is the location it has a metro station just a few steps from the hotel doorWe stayed on the first level so we were lucky that we could use the stairs to go to our room  The bar at the roof toop seems to be busy specially at weekends with all kind of quotwant to be hipquot people with totally exagerated outfit  This means taking one of the two extremely slow elevators can take up some time The hotel temperature is  F that is about  C which is absurd when you are wearing summer clothes  The housekeeping sets the temperature every day at  F in the rooms  If you want to set up the temperature higher the air conditioning does not cool and therefore the room temperature goes up  We asked to get it fixed but this was not done  Perhaps they know this is just so and this is why rooms have winter bed clothing in plain summertimeThe bar at the top is ok however the staff are rude and not helpful or kind as you would expect in such hotel  When asking for the way back to the stairs to go down to my room I got a very rude answer quottake the same way you got to get inquot  Unbelievable The concierges were kind but not specially helpful  We were shocked to hear that for   each they could sell seats for us a Broadway musical of course with average prices    per seat at the theater itself we did not take such offer  Another funny one was that one of them did not know about an internet caf  near the hotel   I recommend you to go to the Apple store to get access if you do not have a laptop with you  There are almost no internet caf s in NY The Serafina restaurant looked ok but we did not have lunch there in the end  We asked for a table and they offered us to share one with other guests even if there was a table free with  places  We do think it is unacceptable to ask us to share if there is a table free  In the inside of course and once again temperature was about  F Overall I would say this is an average hotel that needs to improve service levels as well as reate furniture painting walls and changing basic installations  Not worth the money if you can stay somewhere else  
N => comme ci comme  a Here is what I liked easy check in check out valet parking first impressions comfortable bed and good showers Here is what I did not like we had a corner room on the th floor  The staff failed to mention that the bar is above that room  Lets face it loud thumping music is not conducive to sleeping  I had enough of that in college  To the hotels credit when my wife called the front desk they immediately moved us to a room on a lower level  The hassle however was annoying  If you are in the party mode then it is a good place to stay  However with so many other good hotels in NYC it simply was not worth the money  
N => Great stay My girlfirend and I stayed in the Dream for  nights running from Thursday until Monday and had a fabulous time  Upon arrival we were greeted by the door men and ushered through to reception where check in was quick and painless  We found our Queen size room on the th floor to be a good size clean well laid out and quiet Throughout our stay we were shown nothing but good manners by all the staff who were helpful attentive and happy to help with any queries  The hotel all around was very clean with a modern chic feel ranging from the polished ble floor with giant fish tank and the lovely looking spa downstairs to the blue strip lighting in the rooms and  good bars The hotel was perfectly situated for everything that we wished to do just a  minute walk to Times Square and the same to Central Park and th Avenue shops  I have read many reviews moaning about lack of service and small rooms but in reality how many people come to New York to sit in their rooms We found we had more than enough space for our needs and can have nothing but praise for the staff suring our stay It is true that food and drinks in the hotel arent cheap but I think the same can be said for almost every hotel in New York  If I had one complaint it would be that on the days we visited it was almost impossible to get anywhere to sit in the rooftop Ava loungue  It was a very nice venue but we found it full of office workers with reserved tables everwhere   perhaps a consideration to those who are staying there would be good  On Friday and Saturday night this turns into a very busy nightlife hotspot with queues outside and doormen checking entry  The bar downstairs however was very nice and not too full everytime we visited it Our stay in New York was fantastic   the weather was great we saw all the sights did lots of shopping and had a brilliant time both during the day and at night  Although all of these things were not as a result of staying at the Dream it definitely contributed to us having a great trip to New York  I woud have no resevations about recomending this hotel to anyone 
N => bad service I stayed  nights in Dream hotel from friday to monday  People at The reception desk was overbusy no nice wecome for me  Bagage man was more aware of joking with his colleagues than taking my luggage up  When I asked him to put my suitcase on the trail he raised his eyes up The furniture in the room are a bit old  Reation should be done I had a message from the staff  When I called back the housekeeping answered in a very angry way But most of all the last day I consulted the internet site and I realized there was a lounge and a fitness club  No one or no information in the room to inform  Everyday I went to the spa center near which was annexed  No one told me there is a direct access to the spa Hopefully for the hotel localisation is exceptional  But I wont stay there next time  I prefer stay in Night hotel which was much more terrific  
N => Very chic but small My friend and I stayed in the Dream and booked one of the smaller rooms because of our budget Whilst I appreciate square footage in NY is at a premium I wasnt quite prepared for how small it was  Pictures just dont show exactly how small something is  When youve got  suitcases between you we had just been to Vegas and wanted to do lots of shopping in NY and barely enough room to swing a cat then youre in trouble Having said that the staff at reception were very polite and we checked in no problem the room was very clean and tidy but we had to do some serious space planning to fit what we needed where i e  putting suitcases in a very small cupboard on the desk chair etc  Bed was very comfortable but again small to fit both of us on probably best for couples and not friends sharing had great plasma telly and nice toiletries  A nice touch was the maids delivering fruit in the afternoon free of charge very niceOne serious negative about the bathroom we had is that the shower curtain simply did not keep the water in so each time we had a shower the bathroom floor flooded the step into the shower was simply too low to keep the water from not escaping so I ended up having to turn the shower against the wall to try and keep the water in one direction not great for washing hair Bathroom tiles could also have done with a scrub too quite a bit of mouldOverall though the Dream was lovely definitely try the Ava Lounge bar upstairs take the lift to the top and there is a bar with roof terrace although we didnt get a chance to sample the terrace as it was busy when we went  Great location not far to walk to Times Square or Columbus Circle Do make sure that you collect your luggage early from the valet Im not sure if he was having an off day but he took a good  mins to find our suitcases and we were in a serious rush to get to the airport make sure you dont make the same mistake as us and leave in rush hour One of my more stressful journeys to an aiport it has to be said I would definitely recommend staying here but if you can try and upgrade to one of the larger rooms as youll appreciate the extra space 
N => Dream a Little More Dream Hotel has a great mid town location which is why we chose it   close to a couple of subway stops Columbus Circle Central Park Theatre District  Serafina Restaurant onsite and not bad  The Good News  Rooms are small but well appointed Staff was helpful  Fitness room was so so but you can get a comp  pass to Golds Gym just one street over  We booked on Quikbook com and got a   per room rate The Bad News  No coffee maker in the room really the Hampton Inn has a coffee maker   cant an upscale hotel like Dream do the same  VERY slow elevators  We were on lower levels and there was some noise coming from the bar below  I used earplugs   a travel staple for me esp  in NYC  But ask for an upper floor  
N => All right but not special We booked this hotel as a flighthotel package through Expedia  It was recommended by friends of ours  We spend  nights there from  to   It is an interesting hotel but not as special as we expected afer looking at their website  Our room was tiny but we know this to be normal for NYC  The rooftop bar is cool but was mostly booked for private parties i e  quotRussian Vodkaquot party  The staff didnt bother informoming us in advance they simply ushered us in the elevator that doesnt go to the roof top    The design is pretty cool however the whole hotel seems literally coolcold and not really inviting  We never saw anybody hang out in the small lounge area next to the front desk  It really is simply a nice place to sleep  The other Vikram Chatwal hotel quotNight NYCquot is waayyy better  The Times Square area is crowded with tourists we didnt like that at all  Midtown East or lower East side are much better and have nicer hotels and restaurants  Midtwon West caters to tourists crappy food and over priced everything   If you are looking for a REALLY nice hotel cozy inviting and reasonably priced   stay at quotThe Bowery Hotelquot  Awesome 
N => Nighte hotel I booked this hotel as part of our honeymoon so obviously did a lot of research first  I initially booked through lastminute com but their description of a standard room wasnt accurate   Dream Hotel has small medium and large rooms  After calling lastminute com trying to find out what size of room I had booked I then had to call the hotel in America  I had a small room so cancelled paying lastminute   fee which they wouldnt waiver  Then I re booked through hotels com which were much more helpful When we got to the hotel our room was tiny   king sized bed but only just enough room to walk around it  We had a small window which looked directly into an apartment so we had to have the blind shut  I called reception and complained about the room as it was our honeymoon and I had paid a lot extra for a large room after reading reviews They upgraded us to a suite but warned us that there  be a very small amount of noise from the bar on the th floor  I asked how much and they said just a very small amount of bass The room was lovely although not for the feint hearted   we had a balcony that looked down the length of Broadway but the wall wasnt very high around it   being  floors up is quite highWhen we got back into our room the noise was unbelievable  I had earplugs in but the bass was that strong that I could feel it and the pictures were literally vibrating on the wall  Then you could here everyones feet dancing too  This went on until am I called reception in the middle of the night saying that we couldnt stay in this room but they said they  not be able to move usSo I had to call back the next morning and we got moved to the only available room   where we were originallyAlso be warned about getting a ipod for your room from reception  They take a  deposit from your credit card in case you dont return it  I returned ours but didnt get asked to sign anything then on checkout they tried to charge me for it saying I hadnt returned it After lots of arguing they checked the security tapes from when I said I brought it back only to see that I had  No apology at all My recommendation   stay at the Royalton   massive rooms great staff and a ft round bathtub   great 
N => Overpriced but ok We were there during mid ober  Our friends were given a small room that was filled with the smell of cigarette smoke   the smell did not go away during the three days we were there  Our room was a bit nicer and had no smell  Service was spotty all around from the Doorman who didnt open the door to the trays of garbage left in the room and hallways The worst thing was the mattress pad on the beds   it felt a bit like plastic and slid around on the mattress making sleep noisy and uncomfortable  When we asked them to remove it they took away the pillow top and left the padAt   a night I expect more   even in NYC  
N => Loved it in spite of reviews My parents booked this hotel for my birthday gift for my husband and I  We stayed for  nights  When I found out about the trip in advance so I could get the time off I went to tripadvisor to check out the hotel  I was quite worried by the reviews but figured I love NYC and loved the location of the hotel so would get by I loved the hotel  Im not into that super modern stuff but the lights didnt annoy me like I thought they would  We were in the smallest room they have but I thought it was fine it had some wasted space in an empty corner that we could keep our suitcases in with room to spare  The bed is amazenly comfortable just great  The bathroom was small and there was no place to hang your towels so I could never reuse them  But they would leave us fresh ones so no problem  Also our safe broke and went into a lock down about  minutes before we had to leave for our play with our tickets in it I was in a complete panic and neither of us was ready or dressed  The hotel staff was great in helping us they sent someone immediately  When he couldnt get it fixed they got someone else that said they had to take the safe to drill it  When they did they returned it before opening so we could account that nothing was taken  And this took  minutes We made it to the play with tickets hair done and dressed  I was quite pleased with this service My parents thought we would like the rooftop bar  Boy were they wrong that I thought was a waste  It wasnt outdoors just a tiny room with way to loud music and no room  Just very small  So I wouldnt recommend the bar I would be willing to stay here again and definitely couldnt beat the price they got for the location  I have noticed the price has been much higher than the booking though so it must have been a special expedia deal my mom found  
N => EVERYTHING was s DREAM My boyfriend and i traveled to NY in ust and after much deliberation we ided to stay at the Dream  As i wanted to make the trip more special I arranged in advance with the concierge Mr  Edwards to have the room quotdone upquot with flowers and balloons     I was not disappointed nor was my man From the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic between helping us with our luggage to helping us with directions to the Zoo Our room was beautiful we stayed in a Queen size room and I really dont understand what people are talking about when they say the rooms are cramped   we had plenty of space for all our baggage The bed was amazingly comfortable and the blue under lighting aided a good nights sleep   it is possible in Manhattan There was a turn down service and each evening we returned to find an apple on our pillows this was a lovely touch and was performed by extremely friendly housekeeping staff  Location is ideal for shopping   bang smack in the center close to EVERYTHING We really cant fault the Dream and are already looking forward to returning in  Fantastic holiday in a fantastic Hotel 
N => Dumpy and Pretentious So I thought that theres no way people could say bad things about this hotel   it looked so great on the web Boy was I wrong We arrived in New York around pm after a hellish drive in from Newark and were greeted by a very nice girl at the check in desk  We got our keys and went up to our room with no issues  We walk into the room   it was small as I had imagined but I never thought it would be DIRTY AND SHABBY  My first clue should have been the elevators   tiny rundown and slow In our room our carpet was extremely dirty and the room had a musty smell  When I went into the bathroom I found the shower tiles MOLDY  Okay if youre going to commit to tiling an entire shower you need to commit yourself to the maintenance  I was not happy I went down to the front desk and inquired about moving to a bigger room  They were booked up that night Thursday but we would be able to move the next night into a king bedded room for an extra sixty dollars a night The new room was spacious but the bathroom still had mold issues  The sheets kept slipping off the bed because the featherbed was too big and the sheets too small  The worst thing however was the air conditioning   it made an awful banging noise about every  seconds all night  We eventually turned the air off and slept in a hot stuffy room for the rest of the night  I complained immediately the next morning and was assured that it was going to be fixed  It was not fixed  Finally on our last night there my husband took the vent off the air conditioner and guess what he found DIRTY TOWELS shoved up into the air conditioning vent  It was disgusting  When I told the front desk about this we received  dollars off our total bill On Friday night it was raining and the front desk and concierge flat out refused to get a taxi for us  They said there was no way wed get a taxi in the rain  Finally I went to the corner of th and Broadway and hailed my own taxi  The desk people were rude dismissive and unhelpful Please please do not give this hotel your business  They try so hard to be trendy and fun but just ended up being dirty and rude  Dont waste your money  
N => Dream   It Was Excellent through and throughSpotless rooms small ish   but so what I though the size was going to be a problem from reading the reviews but how wrong I was    I booked a small room and to be honest having a peak at the other rooms its not worth the extra cash to upgrade to medium  If you go to New York to stay in your room then you really need your head looking at Haha The size is more than ample for  Adults   Ive stayed in A LOT smallerThe room was cleaned  towels changed twice daily staff were super helpful supplying us with free NYC maps even loaning us umbrellas when it rained  It was also quiet where we were Floor There is a Subway  yards away a Starbucks on the corner and Times Square is  minutes by foot  Its probably the most perfect spot we could have asked for All in all I could not fault the Dream  People will complain about anything so try to take negative reviews with a pinch of salt  Sure Im not saying they  have had a bad experience but stay in a  Star and still things can go wrong   The Dream is a New York hotel that I would suggest to anyone We WILL go back 
N => Terrible Hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at the Dream Hotel in tember My friends raved about the bar on the roof top  The room was tiny and far from chic  The air conditioner kept us up all night  They stole my boyfriends watch  We tried to go up to the bar on a sunday night no tables were open and they closed off  of the bar  When attempting to sit i was scolded by the waitress who said quotSIT OVER THEREquot like an animal  Terrible service horrible hotel  Do not ever recommend staying there 
N => Dream       You Sure  We booked this hotel via a search engine  Major mess up  adults and two children boy aged  and girl aged   We booked an executive ior suite  Apparently the suite we booked only had one super huge queen size bed  However our booking clearly stated  adults and  children aged  and   Afterall the hotel had accepted our booking why hadnt this been pointed out then On arrival no other rooms were available  The staff appeared none too bothered and totally unsympathetic because we hadnt booked direct  What did they expect us to doEventually they offered us a smaller room with sitting area where the children had to share a corner leather settee  Not exactly comfortable or appropriate but we had no choice  They also insisted on increasing our room tariff by an additional  per night  We had booked for  nights  We only stayed two  Total cost     Totally unhappy will never return will never reccommend Then of course there was the disco on the top floor  No complaints about the noise we were on the th floor  However we did hear others complaining about the noise  On the Saturday night we returned about pm there were queues in the street for the disco  On entering we were stopped by the doorman and asked where we were going  We informed him we were residents and were going to our room  Despite having our  yr old dhter with us he demanded to see our room key  Totally unacceptable  Obnoxious and rude  
N => My stay at Dream Hotel  A dreamy experience We have just returned from staying at the Dream hotel in New York  I really enjoyed my five day stay there  The first room I had was a tiny room located below their famous bar on the Penthouse  Needlesss to say I was up all night with their techno music  When I complained to the front desk the next morning they were quite willing to change my room to a better location in the hotel  The rooms are small but exceptionally clean  The staff was pleasant and very willing to help The hotel is ideally situated in Manhatten and most of the attractions were within walking distance  The hotel gears for a younger crowd between  to  years old  I would definately recommend this hotel If I ever go back to New York I would not hesitate to go back to the Dream HotelD  RanellaMontreal Canada 
N => The absolute worst service I have experienced in my life This hotel had a beautiful lobby and the promise of being a preferred property but beyond the lobby this place was completely disappointing  The service was totally dismissive uninformed and discourteous  It epitomized every negative stereotype about New York City  Thank god that I am not a stranger to the city because I was able to get around without assistance from the concierge who gave absolute incorrect information each time I was able to reach him which by the way was only about  percent of the time  The hotel floors and rooms were actually rather shabby considering the room rates and hotel status  The doormen wouldnt even hail you a taxi they automatically shuffled you to sedan services without even telling you that you had an option  Another NY stereotype   hustle the tourists  I would recommend that noone stay at this location  it is a complete rip off unless of course you wanted to be treated like a piece of garbage and be charged top dollar for it  I cannot believe Deepak Chopras center is in anyway affiliated with this place because it induces stress and an overall unplesant aura  
N => Not great Stayed here in il  for  nights   a few problems Our room was not turned down any of the two nights   when we callled for this to be done the lady in reception put me through to Housekeeping to a loveley lady but unfortunatley didnt speak english On check in the receptionsit who I must say procedeed to deal with two other colleagues at the same time as checking us in which in my opinion is not at all professional but it made us feel unimportant Roms are TOO SMALL even though we had just come from the amazing Bellagio on Las Vegas they were horrendous our view was of the back of the hotel and was very dark   no daylight at all ordered Room Service breakfast on nd mornignbut nothing came receptionsist said oh be some prankster took it off the door handle last night  What  Staff use the very infrequent guest lifts for Room Service etc  We left an IPOD and Drivers licence after us in the room and when called back to see if they were found had to be transferred to nine  dfferent employees to give our detqails   in the end they said there was no record of the lost items I am returning to The BIG APPLE in ember for a shopping trip but I will most definatley NOT be staying in Dream 
N => Dream   Solid hotel with a little funkiness  We stayed at this hotel for three nights in late ember  We had a really early flight into town so requested early check in and actually arrived before am expecting to just drop off luggage and hit the town  Our room was already ready and they bumped us up to a medium room with a queen bed and the front desk clerk remembered to wish my wife a happy birthday nice touch Room was as expected or was minimalistic cool blue lights under bed bed was comfortable and plush TV was good  The shower did have good water pressure and temperature  On the downside not much room to store clothes or luggage at all and the bathroom was on the basic side small section of mold on wall near tubtoilet a little gross  Also no wine glasses or bottle opener in room strange considering fully stocked mini bar  I phoned room service to request some and they never showed up  Made a request to concierge later and he was very professional and items came up within  minutes  Concierge also recommended great restaurants and made reservations for us Location is A and really close to subway  Au Bon Pain is a good place to pick up morning pastries and coffees and is just one block east on th We went to Penthouse level Ava bar twice including once after late night dinner was very cool atmosphere relaxed but funky DJ played good tunes  Drinks aint cheap thoughAll in all a solid hotel which should not disappoint if you have realistic expectations  
N => Hip hotel   a Dream My girlfriend and I took a long shopping weekend getaway to NYC  We were a little surprised by the increase in hotel prices during the holidays  We ended up finding a ent price for one night at Dream the week we were leaving  I would have gladly spent the whole time here The lobby is modern and interesting with a huge fish tank upon entering  The desk clerks were very helpful  I booked through an online site and requested a nonsmoking  I got a smoking room  Not a good start however they made up for it  The room is small no surprise in NYC and they give square footage on the website  It has cool blue lighting in room  Bed was very comfortable and believe it or not room was quietBathroom was modern with great toiletries  Heres where they impressed me most  We checked out after one night and moved to another hotel  In the move we lost our tickets to Wicked one hour before the show  Panicked we called the hotel to see if they were there  They tracked down and dug through our trash to find the tickets  We know this because they found tickets to the club we went to the night before  That seemed above and beyondVery good experience   would stay again 
N => Great location This was our first time in NYC and as two excited little children couldnt wait to get there  First and foremost the location is FANTASTIC You are just  mins walk from Times Square and Broadway seconds away from the subway and a few minutes walk to Carnegie Deli which was a great landk as we kept getting lost  Conceirge staff were extremely helpful our first day they got a map out and ked on it our places of interest and told us a great place for breakfast Applejacks  Room was slightly smaller than I imagined although clean comfortable not a bad view th floor great Plasma TV although not great picture quality   but who comes to NYC to watch TV One complaint   the bed was sooooo soft in fact it felt like it was made out of feathers not good for people with back problems  Good maid service not intrusive polite  Great bar on th floor with amazing views  On departure we befriended another couple and ided to share a cab back to the airport in the hope to save a bit of money  We asked the conceirge to order this for us  When it turned up it was not a yellow cab but a private hire vehicle cost more than a yellow cab understandably and cost  more than what the conceirge quoted us   so be a bit aware  By the time we both paid and left a tip we were better off getting a yellow cab arately  I am not in the habit of returning the same hotel twice but if I found myself here again I would be very happy  
N => The Dream   A Nighte I travel A LOT for business and stay in NY often  I was interested in trying the Dream Hotel because I heard they had a fantastic rooftop bar    The bar was indeed fantastic although we were there  nights in a row and had to BEG to get some peanuts Each night we were told quotwe dont have peanutsquot we then had to explain that we had them the night before    somehow they managed to quotfindquot the darn peanuts   this happened  nights in a row I was traveling with what the hotel called a VIP and when I checked into my room next to the elevator can you say ding    ding    ding    every time someone stopped on the floor So I thought to myself this couldn t be how they treat their VIPs right Well I requested a room change to which I received a room smaller than my bedroom    Finally we were moved into a suite much more expensive this is now  hours of playing musical hotel rooms The bathrooms there were two in our suite were so moldy that I requested they come and look at it  I took pictures in case I was questioned later    Then I needed to send a box to my office and when I went to the concierge to ask for a box I was told that I should go buy one at Kinko s  I am NOT kidding   I have to send things to my office often when I am in NY and every time the concierge has always managed to find a box in the hotel somewhere but not at The Dream so off I went to kinkos to get a box  The gym is small but workable and the elevators are tiny tiny  I think it is important that people understand that everyone has different experiences   this was just mine but all in all The Dream was actually a nighte 
N => Major service failure The Dream Hotel experience was less then dreamy  More like indifferent  They dont seem to know how to respond to a guest problem  Recently I visited the lobby lounge with several senior executives  Imagine the suprise when on entering i was asked to supply a credit card before they would accept an order unprofessionalinappropriate and borderline insulting  It was PM and the lounge was nearly empty  We stayed for a little over an hour and the service was indifferent  At dinner later that evening I realized that the hotel never returned my credit card but instead had given me someone elses card  I contacted the hotel and was promised that i would have the card back in my possession early the next morning The card was not delivered as promised   After waiting hours i began calling the hotel  The resonse to  calls were no one is here who can help youno one was available and they would look into it  Two calls to the GMs office was met by voice mail and no response The clear impression is that they are strong on promising but very weak on delivery  Wonder how that attitude affects other guests Enough to keep me from returning  
N => Skip it We did not have a pleasant stay at Dream  The rooms are extremely small but we knew this before booking  I can deal with small rooms our main complaint was the extremely loud air conditioner unit that kicked on every  minutes throughout the night  I would have gladly turned off the air unit and opened a window to get fresh air into the room but our quotpseudo windowquot was walledbricked over and there was no way to get fresh air to circulate through the room without the air unit on  With no window no fresh air and no natural light it felt like we were staying in a cave  There are so many better places to stay in NYC for the price  My advice is to skip it  
N => Ridiculous waste of money Glad Im a small person or I would never have been able to walk around the bed to the desk This is THE SMALLEST room I have ever seen  Upon opening the window for a view of midtown I saw nothing but a brick wall  There was no view  Oh well the room was clean new and not bad looking  This would be the end of the story except the toilet was broken It overflowed I know a little about plumbing and was able to keep the water from flooding the bedroom but the bathroom was a puddle  I cleaned up the mess then had to use a wastebasket full of water to flush the toilet  Complained to the Manager and explained how Id saved the carpet from destruction but there wasnt even an apology forthcoming  And  for a pot of coffee is an insult  I would recommend this hotel to Osama Bin Laden  
N => Wonderful boutique hotel My boyfriend and I visit NYC three to four times a year  We like to stay in smaller contemporary boutique hotels  Dream is in a great central location with Carnegie Deli just around the corner and Times Squaretheatre district in walking distance  The staff was wonderful and very accommodating  The room was rather warm when entered and we had to call the front desk to fix it  While we were out they fixed it  It never got really cool which we prefer but it was comfortable  The room size was larger than many other hotels in NYC and the bed was very comfortable  The bathroom was small  The restaurant attached to the hotel had great food    calai was excellent  The lounge was great    visually stimulating  We would stay there again  
N => Worst NYC Hotel Experience Upon our initial arrival we had our bags brought up to the room and didnt get a chance to situate ourselves until after we had returned our rental vehicle no need for one in the city and ate dinner  On our return we come to find that were unable to contact any type of service from our phone   room service housekeeping concierge  I had gone down to the front desk and was advised to disregard the service buttons and to dial quotquot for anything were in need of  very well   The carpet in our room was in pretty bad condition our phone was missing a couple of buttons on it the alarm clock was missing our bathroom had no washclothes and our view was a street view lined with garbage dumpsters right in front of the hotel  You wont be able to miss it as its right across the street in front of the main entrance when you arrive  Mind you the overall look of the room was presentable but definitely not the quotwow factorquot that you had seen online  The bathroom shelf over the sink stuck out so far that when you went to brush your teeth you had to tilt your head a little too far to the side to rinse your mouth out  I did complain to the front desk that evening and again the following morning to where they had accommodated us by changing our room that day while we went to a show  Upon our return you would think they wouldve put us in a better location and a better room but NO and considering it was our last evening there it wasnt even worth asking nor going through the frustration of being moved again  Our stay was only for two nights and two nights of grief  Our second room was stuck back in a corner and our view there was none  It was the walls of the hotel in the shape of an enclosed triangle with nothing but pigeons and bird poop  The bathroom was missing the fog free shower mirror that our other bathroom had and the towel bars over the rear of the bathtub were rusted in numerous spots  I took pictures of everything as well be writing to the hotel as well  My husband and I travel to NYC once or twice EVERY YEAR and aside from the GREAT location there are so many other great hotels that weve stayed at in the same vicinity  Our money was a waste for the price that we paid  Wed been on vacation for a number of weeks and what a way to end it here  Even though this is our home town dont waste your money on this hotel You dont get what you pay for  Want to see a quotDreamquot Come to Vegas   I think we got you beat Everything at the Dream hotel is nothing but SMALL Best of luck to those who do give it a shot  
N => I didnt want the dream to end I would have to say please ignore any bad reviews of this hotel we arrived at the dream hotel and were greeted by friendly over accommodating staff and the lobby is breathtaking at first we were put in a smoking room on the nd floor at my request however when we arrived there was no view my partner went back down stairs and asked if we could move to a higher floor the staff had no problem and quickly changed the booking now the shapes and sizes of the rooms do vary we had booked a king room and the layout of the room we were changed too was not as good so my partner sheepishly went downstairs again and asked if we could just move back down to the nd flooragain this was no problem for them and they upgraded us to a room on the th floor with a wonderful view and a better space  I found my room to be perfectly spacious and immaculately clean the staff are more than happy to send a cleaner up to your room at any point in the day if you want your bed made  Each night when we returned there was a different peice of fruit left on our pillow with a little card forecasting the weather for the next day  The food in the serafina restaurant is absolutely delicious but quite pricey and i would have to say do not order room service we paid  for tea but there are lots of cafes and restaurants on your doorstep that you can go to instead  Please do not be put off by bad reviews of this hotel i can promise you that if you are thinking about choosing this hotel you will not be dissapointed i do agree that the concierge was not the most friendly character but we had no need to speak to him there are at least  lobby staff there at all times and they are extremely helpful and courteous and know lots about the city  Also check out is at  but if you have a late flight they are more than happy to hold onto your luggage for you until you return  I had an amazing experience at the dream hotel and can promise you will have no regrets  
N => The only NY hotel Id go back to Dream is so much more than I expected to get for the price  The rooms werent spacious but thats NY for you  Everyone on the staff was super helpful restaurant recommendations were spot on just dont get the namesake drink in the hotel restaurant SeraphimThe ambiance was fantastic and the robes were so soft I slept in mine  And the beds really were so fantasticwhen we returned from our trip we bought a new mattressIf you want to stay in midtown I cant recommend dream enough 
N => Frustration for Wheelchair User My husband and I had a frustrating five night stay at the Dream The atmosphere is impressive luxurious and exotic but the promise of a lovely stay was immediatly dashed at check in When we made reservations we spoke to the desk about the need for a wheelchair accessible room  When we arrived the wheelchair accessible room that we were promised was not available  The desk staff was indifferent and stated that a person can request a wheelchair accessible room but they could not promise to have one available We were given an otherwise very cool room but could not get the wheelchair into the bathroom  In order for my husband who is a quadrapeligic to go to the bathroom we had to go to the mens restroom in the basement  The next day we were given the ADA room  What a disaster  It was tiny  The bathroom door was wide enough but in very few ways it met ADA standards  I requested a shower chair that day but non were available  A small shower stool was provided on third day of our stay  It was soiled  My husband wasnt able to shower during our entire stay  We made the best of our trip but the Dream was as others stated a nighte For all of the expence and creative energy that went into the design of this hotel it amazed me that ADA elements were handled so poorly  
N => Loved It After reading the reviews I thought twice about Dream hotel  The photos on expedia com was so impressing  When I arrived to the hotel I was afraid As soon as I was greeted I was okay  The staff was very polite and helpful  They carried all of my luggage answered all of my  questions  As I entered the room I was relieved  The room was small but it was only  bed  The sheets were white and clean  The Plasma TV was nice and the room was very cozy  The closet was small but you are not staying for months They provided you with a mini bar  Very expensive so do not touch anythingThe location was great  It is located in the middle of TIMES SQUARE Great Resturants shopping everything The subway is located less than  minutes away  If you need assistance the hotel staff will assist you We need to realize that this is a hotel not your place of residence I enjoyed my stay and will visit again 
N => Sweet Dream Other reviews seem quite mixed but I found this to be a pretty good Manhattan hotel  Initially they tried to put me in a room  that was so small it didnt actually have anywhere to hang your coat  But after pointing this out to the front desk I was quickly re located to another that seemed the size of a small suite   Service or amp location are all good  The gym in the basement is a bit of a joke   but theyve got free access to the Golds Gym around the block which is fine  I was able to get a good price from expedia c   inc  tax so all in all Recommended 
N => More of a nighte than a dream This was one of the worst experiences ever  Our room which was billed as a non smoking suite at  a night was directly beneath the club on the th floor and the noise and the music came right through the floor with extreme bass  Called desk at  p m  was assured the music ended at  a m  at  a m  the music was still going strong  At  when I called they said to go to the front dest first thing in the morning and they would gladly change our room  Went to the front desk first thing in the morning and we were assured we would be given another comparable room was told to pack our bags enjoy our day and pick up our keys when we came back  Returned at  p m  ready to shower and change for dinner and our room had not been changed  Sent us back to our room as soon as we reached our room they called us  sent us to our new room which was very small but was considered a suite for the same price  The TV which is anchored to the wall was around the corner and could not be seen from the bed and was on the smoking floor  Was told this was the only room available  The only other option was to go back to our original room but since it was a Friday night did not want to take a chance  So we called another hotel and checked out  We were given a half price rate for the evening we stayed  Just as a side note the concierge was very rude and almost seemed annoyed we were asking him questions  And the heating system was very noisey and rattled most of the time we were there  
N => Please do not stay at the nighte I stayed at The Dream two weeks ago mid ober  and it was dreadful   none of the gadgets worked in the room  although they advertise quotthe latest in technological delightsquot   room service was a nasty adventure in food poisoning and to top it off  gt often sewage would come out of the taps when I turned them on  On the latter maintenance would show up every time to fix the issue and cite the rain as the problem and I thought yeah right   I live in London England and this does not happen there where it really rains Management seems to think citing that they are a boutique hotel will gloss over all these issues  They are also at great pains to state that serafina room service is only contracted to the hotel and not part of it   i e  they do not take responsibility at all for this department  The Chopra Centre is not open still and looks likely to not at all All in all a really bad experience  Please do not stay there  Belinda 
N => Disgraceful to the New York Boutique hotels Absolutely horrible I rated this hotel a one on a scale of five but thats only because there was no rating of zero option My girlfriend and I stayed at the Dream Hotel for two days this past weekend  First Ill start with some of the very few positives  The bed was extremely comfortable and the turndown service was excellent  Now for the bad  The room we booked was a quotlarge room with a king size bedquot I would love to there version of a small room if they consider this a large room  Closet and bathroom were outragously small  The flat screen television was outdated and only worked half the time  Booked room on their wbsite which I noticed didnt have very many pics of the entire room just little eiving pics of a desk or chair  They obviously arent proud of the rooms themselves  We checked our bags after we checked out to walk around Time Square before our flight and when we cam back they had no idea where our bags were or who took them  They were running around for  minutes looking for our luggage before they found it  I have stayed at many of the top boutique hotels in NYC from the Parker Meridien to the Plaza before it closed and I have to say this was the biggest disappointment of them all If you like small rooms bathrooms and closets with a high price tag than this is your place  
N => Hotel Charged Credit Card After Cancellation After reading some terrible reviews of this hotel blood on the sheets my boyfriend and I ided not to stay there  We called and cancelled our reservation well before the cutoff period which is  hours in advance but were charged anyway We called to tell the hotel staff of their mistake and was told that while they are sorry for the inconvenience they wont credit our credit card  I guess their policies arent set in stone   at least not when they benefit the customers  
N => Please Read Cannot Imagine A Hotel Worse Than This After reading several bad reviews I ided to give Dream a try anyway  It sounded and looked great on the website and when I called to make a reservation they were very accomodating and easy to deal with  Please trust me on this one   This hotel was worse than you could ever imagine  Upon arrival we learned that a private party was being held on site so the bar was not open to other hotel guests  Since no one had mentioned this to us we had planned on staying at the hotel for dinner and drinks so this was a big disappointment  Once in our room we noticed that our air conditioner was leaking  We called to let the front desk know  We also asked for ice as well as the ipod and dvd player when we called about the air conditioner  We were told that it would be about a half hour so we ided to leave the hotel for dinner  We stopped and bought dvds on the way home to watch in the room  When we got back  hours later our air was still leaking and there was no sign of a dvd player or ice in the room  I called the front desk and they told me that they ran out of ipods the dvd wires were too short to fit from our tv to the outlet and that they came to give us ice but no one answered the door  They offered to pay me  for the money i spent on dvds however after all of that we ided we didnt want to stay in that horrible room small leaking a c  no movies  The only good thing i have to say is that when we told them we were going to leave for all of the above reasons they did refund us in full for the night  Please go somewhere else We went to the Sheraton in times square which was  times better 
N => Really really nice Recently stayed at dream hotel for ten nights After all the reviews we were expecting the worst but once we got there we were pleasantly surprised  We upgraded to a bigger room before we even got there for  dollars extranight as everyone had talked about the tiny size of room  The room was big clean comfortable   absolutelty no complaints  Good location friendly staff    absolutely no complaints Have stayed at hudson W Hotel and Sheraton Manhattan and this was definetely up there with them  
N => Dream was a great hotel We just got back from spending a night in New York at the Dream Hotel  I was very concerned before we arrived because of the negative comments I had read  In fact it was great  We reserved a medium room which was totally comfortable for my husband and I  The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept on a hotel  The bathroom was fine  The room was quiet and the black out shades made it pitch black so that we could sleep late  The front desk staff was very helpful including telling us where we could find a garage right across the street that was much cheaper than using the hotel valet service  We did get an ipod as well as two drink vouchers that we used in the hotel bar  We will stay at the Dream again the next time we are in New York especially because it is a very easy walk to the theatre district  
N => Over Rated This hotel is just not ready for prime time  After booking and confirming a quotlarge kingquot sized room I was nonetheless placed in a tiny tiny room with a twin bed  I had to call downstairs to complain before being quickly placed in the proper quotpaid forquot larger size room  The excuse I got was that Hotels had forwarded them the reservation as a quotstandardquot room  This was obviously a not true as Hotels had sent me multiple emails to various places all listing the room as a quotlarge kingquot  In New York you need to speak up to get what youve paid for but when you spend  a night you should not have too  Had I been passive I would have spent the night in a tiny box The hallways are way too dark narrow and hot  Was I in a nightclub or a hotel hallway The smallest hallways I have ever seen  No air conditioning could be felt on the floors other than the lobby  The air conditioning unit in my room was on occasion so loud that it kept my wife awake  Plasma TVs are cool but with only a handful of channels no premium channels and no in room movie purchases available the Plasma wasnt a big deal  Like a Mercedes without wheels  No coffee makers in the room  Room service was inadequate  My wife ordered a large pot of coffee and they only sent up one cup  Then the muffins came without any butter jams or jellies  No one asked quotFor how manyquot room service was being ordered The bathroom showed no style in fact bland is the first word that comes to mind For the price paid you can better at other hotels in New York  
N => well definantly stay here again we stayed at the Dream for  nights and after reading bad reviews i was rather worried about staying there but i had nothing to worry about  Upon arriving the staff were very polite and we were shown to our room straight away  Although the room was small it was big enough for the two of us to sleep in and there was enough space for us to hang our clothes the room was fully orated and was very modern  The bathroom was a ent size and was stocked full of towels and molten brown toiletries  Although the ipod was not in the room we still had the plasma tv with all the channels to watch in the nights  We enjoyed our stay at the Dream and would definantly stay there again  
N => Great hotel My husband and I stayed at the dream and found it to be a great experience  Before we arrived we were dreading our stay this was because of some of the reviews on this site  Our room was small modern and very nice  The room was kept clean and a pieces of fruit was placed on our pillows every night with the weather prediction for the next day  We never waited more than  seconds for a lift and the fish tank in the reception is amazing   The only down side was there was no Ipod in the room and when I requested one I was told they were all out   Beware of the airport shuttle service the concierge arranges for you we booked our ride the night before the ride failed to show and they didn t bother to ring and let the concierge know they were not coming so what should have cost  dollars ended up costing us  dollars as we ended up taking a private taxi to the airport  Apart from this we had a great time and we will definitely stay at this hotel again  
N => Absolute Nighte My boyfriend and i ided to stay at Dream Hotel because it was newly reated regardless of the bad reviews  As soon as we arrived Dream quickly turned into an quotAbsolute Nightequot  There was no bellman at the door to help us with our luggages and the hotel front desk staffs were unfriendly and were not very accomidating  We had to wait for  hrs to check into a quotTinyquot room and soon we found a quothugequot roach in our room  Then they moved us to a second room where we found a blood stain on the white bed comforter  We demanded to speak to a manager who was not on site at the time  pm and we had to wait around for awhile  They finally moved us to a suite which was great but not worth the troubles that we had encountered  Even if the hotel staffs front desk were nice and accomidated the room is not worth the price  The room is tiny the bathroom is also tiny and the oration is not impressive even with the quotcheapquot plasma TV  However the bed is very comfortable and the location is great  But you can get a better deal plus free breakfast at the Libary Hotel or The Mansfield Hotel and with a little more money The Royalton is absolutely the dream hotel 
N => this hotel DREAMs of ripping you off  I stayed at DREAM for one night and it was by far the worst purchase I ever made in NYC  The room was not completed finished  Carpet was missing in some areas of the room  The pre loaded iPod with speakers which the hotel boasts is available in all rooms was not available  The hallways were not air conditioned and had a rather foul odor  The rooftop bar Ava was not open  Neither was the fitness center  The front desk did not seem motivated to help in any way whatsoever  The shower in the bathroom did not have hot water  To sum it up your money is better spent at an established hotel in the same category such as the W Hotel chain  
N => Dont stay here The hotel was awful We had a leaky air conditioner and were asked to stay in that room instead of moving to another room  We had to wait   minutes for our bags to come up to our room and were lied to about the location of our bags  The rooms are very small   We had a queen size bed in a  square foot room and that was considered a medium room The DREAM website was also very misleading the square feet of our room is equivalent to a small room but because they could fit a queen size bed in there it was considered a medium room I will NEVER stay there again and would not recommend this hotel to anyone  We were supposed to stay there for  days but checked out after two days and went to a different hotel  We tried to give it a chance but it was just too awful  
N => Excellent hotel My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel for  nights in e   The room was small but nice and modern  Unfortuantely we had a view of a brick wall but it wasnt too much of a problem  The huge plasma TVs in the rooms are lovely and there is a very impressive fish tank in the lobby  The elevators are a bit slow but they get there eventually  There was a nice bellman named Edwin who was very friendly and helpful and recommended a great Chinese restaurant to us  There was also a very helpful concierge who very kindly rang the airport to arrange our pickup car for us as we could not get the phone in the hotel room to work and he even rang back to change the booking when we realised we had got the wrong flight time  All in all it was a very good hotel and I would stay there again  
N => Nighte Truly the worst hotel experience I have ever had  The hotel is trying way too hard to be cool   it doesnt work  It was so loud from doors slamming all night that I didnt sleep for two days  Mysterious black grease on the door got all over my clothes  Went to call security at am after listening to kids run up and down the hall all night and the phone was dead  Hows that for safety Takes forever to get an elevator too  Skip this one unless youre an insomniac that likes to listen to other peoples music thumping through the walls  
N => Overpriced hotel We got to the hotel about  pm and dropped our luggage off in our room  We came back to the hotel room around  pm and our closet of a room had no air conditioning     The staff did transfer us to another room but it was inconvenient  The room was an upgrade but still small  The toilet leaked but the bed was comfortable  All the TVs in the rooms are flat screen TVs  The hotel restaurant had good food but overpriced like their rooms  The staff of the hotel shouldnt have been in customer service they were not very friendly  I was a little disappointed that we had to pay to keep our car there the price should have been included with the room or complimentary  
N => Avoid this nighte We stayed at Dream for four nights in   Very disappointed  The room was so small that we kept bumping our legs on the corners of the bed when trying to walk by  There are only two lifts so you have to wait each time when going to or coming from the room  There was no evidence of ipods in the room or indeed of the promised Deepak Chopra spa  The hotel gym is not in the hotel at all but they allow you access to a gym down the road  There was no complimentary breakfast as had been advertised and breakfast at Serafina was a complete rip off  The roof top bar was too loud and full of drunk suited city boys and on our last night the firealarm was set off by someone who got stuck in the lift  We had to evacuate the hotel with no reassurance from staff about what was going on  Instead a surly bouncer told us to go back to our room  Not recommended at all  
N => Dream More like nighte I came to Dream expecting great things due to an excellent web site Nice one Sri but I was immediately disappointed by the quotdont give a damnquot attitude of the majority of staff and the tackiness of the lobby  I understand that it is meant to have an Indian feel to it but in my opinion it just appears all too tacky The room was small even by NYC standards with extremely limited clothes space and no room to store empty luggage  No pay on demand movies and no CD player  I requested an IPod which room service eventually delivered but no calbles in order to play it thru the Bose radio The service at breakfast the first morning was bad to say the least The service in both the lobby and penthouse bars was rude and unprofessional you cannot charge drinks to your room  We checked out early and went to stay at the Royalton and enjoyed wonderful service and attention     I suggest that you do the same as Dream is an experience you definitely do not need to repeat  
N => This Dream keeps getting better This is my second trip to the Dream and while my first stay was enjoyable my latest experience was fantastic  It seems that they have worked out all of the opening kinks and are now on track to deliver a fantastic guest experience  Once the Chopra Center opens in tember I will definatly make a return trip 
N => Found the Dream to be one Just a quick note to let folks traveling to NYC to check into the Dream Hotel  Great ambiance great service GREAT PEOPLE  
N => Nice hotel All around a nice hotel  Only below average service i received was from concierge  
N => You  want to check the building work is complete I was booked to stay here in tember  through Expedia  I arrived at pm on a Saturday night to a building site with no rooms open  They say it was Expedia s fault Expedia say it was the Dream  Either way it was a very bad experience and Dream did nothing to help me find somewhere else   poor service  
N => I dont think so    I am sooo happy I read this site  I called to cancel and the person was soo unprofessional  He started to argue with me that there would be a charge to cancel  I said that there was only one working elevator  He said no  We have two working elevators  As if that was wonderful   He refused to admit that there was any work being done on the hotel  After I pushed it he offered to cancel and then hung up  Although it was so quick I have to call tomorrow to make sure that he really did cancel BTW the website  does  say the rooms come with preloaded IPODs  So anybody that stays there should print that out                                    Also some of the reviews on this hotel were so hilarious that we almost considered staying there just so that we would have some of our own funny stories   be another time when we feel like wasting our time   
N => Keep Dreaming if you want service It was so bad we changed hotels after our first night on the thought that we were paying top dollar but got horrible service  Ill give you the short recap after paying  for a king Christmas week put us in a smoking room bc they quotcant guarantee smoking or non just bed size quot moved to a nonsmoking room but had full bed when we asked for a discount off the king rate we had to fight for  off  no toilet paper when we finally got to the room had to call for an iron and ironing board which was supposed to be in the room  either hit your head on a poorly designed shelf over the sink or make a mess trying to splash water on your face  After bringing us to a second room that still wasnt right the bell hop had nothing nice to say about the management or their concept of customer service  They just arent paying attention to the important details you expect when paying these rates I would recommend staying somewhere else but visiting Dreams penthouse bar which has an awesome view of times square 
N => Really Disappointed I have just returned from a week at this hotel and i was extremely disappointed with the overall service of the staff and quality of the bedrooms  Prior to even arriving at the hotel we had already been appalled by the unhelpful staff  We had contacted the hotel on numerous occasions to try to see if the hotel was doing anything for New Years Eve and after being put through to the wrong department  or  times we were told that the hotel was not holding anything  However when we arrived we were re informed that there was in fact an event being held for New Years Eve  Subsequently we informed reception of what had happened and were assured that we would be contacted immediately for information about this event  Disappontingly we never heard from any member of staff throughout our holiday Furthermore the rooms are exceptionally small and even after being moved to a fractionally larger room we still had no space to put our clothes and had to put the majority over the desktop which was most inconvenient The sheets were also dirty and the room was freezing  There was a heating system however it made so much noise that we were forced to keep the heating off throughout the night to keep it from waking us up Lastly there were no ipods in the rooms and there were very few TV channels to watch To credit the hotel it was in an excellent location and the bar and restaurant were lovely  However this did not make up for our overall experience of this hotel  
N => dream was not so bad but the small room yes i just came back from new york and i was very disappointed with dream disillusioned  when we arrived at the hotel first we found the lobby small nothing to see with the pictures of the lobby but it was nice modern a big statue and an aquarium  but then what almost a nighte  the first room they gave us a small one was just a shame  it was not small it was ridiculous our luggage did not fit in the room  the view was disgusting if you can call this a view  the view was one of the behind of a building just disgusting so we asked for another room  the other room was better we had a view on the street  but VERY VERY small and the shame is that there were NO closet at all to put our clothes there were  little drawers and  coat hanger and THATs IT so we had to leave almost all of our clothes in our luggage which took all of the space on the side of the bed   then if i sat on the bed it was not possible for my friend to go to the other side there was like  cm in front of the bed  for this price its a shame i strongly suggest you NOT to have a small room at dream not even a medium one which is just a bit bigger so i was shocked of the size i would not even pay a hundred dollar for it  i thought people exagerated a lot about the size but i can assure you they did not  we did shopping and after  days the room was a mess it was difficult to move and we almost fight with my friend because its so irritating this size then no ipod the tv was great but sometimes gave headaches because it was so close from the bed and there are no numbers for the channels just  or   so good luck if you want to go from channel  to channel   then the heater waws soooo noisy horrible either it was too hot either too cold and one day it broke so they gave us a portable heater what i strongly suggest you because no noise and the temperature is better hot everywhere in the room not just only in front of the heater if you use the one on the ceiling then another really bad thing for a  stars hotel our room was not made during THREE days and they changed out towels just once in a week they even left dirty ones with make up   we left a tip everyday but we should not have because those kind of things its not normal so what i can tell you is that we will probably not go back and really dont go in a small room if you want to do shopping and have some clothes for the good points well the location the confortable bed and bathrobes and thats it  we had a drink at the ava lounge its very dark and i asked for a bloody y with no spice they told me that the cocktails were already mixed    for  dollars a cocktail pfff ridiculous  and the rooms were not as fancy as i thought seeing the pictures they had nothing special the blue neon board the huge screen but nothing else  and the bar at the lower level has nothing to see with the one on the pictures i did not see it like this  the hotel did not ruin our holidays but i can presume that it ruined some other people ones and that it will  
N => I loved the dream Just got back from Dream and cant wait to go back Great location friendly staff chic atmosphere and great Key lime tinis made this trip to the city fantastic Small rooms Its NYC folks Besides the rooms were not THAT small  How much time will you be spending in your room anyway Only  elevators working Yes but we never had to wait long for one to arrive  No mini bar true but I have never been a fan of paying  for a bottle of water  These  things were eclipsed by the beautiful rooms great lounges and superb location  Personally I hope more people write bad reviews so I can have this great hotel all to myself the next time I go to New York  plus it might keep the prices down There were a couple of small glitches while we were there but the staff took care of our needs as soon as we notified them  Overall Dream was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had  Definately geared more towards the   something hipsters  Families with children should consider other nearby hotels  All others come and enjoy the Dream 
N => Dream was great We were concerned about what we would find when we went to the Dream because we read many reviews and they were mixed  However from the time we were greeted by Mada at the front desk who was terrific and gave us great restaurant recommendations to the time we checked out we had a great time  We found the room to be very comfortable quiet and stylish as well  There were many special touches and it was lots of fun  Our party included younger and older persons and all loved it  
N => Dream Code name for only enough room to sleep On the good side The lobby was very nice and the lounge on the top floor was a good place to hang out with your friends  On the bad side The rooms are VERY small I wasnt sure if I was in my room or in my closet  There was only one working elevator  The in room safe was not hooked up the mini bar was not stocked some of the outlets didnt work  The was no bathtub just a small shower Overall I would say they did as much with the space as they could but it just wasnt good enough  
N => Loved this hotel Stayed at Dream for  nights from th ember a birthday treat for my husband  I loved it  Yes the lobby was still having a ft fish tank installed will be great to see when finished but the work was all taking place behind a cordoned off area  Room was small but TV plasma screen enormous Bed was small but or in room was great black and white and I loved the blue light under the bed and under the desk  All furniture was good quality Molton Brown toiletries what a treat  Bathroom as clean modern and great power shower  View was pants and when asked to upgrade we were told they were full booked all nights  Bar was expensive  for two bottles of beer but the view was superb looking right down broadway  From there we saw another bar called the Triple Inn or could have been M where there was a live soul band and a balcony to watch Fantastic location for so many landks had breakfast every morning in Applejacks Diner just across the street  Wish they had told us they had changed the hotel to Dream we booked in il with Expedia under the name of Majestic freaked our cabbie out a bit   but that is down to Expedia not the hotel  be I am just easily pleased but I loved it  
N => A bad dream We had a three night reservation and my wife wanted to leave the minute we arrived  Problems included construction in the lobby when we arrived only one working elevator very small room tiny bathroom double bed when queen was reserved and apathetic front desk staff  The walls seemed to be paper thin as we heard televisions in each room as we walked by  Also if you stay on a low floor be prepared to hear all the noise from the streets  We stayed one night only because we couldnt find another room  Moved the next day to Affinia Dumont which was very nice  The few positives are   nice moderately priced restaurant good location plasma tvs in the room because there isnt room for anything else  Buyer beware    
N => Not the stuff that Dreams are made of  
N => more like nighte  
N => Good experience Having read several not so great reviews of this hotel I did not have high expectations but needed to stay in Chelsea for work  I thought this hotel was totally fine  The room  full size beds was larger than similarly priced hotels I have stayed in in NYC in the past  It was spacious for this price in NY with a ent bathroom  Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable  The hotel has a nice business center downstairs with computersinternet access free of charge along with a printer  The front desk staff were very nice and helpful  I had no complaints at all  I also liked the location    th Ave offers Whole Foods and other conveniences within a block or two and taxis are very easy to get  
N => Not Bad Stayed for two nights and thought the room was fine  I did not stay in the room a lot as I was exploring NYC  Front desk staff was polite  As expected the room was small but again it was clean and safe  It is within easy walking distance to Penn Station as I flew into JFK took the airtrain to Jamaica station and the LIRR to Penn Station  I would stay here again  
N => There are better hotels Walking into the lobby of this hotel we thought we must be in the wrong place  It is extremely small and seemingly unorganized  They were unable to check us in due to computers being down so we went into the bar which was substandard as well  The only thing that saved us was the fact that the room was clean and ently orated and equipped  Luckily we were only staying two nights and the location is the reason we chose the hotel in the first place  We were using Starwood points   if we had been quotpayingquot I definitely would changed hotels once I saw what we were in for  My husband who usually doesnt pay too much attention to hotels said quotHoney I thought we usually stay a nice hotelsquot  That says it all  
N => Small room strange staff This hotel seems lacking in the right sort of staff  There is no bellman and nobody to really help with luggage  I arrived before my room was ready so they stored my luggage in the basement  A very surly security guard brought the luggage up to the room without saying a word Their restaurantbar wont charge to your room which is a shame because after you wait  minutes for the menu and another  to get a drink you dont want to spend much time settling the account  They have a lounge area but nobody to really staff it if the bar area is full so its a bit of a dismal situation  Especially since while you wait you get to experience the same security guard staring around the lounge area and using the business center an area at the end of the barlounge to look up websites The room itself was pretty small and dark   nothing too flash but not particularly bad  
N => Had a good time here with wife and teenagers I stayed here with my wife and two teenagers over a long weekend  The location was very convenient    my wife went to Chelsea galleries and I went to Yankee stadium as the location is convention to subway lines  The beds were comfortable the manager was very helpful and we had a very good time here  The gym was small but just fine  Well go back  
N => Good stay     We got a good rate for this hotel   under   a night on hotwire and I would say that it was good value for the money  Clean good sized room good location walkable to most attractions in Manhattan  Didnt need to deal with the staff much but they allowed us to check in early and stored our bags on our last day before departure  Would stay there again and recommend to friends if getting a similar rateAnd there were no protesters but were signs up over the street  
N => Good stay in Four Points Chelsea I booked rooms early uary from Priceline for    List price on hotels website was   We were very happy with the price we paid and in general with our whole stay in the hotel  Check in was fast and soon we were in our rooms on th floor Rooms were clean not very big but spacious enough for us and our luggage and shopping bags  We even had view to ESB  Staff was friendly location good between two subway lines nearest stops on th ave and rd st add th ave and rd st  We received breakfast coupons one per person for one morning I had read about the protesting but they were not there for our entire stay There is free internet access two computers  printer downstairs  
N => Very pleasant stay My best friend myself and dhter spent  nights here for a girls getaway to celebrate my dhters th birthday We booked on priceline just before New Years and got this room for a steal of nightFor that price it was worth every pennyCheck in was easy  We were put in room  facing th St  We had  double beds which to me was the only drawback as the beds were really small  We did love all the pillows on the beds though  We always bring our own sheets to hotels and remade the bed with those when we arrived and housekeeping just made up the bed daily with our sheets on the bed  I just have a thing about sleeping in questionable sheets so this is my habit whenever I travel  It gives me a peaceful nights sleep  The room itself was small but we expected this for NYC  I thought they did a nice job of giving you storage though  We unpacked and each had  drawer  total  We also hung up some clothes in the closet and used the shelf above the desk and the desk for additional storage  It worked just fine I thought the hotel was clean and the beds were comfy  The bathroom was ent size and the shower had good hot water amp water pressure  We always had plenty of towels and our room was cleaned well and in a timely manner daily  We received  breakfast coupons total  per person for  morning of your stay  The breakfast was good  You were given a choice of  meal selections  We all chose the full breakfast which included  eggs toast  pieces of bacon and hash browns and drinks fill yourself   juice coffee water milk etc   We didnt realize how close the hotel was to Times Square until we went exploring our first night  The hotel is basically on the corner of th Ave  and th St  Times Square begins basically at th Ave  and nd St  so just a  block walk and youre there  It was a nice walk and we felt safe even at night  However if you cant or dont want to walk that far grab a taxi   it was only  from most parts of Time Square back to the hotel and taxis were plentiful at night  Also the subway is on the corner of rd St  and th Ave  It was an easy way to get around too  We did buy water and fruit from Whole Foods the first night and that was a very nice store and SO convenientJennifer checked us in and seemed to be working every time we came through  She was very helpful amp even arranged for a car service for am the morning we checked out  It was the same price as a taxi to the airport  and very convenient He even arrived  min  early and we were at the airport in less than  minutes  We had heard about the protesting and werent sure what to expect  They were not there for our entire stay  The only sign of any protesting was  banners hung on the building across from our window that said something about Four Points not following Federal Labor Laws  I thought the hotel was relatively quiet  The only noises we really heard were the nightly garbage trucks and our noisy neighbors who came in  night drunk at am  They made some noise but only for a few minutes so we didnt even bother calling the front desk about it  We just went back to sleep  We had a pleasant stay at this hotel and would recommend it for a NYC adventure  
N => To my surprise My overall experience with Four Points Sheraton is between Above Average and Excellent  I booked a room online for a Sat  night to spend a pre valentines day with my boyfriend  I have to say I expected the room to be small being that it is in the city  But the size of the room was fine for one night it was I have to say cozy  The room was clean no smells quiet and no bed bugs  The bed was incredibly comfortable and my boyfriend and I didnt want to get out of bed  I will definitely stay at the hotel again  Unfortunately I would have taken pictures of the room but I forgot my camera duh me  
N => Never Again My stay at the Sheraton Four Points was very unsavory  The hotel was so small I felt that I was in the quotBeing John Malkovichquot movie and the feel of the room when I arrived was very dark amp dirty  There was not one thing in the room that was not painted brown or made with brown material  The protestors were great to wake up to  Something needs to be settled with this  I really felt bad for staying there after I found out why they were protesting  Sorry for the bad review    
N => Felt bad for the Protestors I like this hotel   Ive been using it as sort of a third choice when my first two hotels in NYC are booked  But I have to admit that I felt very guilty staying at a hotel where the protestors represent organized labor  I really think they need to settle this multi months long strike before I can feel comfortable staying there again sorry but I grew up in a working class family and i know how tough it can be to keep good jobs at ent wages  
N => Rough beds nice small room great BAR My girlfriends and I stayed at the Four Points in Chelsea for three nights  The room was small but thats to be expected in Manhattan but it was very clean and chic The hotel staff were great and the hotel breakfast was AWESOME The hotel was also close to multiple Subway stops and taxis were accessible either on th or th Avenue which were very near the hotel  In addition the bar was fabulous Happy hour was from   pm and drinks were  for  Now thats my kinda place The only dissappointment was the union protesters that woke us up at  AM   but I definitley think this was out of the ordinary  To sum it up Id stay here again and would recommend it to any one of my friends  
N => Above average but with flaws We stayed at the hotel beginning of ember for  week  When we arrived at about   pm our room was not ready but it took only about  minutes which we used for some food shopping as there are lots of places around  As it was kind of our honeymoon trip they gave a breakfast for free which was a nice gesture Picketing was still ongoing but the picketers were cramped behind a fence a little aside still being very loud and having a video camera set up filming the entrance and a giant rat about  meters high with them which is quite an odd look to have in front of a hotel  We have not been insulted but being yelled at very loudly when entering or leaving the hotel which we simply ignored  The whole thing is about employee health insurance which   according to the picketers   is not being paid for by the hotel as others do  The hotel says the picketers are not liable for the hotel staff which anyway would have no complaints  The truth   as always   seems to be somewhere in the middle  Expect the picketing in the morning and in the late afternoon  Definitely ask for a room on the backside of the hotel So besides that annoying little fact what can be said about the Four Points Well expect a Starwood hotel but dont expect it to be like other Starwood places  You can sure earn as well as redeem Starpoints which we did but thats pretty much it  The crew at the front desk is kind of unwilling and surprised me with some astonishing helplessness  We ordered broadway tickets and needed some help   not that much helpfull  Ordering a limousine to the airport  dollars  toll with from a different agency than they cooparate with  dollars  toll Not possible not willing whatever  No bathrobe or slippers are provided and dont expect to be upgraded even if you are SPG Platinum  The rooms quotall have pretty much the same sizequot and only very few higher class  The good  Subway stop rd or th street within  minutes walking distance  Very close to Times Square  Whole Foods superket Starbucks and other food places very close  tiny but clean rooms and relatively new rooms  free internet in the room with cable no wireless  a small Poland Spring bottle of water every day for freeThe bad  Air condition produces kind of an odd smell but with around  degrees celcius absolutely required  unwilling amp apparently bored crewBottom line if you want to spend redeem Starpoints   theres not better Starwood place to stay  But paying about  Dollars for it I wouldnt   nevertheless a place I would return to  
N => Spotless Stayed one night  Booked thru Priceline and got a great deal at night  Room and bathroom were spotless  We requested a coffee maker and it arrived in less than  minutes  Bed was very comfortable  Yes there were angry protesters which we simply ignored and walked right by  They have security making sure they dont bother the guests  We were on the second floor but faced away from the street so we didnt hear all the hub bub  If you are on the street side I can see where the noise would be annoying if you spend time in the room  The protest seems to go on from am pm  The staff was GREAT and went out of their way to make your stay comfortable  The manager stood in the lobby and seemed to be doing double duty as concierge even though I dont think it was his job  be they are overcompensating because of the distraction of the protest but I dont think so  We were comped breakfast which was good although it took a while as it was very crowded  Nice bar scene  Would definitely stay here again  
N => Strikers ruin your stay   and the front desk isnt much better The strike ruined the weekend  We were told nothing when we booked  well yes it was on hotels comand minimal explanation when we checked in  Strikers went till  PM on Friday   obliterating the possibility of an afternoon nap after a long trip in to the city I complained and was told   it would not be a problem for the rest of the stay   since the strikers dont come on weekends   well they did on Sunday morning at  AM   could not sleep in  The front desk was sympathetic but offered absolutely no type of compensation for  ruined days   not good business It is a nice hotel   a great location if you like Chelsea   rooms are small but modern  I had thought I booked a queen   and when I checked in found out it was  twins and the front desk was not helpful at all  I called down on Saturday morning to find out what time breakfast was over   the lackadaisical clerk said   oh  or  and it was    my partner and I got dressed to go out for breakfast only to find out that breakfast WAS still being served   till   and a nice breakfast   complimentary one day   eggs   toast   jujice   but no apology at all from the front desk   Service has nose dived   dont know why Service has dropped A LOT since my last stay here two years ago and I would definitely not stay here under any situation if the strike is still going on  I did speak to the manager when I was checking out to register my complaints about all of the above and he was sympathetic but offered nothing  Bad business ember  DEFINITE DONquotT 
N => Great location great room but thats it  I was visiting for the yearly Photo convention at the Javits  I wanted to stay somewhere that was crowded with tourists so I picked this location in Chelsea  I used my starwood points to get  nights stay for free The prosGreat location in the city it is within walking distance to many ammenities  There was a Wholefoods superket across the street  Places to get food in every direction all within walking distance  A great location to stay at if you are not familiar with the city  The room was excelent but then again it is a Sheraton Starwood hotel  The bed and the linen was really comfortable and the bathroom was clean with all the ammenities  The consInconsistant staff there was only one friendly staff that I encountered  I had to move  times the first day of arrival  The room wasnt ready at check in time and I had to wait an hour before my room was ready  Oh yeah no appoligies from the staff that helped me  So the first room I got still had guest in it  The second room I got the AC was broken  The third room was finally all good but it had a weird smell to it  I just smoked a fe cigarettes to get rid of the smell since I didnt feel like dragging my bags down stairs for the rd time in one day  Again no appoligies was given  I woke up the next day to protesters out front of the hotel  I brushed it off theyll be gone soon and they are only protesting for a day  Well no they continued to protest for the next  days that I was there  I would of been fine if the staff had told me of this situation but instead I had to wake up to it  Not only that every time I left and came back to the hotel I was harrassed by the protester to check out of the hotel and get my money back  Overall the stay was great but the experience of the staff and the protester and having to move multiple times really put a damper on my experience with this hotel  I definitly would not ever come back to this hotel and definitly would not recommend anyone else to stay here either  They need to hire better people and train them better in customer service  For it to be a Starwood Sheraton chain I am very disapointed in my experience  
N => BEWARE   Service is horrendous  We had the  pleasure  of arriving in the midst of a labor dispute complete with picketers with bull horns  The kicker is that the strikes had apparently been going on for several weeks before our scheduled arrival date yet nobody at this hotel or Starwood bothered to notify us in advance as to the disruption to service and general noise nuisance that we would be subject to the TV at max volume didnt even drown them out  To top it off the front desk gave us a letter AFTER we checked in to advise that they had become aware of quotsome peoplequot outside the hotel who  cause a disturbance  quotSome peoplequot Really Its their own employees  When we complained after listening to the bullhorns for  hrs we were told that our room reservation was non cancellable and that even if we moved to a different hotel they were going to charge us for all  room nights  Great customer service I was shocked by the entire hotel staffs from the front desk to the managers Allen nonchalant attitude about the whole thing and utter disregard for very legitimate complaints  This hotel is a joke and by no means what one would expect of a Starwood property  DO NOT STAY HERE 
N => Clean Efficient Value This was one of the few places in mid town available for night after a long day at the US Open  No frills but as advertised clean compact room desk chair small but clean newish bath  No surprises  Wholefoods ket across street on th avenue  
N => Had a great time at the hotel My friends and I booked a hotel room for the labour day weekend  This is my fair and honest opinion of the hotel  We checked in at pm on Friday eventhough our check in time was pm  They were generous enough to give us a room on the th floor away from the ice machine  The guy at the front desk was quick with the check in took us about  minutesLike all the reviews the rooms are very small  In our room there were two double beds  The double beds were more like large single beds but they were incredibly comfy  The washroom was right near the door  It was spacious with plenty of towels  There was tv closet and drawers  all in one small room  It would have been better to have a bigger room or smaller furnitures We had to watch our steps over the luggages and stuff but overall everything was included  I loved the free internet access  It wasnt wireless so the speed was amazingly fast  I called home from skype so I didnt have to use long distance from the hotel  It was easy to get directions to all the touristy places too  Whenever we came back to the hotel we were always welcomed back which I really appreciated  The staffs were all nice young and helpful  They got us stuff toothbrush towel prompty  We definitely had no problems with the staffs  We didnt get room service nor used the gym so I cant stay much about that  Its close to rd subway station    two stops from time square  Very close to greenwich village  we had breakfast there  Its a very gay friendly community  Theres a Chelsea Papaya store on rd and th  didnt go there but heard it was amazing  Theres a  hours Duane Reade close by  Theres a restaurant called Bombay Gardens near rdth   its an Indian buffet if you want to go  There is a whole foods store near the hotel if anyones interested  We paid night at the hotel but i know it goes around night  I wouldnt pay  at the hotel so I think it was fair to have it at  still expensive but hey  its new york Basically you get what you pay for  nothing too crazy fancy but we enjoyed the clean simple features and anemities they offered  
N => Unpleasant Experience The front desk staff seemed unorganized and distracted  Upon arrival we were told our room was not available and that we should come back in  minutes  We asked to leave our bags but noticed that they just put them in a pile in the corner of the lobby  We had laptops and other electronics in our bags so this was a bit disconcerting  We came back about an hour later but the room was still not ready  It took about  more minutes for them to locate a room and check us in  Everyone behind the desk was distracted but it wasnt that busy in there  I kept having to remind them that I was standing there waiting for them to finish the process  It was a very unpleasant experience However the room was nice and clean but pretty small  The housekeeping staff was very friendly  
N => Waste Of Time First of all I came in with a group of my in laws for a bachelorette weekend  We were treated rudely upon entering to check into the hotel  The guy at the desk stated quotNo rooms are availablequot  Which would be fine since we were a bit early however he didnt even bother to check his computer  No more than  seconds later he ides he will check his computer and realizes he DOES have a few rooms available  This should have been a simple process checking everyone in  It took TWO HOURS I was very organized with my group and provided a spreadsheet with confirmation numbers and the room reservation name it should be under to make this process quick and simple  And if that wasnt bad enough he placed people in the wrong rooms under the wrong name reservation  How difficult is it to say  Ms  X  you are in room Y and then put them in that room  He just randomly placed people in rooms So wrong charges were incurred on credit cards and wrong rates wrong reservation name etc  etc During our stay we had a pretty unpleasant stay  My mother was moved from her room due to the air conditioning not working  It was  degrees this weekend so that wasn t going to work  The hotel maintenance guy told us it was working when indeed it clearly was not  He just didn t want us to be moved and he was too lazy to bother to fix it  Finally she was moved to another room with the same problem  She gave up on all the moving and dealing with everything else we wanted to enjoy our stay in the city because it was such a short trip to begin with On Saturday night I came back with my mother in law at about am to find someone throwing several glass bottles out of the windows over the entry way of the hotel that missed us by about  feet  The guy at the desk did NOTHING I saw him go to the window look and then go back to whatever he was doing  We were horrified because we could have been seriously injured by this  What kind of place is thisTo my horror checking out was an even bigger feat  TWO HOURS AGAIN I must say this is HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE to my standards  This hotel wasted SEVERAL hours of my vacation time with my family  I chose this hotel  I am highly embarrassed that I had my new in laws and my family to have to deal with this due to the incompetence of the hotel staff I came home and thought this saga was finally over  WRONG  I checked my credit card statement and to my dis once again I will be FORCED to deal with the hotel staff once again  I was charged TWICE on my card  And DIFFERENT rates at that  I shouldn t have even had to pay for my room in the first place let alone be charged twice For the amount of time I had to spend at the front desk I should have been compensated in some way  But I got NOTHING  Absolutely nothing MY fianc  and I are loyal customers to the Starwood hotels and look for them everywhere we go  Good luck getting business at this hotel because I plan to tell everyone know about the experience I had    
N => Excellent Hotel I just returned from a trip to NYC  Stayed at Four Points from      Paid  a night very expensive I arrived at the hotel at noon and was worried about checking in early but no problem they had a room  The rooms are small but OK  The only problems were not enough shelf space in the bathroom and the street noise at night kept me awake  
N => Four Points Small rooms great staff Im often in NYC and usually stay in Midtown  This trip I needed a hotel in ChelseaSoHo area  Most are quite expensive in this trendy area  Searching the web I ran across this hotel and tried it out  First the rates are reasonable but the rooms are very small even for NYC  My first room did not have a bathtub either just a shower  My check in was quite late so the next morning I requested a room change and the staff was very accomodating switching us to another room that was larger but still small  Each room was equipped with Roman shades which do offer privacy but do not block morning sun   so be prepared to be an early riser unless you block it with sheets which is what we ultimately did  Hotel staff is terrific great little bar off the lobby good in hotel restaurant and convenient location for downtownmidtown stay  I would suggest calling the hotel to make a reservation   they were very helpful and suggested several ways to get discounted rates  Bottom line not a ton of amenities and small rooms but a good reasonably priced hotel for the area  
N => Terrible Service Negative Experience I stayed at this hotel for three nights on business  The service at this hotel was exceptionally unfriendly and unpleasant Particularly I had negative experiences with check in room service and phone service  If you are looking to stay here for business I highly advise against it  If you are looking to stay here with your family or partner I highly advise against it if youre looking to have a relaxing and pleasant stay SpecificallyThe room I reserved was not available and I was placed in a different type of room  I wouldnt have minded if the person at the front desk showed any sign of concern or apology but he was so rude and made me feel as though it was my fault that I didnt have my reserved room  He also had a demeanor that suggested quotdont you dare try to protest this quot The following morning my breakfast was scheduled to arrive at am they have a system where you can order breakfast the night before but when I called at am to inquire where my breakfast was the person said they didnt know what time I wanted my breakfast and was told that it would take at least   minutes for the food to be ready  I didnt have time to wait so I went to work without any breakfast  Again if the person showed any sign of concern or apology be a quotwe can get BLANK ready in  minutes if that works for youquot then I wouldnt have minded so much  But the person obviously could care less for my well being I was also getting phone calls to my room and all the people who called me said they had unfriendly and unpleasant interactions with the hotel staff  In fact most calls were directed to my voicemail rather than to my phone even though I was in the room I thought the only good thing about this hotel was its location but there are plenty of other hotels in the area in this price range Please dont stay at this hotel until they improve their service and if you do stay here please kindly help to improve the service at this hotel  
N => be aware of overbooking and confused management We had a prepaid and guaranteed room in the Sheraton since months When we arrived at check in am in the morning the lady at the check in desk told us that we have to move to another hotel for  night cause our prepaid and guaranteed room was given away but that we have to move back to the Sheraton for the nd night I reply that we just have  nights so only  day for New York sightseeing but she was really cool and told us that we can pay the nd night in the other hotel on our own SO WHAT  we had a prepaid room that was guaranteed since months and than thats what they offered us After much discussion it was am and we really like to get a bed for sleeping so we accept or sleep under a bridge The next day we move back to the Sheraton half of our our NY day was lost and our sightseeing was ruined After a new discussion with the Asst  Manager he offered us a full refund for the first night and we should get a letter for this to our room  We never received this refund letter also we asked for  times at the front desk  St check out we asked again for the letter no one knows and much confusion  After  minutrs wait at check out someone came from back office and hand it out to us Bad bad customer service The hotel itself is not too bad designed rooms bit small but ok for a New York mid class hotel Just be awared of overbookings and how the handle it so for that reason i will never go back there  
N => Its an OK place We stayed here on our quotmini honeymoonquot in ust  and although pleasant it was nothing special   if i could id give it a  and a half rating  But ill give them the benefit of the doubt and rate them as a  as ive not stayed elsewhere in NYC so have no point of reference to compare them to Pretty much everything was OK but not great   the only exception to this was the bed which as many have said before is heavenlyLocation is ok far enough away from the major hustle and bustle of the city but be prepared for a   min walk every day to get anywhere or use the subwaytaxis if you want  Were fit and healthy and enjoy walking around new places so we pretty much walked everywhere got the subway a couple of times and took a taxi a few moreWhen we first checked in we were given a twin room rather than a deluxe as booked but this was quickly sorted out  The room was small ish but more than adequate for us the heavenly bed and the large amount of shopping we amassed The bathroom door could have done with a good clean but i put this down to the faux aluminum paint that was used which shows up dirt quite easily rather than a cleanliness problem  The rest of the room was clean and neat and kept that way by housekeeping The room was quiet enough we sleep with earplugs anyway   just a habit picked up from living in a busy city though we overlooked the quotgarden cafequot part of a local bar which on at least one night was noisy enough to hear from the th floor The staff were ok   again i dont know if its just the way New York is but we found the friendliness of the staff quite forced and not genuine at all   it felt like any request we made was a hassle for them   unlike other places in America we have visited where staff have been glad to help Would i stay here again Probably not id want to try another top  rated hotel in NYC so i could compare it 
N => Extremely quiet hotel in central NYC and room exactly like website pictures  We stayed five nights from the th il at the Four Points Sheraton Chelsea and were extremely happy with our stay  I know the city very well after many visits but my other half had not been before so it was great to have such a good base to explore from  We arrived at Midday on the th to drop our bags off expecting that we  have to return later but they allowed us to check into the room straight away much to the delight of the person checking us in  Honestly she seemed happier about the early check in than we did   We had requested in advance a higher floor away from Ice Machines thanks to the good people writing here and got a lovely big room for New York on the th floor  The or is exactly as shown on the    website which we booked through at a rate of  a night plus tax which was great value for this modern room  We had a large television very comfortable bed very nice bathroom and everything seemed new there was certainly enough space so we didnt feel cramped at all I was very happy that there was a free digital in room safe that I have often been charged for elsewhere  The room was so QUIET right in the middle of Manhattan  We could not hear any noise at all from the street or from other rooms which I was particularly pleased about  Let me stress again ask for a higher room so you have a view away form the very noisy ice machines that are on alternating floors book through starwood   to get the cheapest price and you are in for a very nice stay here indeed  
N => Helpful staff and clean but not much else I stayed here since it was close to a business meeting and wanted to be within walking disctance  The lobby is small but well designed and offers a small lounge and restaurant  I had a room on the th floor that stated quotdesignated for Starwood Preferred membersquot  Aside from the sign there didnt appear to be any advantages or services offered that differed from any other floor The room itself although well appointed was very small   even by NYC standards  The quotdoublequot beds are more like twins  There is only limited room service appetizers salads drinks along with breakfast  There was a fair amount of noise from the street all night and the adjacent room doors slam very loudly  I dont recommend getting a room on the street side if youre a light sleeper   unless youre on a very high floor All in all this place is not a bad choice if you need to be in Chelsea but for the money you can find several other relatively close options that offer bigger rooms and more services  
N => Good Value Postage stamp size rooms Mixed impressions of the Sheraton  Our price per night for NYC was outstanding  Location was pretty good only blocks from the subway but since we were there for the Blizzard of  we made a bee line for our destinations and did not spend much time exploring the neighborhood The staff was quite helpful and friendly  We were a bit dissappointed however as we are SPG Gold members and although we were upgraded to a higher floor we were given the smallest room on the floor  If you are given the    room there is a cut out for the service closet and the ice machine  The room was so small we were unable to open the door or armoir without hitting another piece of furniture  Im also convinced it was a queen rather than king bed that was advertised  When we asked one individual we were told they were all exactly the same size and he was unwilling to switch us  If you look on room chart however it was obvious this was a smaller space  That was the only person who was unwilling to do all that he could for us the whole weekend We found the place to be clean but the furniture was worn and chipped probably from having to sidestep your way round the bed  The beds were very comfortable and the shower pressure was good  The bathroom layout offered no counterspace so no place to place electric razors blowdryers or makeup without fearing they would fall into the sink or toilet  We had to ask that the cleaning staff not chat in the hallway near the service closet since the sound through the doors defintitely carried but it never happened again  Walls seemed thick enough though and we heard NO city noise on the upper floors Basically we realized that we would leave at  PM and return at   so we were thrilled to pocket the difference in  another hotel would have set us back  If your are looking for a scene or plan on spending a lot of time in the hotel look elsewhere but this was an alright base for exploring the city  
N => A nice place to stay  Clean comfortable and good location  My son and I stayed there one night for his NYU artistic review at Chelsea Studios which was only one block away from the hotel  We were able to walk to the hotel easily from Penn Station  A front desk recommendation and initialed business card for a nearby restaurant netted us a   discount and the food was excellent Porters  We walked to and back from the Majestic Theatre Phantom of the Opera without trouble  Breakfast was served promptly food was prepared to order and was delicious  Was able to get a free local router wireless internet connection on my laptop while in our room on the th floor  The room was immaculate clean well stocked  Bathroom  shower was adequate but a little small  The two small quotdoublequot beds were a bit smaller than most hotels but were extremely comfortable  We slept great  The hotel staff at front desk lounge bar and restaurant were young and friendly  We would definitely stay here again  
N => Fun in the City My husband and I stayed at thie Four Points for a long weekend  I could tell we were going to enjoy the stay as soon as we walked into the lobby  The staff were friendly and quickly checked us in  The rooms were a ent size for a New York hotel  I loved the bathroom  It looked like it was right out of a pottery barn catalog page  The beds were extremely comfortable  Complimentary water bottle was a plus The location was great  We were able to get anywhere in the city we wanted to within  minutes by foot or subway  Parking was right around the corner  Would stay here again 
N => Fab LocationGreat Value Booked Four Points off Priceline    we were surprised at the great location close to  different train lines amp NJ Path train quick walk to Union Sq Penn Station amp Time Sq  My husband amp I walked from a comedy club on Wrd Street after am   safe amp comfortable walk  They have a really good happy hour and great restaurant  Best of all Wholefoods is on the corner Yes the room is small amp quiet but who goes to NYC to stay in a room The room was comfortable and perfect for sleep  
N => Thought it was great The beds are sooo comfy The rooms are New York small but nicely orated in chocolate tones  You have to walk a little more then staying in Times Square but we expected that  My friend and I go to New York  or  times a year and I would stay here again  
N => Alright I booked this hotel after reading the fantastic reviews on this site but I felt dissapointed First of all the rooms Our room was on the nd floor and let me tell you there was NO view We actually had to shut the blinds The room was lovely orated and beds very comfy but Im a bit alarmed at just reading a previous review about bed bugs cos I was scratching my arm the whole time blaming it on the soap   be just a coincidence Location  I would have rather have been closer to Times Sq I dont mind walking at all and it was only roughly  mins walk from times sq but at night in the freezing cold it felt a lot longer and the fact there are so many roads to cross around and I felt a bit unsafe once you got into the Chelsea district Im not one to complain about hotels but I would have enjoyed my holiday a lot more if it had been more central  
N => Bed Bugs Stood at the four points not too long ago  I absolutly loved the front desk staff  They have to be the best staff I have ever met  The location is great next to everything  The room is small and dark and a little too much money you can stay at the W new york for less but that is somewhat compensated for the service  However there is one serious problem that will cause me to unfortunatly never stay there again During my stay I noticed  sets of matresses outside of the hotel wrapped in sheets  Out of my own curiosity I ided to take a peek and see why these mattress were being tossed  To my surprise they were infested with bed bug droppings it was ABSOLUTLY DISGUSTING I immediatly went back to my room to inspect my bed thankfully there were no bugs in my bed  The discovery of this led me to not have a very good nights sleep  So word to the wise CHECK YOUR BED Dont let the bed bugs bite 
N => Great service Having read other reviews on trip advisor I ided to book a couple of nights at the Four Points  Unfortunately on arrival I was told that the hotel was still fully booked and that I would have to be transferred to another hotel  Normally this would not be good news but I was transferred to the Roosevelt at no extra cost cab fares paid both ways and also given a full refund for the night I missed at the four points On arrival the next day I was especially looked after by Melissa on reception who put me in a great room on the th floor room   The high speed internet connection was free first time ever for me in a NY hotel and you even got a complementary bottle of waterAlthough the location is not the best in NY its very central location and a quick cab ride to time square or a short walk to Broadway Greenwich Village etc Ill definitely book it again  
N => Would definitely recommend it I stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Chelsea with a friend for a week during Easter   We really enjoyed our stay The staff was really helpful in a professional but casual way friendly  They gladly gave us recommendations on restaurants and shops etc and always greeted us with a smile  We loved our room which was quite small but very modern and clean amp cool with a brown colour range very cosy and situated on a high floor with a great view  The beds were really wonderful Also I had brought my laptop and the internet access worked smoothlyThe hotel was being partly refurbished during our stay so the restaurant was not that great at the time but I suppose it is much better now  We hung out in the hotel bar next to the lobby for a while and it was small but nice  Also with a modern urban feel to it  The shared areas lobby bar etc were a bit small but on the other hand all of hip NY was within walking distance We really loved the location in Chelsea which was close to all the cool places we wanted to go to  The street was a bit dark and quotnot happeningquot but that also made it calm which was good  We felt completely safe and right in the middle of things  We walked each morning to have breakfast at a diner which I found redommended on this site Malibu I think it was called  Just a couple of blocks away perfect No fuss and not too expensive I would gladly stay at this hotel again   its totally worth the price And I would definitely recommend the place to anyone especially if you are a couple of friends travelling without children  
N => Loved the Four Points by Sheraton Chelsea I put my relatives up at The Four Points by Sheraton Chelsea last weekend and we were all truly surprised  We got a great internet rate through the Starwood Hotel website  Yes the room was small but very nicely orated and comfortable  The brown interior comfortable bed with luxurious bedding and pillows plus the egronomic desk chair was a pleasant surprise  You usually dont find beautifully orated interiors unless you are staying at the super upscale places  I called to let the front desk know that they wouldnt arrive at the hotel until  am so that they would hold the room until they landed after midnight  Everything was great  They were so happy that the lounge downstairs was still open and they got to relax after they checked in  It was easy to get from the lobby to the elevator and up to your room without having to walk through a casino lobby  Plus there are so many great restaurants and Whole Foods is just around the corner  We will always recommend this hotel to all our NYC visitors 
N => Very warm atmosphere and frienly service     Highly Recommended I was vacationing in New York over Memorial Day weekend in  and I have to say we could not have picked a better hotel  My friend I was traveling with booked our reservation on priceline and we ended up paying around night  Yes the rooms were a little small but for as long as we spent in the room it was enough for us  We did not require room service so Ill leave that out of my review but the front desk service was impeccable  On our last day we talked to Melissa at the front desk and she recommended a great Chinese restaurant not far from the hotel  The warm rich colors of the room were very condusive to a few hours nap in between the long days of sightseeing in the quotCity That Never Sleepsquot and the bed was very comfortable almost felt like I was sleeping at home in my own bed  I would recommend the hotel to anyone that asked for a hotel in the Chelsea District amongst a very prominent homosexual community  Or to anyone for that matter   Points gets  Stars in my book 
N => Caused Cash Problems Nice hotel good location  However when I checked in on a Friday I used my debit card  My account was charged but the hotels computer system did not register it  My account could not be fixed until Monday after I had returned home  Net net I did not have access to more than   of my money that I planned to use that weekend  Following up through the quotcontact usquot areas on the company web pages my eventual answer was quotIm sorryquot and they closed their file  There was no offer of any recompense for my distress  I do intend to continue to follow up with their management  
N => Gave our room away We had reservations at the Chelsea Sheraton  Upon arrival we were informed that our room was not available because the previous occupants didnt check out  What are reservations for The staff was unprofessional in both attire and attitude  The rates were also high for a lobby that was a dump  
N => Great place  Dont be afraid to ask  
N => A great Find  
N => Rooms too small  
N => More botique feel than chain  I was a bit hesitant to book at this location the first time I was in NYC but on my second trip there I knew the area fairly well so I went for it  And it was MUCH better than the other Sheraton property we stayed in by Midtown by a large gin  Having taken the redeye I was expecting to drop my bags off and roam the streets until check in but as luck would have it a room was available so I was able to take a short nap shower and then head out into the city  Im sure this is a your mileage  vary sort of situation but it was nonetheless a great start  The staff at check in was excellent The rooms well appointed and fairly new  The bathroom resembled something youd see more in a higher star establishment  The best part by far was the shower Can you say pressure It was like a fire hose  The bed was comfortable and overall the room felt very clean  There is also free wi fi throughout the hotel Each time I had a question for the front desk staff I was greeted with a friendly smile and a very authentic desire to help me out with advice and information On my last morning there I ided to eat in the hotel restaurant and the food was pretty good  The service was excellent and the host that was there that morning was fantastic I forgot to mention the location  Its sort of on the edge of Soho so you did need to walk a little bit to get to the center but theres lots to do around a couple of blocks  You also just need to walk about  blocks to get to Prince Street and eventually Broadway  So you essentially have the ability to get to  different main subway lines fairly quickly Ill definitely stay here again on my next trip  
N => Exceeded expectations I was worried about the location of this hotel after I booked it  Turned out to be a great location   only  blocks from subway and close to several restaurants  The service was great the rooms were super clean and comfortable   a tad small but everything we needed   especially the starbucks coffee  We were traveling with teenage girls who LOVED their room on the th floor  Our room was on the st floor with a view looking south  I had read other reviews saying the desk staff was not very accommodating and the elevators take forever  We experienced exactly the opposite  We would stay here again  Its nice not to be in the middle of all the crowds in Times Square and using the subway was quick and easy  
N => Amazing hotel stay here We stayed here in room   It was Amazing  We had a view of the Empire State Building free Wifi massive comfortable bed   my wife wanted to take it back to London with us Its just around the corner from Prince and Spring Streets a really short walk to Greenwich village it was a perfect base to explore Manhattan we would certainly stay here again  
N => Several Minor Issues This place appears to be a trendy boutique like hotel with the Sheraton name  In general I would describe my stay as only quotOKquot as we did have several minor issues  For example housekeeping service was inconsistent  When we arrived there was no shampoo in the bathroom  We were able to get some from the reception desk downstairs  On the second day we did not receive our free bottle of water  There were signs of mildew at the bottom of our shower stall  You could also tell that the carpet area by the front doorway had not been vacuumed recently based on the dust collection Other complaints about the room There were at least mosquitos living in the room and unfortunately I got bitten by one of them  The air conditioner was loud and noisy  The pillows had no more fluff in them On the positive side there was free wifi the hotel was located near a subway station  Note that it is on the edge of Soho   not in the middle of the neighbourhood I would probably try another hotel first before coming back to this one  
N => good experience it was good   staff was good hotel was clean location was awesome and the food was really good need a bigger bathroom 
N => Good Time   Nice Location   ent Price As the title says we had a good time exploring the city using this hotel as our base  The price was ent considering NYC just about a block to a subway stop within a short walking distance to many restaurants   a variety but heavily weighted towards Italian Hotel was clean and comfortable  Breakfast was pricey and eventhough I did not order anything high end with coffee and tip it was typically   Would recommend Dunkin Donuts or Dizzy Izzys just round the corner Front desk was helpful with directions restaurants etc Would stay again if I went back but due to all the high prices there and the sites that I have seen I am good for another few ades   this was my first trip to NYC     
N => Great price great hotel ok staff    GREAT experience We got a great price on this hotel at  total for  nights  Just like several reviews said the rooms were pretty small but they werent tiny  The TV with HD was a great edition especially for us to watch the NBA playoffs  The bed was fabuous   king size and VERY comfortable  Housekeeping was great to us  Very professional  The hotel was just very clean and nice looking when we walked in  Bathroom had a unique design and my girlfriend loved the tile shower  If I had one complaint was that there was one woman at the front desk who was a little rude  Everyone else was great and very helpful to our questions  I read some who thought this was a bad area  I COMPLETELY disagree  I thought the location was great  Not too busy   one block from the subway   the view did have a lot of construction in it but you could overlook the Hudson  I just thought our entire experience of this hotel was great  
N => Exceptional In addition to it being about a three minute walk from my client the rooms were beautiful and clean  The staff was all on some kind of mood elevator  The bar was tight  Really small  But great selections of beers  And a quick walk to the subway No question but that Ill return  
N => Great hotel Spent six nights in this hotel over Easter  The staff were very friendly and accommodating from check in until we left  Our room had fairly good view the bed was comfortable and the walk in shower was big but not as powerful as I thought it  be  a very minor quibble Location wise   I was really pleased to be able to walk to great barsbistro s and restaurants  We didn t have breakfast in the hotel but there was an OK bagel place  minutes away we tried a couple of times also went to Balthazar for a blow out breakfast on our first morning Lots of places in Soho to eat  The hotel bar is tiny but there are loads of places near by to drink or one night we took our nightcap up to the roomThe subway stop was only one block away which was handy Would I stay there again  Can t wait 
N => Great Service Clean Hotel  My family recently stayed at this Sheraton in NYC as we had to make last minute plans to attend a funeral  From check in to check out my partner our kids and myself were treated exceptionally well  We were offered water bottles at checkin as there was a slight delay  Then once the staff knew we were there for a funeral they offered and sent our room two orders of apple pie ala mode  The kids loved it Our room was clean amp neat  Beds were very comfortable  We needed extra towels with two teenagers and they were given to us right away  The staff was also very helpful with directions  I would definitely stay here again and our dhter is already asking about coming back to stay here and shop in NYC  Thanks 
N => close to lots of shopping After spending  nights in midtown to see the New Years Eve festivities we were happy to retreat to SOHO The hotel staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient  We have no complaints   this is a basic clean comfortable and well designed hotel  It is very close to the subway station train    Houston St The location is  blocks away from tons of shopping   from upscale designers to the Canal St craziness  We walked from the hotel through SOHO Little Italy and the West Village in FREEZING temps  We would stay there again   in fact   we would like to have more time in this area to really explore it  
N => Don t stay there Very far away from the American service reputation I stayed there for three nights after a huge business project  days earlier I stayed at the W Tuscany Hotel i NYC   everything there was  star to the price of  stars  When I arrived at Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan SoHo Village   instead of noticing that I was actually standing on the other side of the reception desk   three receptionists where to busy quotworkingquot even though I where the only guest in the lobby instead of seeing me I changed rooms after the first night since it was a terribele noice from the bathroom fan that kept me from sleeping  When moving   I forgot some cloths in the room  I talked to FIVE different persons the first four promised to get back to me within a minute or five and waited for  hrs before anyone got back to me with a message that my cloths where still in the room    And brought them to me When returning to the airport   the hotel didn t have any contract with any of the shuttle companies and therefore couldn t make any reservations for such a transportation Instead they suggested a limou with such a high price that my client refused to pay for it  They had never heard of anything that expensive before  So instead of helping they charged me far abowe any normal tarifs If you are going to NYC   Choose the W Tuscany instead and they will make you warm inside from the moment you reach the entrance until your departure  They are REALLT excellentMost hotels send you a survey after departure Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan SoHo Village didn t  If they had showed some instrest in my opions by sending it   I wouldnt have written this review  But hopefully they read it here and can correct their lack of service for future guests  
N => Un buon hotel per  stellema rumoroso  
N => OK but Not Great Stayed for three nights  Got a really good deal through Hotwire so cant really complain  Tiny room with no housekeeping  Wireless never worked despite several requests to front desk  Local friends tried to telelphone three times and were told we werent registered which messed up plans to meet  Bathroom was great beds were comfy and location cant be beat  All in all a good deal but would try for something smaller and with a friendlier staff next time  
N => Only OK We stayed here for three nights   th  The room was clean granted but very small even for NYC standards  I have been in NYC x before at three different hotels and all were much roomier  The maid service was poor   staff threw out receipts left neatly stacked on the night stand and did not replace the plastic glasses  The bathroom was very tiny  Great for a one person stay but definitely not more then  per room  Very close to everything  The Bus terminal was very handy as direct transport to the Bruce Springsteen concert at Giants Stadium in NJ was from there  Did not feel unsafe at all getting tofrom the hotel  Staff were generally friendly but seemed like they were spaced out most of the time and did not know answers to basic questions  The best rate we fund was for ngt and the only reason we stayed here was for a fee night offered to us by SPG  
N => Awesome Place for an AWESOME Price We also got in on the opening rate through travelzoo for    We loved our room  We were on our first trip to New York and everything so great Yes the port authority was acrossed the street but it was the back side of the building and no people   Yes there was an adult dvd store but there was on many streets we walked down  There was also a parole building but only one time when we walked passed it was it even opened  So I do believe all the complaints are truly from people who just like to complain  We loved the proximity to everything  We loved News York We were amazed by all the things to see and the closeness of the subway and Times Square  Not far from the theatres and it was great  We had never seen hotels built so tall and skinny  All the staff was so helpful and we really eciate all their help  They were all so willing  So we are totally going to recommend this place to stay  Our room was on the th floor and we were just above the port authority and we loved everything  It really was a great room and an awesome price  Thanks travelzoo for offering it Room was really clean  beds were really comfy and so were pillows Everything was new and really nice  Elevators were fast  We really had a great experience  Our friends who went with us were on the th floor to the back of the building and they loved their room tooThey had a handicap accessible room and it was clean and nice  We were also left  water bottle in our room when we arrived  But the next day we were given  bottles Thanks Four points for the wonderful stay and we will someday make our way back to the big city Big difference from the rural town we are from  Little Italy was so cool as was China town  We went to the yankees game where Jeter tied with Gherig  We went on a cruise to see the sites of the city and it was awesome  Went down wall street and through central park  There was so much more we could have seen just not enough time Loved it all and will be back 
N => Would stay here again without question After reading several reviews I was really worried about staying here with my senior citizen mother  There was nothing to worry about  Yes the street had XXX Dvd stores on it and a Parole Center which was only open during the day on it but I saw those types of things everywhere in New York  Very close to TImes Square  Great Price  Only complaint was we tried to go to the resturant in the hotel and could not get service  There were busy so that was really not a big deal  Alex got us a private car to take us to the airport and was really helpful  We came home afterdark one evening around  from a night tour and didnt feel the least bit scared walking down the street  
N => Very Nice hotel dont listen to the bad reviews        Contrary to a lot of other people we really liked this hotel  Pros  location close to  avenue and  blocks away from Times Square  price paid   intro rate excellent  room not too small  double beds  GREAT COMFY bed WOW  nice staff allowed early check in  good restaurant onsite Cons  XXX shops down the street  probation office next door Explanations  The XXX shops are nearby but they were all over Manhattan as were homeless people and liquor stores  The probation ofice was so non descript that I didnt know what it was until coming home and reading about it on other peoples reviews  It must have closed by  or  pm as I didnt see anyone near it after the dinnerhour  Face it youre going to New York it is going to look smell and appear exactly as New York  does  Im happy to have stayed in Manhattan for under  night  To have done it at a new hotel and to be close to Times Square was a bonus When I travel to New York and want more space and peaceful surroundings I stay in Secaucus New Jersey  That  be a more suitable alternative for some people  Our  year old wasnt scared or phased his only comment was quottheres a lot of hobos herequot which was a reference to NYC in general  We also have a lot of homeless in Toronto as unfortunately a lot of larger cities do  Go to the Four Points and enjoy 
N => Good hotel   street kind of scary We always winced a bit when walking back to the hotel after dark   walking by the NY Probation Department fortress NEXT door did not help  Hotel was very nice inside staff were good  Location was good  
N => Stay away My husband and I will NEVER stay here again This was our ten year anniversary  We had a horrible view of a pigeon poop stained building and right across the street from the port Authority transit building  The staff was completely incompetent  They charged our room to the wrong credit card  I gave them a card for quotincidentalsquot and was assured the charge would come off in a few days  Two times I went to the front desk and questioned them about this  They never looked up my information the inexperienced staff assured me both times the charges would be released  They acted like new freshman high school kids not knowing what to say  The money never came off I called later she told me it had been released  So I called the bank      no So I called back and find out they charged almost my entire room to the quotincidentalsquot card  When you give your credit cards to a hotel complete strangers you expect them to be professional accurate and to know what they are doing I am trying to keep track of my money on this trip I am very unhappy with this place  It is cheaper for a reason  Its not about which card it went on   its the principle  They lied and never checked then they lied a second time and never checked   or were just stupid  Also porn shops right next door and nasty liquor shops  
N => Newer hotel with night construction Hotel staff was friendly and the hotel was new and comfortable  The neighborhood was sketchy with adult stores and a parole building close by  We got a good nightly rate of night  However there was night time construction across the street       needless to say we did not sleep well of course the hotel did not prewarn  Those who like a nice sleep    please be careful Room service was questionable 
N => Good deal for Times Square My boyfriend got the opening offer of getting a room for  per night  When I first came here to read the reviews about the hotel I thought it would be located in a very sketchy area and that I would be freaking out if we were going back to the hotel really late  When we first arrived at the Port Authority bus terminal we must say that it is amazing as it is only across not even  minute of walking  The area does look sketchy with tons of adult shops but its somehow safe  We stayed there for  nights and every night when we were walking back to the hotel there are cops at the corner of th Avenue and th Street  So we did not feel unsafe at all  Only  avenue away from Times Square and you have subway stations all close to the hotel  Cant complain much  To us it was like normal NYC  I wouldnt know how it would feel like if I went with a bunch of girlfriends only but I think as long as were at least two people together it would be fine The room was a bit tiny and I was seeing spider web behind the bathroom door  The carpet in the room was a bit weird we havent noticed it until the last day when the sofa was pulled a bit away from the wall  But its nothing major  The king size bed was amazing  Havent really tried the wireless but the two computers provided by the hotel at the lobby were really slow  The iHome dock in our room was working fine  No view as we were staying on the rd floor due to early check in  We didnt want to wait until pm  The AC was somehow really really loud  At some point we did find the AC a bit annoying  But whatever again nothing major  We havent tried the restaurant at the lobby and didnt have the chance to go get a drink at the bar although we were offered a  for  drink when we checked in  Apparently it is opened until pm if I remember well  
N => Very clean but area surrounding the hotel is a bit shady Although we had trouble with our reservation at first all was taken care of by a very nice gentleman at the front desk  We were allowed to check in early which was a bonus as we were headed to a  pm Broadway show all of them are walking distance from this hotel The hotel was new clean and well appointed  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was bigger than others we have seen in NYC We had a very nice view from our room The area in and around the hotel was a bit quotshadyquot after dark however we did not feel too uncomfortable walking around  Still it needs a clean upOverall I would recommend this hotel if you can get it at a good price which we did  introductory rate  
N => Beware of Booking online We booked the hotel last minute the night before our arrival through booking com  We also called the hotel directly to confirm that they had rooms available and were told if we could book it online then there were rooms available  When we arrived at the hotel we were told that they did not have rooms for us and so we were stuck in NY with all our luggage and a  year old in tow  At first they told us that the booking was for ober th not ust the day we arrived  When we produced the booking confirmation the staff changed their story and told us that they had tried to call us that morning we had no way of confirming this as we had been travelling to the hotel  On a arate note I would be wary of staying in this location again especially with young children  The hotel was surrounded on both sides by quotadultquot stores and there were lots of seedy characters hanging around even for NY 
N => Good value clean hotel Hotel is good value with travelzoo promotion  Was very clean  Bar was not open at beginning of y  Location is not as bad as reviews suggest  Very close to subway and Times Square  
N => Needs more time to get into shape VERy sketchy area even in broad daylightFor value  intro rate was on line and heard about it on the elevatorspent more on cabs and had to walk to front of Port Authority to grab one none came down narrow street  Nice beds and clean since brand new  Housekeeping inconsistent  No security no doorman front desk staff confused and unhelpful  different   soaps towels coffee cups in room each day   elevators service entire  floors with  rooms on each  Took  minutes  day to get down  I suggest walk if on lower floors  Bill upon checkout was only plus  Felt unsafe going to basement to get ice  
N => Mixed Feelings I really have mixed feelings in regards to this hotel  I was fortunate enough to get the room at  per night with the Travelzoo promotions which makes it a nice deal for the price  However if I would have paid more for the room I think I would have regretted not going elsewhere  When I booked this room online it had recently opened and there were no reviews  Shortly after booking the reviews started coming in there seemed to be a concern in regards to the location  I called the hotel due to the reviews I was reading through our phone call the lady said that she put a block on my room and upgraded the room to the spg floor and a better view  When we arrived at the hotel the rooms were not ready so they offered to hold our luggage for us  I mentioned to the lady about the assurance of this upgrade the girl acknowledged this agreement  However when we were able to check in we were put on a lower floor overlooking the bus terminal  I mentioned this to the hotel personnel and was first told that there were no rooms available then I was told that a room was available a couple of floors higher up then I was told that since I got the promotional rate through Travelzoo and others having a higher tier of spg points that others were given priority  The part that really bothers me is that I was promised one thing then they failed to deliver  On the nd day of our trip we came back to the room later in the evening and were surprised to see that the bed was not done nor the room cleaned clean towels were left in the bathroom  The hotel was clean most of the employees were courteous the room was large enough for what we needed it for  The location isnt the best in the world and I would not recommend it as a place to stay for families with children or females traveling alone  I did notice that they have video stores in many areas even around some of the   star hotels  
N => Definitely not family friendly We booked two rooms in e   On line I requested a crib which never arrived  The first night there was no hot water for our showers the second there was no water pressure  They also forgot to mention the State of NY Parole Division was next door not a pretty view  The rooms were ok but there was barely any room to walk  To close our stay there was no staff available at check out to help bring luggage down  We were told to come down to the lobby and get the cart ourselves  As we were checking out there was another unsatisfied family loudly expressing their concerns to the front desk staff  
N => Good deal in NYC Found a openning special as a SPG member  Paid night  taxes  Room was ready upon arrival noon  Asked for a room that had a view of the Hudson River  Not a problem  Room was on Oth floor  Watched fireworks from the room  Nice room  Excellent king bed with good linens  Bathroom was small  but functional  Asked for extra towels which were delivered promptly  Free bottled water was included  Room was behind the elevator but was quiet  Room darkening shades worked well  Safe in the room coffeemaker with supplies an ipod docking radio and an HD tv  Everything was good except the airconditioner  It worked well but was noisy  I had earplugs which I used   slept well  I would stay there again if the price was right  The seedy streetlife is just New York  Homeless people are in all parts of the city  Just ignore  I felt safe  The hotel has a restaurant which I did not try  Nearby is Lennys and the Westway Diner   Both on th at rd  Good food and cheap  
N => Great deal in Times Square This hotel was fantastic  My husband and I were going to NYC to attend the U S  Open Golf tournament out on Long Island  We found this hotel from a hotel special email we received as we are Starwood members  We booked it immediately figuring that with it being brand new we couldnt go wrong  We were right  The hotel is very nice  The staff was very friendly and accommodating  The block that it is on is definitely a side street in a big city dingy nothing pretty but certainly not dangerous  We dont typically stay in Times Square when we go to NYC but particularly with wanting to be near the train station to go to Long Island the location was perfect  Its a brand new hotel so even though they said the hotel was up and running it was hard to tell but it didnt matter as we didnt need a restaurant in the hotel  It looks as though a cute little bar area is about to open in the lobby area of the hotel  With the prices that they have been offering this will definitely become a NYC staple for us  It suited our needs perfectly 
N => Disappointment I had high expectations for this hotel given its reputation and was really wowed by the architecture upon entering  Things went mostly downhill from there  The staff lacked the warmth and willingness to assist I would expect from a Four Seasons  This was obvious from the moment we checked in but got worse when we notified the front desk that we had no hot water  They said they would flip a switch and get the hot water running but that did not happen  When we called again they finally sent a repairman rather than simply send us to a room that had hot water  He still did not get it fixed  After calling one more time and getting blown off we just shivered for the rest of our visit it was snowing outside  Smaller issues but ones that I would not expect at this hotel dirty dishes stacked up and abandoned on a tray next to us at the restaurant a  minute wait for room service to bring granola and coffee with no explanation offered  The room is big by NY standards and of course the location is great but St  Regis and Ritz Carlton are far superior in terms of the appointment of the rooms and service in this area  
N => First Rate but pricey Very comfortable luxurious rooms  Not fancy but extremely well appointed a comfortable  Prices a bit silly especially for food and beverage but this is the top of the heap in New York  
N => new york new york great location  Close to central park  Close to shopping  A quick taxi to time square  Rooms are clean and roomy  staff was very nice  Be prepared for the cost of drinks and food  
N => Fantastic location fantastic staff fantastic hotel I arrived at the hotel extreamly early am  Thinking I would have to leave my luggage and see New York before getting into my room  But I was wrong  Upon arrival I was greeted by a Doorman who had my luggage taken away and walked me to the Front Desk  Once I gave my name that was it nothing else was needed  Due to my time of arrival my room was still occupied but they were kind enough to upgrade me to a beautiful room   This room had a balcony which for New York is rare huge walk in closet  The bathroom was just splendid  Internet was dead cheap either  or  for h cant quite remember  But the connection was fast  The cleanliness was   All staff that I came across where nothing but polite and welcoming  To the point where I even had the pleasure of meeting Mr  Sharpe Founder amp CEO of Four Seasons himself at the front desk The only down fall and its just a small thing during room service I ordered the Lobster Spagetti which to be honest the Lobster tasted as if it had been frozen  Very Chewy and hard to get through  But everything else and my whole stay in New York was such a blast this didnt bother me  
N => Bare Feet in the Restaurant Well normally eating breakfast in the FSH is a great experience but apparently their dress codes have changed  This morning    Sunday ember      four of us sat right next to a guy with an ugly shirt wrinkled pants AND BARE FEET  Yes you read that right  he did not come to the restaurant with shoes and then take them off he came into the restaurant with no shoes and spread out across the floor so everyone could enjoy his feet  NO ONE AT THE RESTAURANT SAID A THING TO HIM    NOT THE CUSTOMERS    ITS NOT THEIR JOB    BUT NONE OF THE STAFF OR MANAGEMENT EVEN APPROACHED HIM  As I left I told one of the staff that I was waiting for shirtless Sundays  Really really bad form for a  breakfast  Guess The Four Seasons really needs the business  
N => Not Great  Really poor for this normally excellent chain of hotels  Rooms although big are uncomfortable and you can hear everything in the hallways  Rude reception staff I was obviously not a big enough mover or shaker for them  I will not return far more better hotels to stay in  
N => Save Your Money Not Worth It I stayed at the Four Seasons in New York for  nights and all I can say is    Dont ever stay here  I thought it was the worst Four Seasons and Worst hotel I had ever stayed in  My room was spacious but dirty the wood lamp in the room was peeling and cracked there was a paste substance that I did not know where it came from were in the cracks of the sofa  The management was not any help  They offered a small discount but for the price I paid which was  a night was not at the least worth it  The staff were not helpful  All they did was merely apologize and that was it  The lobby was nice and clean and the food was ent but dont judge a book by its cover on this hotel  
N => Will never go back We just returned from a two day stay at the Four Seasons in Manhatton  It was the worst  star hotel experience I have ever had  I would not stay there again if the room was free Upon arriving to our room we discovered we did not have the room we reserved  We called the manager and he said it was a nice room  I told him it was not a nice room and it was certainly not the room we had requested or had been promised  It was a small room called a suite  The living room dining room and bedroom were all in one common space  And that common space was not very big  This room cost  a night When we asked for the room we had specifically reserved we were told the room was not available   it had been given to someone else  However like a used car salesman the manager said that we could have a room sort of like we had reserved for an additional  per night  I have never felt so violated in my life  Shame on the Four Seasons That was a bad start but it got much worse  It was about  degrees outside  We noticed it was very hot in our room and reported it to the front desk  They said not problem we will fix it  By bedtime on our first night it was  degress in our room and we did not sleep much at all  The next morning we reported the problem three times before we left for the day just so there was no confusion about the problem  We returned to our room at  PM that evening only to find the room was  degress again  We called the manager who said quotthat was corrected earlierquot  At that time I asked that he please come to our room to see this for himself  He did and was appalled about the AC not working  Somewhere around  PM our air conditioner was working  We had a  AM filght the next day so this was not much fun  Aslo by this time we also discovered that housekeeping had not cleaned our coffee pot day old filter and coffee were still in the coffee maker  And housekeeping had neglected to leave a single wastecan  Our simple requests for plenty of extra water was ignored each day There were several other things wrong but it would take me a hour to explain the experiece I think that since there is new ownership they are trying to cut corners at the expense of their customers  They also seem to be falling all over themselves to accomodate foreign customers which is fine  I am an American and will not stay at a hotel that doesnt appreciate domestic travelers I will never stay at a Four Seasons again certainly not in NY  They are very overpriced and dont deliver the service that justifys their price tag Gary W  
N => One night is not enough     I wish we could stay longer but living in NYC and staying in hotels is something we do only after were not in any condition to hail a cab after dinner hotels LAtelier de Joel Robuchon is exceptional  DEverything from the check in to the room service to a few concierge assignments was flawless  Our room a corner City View Tower Room was spacious for one night but wed probably prefer something a tad bigger if we were staying an extra few nights  It was spotless and very bright with UES views from its th floor  As always everything requested during our stay was delivered instantly and I dont have anything negative to add or even anything to suggest to make the place better  I doubt well ever get to experience the NYC location for more than one night thats when itd be possible to review the property a bit better but as it stands right now our stay was perfect  
N => Fantastic as always      As usual we stayed at The Four Seasons on our way back to The Hamptons  Great service as always but what really made our stay special was that they helped us find a quotspecial protection companyquot while we were here in NYC to help us get around  The company worked seamlessly with the hotel in catering to our special protective needs  Since my chauffer  bodyguard was unavailable that weekend due to a family situation  I dont like to travel wo protection for my family  So they contacted a company called quotVerdad Investigations amp Protection Inc quot  Apparently they have used them before as evidenced by their professional services  We dealt with a wonderful man named Sean Noonan Executive VP of Verdad  He was attentive to our needs and quite frankly we would use their services again while we were in NYC  The hotel even worked directly with him and the concierge services  A great experience as always    Preston 
N => Poor service   especially given the price Staff didnt even know that there are two breakfast locations We made reservations to meet friends  We asked where breakfast was served Told only one place but they had no reservation  Meanwhile our friends were waiting at the second location   where there was a reservation under our name At the exhorbitant prices the Four Seasons charges the staff should be more knowledgeable and better trained and when our reservation didnt show up it should have been suggested that there was an alternative location And despite my leaving my phone number no manager has called to explain this embarassing snafu  The Four Seasons prides itself on superior service but failed miserably And no the breakfast wasnt as good as it used to be either  
N => Luxurious Break but not for my wallet Yet again a lovely weekend wearing my corporate wife hat  Im trying to sleep my way around the Four Seasons chain   a girl has to have ambition NB Same husband at each hotel though We had a corner room on st floor   lots of room but not much furniture  Felt a bit empty at first but got used to the space after a while  Bed wonderfully comfortable comfy sofa and tables desk etc   although there were a few worn patches on the sofa tut tut S   less than perfection Being a typical Brit I was desperate for tea in the morning  No in room facilities and   for a cuppa    I was twitching when I flew back The bathrooom   how fabulous Big deep bath   filled in  seconds  Lovely soap amp stuff sorry guys kept pinching it each night so I had lots to take home  Big wonderful shower  Fluffy fluffy towels  I know its irresponsible but I had a bath every evningStaff were soo friendly  Breakfast wonderful but not cheap with emphasis on quality not quality  But when will American hotels get the hang of making teaTried out the spa told you I was playing corporate wife   very pleasant surroundings friendly staff but a bit  even for a LondonerConvenient location   Im not a great shopper but if thats your thing youll love the S  Easy to wander to Central Park for a bit of greenery or down to the museums Would happily return   and even pay for it myself 
N => Winter wonderland This really is a fantastic hotel  We were upgraded on arrival thanks and our room was absolutely huge  Previous stays in NYC have generally involved tiny rooms but not this time  Saying that it is eye wateringly expensive  One grumble  When ordering a cheese and tomato omlette for breakfast I would have thought that they could source a better cheese than quotSqueeze Cheesequot  Yurgh  One final thing the concierge was a master 
N => Absolutely Fantastic Hotel This hotel was by the far the most beautiful hotel we have every stayed in What a fantastic property Our room was incredibly comfortable clean amp orated with great taste  The closet leading the bathroom was a spacious bonus  We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel amp would highly recommend it to anyone coming to NYC They were very helpful booking us for dinners at area restaurants amp providing transportation to a Broadway show We will definitely stay here again 
N => Very good property My wife and I just spent two nights at this property  We are not regular travellers to NY so have little basis for comparison to other hotels in the city  That being said I do understand that most hotel rooms are not particularly large  Our room was a very comfortable  sq ft  which was spacious in all areas  Bath products were Bulgari which my wife appreciated  The room was attractive and well appointed   nothing was missing The concierge desk was superb   exceptionally professional and well informed  They were really top notch  You can tell that the staff is very well trained  The workout facilities although in the basement of the hotel were well appointed  Free juices and fruit were available  I also took note of the extensive security that the hotel maintained  I was suprised in a positive way that an employee was positioned in the evening to check any person accessing the elevators  While perhaps not necessary it was reassuring We only ate at the hotel once  The food at breakfast was excellent along with a similar quality of service  While not someone unaccustomed to expensive prices I was taken aback by the  charge for coffee  While   for eggs does not surprise me the coffee charge did Anyhow it is obviously a hotel that caters to its guests and is very responsive to all of their needs  You do pay for this level of attention to detail  It is by any standard an excellent hotel  
N => Fabulous Time at the Four Seasons Our Family just returned from an exceptional weekend in New York thanks in large part to the Four Seasons Hotel  We booked the Kids for all Seasons Package which is two adjoining rooms  Children aged    From the moment we arrived the kids were welcomed and treated wonderfully  They were given a small gift each and then treated to cupcakes and cokes in their room which I can tell you won them over on the spot On a service level we were given top notch service from everyone at the hotel  The people at the concierge handled all of our transfers and requests for driver and car as well as recommending nearby family friendly restaurants  We were driven twice by the hotel house cars once each in the bach and Rolls Royce  The door men were excellent  Every little need or request was addressed immediately from pressing to bandaid requests to room service etc    each time someone responded immediately  Yes this level of service is expected at these prices but in our case they did deliverThe location was fantastic for shopping as well as proximity to sight seeing FAO Schwartz Central Park Our rooms were very spacious for New York standards and extremely well appointed  We had a surplus of closet and drawer space the washrooms were incredible  No noise concerns and we were only on the th floor  I did not find the or boring or drab as other reviews have stated I felt it was elegant and luxurious in an understated way Let us not forget this is Manhattan not Hawaii  I wasnt expecting the same or and atmosphere as a Four Seasons quotResortquot  I felt the entire hotel was well suited to a stay in Manhattan and representative of the Manhattan we wanted our children to experience and remember Unfortunately there were some crotchety folks who were cranky with the children for no apparant reason  We turned those into teachable moments for us to share with the kids that sometimes its the adults who are badly behaved not the children If you want a flawless stress free place to stay in a serene atmosphere where you dont have to do all the planning and scheduling   you wont be disappointed  
N => Wow what a place Thursday to Sunday in the FSNY was perfect  No kids to drive us mad a stunning room on the th floor with dual aspect windows meant  different views and glorious weather the hotel had nothing to do with the weather  We did start at the th floor but after a polite request the front desk happily changed our room to a higher floor  Rodman at the Concierge was a god   pure genius  He guided us round the shops the sights amp the restaurants and seemed to know exactly what we wanted when we wanted it  If I was to pick any bones it would be the price of  hot chocolates at bedtime my wifes regular hotel request but at over   it seemed a little steep  In fact it took  hours for anyone to remove the tray from our room  Both my wife amp i had Spa treatments and desipte the price they were both excellent Overall I rate this hotel experience as one of my most enjoyable  New York has a special vibe about it and the location the style amp the class of the FSNY made this a perfect place to stay 
N => Still a Ritz fan       I begin by saying there is no doubt this is a wonderful Four Seasons and my stay there in no way diminished our vacation experience  However in that we like to stay at different places in the city from time to time we chose this over either of the Ritz properties in NYCity so as to try something different  We booked a two bedroom suite and much attention was given to our arrival before the trip by a member of the staff  However litte of what we discussed with her regarding requests was prepared upon check in  I requested a rollaway in the LR for my  year old dhter be made up and in place upon our arrival  It was not  I had asked that it be made up just like the beds in the rooms    it never was  SHE asked the ages of our children so she could have age appropriate welcome gifts  We told her they were quotchildrenquot in their s but Beanie Babies were still given  In more than one email correspondence my husband told her we were travelling with our son and dauhghter in law but we were given one BR with a king and one BR with two twins  They claimed they were under the impression that we had three small children in tow  And of course they were fully booked and this was all they had available  Each morning our room service order was just a little bit off  One pot of coffee instead of the two that were ordered missing orders of eggs just little things but still irritating considering what we were spending  As to the quality and appearance of the room    nothing to shout about  Mini Butler in the LR had a broken door  or was as it was advertised and presented but nothing to jump and down about   bland boring  Master BR was very roomy  Attached double was quite small  LR was just average  Furniture not very comfy  Concierge was very attentive when we did use him  Door staff was excellent  Location was the best of any of the properties ive stayed at in NY  But all in all it was just an above average visit  I am happy that we tried it  But I still prefer the Ritz Cartlton 
N => Disappointing I had high expectations for my stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the one word I am using to describe my two night stay is disappointing  My partner and I arrived at  pm after a delayed flight from the UK and were suppose to be meeting colleagues at a cocktail party which finished at  pm  We were in two minds whether to rush to try and make it or just phone and say we were unable to attend   luckily  the hotel made the ision for us by taking a considerable time to check us in   having to check whether the room was ready it was  pm and the room was suppose to be ready by  pm and the porters who had taken our bags from the taxi then took  minutes to deliver them      To add insult we discovered when we checked out that we had been charged for that service We were offered a complimentary newspaper   didnt get one on either morning  The turndown service was a constant ringing of the room bell at   pm when I would have thought the majority of people were either relaxing after a busy day or in the bath getting ready to go out  We politely asked the maid to return in about half an hour   and in fact saw her while we were waiting for the lift and told her our room was now available   to return later on that night to discover no one had bothered to return The room was very nice   clean and a ent size   and the bathroom lovely  Although I would expect nothing less for the amount charged  We left our baggage with them on the day we checked out and specifically asked for the suit bag to be hung up  They said certainly but when we went to collect it was folded up actually underneath our other bag Some people  find my comments picky but at the prices charged by this hotel I really feel that I am entitled to be  
N => Wow Nothing more to say than if you can afford it   stay here Its an incredible experience  And dont miss breakfast lunch or dinner at the  restaurant   everything you ever dreamed of in high dining experience  Cant wait to go back  
N => Service just a bit off My husband was booked into the Four Seasons for a business meeting and ided to bring me along and extend the stay in celebration of our anniversary  When we checked in the front desk was aware that part of the expense would go to the company business coordinator and part would be charged to us  We were shown to our rooms and welcomed the brief introduction to the room  One neat feature was that the curtains opened and closed on a switch which other people didnt find on their own  The rooms are stark and modern devoid of oration  The bed chairs and sofa were very comfortable  It was great to have a fax in the room I believe it was a copier as well  The bathroom was lovely although a second sink would have been nice  The tub was wonderful and filled in  minute We were pleased with the fitness room there was a comprehensive amount of equipment towels and headsets ready on each item and drinks to keep hydrated  The restaurant was under reation but there was service in the lobby restaurant  We opted to have only one breakfast there as others have noted it was quite overpriced despite the service and nothing that special  Perhaps other meals are better  The lobby bar was busy and we didnt really appreciate being seated at a coffee table with  strangers on our anniversary  My husband had a suit pressed nicely done and quick service  The concierge desk was quick and helpful  The doormen were excellent friendly and funny  The part that took away from our stay was the last  hours  At about  on the last evening the bell rang  Id just stepped out of the shower and hadnt put on the privacy light as I was afraid Id lock out my husband who was jogging  I opened the door because I saw the housekeeper with my husband right behind her  We told her wed be leaving in  hour and asked if shed come back  She asked if wed like anything and we asked for ice which she left  She asked if there was anything else and we said no  I guess she took that as quotno need to come backquot  When we arrived back late that night she hadnt returned so there was no turndown or dry towels  The next morning we were scheduled to check out  We started to pack then went down for breakfast  While we were gone housekeeping came in  They got rid of the soap by the sink and replaced it with a new wrapped soap  Theyd replaced all the towels and placed new shampoo and conditioner in the shower and put the sticker on the toilet roll  It felt like they were getting ready for the next guests before we were gone  We had to wonder when we washed our hands if the hand towels would be changed before then  Then when we got to the desk despite the instructions to split the bill it hadnt been done  All charges had been put on the company card  The woman at the desk really didnt want to split out the charges she said it would be extremely difficult  When we asked if shed put the charges onto our card she said that would be even more difficult and that the bill had actually already been sent to our business group coordinator  Were now facing the time consuming task of sorting this out on our own it shouldnt have happened  We did have a lovely stay but felt that they didnt quite live up to their reputation  
N => Use the hotel bach My wife stays here all the time on business but this was my first  When we checked in for a romantic weekend in ust everyone was out in the hamptons  empty  it was great they upgraded us to a tower room on the th floor nice views of central park  I think we had a rack rate of   We would walk through the park every morning and have our tea  I am not a city type but she loved it  Mostly formal attire walking through the lobby  But no one batted an eye at my shorts and flip flops I hate trying to sleep in manhattan because of the noise but managed very well on this high floor  We had stayed at the hotel gansevoort for a week in il  those rooms are small quothipster boutiquequot style  very loud in the meat packing district  FS much bigger quieter  Also there are a ton of wifi hot spots at this location if you have a wifi card  On checkout we went to hail a cab but the doorman wouldnt hear of it  He put us into the hotel back gratis  We never wanted to get out of that car  It only seats  back there  Someone told me these bach limos cost   Tipped the driver   Best deal in NYC  
N => Disapointed Stayed at this property with my two dogs using a free night certificate I had received from Four Seasons  I live in NY but needed to stay at a hotel one night after a terrible wind storm knocked out power to my home for four days  I had stayed at the hotel four months after it opened back in the late s and was truly impressed  However this stay was a disapointment  The room or is stark and cold  The carpeting both inside the room and in the hallways was stained  The bed felt a bit worn and not as comfy as I remembered it  The food at the hotel particularly breakfast is outrageously priced about  to  for two with tip and taxes  Worst of all the service at the hotel is inconsistent  Reception staff were welcoming but other staff were not as obliging  When I called housekeeping to inquire about why I had still not received the dog bowls I requested  minutes prior there was no effort made to apologize or expedite the delivery even after I explained that I needed to leave the room for a restaurant reservation  There was only one doorman stationed at th Street to handle guest needs and I had to wait  minutes for my car When I came across a maid who was doing turn down service on our floor I asked her to do our room while we were inside because once we left we did not want staff to enter our room alone with the dogs present  She refused to do our turn down at that time saying someone else was assigned to our room and would come later  I am an avid fan of Four Seasons hotels but management does not seem to be on top of things here  be I was spoiled having just returned from the Four Seasons George V in Paris five days before this  
N => was it worth it not perfect but      restaurant needed later hours for a friday night  and saturday was brunch til pm  we wanted lunch  room service was nice and a treat however it was expensive    gratuity   room charge and an additional   tax  we loved our anniversary package and being called by name was great  dont call down to the conceirge or you will be on hold for up to  minutes its better if you just show up  the house cars were a real convenience and they were free  we were driven in a royles royce and mercedes sedan  the spa was wonderful  i had the waterfall facial and it was superb i was disappointed that some of the spa services were advertised but no longer available  overall  very expensive but worth it if it is your anniversary 
N => Best Hotel in the USA    Honestly I dont even know where to begin when talking about the Four Seasons in New York  It is the finest most luxurious beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in  From the moment you walk into the towering hotel the lobby almost takes your breath away  As we all know Four Seasons Hotels pride themselves on pampering their clients  This hotel brings that to a whole new level  There wasnt a single person who didnt address me by my name including the chamber maids  Due to the hotel being less busy on the weekend we were given a luxurious upgrade to a suite on a high floor  The room was amazing plasma screen tvs DVD players electronic switches to control the window shades  I really cannot say enough great things about this hotel I have traveled all over the world and stayed at many fine hotels but nothing comes close to the Four Seasons in New York  
N => Presidential Suite My husband and I just got back from our weekend getaway trip to new york city  We stayed in the luxurious presidential suite   We always always stay at the four seasons when we come to new york because of its great location  It is right in the heart of the action   high end shopping great restaraunts and central park  However this trip we ided to treat ourselves and stay at the newly designed presidentail suite  The second we walked in to our room we were amazed  The view from this suite was not to be believed  Every little detail of this room was amazing  I would highly recommend this suite to any guest looking to try something new at the four seasons or even just want to expirience new york at the highest degree  
N => Not what I was hoping for My husband and I stayed at this hotel the first week in ember  we reserved a suite  We arrived and the room seemed to be mostly hallway  dollars a night for hallway  We got in to our room in the evening and the lights were not on for us and it was a chore to try to find all the lights in the room to turn on  We seemed to be searching for about  minutes in the dark trying to get us to where we could see the rooms we were in  The rooms were a neutral tone and not very exciting  There was the bedroom bathroom front room very small and lots of hallway  We were not impressed with the lobby either very small and not very exciting  We ordered room service one night got a bowl of soup a small individual pizza some tea and a coke and it was over a hundred dollars  I can appreciate that this hotel is pricey and we new this before going but that is ridiculous  If you are going to get a massage be sure to ask the prices a normal regular  hour massage was over  and it wasnt even that great I did love the conciere at this hotel they were the nicest most helpful gentleman and hooked us up with show tickets and a great sushi restaraunt in noho  The restaraunt  was wonderful although when I checked in at the front desk I told her we had a reservation there in the next hour and needed to get our bags upstairs asap she told me not to wear what I was wearing how rude I was wearing a pair of nice jeans boots and a long nice black coat  I called the restaraunt to cancel because I needed my suit pressed and didnt have time and he asked why and I told him and he was upset and said we would be his guest and treated us wonderfully That was nice  To some this hotel  be perfect to us it was only a hotel nothing special not worth the money  
N => Flawless A flawless experience  The space was intimate but glamorous  Exceptionally courteous staff thats hard to find in new york these days  
N => ill be back  
N => Was f r eine Entt uschung      
N => Great Value   convenient location for us Booked this over the phone directly with hotel after several websites including their own showed no availability  Location was perfect for us since we have family a block away  Room was above average size for NY standards interesting or nice atmosphere overall  Only hitch was the smoking room they originally assigned we had to wait about  hour to be re assigned but everything worked out OK  Would definitely recommend this if youre looking downtown  
N => Not a  star Definitely not a  star rating  Pricey hotel for what it offers  No restaurant or food room service available in hotel  Why not at least have snacks in the bar Rooms are clean but really small  I hurt my shin on bed frame  Not enough drawer space for clothes  Closet was ok  No coffee maker or iron in room  Bathroom glass door needs to go what was the reasoning behind this semi see through door  To make matters worse our bathroom door had a defective lock and couldn t stay shut We couldn t believe that they charge  per day for the internet Is this a New York thing Cheaper hotels have free internetStaff was great Friendly and helpful Hallway or is nice and unique  We found the lobby somewhat dull  One night there was a wedding party  We tried to get a drink at the bar on the first floor but the wedding guests were hoarding all the space around the bar and some of then seemed reluctant on creating a pathway for us to order our drinks  The bartender seemed unconcerned about us If you are ever in Chicago try Hotel Blake  In Washington DC try Hotel Lombardy youll see why Gild Hall does not deserve a  star rating  These other hotels are rated   star but are surely   star based on the Gild Hall rating  They are also less pricey than Gild Hall  But then its New York  the streets around the hotel were full of garbage bags  Wall Street More like garbage street  Everything seemd just crammed in    well 
N => Recommended overall The room and bathroom were of a reasonable size nicely furnished and clean  Wireless internet is an extra  USD per day  A few unusual extras were available in the room condoms etc The hotel is located in downtown Manhattan which  not be suitable for all though there is a metro station located closeby The only issue I had was that the fire alarm went off at  on the first night we stayed followed by an announcement that this was a false alarm  The alarm then repeatedly sounded until the morning though was stopped quickly on each occasion  This meant that it was not possible to get any sleep from   I realise that this is not necessarily the hotels fault but it would have been nice for the hotel to apologise when we went through reception in the morning which would have been good customer service  
N => Stylish cozy fantastic servicestaff We love Gild Hall   we stayed this past weekend while in town for a wedding  Fantastic or in both the common rooms amp our room  Excellent attention to details high end materials extremely comfy bed amp linens excellent toiletries Kiehls  Best hotel bathroom Ive ever used  The staff was friendly amp attentive without being pushy  Room service was quick amp delicious  We slept really well too  We wish this hotel were a little further uptown as the financial district is a bit dead but it was only a short walk to several subway lines Overall we had a restful wonderful stay  
N => Wowsers What a hotel Gild Hall was the culmination of every design i have tried to incorporate in my house but have not been able to  Service was great food was great conceirge accomodating everyone friendly  You have to ride the subway in New York and they are close to every line you need and the doormen are more than willing to get you a cab even if they have to go a couple of streets over to do it  Lived in greenwich village for three years and didnt know you could find a spot in the city to sleep that wasnt loud  I will definately go back The only bad thing was the door on the bathroom   kinda kills the mood if you have to use the restroom before love making    
N => Beautiful Hotel at what must be recession prices Booked a standard room but agreed to an upgrade to a Suite when I arrived  Rate was  a night after the upgrade  Suite was gorgeous wood floors designer furniture  Hotel as a whole is beautiful  Very clean and well kept as well  
N => good but a little odd The good   rooms are nice well designed use of space and well orated  Restaurants was good Odd   well its very hard to find  My cab driver got quite lost  Location is not well ked so be prepared  No normal public restrooms they direct you to two rooms on the second floor  just odd not good   workout rooms a few little cubicles really are small hot unpleasant  dont expect to work out  They should convert a room to a workout room instead  this is a ent solution if you have to be in lower manhattan but not my favorite nyc hotel by far  
N => Not the Ritz Carlton I sent some colleagues to this hotel due to its proximity to the Financial District and the reviews I saw on Trip Advisor  First the hotel front is not on Gold Street but on Pratt Street and the limo driver would not go to the front  There are no individual temperature controls in the room so it is hard to regulate to individual temperature preferences  The windows do open but the garbage trucks pick up trash at am and it is very noisey  The bed frameplatform is larger than the mattress so one gentleman kept hitting his shin on the frame  The restaurant serves a limited British themed menu which was not to their liking  I would porbably reccmmend the hotel to a younger person but never again to older executives  
N => If you have time to waste and dont mind being aggravated this one is for you Gild Hall is listed as being on Gold St  After min  of circling with my navigation system on I finally got st enough to call the Hotel  They are on Platt St  Taxiss cant find this place  The bellman has to go up to the end of the block hop in the taxi and bring the taxi to the hotel  Very time consuming and inconvenient  The Music in the lobby was so loud you couldnt hear the front desk people  Parking was interesting  I called the night before to confirm they had parking  They said yes  What they did not tell me until I arrived is that the parking is  per day and per each time you take your car out of the garage  So Plan on taking a taxi if you can find one  The Bathroom was another storyOne side of the bathroom wall had frosted rippled glass the door had just plan rippled glass Either way if someone was using the bathroom their was nothing left to priviacy or the imagination  The next biggest disappointment was when we returned to our room to rest at pm and found our room had not be made up  When I called the front desk to inquire they said that the guest has to request houskeeping  I have never heard of this but more importantly I was not told this at registration  In ember I stayed down the street at the Hampton Inn near South Street Seaport  It was my first time there  It was a far better hotel for the same price as Gild Hall  By the way  When the Bellman asked how my stay was and I told him of my complaints he saidquotWe hear the same complaints all the timequot  Guess whos not listening to their patrons 
N => Wonderful Hotel Stayed in the Gild Hall Hotel with my partner from monday to friday ember  th  Found the hotel to be very stylish comfortable and in a good location All the staff were extremely friendly thanks all We stayed in another hotel  nights prior to our stay at Gild hall and loved the bed in the first hotel  So we were a little worried the bed would not be as nice but boy does Gild Hall have comfy beds Large King Size beds with beautiful leather headbords  We checked in around  and our booked standard room was not ready  We were offered a deluxe room upgrade at  dollars plus  We exepted and were not dissapointed  The room was on the th floor and had all the ammenities one could wish for  Housekeeping was excellent front desk extremely helpfull in giving directions and suggestions of places to have breakfast etc  We had breakfast in the hotel once  It was good service was good but overall a little pricy for what you get  We had some great breakfasts across the street at the Gold Street Diner  I read some complaints on the hotel location but in my opinion it could not have been much better  Ok its not very central but there are several subwaystops around the corner with connections to all areas of NY  As said before youre on Times Square in min And I found the Financial District as well as ChelseaWest Village where we stayed before a much nicer area then the over busy touristy Times SquareMidtown areaWe sure had a great stay at the Gild Hall hotel and will surely return next time were in NY 
N => Enjoyable We were looking to stay at a nice hotel for a single night whilst we were staying in NYC but didnt want to spend too much of our budget on a fancy hotel  After reading reviews on Tripadvisor and finding a good price on Expedia we ided to book the Deluxe King room for approx  GBP  The location of the hotel was great  We were within walking distance of South Street Seaport World Trade Centre site and importantly we were close to Fulton Street Subway  We did find it difficult to carry our luggage from the subway platform to the street level because we could only find exits via stars rather than a lift so it might be worth researching more to find out whether there is a more accessible way to get to street level if you require help When we arrived at the hotel we were met by a friendly member of staff who checked us in pretty quickly  They took a copy of my passport and also my credit card information just in case we used any extras i e  mini bar movies etc  The receptionist informed us that we could use the business centre actually a small narrow room with a few PCs in and a printer free of charge as well as the fitness centres also small narrow rooms with two cross trainers in and some weights  These also require your room key to get in  The en suite room was very spacious and had a high ceiling  The or looked very nice and the king size bed was extremely comfortable  There was an HDTV approx quot on the wall which had quite a few channels in both English and Spanish including some HD channels which looked great The room had a combination safe a snacks draw and a mini fridge full of alcohol chocolate and soft drinks  There was also a robe available to use we only had one robe two would have been better and also an umbrella hairdryer and some magazines  For those who get embarrassed easily please skip the next nine words   There was also a travel couples pleasure kit Ooh  Various freebies included some brownies to munch on body lotion soap cotton wool cottonwool ear pokey things which your not meant to poke in your ears Im a man I dont know what theyre called  shampoo  conditioner  The bathroom was clean and spotless but like a few people on here it was a bit embarrassing using the toilet because one wall and the door was close to being see through  It made the room look good having the design of the bathroom though and to be fair you couldnt actually see what was going on but it still felt a bit awkward  Overall although our stay was just for one night it was a really nice hotel and I can see why this hotel has been given a lot of positive reviews  The room was clean comfortable and close to the subway and attractions  
N => Nice stay but needs improvement Spent  nights at Gild Hall during the Labor Day long weekend  Overall a happy stay It s true that the hotel is too new and taxi drivers  not be able to find  Good that we got a print our map so our taxi driver just followed it    Hotel lobby is on the small side but still got the hip feeling  All staff were friendly and we didn t have any problems of waiting the elevator We got there in a Fri morning so the room was not ready  Reception girl took my cell phone number and say  when your room is ready we will give you a call   There was nobody calling even at pm    So we just headed back to our hotel and found that room was ready   The double deluxe room was quite spacious in NYC standard  Fresh products in bathroom was really a highlight  However the glass door of the bathroom seemed to be a problem  It s really transparent even we tried to turn off the light Good that I found  robes in the closet that I could hang them at door  I was very surprise that both bathroom and the hotel room had lots of storage which is good for us shopping in NYC to put our stuff Little thing can also improve instead of change the bathroom doors as well is they can put a dim light somewhere so that it won t be totally dark at night  Because the bathroom door is transparent it made the room very bright at night if you leave it on  The light at entrance was bright too So we had no choice to turn them all off which made it a bit dangerous when woke up at night and walked to bathroom It s nice that there was complementary pastries coffee amp tea in the morning  However we could hardly enjoy it  We usually got downstairs around  am either coffee was gone or pastries were gone  I asked the reception to replace the coffee on Sat and a staff was being sent to grab a new pot right the way  Sun there was only  reception working at the counter There was no coffee as well so we just didn t bother Hotel is located in financial district  It means there s nothing going on during weekends at night It s great for us cause there was no noise problem at all   mins walk to subway but due to MTA construction subway didn t stop there all the time    and we could be in SOHO in a short time The hotel is nice overall but it s lack of staff during weekends  I do have expectation for Thompson group hotels and hope they can improve this  Still recommend this hotel if you like the small boutique hotel idea  
N => Even improved from our last visit Just an update to my earlier review from    quotGreat rate at great hotelquot After our first stay in ch we went back in e and even after having had a very nice experience with the Gild Hall in ch we found it even had improvedThere were minor  points I had written about in my first review and they all seemed to have been addressed First I thought that the hotel had such a nice room or that their cheapo miniblinds just did not fit  In e we found our room with great cloth miniblinds which were much better  Second I also had concerns if the AC would be sufficient in the hot summer months   It wasThird the last time the delicous breakfast pastries served every morning in the lobby were pretty much gone at around AM and not replenished  This time there were plenty and we even were able to get some very late one day when we arrive downstairs at AM and usually they are only served until AM Somebody must be reading these reviews and actually take them to heartGreat job 
N => Gild Hotel   hidden gem Stayed at the Gild Hotel for  nights in late y  When checking in I was upgraded to a suite  It was huge and very nice  The bathroom is super clean and nice with plenty of toiletries    The minibar was fully stucked but still had some room to place your own bought drinks The breakfast was nice but be in time in order to get the good stuffThe only downside was the wi fi   it was supposed to work all over the hotel but it simply did not work in my room so was forced to go down to the lobby to access the Internet But all in all a very good experience in NYC 
N => Best kept secret in great location I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place  From check in to check out everything was just great    and as the previous post said make sure to keep singles out and ready for those great bellmen  Me and my wife in town for business from Chicago and we ided to check out the Gild Hall since it was close to where I work and also much quieter and away from the hustle and bustle of our last stay in midtown  A bit bummed out they had no restaurant but the front desk make the best recommendations and you even get a discount as this great local resto if your a guest Complimentary pastries and java in the morning was exactly what I needed Right near the south st seaport  The rooms were superbly designed and make sure to ask for the high ceiling rooms The staff were as friendly and kind as they were attractive Even one of the front desk people andre was kind enough to help us get a taxi and carry our bags three blocks to where our driver was waiting to take us to the airport A bit hard to find but be that keeps it a hidden secret Two thumbs up everyone at the place shows what hospitality is really about Cant wait to go back  
N => Great Hotel We booked  nights through Quikbook and were not unhappy with the results  While the th floor room we received was a little smaller than we are accumstomed to in our travels it seems to be an adequate size for New York  The bedding was perfect the room was clean there was a ent sized closet and in room safe and the washroom was clean modern and had enough shower pressure The location of the hotel is pretty good for downtown Manhattan  Youre not too far away from the Fulton Street subway station and we found the  lines most convenient for us  There was also service with A C   among others that were convenient for getting uptown  Youre a few blocks away from Broadway and there is tons of shopping within walking distance like JampR and Century  The only disappointment we had was that the turndown service failed to fully secure our door one evening  We came back to our room to find that while the door wasnt ajar it was not fully closed  Luckily the location of the room was at the end of the hall so there wasnt much walking traffic  But we only received a couple of perfunctory apologies from the desk clerk  We were told the housekeeping manager would get back to us but never heard from anyone else and did not receive some token of apology like a meal chit for their current dining relationship All in all a great stay was had by all  
N => Pleasant surprise My cousin was getting ried during the last weekend in ch  It was at the Brooklyn Botanical Garden  I contemplated whether to attend or not because   Im not familiar with Brooklyn to find a hotel to stay in and   Manhattan hotels are way too expensive  After a LOT of online searches for hotels in NYC I finally found a great deal at the Gild Hall a Thompson Hotel in lower Manhattan  Its in the Wall Street Financial area  I thought why not its close to Brooklyn and affordable When I arrived around pm I was a little disappointed by the location   it was quiet since its in the Financial district not much going on    But then when I checked in I had a positive experience  The front desk rep was very friendly and helpful  She upgraded me to a room on the th floor not sure what I wouldve had in the first place and informed me that theyre close to completing reation of the hotel but excuse the appearance  I didnt notice anything different like messiness or noise so it didnt bother me    I took the elevator which was nice and clean  Then got to my room and I was very impressed wasnt expecting much to begin with This place exceeded my expectation   there was a king size bed flat screen TV sitting area free Wi Fi  It was very spacious and clean for a NYC hotelNext day I took a walk and was pleasantly surprised that I was so close to the subway PATH ground zero South Street Seaport and other touristy areas  The hotel was also close to shops like Century  Borders Daffys and hora  This worked out great for meTo sum up know that this hotel is located in lower Manhattan close to the southern tip  If you plan to have a partying weekend or want to explore all of Manhattan then this might not work out for you  However if you dont mind the commute or if youre going to Brooklyn NJ want to explore Wall Street Statue of Liberty Ellis Island places below th Street or even Canal Street then this is a great place to stay  Enjoy 
N => Awesome quiet location in NYC  Gild Hall was definitely worth the pre opening price  Our room was small but well outfitted  The bed slept well the linens were exceptional and the bathroom was well designed  The hotel services seemed to be up to speed too  The hotel is steps away from Battery Park the South Street Seaport and the pedestrian walkway entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge  If youre looking for a quieter getaway not NYC this is the place to stay  
N => Surprisingly wonderful We booked our reservation with Gild Hall in NYC through Priceline for night  Its in the financial district which we werent terribly excited about but we were pleasantly surprised The Gild Hall is a diamond in the rough  The staff was all very friendly and extremely helpful  they pointed out great places to go on the map and advised on where not to go  They were quick to help us upgrade our room at no extra charge  The room was amazing flat screen TV orative no expense spared  Beds were comfortable  Doors to the bathroom were slightly more transparent than necessary but we got over it Every time we came and left the hotel the staff would recognize us and exchange pleasantries  There was a friendly doorman who helped with taxis and finding our way to good restaurants  The front desk person who checked us in even wished us a good morning when we saw him in the subway station  thats good serviceI will definitely plan on staying here again on my next trip to NYC  
N => Loved our Stay at Gild Hall I wasnt sure what to expect of the hotel as our last stay at a mid town location with higher quotstarsquot was less than ideal and although not in the heart of the city hubbub this place was worth every subway ride  The quiet Financial District location made it feel more neighborhood y  The walk from the subway station to the hotel was quick even for someone like me who clearly overpacked  The lobby was small and intimate and the front desk staff answered all of our questions pointed us in the right direction and we were set  The room was a great size we didnt have to jump over the bed to get to the other side as in most small NYC hotels  My boyfriend was happy with the big flat screen TV and the complimentary fatwitch brownie he said it was like eating his favorite chocolate breakfast cereal  The king size bed was to die for and curling up under the covers every night on good thread count sheets was the best after a long day  Thanks to the great Fresh bath products we smelled as quotfreshquot as the yummy fruits every morning from the produce ket  And even though we didnt indulge too much in the treats in the room the fridge was packed with great drink choices and enough snacks that we wouldnt have had to leave the room for a few days if we ided not to  The location couldnt be beat to the Financial District attractions the Seaport WTC site Brooklyn Bridge Wall Street etc  We enjoyed a late night drink at the Gold St  diner and a great breakfast there on our last morning in the city  Without a doubt I would stay here again it was a great experience from the complimentary coffee tea and danish in the lobby in the morning to the amazing bathrobe hanging in the closest  My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our time here and we would come back for another stay without question  
N => Gild Hall   What a treat A friend of mine sent me a link to this hotel via Quikbook as I was not finding anything uptown  I was quite hesitant about staying downtown but convinced myself I would never know what it was like until I tried plus the rate could not be beat First off the staff was extremely friendly  Although my original room was not ready and it was past check in time I was quickly upgraded as there were other rooms available  The room was large and had high ceilings  The newly reated bathroom was beautiful As others have said it was very close to the subway so I was able to get to where I needed to with no problem One thing is for sure as this hotel is away from the normal hustle and bustle of the city it was nice and quiet at night  I slept very well  I liked this hotel so much that I went ahead and booked another weekend although the price has increased a bit  I have stayed at  different hotels over the past few months but Gild Hall has quickly become my new favorite  
N => A  star hotel with  star rooms  
N => Wow this can only get better  
N => Recommend   
N => Entertaining but bad for work and terrible service I ided to give the property a try despite a previous bad experience trying to organize an event here  The property was better than I expected but isnt a place that I would repeat The pluses  great location  entertaining or  design  passable rooms i e  not a closet but not enough space for   hip bar with good people watching  attractive clientele   free internet  wireless in the room  io Badescu amenities   good mobile reception inside the room  reservation made my concierge resulted in complementary dessert at Craftbar for brunchThe minuses  service at the rooftop restaurant at least for brunch is about as bad as you can get  the food is forgettable and overpriced  it isnt that staff arent friendly they are just forgetful unattentive inconsistent and dont seem to really know what they are doing  very dark  this was fun   years ago but it is time to turn the lights back on at these types of properties  hallways can be a bit loud in the middle of the night if you are trying to sleep  guests arent rowdy but the opening and closing of doors might keep some folks awake  power outlets are few and inconvenient  at the desk  in the bathroom  there are others but they arent easily accessible i e  require you to move furniture  understaffed but friendly bell service seems like they only have  guy on duty  forgot to include Tablet Plus bonus amenitiesEntertaining enough but a stay of more than a few nights would be pretty painful  The staff were friendlier than some other boutique places not warm but respectful and helpful however service levels are poor for the price point likely due to understaffing and poor training  
N => Interesting one time only experience be were just not hip enough  We appreciate the artwork  Understand the Bohemian or  Do not mind paying for good service and product  But after two days of straining to see the elevator buttons the moodiness of GPH wore thin It almost seems as though theyre trying too hard to be cool and calculatingly pricing themselves into the quotvery exclusivequot category  Food and drink prices are over the top even by New York standards Having said that we found the service to be attentive and not snobbish as other reviewers have said  The room though dark of course had top drawer appointments crystal barware fabulous duvet on a very comfortable bed opium den chic sofa and chairs with artsy lamps and wall or  The real wood fire in the stunning lobby fireplace was a surprise as we arrived on the hottest day of the year  The historic neighborhood is wonderful with a Kensington London feel  I channeled Edith Wharton as I meandered through Gramercy Park after being escorted over by a very pleasant hotel employee  We enjoyed our two night stay and are glad we experienced this very different European feeling hotel  But in the future wed opt for more pedestrian   OK boring   accommodations  
N => Trendy Nice but Overpriced Check in Arrived at the hotel around  p m  I was told I had been upgraded twice from a Superior Room  to a Loft  I checked online and it was actually a Deluxe Loft   Front desk staff was very nice and friendly  Hotel  Room Ive had difficulty explaining the hotel  Its modern but not W modern  More like weird artsy modern  And very VERY dark  The room was big a corner room and almost seemed like it was originally two rooms with the wall knocked down  The or has a bit of a matador theme to it  The bathroom was an okay size with a shower big enough for two but again bad lighting  The bed was firm and comfy and the italian sheets did not disappoint  The room was the quietest I had ever had in New York Rooftop Terrace The rooftop terrace was wonderful with a glass enclosure that could be opened and closed  The weather was fabulous Friday amp Saturday and it was nice to sit outside  Sunday it was warmer and overcast and the glass was closed  We had breakfast twice and lunch once  Both the lunch and breakfast menus are limited and very expensive  For example  for contenental breakfast  for a very limited sunday brunch etc  At lunch we ordered the nd cheapest bottle of wine for  that retails for   Athough expensive the food was good and the service was attentive Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Gramercy Park Hotel and was glad I had a gift certificate to offset some of the cost  Due to the quiet area I wouldn t have picked the hotel but was glad I was able to check it out  The service was good overall but not even close to the best Ive ever received  I doubt I would stay here again if I had to pay  a night  Just not my style  Pet Peeve On Saturday night I returned to the hotel around  a m  and wanted to have a nightcap before bed  I went up to the rooftop terrace but was told it was closed for a private event  I went down to the lobby to ask if I could have a drink in the Jade Bar  I was told I needed a reservation but could ask the door man if there had been any cancellations  Although I was told at check in I would need a reservation after  p m  even if I was a hotel guest I found it pretty ridiculous that it was so difficult to get a drink  Oh and when I had a drink at the Jade Bar the day before it was  for a stoli and club soda  
N => Trendy Dark and Different We stayed for the weekend and were upgraded to a larger room  The bathroom was really really small   when the shower door and bathroom door were open you could not stand in the bathroom  It did not really make sense as the room was very large especially for NYC  The hotel was dark but trendy  
N => fantastic six days in new york what a fantastic place  great location very helpful staff lovely atmosphere  we arrived after a long flight to discover they had upgraded our booking to a loft room on the third floor so were chuffed to bits  wed looked at previous reviews and knew that wed need to take earplugs so the noise outside was no problem at all dont forget to take them if your room is overlooking lexington  the bed was the comfiest ive ever slept in and the roof terrace was a beautiful they even gave us free coffee on our last morning  yes it is expensive for the extras but frankly that was no problem  dont bother with room service as its a fortune but head up the road to the murray hill diner if you want a hearty kick start to the day    
N => Dont even consider this hotel  It is awful Uncomfortable tiny cramped room switched for mucho moolah to a bigger dorm style room with still the same tiny cramped cold bathroom They redid the or  frightful  but left the old NYC bathrooms intact  The room was very COLD and we couldnt get the temperature to rise  There were no shampoo conditioner body cleanser or body lotion we had to request them  TWICE  because the front desk insisted we must have missed them we didnt  We even had to ask for toilet paper because it ran out after two days and there was no replacement  Overpriced  Overrated  Not a find  Should not be in this class of hotel  
N => Wheres the amenities My husband and I just returned from a Valentines Day overnight at the GPH and we were very disappointed  We chose this hotel because our dinner reservations were downtown and thought it would be more convenient  Also the last time we stayed overnight we stayed uptown  We will not return to this hotel  We were triple upgraded to a one bedroom suite and at checkin thought this was awesome  Well not so awesome  The room itself was really cool  Great art great colors  The bathroom was horrible  The toilet was on top of the shower  I felt like I was on a boat  The shower was not a arate stall but a bathtubshower with a curtain  A curtain yuck The water pressure was great but so strong that it created a wind effect that caused my husband to do a dance in order to avoid contact with the shower curtain  Turndown was a joke  No slippers no water bottles next to the bed the towels used to clean up the tons of water from the shower incident were not replaced and the tissue box was empty  How is that service We recently stayed at The Lowell and can tell you that the luxury and contrast is like night and day  While the rooftop bar was awesome but visiting it is not worth it if it means having to stay at the hotel  
N => Dropped the Ball on New Years Eve  Part II I was the other shivering person in the incident described in the review below mine quotDropped the Ball on New Years Evequot  Thought Id chime in too but want to make clear this isnt some  other  incident that the hotel screwed up  Im just elaborating Im the one who booked the reservation  Ive stayed at GPH before    more than once    and liked it I had already booked a regular room there for NYE but then received one of their keting emails for a special New Years Eve package which required upgrading to one of their suites  Suites are often not always a bit wasted on me    I dont throw wild parties or live like a rock star or do illegal things in the bathroom    so the only reason I changed my reservation and upgraded was because of the special bells and whistles that were supposed to come with this special super cool NYE package  The two bells and whistles I cared about were  guaranteed access to the Rose Bar and  late check out  I was perfectly happy to pay a premium to ensure that we wouldnt be standing around freezing our asses off not getting in anywhere at midnight on New Years Eve  Which is exactly what happened after two different staffers turned us away from the Rose Bar and we ended up listening to the count down from the street failure    The staffers had never heard of this NYE package or the guaranteed access part of it and they didnt bother to check internally to find out if we could possibly be telling the truth failure   By the time I found a manager who said that quotof coursequot access to the Rose Bar was part of the deal midnight had come and gone  Failure   no attempt to make amends  Not even a comped glass of champagne Failure   even though that particular manager knew that this had all gone pear shaped for us there was apparently no communication internally about what had happened or any kind of hand off to the day shift because when we checked out the next day the other person on duty was surprised to hear my reply to the standard procedure quothow did you like your stayquot Failure   When I told her about the Rose Bar problem she offered to comp us breakfast but then realized that breakfast was supposed to be included in the rate as well  When no other offer was forthcoming    all while shes finalizing our bill and closing out the valet parking    DoINeedAVisa suggested that it might be a nice gesture to comp us the  charge for the valet parking which she did  Failure   She asked why we were checking out so early when our rate gave us a check out time of   I told her I had asked expressly about check out time the night before and had been told noon  She was sorry about that too  She did offer to let us stay in the room but wed already cleared out by then If I had wanted to be a hard      about this and I never am in these situations I just vote with my feet I would have expected the following comp us the room for that night or offer us a room on the house for some future stay  I had such a great time overall on NYE that I wasnt in the mood to have some hissy fit with the front desk over a hotel snafu  But DoINeedAVisa and I agreed it made sense to share the story here since we both benefit from TripAdvisor reviews regularly In the meantime its back to the Mercer for me although Id gladly return to GPH just to hang at the Roof Bar  
N => a pleasant surprise I was on a long business trip and this hotel was a pleasant surprise  Often quotboutique hotelquot means that the staff exhibits more quotAttitudequot than quality service  But everyone I dealt with was not only efficient but affable  The room was a delight like the guest quarters of an eccentric aunt  The bath amenities were great as was the bed  Dry cleaning room service computer access rooftop garden lounge were all fine  The location near Gramercy Park provides a quiet enclave in Manhattan but it is close to public transportation as well as some of the citys finest restaurants  
N => Silver Anniversary Sadness Called ahead to ask for a view suite and mentioned it was our th anniversary  When arrived desk staff surly clueless about our request brought us to dark inner suite  They changed it after much ado to a semi nice suite with view  Went to roof terrace for a cocktail and told them we were entertaining people that evening did we need a reservation  They said no when we got there we were told we did and no tables  I cried for the first time in  years  Thank God I have a wonderful husband  Service ambience absolutely the worst ever  
N => appalling Huge dissappointment if you have half a brain dont bother going     service is completely non existent across the board  staff is useless they seemed to be too worried in trying to be cool and completely lack guest attention  evrything took forever to get  one of my worst stays ever in a hotel 
N => Great rooms service levels unacceptable  This hotel was a beautiful boutique affair overlooking the peaceful Gramercy Park area of New York and by definition is a little quieter than the buzz of the nearby Broadway and th Avenue  The design and or of the hotel are fantastic as is the hotels Japanese restaurant where we ate on our first night  However for this standard of hotel you simply dont accept or expect the following problems  We booked a  person car to pick us up from JFK on arrival and were greeted by a car which had been asked to pick up a single traveller so we could not fit ourselves or our luggage into it  This was the hotels mistake    We arrived early and were told that we would be called on our mobile to let us know when the room was ready  This didnt happen    Our travelling companions were then booked into a room that was already occupied  This is a definite quotno noquot in the hotel world and was shocking and unacceptable   Having paid for a deluxe suite they were then given a tiny old room  They had to argue to get this upgraded  Disgraceful    We found the Rose bars admission policy unacceptable and overly pretentious as it favoured guests from outside the hotel  Even having booked a table each night we found ourselves ignored and neglegted by the hosts on arrival at the bar    Having collected our bags and coats prior to departure on the last day they managed to lose our coats and had to search everywhere before finding them It seems that this place expects you to pretend to be a celebrity of some description as everyone there seemed to pretend to be so All in all if they sorted out the service and the state of affairs in the Rose bar this place would be great  Unfortunately for us it was not  
N => Horrible service Stayed at Hotel for  nights last week   Service was terrible   I have stayed at other Ian Schrager properties and this was by far the worst   no water in rooms   glasses in restaurant still have orange pulp or lipstick ks from previous user   Smokey Rooms No water in rooms Arrival tini Glasses that we finished were still dirty and in our room when we checked out   just terrible for the  rate we paid a night   I would certainly not go back   The Rose Bar was fun but you cannot get in even if you are a guest of hotel   you still have to beg Good Luck 
N => Expensive but worth it as a special treat We had booked the hotel on their website saved a bit of money and so upgraded to a deluxe loft  When we arrived our room wasnt ready so we were given a complimentary drink on the roof terrace whcih is lovely  Unfortunately the service was rubbish   took ages to order the drinks and then even longer to receive them  A lady from reception came to bring us our key which was nice as they had said they would call our mobile The room was even more beautiful that I expected it to be and was massive  The bed was really comfy and so was the sofa though you needed to use the cusions  It is quite a dark room even with all the lights on but during the day it was fine if you rolled the blinds up and at night it was very cosy  I had let the hotel know that it was my boyfriends birthday and when we came back the next day we had a birthday cake on the table which was a nice gesture  Room service was very prompt and the breakfast was really good  However service for brunch on the roof terrace was again rubbish as they gave our food to another table so we had to wait even longerThe Rose and Jade Bars were lovely   the Rose Bar has a pool table which was fun  Ask the concierge to book a table  The cocktails were yummy  One night we ate at the restaurant Wakiya and had the taster menu for  each   it was very tasty We didnt really speak to the concierge as they all seemed a bit snooty but the door staff were really approachable and gave a good tip for a local dinerThe hotel has a channel on the tv were you can view your hotel bill and check out remotely   it didnt work so had to do it the old fashioned way We didnt manage to have time to check out the park but had a good view from the room  The whole area smelled of dog pooBeautiful and expensive hotel full of elegant and rich people but worth it to experience the luxury and amazing art work  
N => Very Nice Great boutique hotel in a perfect locationUpgraded to a corner suite at check in it was by far one of the nicest most stylish hotel rooms Ive stayed in  Great atmosphere though the corridors are very dark Cant say enough about the room the furniture tvs bathroom everyhting was perfect  Not cheap but worth the money 
N => Nice or atmosphere a bit stuck up We picked the Gramercy Park for its location amp because it looked as though it would be a cool modern hotel  All of that was delivered amp we also had a great sized room we booked a loft room so that was all good  When we arrived the service from the doormen amp concierge was good but other than that it was a bit mixed except a great cocktail waiter in the Rose Bar  Its hard to put my finger on it but most of the people there didnt seem genuinely friendly or particularly interested to give a good service or make your stay a memorable one  At a lot of the places weve been to in New York weve come across people who do seem genuinely friendly amp love the place they live but this hotel was largely lacking in this amp seemed more interested in things such as a booking policy for the bar after pm even when it wasnt busy So while there were good elements to staying here we would probably try somewhere else in future as we expected better for the money we paid  
N => Dark smoky and with bad service   but the shower was great My husband and I who live in NYC stayed here overnight for his birthday  We were greeted nicely and received excellent service by the front desk staff But from there it was a disappointment  We received a very nice upgrade to a gorgeous room overlooking the park  BUT the room smelled overwhelmingly of cigarette smoke  Even after opening the windows  This contributed to the very dark feel that the hotel is trying to evoke  Which frankly I found a bit too much  The pay per view function on the TV did not work after we called for a repair twice the guy never came  They forgot our coffee for room service it took about a half hour for the guy to come back after we called  We had drinks in the bar but the waitress was MIA when we would have liked another round  What a disappointment  
N =>  star hotel prices with  star service Great location but at   per night they dont have free coffee in the morning  Very bad service the front desk was like talking to my  year old  Our reservation got mixed up  For this kind of money stay at a real  star hotel  Bathrooms need to be updated 
N => Dark Boutique of a Hotel We heard lots of cool things about The Grammercy Park Hotel and have read several positive articles  We stayed two nights in a one room suite  Comments as follows Our room on th floor very dark the whole aesthetic with red curtains wood floors funky furniture is really fun for an hour or two but not very functional  It will not stand the test of time  Hard to see heater fan loud outdoor trafficsirensgarbage truck made room very noisy  One full length mirror in very dark closet no ironing board funky switches for all the lamps  Had to swat several flies during two day stay as well  Kind of tires you out  Bed was very comfortable and flat screen tv in our room very nice  If you stay here you have to go to the Rose Bar good music and crowd but be sure to make a reservation preferably around  or  p m  Upstairs rooftop spot was really nice lots of plants and candles and friendly waitress but was empty at cocktail hour around p m on a Sat night  Continental breakfast the following day was okay and there were a handful of people up there  Spa is just one or two small rooms with a common changing area have to wait your turn to use locker or shower   unisex Website makes it sound like a tremendous spot  Not the case very small and no place to loungeompress beforehand  Got a great massage but room is next to workout area and you can hear everyone talking and working out  Workout area not used but did not come across to me as comprehensive as website made it sound  Couple of treadmills weight machines and big freeweight set  Workout area was bright and had windows a plus  Staff all very young were very nice for the most part to us  Hotel not conducive to getting a quick to go coffee or newspaper or checking e mails on house computer if you do not have one  General area at nd and Lex is nice restaurants and drugstores nearby Sumy We had a fun experience but will move on to another hotel in NY on next trip  
N => Style over substance I was very excited about staying at Gramercy Park  I was taken on a celebratory trip by my father for three days of shopping and eating in NYC  We had both been advised by colleagues and friends   who are based in New York  that this was THE place to go and that the rooftop bar was the latest bar to see and be seen  As is often the case with much hyped and trendy hotels it was not quite up to scratch as a real luxury hotel  Given it is a boutique hotel I guess some would say things might be different from an old fashioned luxury type of hotel  But I cant help but think when you pay so much for a room   even if it is highlyfashionabletrendyboutique you should still expect perfect service food and luxury rooms  The room was fashionably orated but a little small  We had a room with two double beds and I guess the use of space was clever  The airconditioning was centrally controlled so we could not change the temperature on our own  Staff were friendly and helpful if you asked them but I was immediately disappointed when upon our arrival and check in around pm on a Sunday night and the front desk did not automatically offer to take our bags up  Is it just me being a bit old fashioned I figureat those rates and it was not too late in the night  this is somethingthat should be automatic no matter how cool a hotel might be  What we found most amusing was that wed heard so much about the rooftop bar and yet on the night we arrived for a drink we were the only ones there  We thought ok be on Monday or Tuesday therell be celebs coming out to play  but on both those nights I checked the bar and again barely anyone was around  We were also amused by a young couplefrom abroad staying there who cht us in the lift and said they had heard they could go celeb spotting at the rooftop bar  I must say it got me thinking about whoever it was that did the PR for this hotel  Fantastic job in giving such an impression  Or perhaps New Yorkers were already bored with this haunt  We only ate at the Wakiya room downstairs for breakfast and found it to be quite good but were tickled when my father ordered a Japanese breakfast with miso soup only to find the miso soup was filled with the seaweed salad that should have been on the plate  Either the breakfast chefs have not got a clue about Japanese food or someone was still recovering from a night out  The maitre d was somewhat embarassed and luckily we were hungry and in a good mood  She claimed none of the staff were Asian that morning  Funny for an Asian restaurant  Other than that our stay was mostly pleasant  Luckily this is a cityhotel so people dont really expect to stay in the hotel all day as one would with a resort  As I say though sometimes experiences like this in trendy hotels make me think a good old fashioned luxury place where they have service down to perfection is more worth the large amount of money one pays to stay there  
N => I love it but    There are several things to love about the hotelThe products are awesome the shower is fantastic the entire hotel has a great smell the beds are super duper comfy the windows open for fresh air access to the rooftop is fun and i had a star sighting and the floors are hard wood which to me says quotcleaner than carpetquotBUT as much as I love the hotel there were several service problems that I encountered  Slow I checked in at  or  PM and my room wasnt ready checking me in took almost  minutes  The ParkGot the key to the park from the front desk  They dont give you the key but instead send a bellman to let you in  The bellman was supposed to come back to get me in  minutes but the bellman never came back  I even called the hotel twice  Some lovely neighbors with a key had to let me out    BIG MistakeI made a reservation for one day but wanted to stay for two  They said quotno problem but youll have to take another room and well move your belongings for you quot quotNo problemquot I say and went about my day  When I went to get the new key and go to my new room I walked in on people who were already given the room Did I get an apology no Did i get anything comped no I dont know what happens behind the desk but its not good and its really inefficient   DVDOrdered a DVD from their list and it never ever came All in all I love the hotel but they made a ton of mistakes  I would never pay to stay here but its on my list of corporate preferred hotels so yes I would stay here again but not on my dollar  
N => Have a drink and stay elsewhere All style and no substance  We stayed here last night for our anniversary I work  blocks away and we live in a NYC suburb and have stayed in most of the hotels in NY  The much acclaimed roof bar was closed for a private party  The restaurant got an awful review in the Times this week so we cancelled our reservation  We scheduled massages in the quotspaquot  When I called to confirm upon arrival I was told we had no reservation after being left on hold for  minutes they figured it out  The quotspaquot was  roomd with paper thin walls in the small gym without musiccandles and only threadbare towels  I could here every step from the treadmills  The therapist arrived  minutes late from a previous appt  downtown To top it all off when we returned to our room at pm after dinnerit was boiling hot  The AC was not functioning  After someone came up and was unable to fix it the manager offered us a new roomand gleefully said it was an upgradegee thanks at midnight I was thinking of getting in my car and driving home Needless to say not the best anniversary  In all fairnessI must say they were apologetic and did not caharge for the room Lots of better choices in NY 
N => Have never in my life had a worse experience My fiance and I ided to treat ourselves to a weekend in the city after our Jetblue flight to California was cancelled  It has taken me this long to write this review because I get so upset just thinking about it  The service was absolutely abysmal  At   a night one would expect to be treated like a guest  Not so here  I left in tears on Sunday  
N => Wonderful stay but       Me and a co worker just got back from a weekend at the Gramercy Park Hotel  We were really looking forward to it because of the outstanding location and the beautiful property that this hotel is reputed to be On check in the service was excellent though we were not offered an upgrade from our poor viewquite small room  And I could see the hotel was not at capacity The room was lovely great furnishings nice touches  The service excellent  The rooftop was breathtaking and we had a drink there in the evening as well as breakfast the next day  The rooftop is now on my personal top  things not to miss in NYC The only slight issues we encountered were at the Rose Bar  We were there with a couple of friends we had a midnight reservation and arrived at around   After our tab was at about  of drinks they told us they  ask us to leave as the tables were reserved  I told them that we in fact had a reservation  She said we  still have to move  I appreciate that they need to accommodate their patrons BUT it was not busy it is ust and we were guests of the hotel  She never mentioned it again nor did she apologize so we never quite knew where we stood until we left at around   It certainly made at least me feel less than welcome And on another note the next morning housekeeping came to our door twice and asked us twice how long we would be before checking out  Shouldnt we be asking them thatOther than those two very slight considerations my experience at this lovely well run beautiful hotel was wonderful and I highly recommend it to any who enjoys better hotels and wants to avoid the big boys Ritz Mondrian etc  And I could not review this hotel without mentioning the sheer joy of being surrounded by the magnificent artwork  
N => Worth every penny Having stayed at the Manderin Oriental and the Soho Grande we had very high expectations but we wanted a change    this was a special occasion and the hotel staff made certain everything about the weekend was wonderful  The room was outstanding though we did need to be moved since the first room had no view the location perfect and the roof top bar beautiful  The concierge could have been more responsive but we are used to that in NY we are too old to be part of the quotbeautiful peoplequot If you are willing to spend just a little bit more this is a great choice for a romantic weekend  The location is better than the Mandarin and the staff was as accomodating We will definitely be back 
N => unacceptable Yes the place looks cool in fact all the hotel employees I encountered were great as well  But at these prices the shower needs to drain and the toilet paper holder should not be broken  And at  for one night I should not have holes in the drywall of my suite either  The hallway was being painted when I checked in and shoddy workmanship was abound  My final gripe was upon checkout when I saw a  charge for WiFi connection  On the whole far too much money considerring the poor quality  I would not stay here again  Save your money and just look at the place but dont stay there  
N => A second stay at hte Gramercy Park Hotel I thought it was time to re visit the Gramercy Park Hotel having stayed there early last fall  My original stay there was above average but you really cant judge a hotel until they get up and running  Hence a second visit There were subtle differences from my last visit the biggest changes seemed to be in the staff  When I walked into the hotel to check in there were smiles from everyone  I think I was asked at least  times in the lobby how my flight was how long Id be staying in the hotel and offers everywhere to make my stay more enjoyable  One doorman even made some great suggestions about restaurants in New York  I was quickly checked in and brought up to my room  As was the case with my last stay there the rooms are really the coolest in NY  Again love the huge closet the bathroom and the mini bar  I immediately called down to get a reservation for myself and two friends for the Rose Bar which had been somewhat difficult to gain entry to on my last stay  That bar could be a little intimidating bc all you see are pretty people  But when we got there later that night and the staff found out I was a hotel guest we were treated as you should be treated when youre a guest of the hotel  I told the waitress we were guests of the hotel and her pleasure at that was most evident  And while you gotta wonder how service in a bar like that can be good it was On this visit I ided to visit the gym which I had skipped last time  Very clean and a good view of the park  The restaurant still wasnt open but many of the staff were quick to point out that Nobu is doing Chinese food and it will be open this coming y  This was good news and I look forward to it when I return to NY in tember  I couldve skipped meals in the hotel but thought I should at least see what they have  No disappointment there  Food was very good service very good  But the high point of this visit was the recently opened bar on the roof  This will be the biggest thing in NY once everyone finds out about it  And if you think that it will be overrun by the richa nd gorgeous think again  The staff was quick to point out that only hotel guests are admitted  In fact your hotel key card gets you up there  Once you exit the elevator there was a very sweet hostess type person who showed us to our table  And it was beautiful up there  Very very green  Very comfortable  A retractable roof which they opened bc it was a very mild night  The music had to be done by the same person that programmed the the IPods in the rooms  They should really sell those CDs bc it really set the tone for the evening  Not overly crowded at all we had a fabulous time up there and I cant recommend drinks up there enough Overall a great stay When that restaurant gets open this hotel will be firing on all cylinders  
N => Loved Breakfast in the roof garden Ill not copy the previous positive review but would like to add how much I liked the rooftop barcafe  It was a quite stunning place to have breakfast or a drink in the evening  I watched the sun go down reflected off the Chrysler building vellous The art through the three bars was superb Hirsts spin dot and butterfly paintings as well as loads of good Schnabels Warhols Harings and a Basqiat  The rooms also had some great unsigned Magnum prints The only slight negative would be the overprotective nature of the waitresses in the hallowed Rose Bar tried to tell us our table was quotreservedquot and that we would have to leave it at   they did relent however when my wife feisty informed the concierge that she would be quotunhappyquot if we had to move The gym was a pleasant small hotel gym with a good view of the park I actually prefer it to any of the other Schrager hotels including Sandersons  
N => Bring your flashlight Our first impression was very good but hallways and rooms are very dark  Housekeeping left lights always in a low intensity  We needed to turn all lights up as well as blinds to avoid self injuries  Loft rooms are equal to regular rooms in other US hotels but I think these had very nice space compared to other New York hotels  Location is excellent  Loved the area of Gramercy and Union Square filled with new restaurants  Staff always say YES but things NEVER happened  Room service is slow and food quality is ok small breakfast selection  
N => What a joke Of all the hotels in NYC the Gramercy Park Hotel is the WORST The place is dark and not welcoming  The rooms feel old and are not comfortable  We could not even get into the bar  This hotel does not care one bit about paying guest  For  a night you get NOTHING We could not wait to leave and change hotels  Save yourself the aggravation and stay somewhere ells  A note to the hotel manager  Please don t respond to my review  It is bad enough that you feel compelled to defend you poorly run hotel on every bad review  Face it there are much better places to stay in NYC  
N => Experience lovely overall but red by false advertising My boyfriend and I chose the Gramercy Park Hotel out of several luxury hotels in NYC to celebrate our anniversary  The staff was nice and accomodating and I loved the or of the lobby and the bars and the room The bed was very comfortable and the products in the bathroom were very nice  My biggest disappointment was that the rooftop bar which was advertised both on the website and in the list of amenities found in the room was not open  I was so looking forward to hanging out in an exclusive club with a great view we werent told it wasnt open until we ran into a staff member in the elevator  Also we were told we couldnt even go to the Rose Bar after  even though I had attempted to make reservations over a month in advance and was told to check with the concierge when I arrived  I emailed the info email to let them know of my disappointment about the rooftop bar and received no reply  This surprised me as I expected such an expensive hotel to have better customer service follow up especially since I was just trying to be a good consumer and share my experience So all in all it was a nice hotel but not the oasis of exclusivity and luxury I had expected for the price  We would probably try somewhere else next time but I would definitely like to see the rooftop bar when it finally opens and would revisit the Rose Bar  
N => Ian Shrager has better hotels  The vibe was kind of serious  The Hotel is OK  In terms of Design we missed Phillipe Stark s vision which had a large sense of humor amp a real magical quality  We love staying at the hotel s designed by him  I felt this hotel took itself too seriously evidenced by the too precious for words guests prancing around the lobby amp unisex bathrooms  Kind of gothic amp a modern Baroque style there were clever things that stood out but really didn t do all that much for us  As for the Dark rooms  Yup  ours was which was fine      night but during the day We had to turn on all the lights even with the blinds open  I also thought most of the furniture was uncomfortable  Thought the bed was a too firm amp lots of stiff high back chairs Even in the lobby  We ordered room service both mornings  Extremely expensive  Higher than most but very very good  The staff were very friendly all around amp accommodating even after not having our reservation I forgot the Conf    amp booked through TableThotels com  HOWEVER a couple of things that REALLY annoyed us amp they should get rid of this ridiculous policy pronto is having to show your keys to the  bouncer  at night before entering the hotel lobby Both nights we went out to see friends amp came back   am the st night amp am the next  The st night the BouncerDoorman was talking to a gaggle of people amp he was blocking the entrance  When we went to move around him to go in he slid over amp blocked us amp said  Can I help you  Hmmm       yeah  you can move out of the way so we can go to bed  So we just said We re trying to go in  amp he said  Oh You re staying here  when we nodded wan surprised looked he let us in right away but we thought that was too much really  He was nice enough but how stupid to make them do that  That s never happened to either of us in all of our lives when entering a hotel amp we ve stayed in over   We thought be it was a one off but the nd night it happened again amp we had to show our keys this time to prove we were staying there It s a freakin  hotel not a club for cripes sakes  Even   the  members only  hotel guests club  like Soho house we never had to flash our card before entering or even when we got through the door The other big thing that annoyed us was that stupid rule that even hotel guests have to make a reservation   the Rose Bar  Just pretentious  We made a reservation to which we were an hour late for due to a dinner party we went to starting later than expected the bar was practically empty amp still wouldn t let us in  Crazy  Overall we re glad we saw it amp tried it but won t go back amp doubt we d recommend it  There are much better hotels in the city  Great area though  
N => Waste of money My husband received overnight room for a special birthday gift  Based upon Ian Shraegers name and reputation we wanted to see what the hype was  We had stayed there before reations and had a pleasant experience and really enjoyed rooftop bar Unfortunately the hotel was not what we expected  Unless you want to cross every palm with a tip beware of what the results might be  We arrived at had a pleasant check in   our room had been upgraded from a superior to a deluxe although the heat and air did not work  We reported it immediately and left for the boat show giving maintainance  hours to correct  I suppose since we did not tip Aiden to make the report nobody ever showed and as a result I had to complain at  oclock when we returned By the time somebody came and finally told us that the valve needed to be replaced we were a little harried as we were expecting friends by  Finally they moved us to what they said was an upgrade although the room was the same but had a view of the park Try and get into the RoseBar even though empty    forget it    stay out with the peons and drink at the small Jade bar    we did have fun and lhed as the so called beautiful people pranced past us to the Rose bar at midnight   I did try to make a reservation online as suggested although they did not honor it without going through the concierge who of course wanted a reward as well Better off going to the Hudson or any of the other boutique hotels 
N => schrager nonsense Stayed there at  a night  Room was very cool and nice I had a small suite  Biggest negative was ridiculously small dark bathroom  Hotel would have a got a ent review if I hadnt experienced the most ridiculous situation in my only night hanging at the hotel  Went to the lobby bar the only place to have a drink with a friend  Popped out to the restroom and was refused re entry with my friend still in there with our drinks wondering what happened to me Seriously The place was now booked for a private party  Obviously I went berserk and was allowed back in but ruined my night  I cant even believe they get away with allowing the only communal area to be booked in the first place   what are hotel guests supposed to do Outrageous even for a Schrager hotel  What you get when you stay at a hotel that also tries to be a happening spot  Still Ive never had this before and Ive stayed at the Delano Sanderson etc  Last time at a schrager hotel  
N => Worth every penny by NYC standards Spacious room interesting or  cool bars and friendly staff was what we found  The only anti climax was a key to Gramercy Park  What a joke The park is a small dump  The rose bar had an unbeliveably high celeb count on Friday night but be warned you must book ahead  This was a far superior experience to our next stop  Thompson that was similarly priced but had none of the wow factor  
N => Overpriced and arrogant staff I stayed one night in the GPH and that was more than enough  The rooms are very tinny specially the bathroom  If you pay  you can expect a little bit more The lobby is ok and the bar is nice if they allowed you to get in  I ll tried to get in the bar but the bouncer refused to let me in  Hotel guest or not made no differences  Friends of the doormen walked in and out but No Hotel guests   In the morning I made my complains to the concierge but he was not under the impression  He reacted very arrogant and didn t take the time to listen to my story  Avoid this overpriced Hotel with their arrogant staff specially the bouncer and concierge  It is not worth your money you can find much better in NY Amsterdam ember   
N => Trying to be too cool I stayed for  nights overall its a nice hotel nice or moody lighting throughout inc bathrooms not good when getting ready  I found the hotel nice enought but was let down by poor service and the ultra trendy bar was just a nigte to get into  I have stayed at similar hotels  Thompson although found they treat you quite well if youre a guest here it made no difference  I tried  different nights to get in the doorman was totally oblivious to the fact that I was staying there  In addition when I checked out the bellman sent me with someones else suit carrier    luckily I realised an hour aftewards otherwise it could have ended up very badly for me  I didnt find the concierge particualrly helpful either  
N => Amazing new NY hotel experience  
N => Fabulous Stay  
N => Not impressed  
N => Its Still Rock and Roll to me      
N => Fantastic location The proximity to Grand Central Station and the Newark airport shuttle stop made this hotel a very convenient location  Front desk was busy but I was helped quickly and checking in early wasnt an issue  Initially I was put in an extremely small room but after noticing how much larger other rooms were I called to request a change which was denied  But after speaking with a different front desk agent in person I was given a slightly more spacious room  Furnishings were above average and public areas seemed clean and well maintained  Overall an excellent business choice for NYC  
N => huge room clean quiet hotel and friendly staff stayed for  nights recently  We were able to check in early which was great after a long flight Our room was on the th floor and was extremely quiet no noise from ajoining rooms  the room was clean and nicely orated and it was massive Throughout our stay the staff we met were extremely helpful and friendly  It was close to Times Square and we were able to walk to all attractions We enjoyed our stay and would use this hotel again  
N => ITS TRUE HOTEL IS MAINLY CONFERENCE WEDDING  Great hotel but not really made to feel welcome so busy you are lost in the crowd weddings seem to take over the hotel we were told not to use lifts until around  wedding guests had used them  Also business meeting sometimes makes you feel like a second class citizen did not attempt room service as it was  for a cup of tea I think I would try another hotel when I return to New York 
N => Room was not not clean Got a room that had dirty towel and washcloth on the floor of the bathroom  Bed was a bit rumpled also  Called houskeeping who kept promising that within th next  hr someone would be up to clean   an hour turned into  hours with me calling them about  times  Seems I was begging them  My collegeage was checked in on the same floor so I did not want to relocate  Otherwise I would have gone back to reception and requested a room change  
N => pretty good overall great location Stayed here  nights and after some scathing reviews was pleasantly surprised  Check in was fast room was good  The refurb is tasteful and stylish  Bathrooms are small but there is enough space on the wall shelves to put things  Good location connected to Grand Central and so close to Bryant Park  The walls are paper thin so you will hear nice  On two mornings the people next door had fairly loud music and lots of coughing and it was like they were in your room  To provide a kettle and some tea bagscoffee is so basic and happens all over the world yet this is not the case here and to be honest seems cheap  I paid a fairly high rate for this hotel as a Grand Hyatt but not even a tea bag  The worst part though was the strong smoky smell  To me this room was definitely a smoking room previously and this spoiled the experience totally  
N => Ordinary Grand Hyatt in Extraordinary New York Stayed here for  days with my Mum and Dad  We had  people to a twin standard room  Mum and Dad left for their Canadian holiday after  days so cabin fever wasnt a problem Got a good rate  USnight by trawling through the hotel websites and finding a mismatch between them and the Hyatt website  Used the Hyatt Best Rate guarantee to get the rate down to USnight  Ridiculously cheap for NY  Was also considering the riott on Times Sq but my Hyatt membership and potential points earning got this one over the line  Wanted a hotel that had some luxuries and was clean and comfortable plus I was comfortable with the Hyatt brand Check in was easy  Check out   there was a queue but I tried the automatic machine checkout   it was easy to use  Room was small   expected in NY  View out the window was the Chrysler Building very close  Had two double beds   not much room to move around with  people in the room  There was a flat screen tv desk area with executive chair small armchair  One small wardrobe behind the entry door  One good thing was the ability to open the windows   Mums asthmatic and needs fresh air  Beds were comfortable  My Dad stepped on some glass shards already in the room not visible to eye in the carpet  Had to ask housekeeping twice to attend  No in room minibar   you had to go the corridor ice machinedrink dispenser  Hotel is very big   but didnt have to wait long for an elevator Bathroom was small  It had a basin toilet shower over the bath with a shower curtain  Not much room to store toiletries  It was a little dark   could do with more lighting  Water was hot pressure good  Toiletries were good Didnt try any restaurants as I saw a small mouse running along the floor of the restaurant on the first night  I couldnt bring myself to eat in the hotel after this  There are many alternatives for food close to the hotel   delis sandwich shop quotPretquot etc or you could walk  min to Times Square for a meal  Hotel is right next the Grand Central Terminal train station   couldnt hear any train noise at all  Hotel location is a good base for walkingtrain to many NY attractions All in all room was good for the price hotel is in a top spot  But I was expecting more from a Grand Hyatt branded product particularly one in New York  Hotel and room were by far not the same standard as Shanghai Singapore or even Melbourne  It did look a little tired and the rodent sighting worried me  
N => Nice My husband and I ided to try Priceline in an attempt to find an affordable deal to NYC for the Halloween weekend  Not only were we successful in finding a deal it was to the Grand Hyatt no less The hotel was absolutely superb   very grand true to its name  I loved that it was situated over the station and that the central ket was right beneath it  Our room was nice well kept well orated  A glance at the breakfast menu is enough to make anybodys jaw drop to the ground but the situation was remedied by a quick walk in any direction to a more afforable eatery  Although we try to be budget travellers for the most part this hotel has convinced us to simply book it from now on whenever we go to NYC  Its a comfortable clean well located hotel with a level of quiet and luxury that was pleasantly surprising  
N => valentine This hotel was beautiful  Most of the staff were very helpful  It is right beside Grand C Station  My only compliant is that the bar staff are not so nice and we had to wait    min to be served even when the bar had very few people this would never happen and has not happened to us any where else in the world We were told that when u order u have to wait till lounge person carried ur drink to u wierd 
N => I liked it Stayed here in e   We had a very large double room with a walk in closet  The space was really appreciated because of all the shopping we did  Bathroom was kind of small but it did not bother because it was nice and clean anyway and that is more important to me  Location was great also as always in midtown NYC  We had a great deal from Priceline  
N => Not entirely a Grand Hyatt   be a moderately OK one  One of the most amazing things about a regal NYC hotel is its lobby   and admittedly the Grand Hyatt has a beautiful and ornate lobby  However all of the polish and glamour soon wore off when we experienced the front lobby staff As we were unable to use the kiosks we had to make way to the front desk to be assisted by a human being  What we received was a flash of hatred only experienced as an American youth traveling to Communist USSR in the early s  Instead of assisting us the front desk agent went back to her keyboard clacking away while her knitted eyebrows told us that we were almost to the point of death should we bother her with our measly request of checking in to our hotel room About five minutes later a second front desk staff member arrived reassuring us that this was indeed the front desk and this is where we check in  We were given our room assignment confirmed my Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum status and directed to the elevators  Soon we were on our way to room  As part of Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum status Im supposed to get the best room available within the category booked  To all my fellow travelers I sincerely apologize  Based on the state of my room I would surely suggest that your rooms were scarier  Room  featured a lovely cracked closet door mold not crown mold around the door of the bathroom and a toilet wedged between the shower and sink that required the strength and acrobatic skills of Cirque Du Soleil to use  Additionally for all of those that dislike adjoining rooms   you had not one but TWO adjoining rooms   one on each side of the room  Nonetheless the King sized bed was comfortable and the desk area along side the TV was useful to complete work on my partners laptop  The room also had a functional AC and Heater and the noise levels as you faced nd Street were almost inaudible once the window was closed Our further interactions with the hotel staff were just as cordial as our knitted brow friend showing us that customer service is indeed on life support at this hotel  When we called to inquire about the correct method to use to obtain free internet the response was quotIf youre Platinum you should know quot Yes because all hotels are the same  As a FYI When you access the T Mobile hotspot and enter your room number it apparently is automatically removed from your room charges  Bell staff were courteous and unlike many other NYC hotels did not tout their friends town cars or expect tips for helping with bags or hailing cabs  While tips were appreciated there genuinely seemed to be some helpful staff outside of the hotel  Directions and help with getting our navigation straight was truly appreciated  This honestly was the saving grace of service at the hotel   otherwise it would have been a terrible experience With hotels fighting each other to keep in business in this economy abusive service and rooms with cleanliness issues do not win repeat customers  Would it cost that much more to have someone fix a crack kill some mold and coach your front desk people to smile The Hyatt Grand Central NYC has not won a repeat customer here  
N => Unclean slow service not worth the price While I was excited to be staying in such a great location I was not impressed by the hotel  Many areas of the hotel were not clean including the room and service was exceptionally slow  On more than one occasion it took HOURS for them to deliver the extra towels we had requested for our room  I would not recommend this hotel especially for the price  
N => Service doesnt live up to their stars At check in we were assigned a room with a queen size bed and the clerk told me they couldnt change it to a room with  doubles because Id booked with quota rd partyquot I used Priceline  Seriously They only make changes for people who book directly with them and dont use a travel agent or a travel website I wasnt even asking for a more expensive room or a free breakfast    just a room with  beds so we could sleep more comfortably with our  small children  I suppose this is a warning to me not to use Priceline if youre traveling with kids but also I would have thought better of a  star hotel  
N => Gone way downhill in one year This wasnt such a bad place in   I dont think theyve cleaned it since then however  They certainly havent done any maintenance  The first room I checked into smelled horrible   smoke and who knows what else  To their credit they did move me to another room on another quotnon smoking floor quot Getting off the elevator on this new floor th I was hit by a wave of smoke  My room didnt have the odor thankfully but it did have a disgusting carpet with an even more disgusting black mold stain right next to the TV stand  Nice  I think Ill look elsewhere next time  Hyatt is clearly trying to ride out the recession by milking its properties for all their worth which doesnt seem to be much in my opinion  
N => Not so Grand Hyatt NY We stayed at the Grand Hyatt NY for  weeks and expected our stay to be well above average seeing as it is part of the Hyatt chains  We were wrong Our room was on the th floor and we had a view of a high rise which was to be expected as it is New York City after all and there are high rise building everywhere  The windows of the rooms are mirrored so the opposite people in the buildings could not see into our room  This was the least of our problems believe me   The first thing we noticed was mould growing in a corner of the ceiling near the airconheating system and also the paint had started to peel away I guess due to the moisture here  We were going to asked to be moved however I wasnt sure that they had other rooms as most if the US Open Tennis players were also staying there too We also noticed no mini fridge or minibar  We rang the front desk only to be told that this did not come standard and that you had to request for one to be sent to the room at a charge I was certain that I read on their site that minibarmini fridge was included in the room to which the staff member told me shed send one complimentary We also had to request bathrobes and slippers not so much of a hassle it was just weird that this was also not already in the room considering that this was stated on their site Amongst other things our room wasnt clean properly everyday the walls were thin and we could hear people snoring in the next rooms and people walking down the hallways  The staff were not that helpful but we also found this throughout Midtown   we would always get blank stares ignored or replies such as quotI dont knowquot or quotthats not my jobquot which was also a huge disappointment when you asked them for something  Everyone passed the buck and unfortunately we had to endure this for  week Another thing was the draining system  The drain in the bathtub would clog and your feet would be in a pool of dirty water while you showered until about half way during your shower where most of it would drain away  And at times the toilet would also not flush properly too My suggestion to you is to stay somewhere downtown or away from the centre of Manhattan  We received excellent service from retail and food industry as soon as we left Midtown such as in Greenwich Village SoHo and also in Brooklyn  Yes staying Midtown was handy to get to Uptown and Downtown with ease but the NYC Subway and bus systems are so good and so fast that it shouldnt take you long to get from one end of NYC to the other PS  Subway MTA MetroCards are the way to go  We got a  Day unlimited pass for USD and it was gold  You can use it on buses and subway trains all day  Make sure its not the  Day MetroCard USD as this is not unlimited and made of thin paper card  It just has USD worth of credit and you have  days to use it in  What you want is the  UNLIMITED MetroCard which is made of thin plastic Sorry to get off track   this Hyatt did not live up to its reputation of silver service  In general our room left a bad taste in our mouths and also in our noses We have paid less at other Hyatts and received a much better service So no excuses Grand Hyatt NY will not be returning there ever again  
N => This is not a Hyatt I am a Diamond Member of the Hyatt and this was the worst one I have ever stayed in  Even the Members Club where we receive free breakfast drinks etc  was appalling   it was like the entire hotel was invited inside  The entrance of the building is so dark and old it really needs to be bulldozed down and redone  The rooms are ent but its obvious they are completely out of date with additions such as flat screen new fresh linens etc in attempt to spruce things up  I had heard that NY City hotels were a joke and this one sure lived up to that  It was a major bummer to me that the Hyatt in Adelaide Australia pop mln was significantly nicer than the Hyatt in NY      blech  
N => No Service I have the Hyatt Gold Passport and generally speaking Im quite satisfied but I will never return to this Hotel   I booked two rooms for  days this hotel four months in advance asking to get those at the same floor when we arrived they proposed two rooms but at different floors finally after a long discussion they provide us two rooms one was King when we asked for our two teens a two Queens  Before NY we were at the Hyatt Regency in Los Angeles where we spend a great time and we had a very good service even if the Hotel was expensive we knew it  After a good night reception called us and asked us to move to two other rooms at an other floor to due some issues with the water they mentionned that they will manage our luggage if we packed before leaving in compensation they gave us breakfast coupons for the duration of our stay  The inconvenient is that you have to spend at least  hour to get your breakfast    When we return on the evening they gave us two rooms but at different floors we refused and asked for two rooms at the same floor after two hours discussions they finally found two rooms for us but they didnt find our luggages it took them Im saying them because we were obliged to ask several receptionnist before getting some attention two hours to find it   We had no glass in the bathroom six hangers no slippers   for a   Hotel its amaizing   This is a business hotel everything is charged   For our departure we have been obliged to pay  per items for the hotel to keep our luggages Under the quotconciergequot recommendation we aked the bell man for a taxi to go to the Newark Airport but it seems that it was too complicate for him and he said that the best way is to take the Hotelcarit will be the same price around  plus tax but when we arrived at the Airport the driver asked for      an advise dont trust the Hyatt employees for them you are just a banker and you should pay   Other than that the Hotel is well situated    
N => No hot water Yikes   no hot water  Guests upon check in receive a letter saying there is not hot water due to a problem at the adjacent Grand Central Station  Letter does not indicate when the problem will be resolved  I checked in at  pm  Still no hot water now at  pm  
N => new york new york Really enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatthad read some reviews of New York hotels which said they were very smallnot the case with the Grand Hyattmore than adequate spacebeds very comfyshower goodrooms cleanonly tip i would recommend is when checking inrequest a room that isnt one the adjoiningfamily typewe wanted a good nights sleep after travelling so we could get an early start the next dayunfortunately the guests in the adjoining roomnot with us returned at amampided to have a partythere is no soundproofing between the adjoing rooms just what seem like a paper thin doorit felt like the party was in our roombut credit to the staffon complaining the next day we were m oved to a larger corner roomnot adjoiningampa complimentary bottle of wine amp strawberries dipped in chocolate were delivered to our room that eveningall said it was a great stay in New Yorki would recommend this hotel for its locationamp the comfy bedsampclean roomswith all there is to do in NYCyou dont really spend that much time in your room Great place to stay 
N => Loved it Had a great stay  Booked through priceline for an awesome price Got upgraded upon arrival  Great room very clean comfy beds fantastic location  Took advantage of proximity to Grand Central Station and rode the subway often  Never had to use a cab on this trip  Consierge was very helpful and clued us in to some quotnon touristy spotsquot Very large hotel so not very intimate or unique but non the less a great place to lay your heads in comfort after busy days in NYC  
N => Worst Hyatt I have evey stayed in First the good points       well I can only think of two  the location and an impressive lobby area  Other than that I cant believe that Hyatt put their name to this hotel  We have stayed in Hyatts all over the worls we are Hyatt Platinum members  We stayed a total of  nights as part of a longer trip to New York Las Vegas and Mexico  We had booked a Club Room  I had emailed the hotel before we arrived to request early check in we arrived at pm   check in is normally pm   room wasnt ready so we left our bags in storage and headed out  Room was ready when we returned  We got into the lift and were ready to be impressed Oh my word The room was just awful   vary dingy badly in need of a refurb  They had tried to tart it up with a modern lampshade flat screen TV but the room needed a repaint was very dark terrible lighting awful old carpet    and the bathroom    the sink was in the bedroom area sink was repid and vanity worksurface looked like it was about to collapse and the bathroom had just a toilet and bath with old fashioned overhead shower  Extremely old fixtures and fittings and it was so small   I am very petite and I struggled to turn round in the bathroom  Poor quality toiletries and on two occassions maid service forgot to replenish said toiletries  No tea and coffee making facilities in room  No bathrobe or slippers  Bed adequate  Maid service was poor room and bathroom just got a quick going over bath not cleaned adequately   and yes we did leave a tip for housekeeping every day As we had a club room we had access to the club lounge for complimentary breakfast snacks and free soft drinks  Lounge was far too small for the amount of poeple using it   you struggled to get a seat at breakfast if you arrived after  am  Selection of food not bad   but have had a lot better  Staff in the lounge were helpful and polite especially when compared to reception and concierge staff who we found to be quite cold and impersonal For  per night I was bitterly disappointed  I would never stay here again and cannot recommend it  Hyatt should be ashamed and I would have expected a much better hotel from them in New York City  It should be a flagship not a dump 
N => Great Location outrageous room service prices We stayed here for two days after an ocean passage  The room was clean and well organized  The shower was not so good almost no water came out the shower head There was a charge for the internet  The room service price for a cup of coffee was nine dollars plus five dollars per person service charge plus fifteen percent tip  One could order steak for two for   A kiosk in the lobby was a little less expensive  Where we actually ate was in Grand Central Terminal  Had a breakfast sandwich and coffee for two for not much more than that cup of coffee for one would have been  The location was excellent  Walking distance to places to eat and shop  Nice view from our th floor window  
N => The best Hotel location to stay in nyc   on top of Grand Central station the location of this hotel is great so is the view from my hotel window easy to get arround to walk to get subway if you likemy room have plenty space nice shower  i have stay at this Hotel around  times and i recomended to every onewho want to stay in good hotel in NYC 
N => Not a      star Old rooms   no fridge  only on request  smal beds  Is more like a     star  
N => Average  Recently had the pleasure of visitng NYC  Hotel was only average considering it belongs to the Hyatt Group  The room was extremely dusty   so much so that I could smell the dust  There was a large floor lamp right near the air con vent that was covered in dust  The bedside table in between the two double beds had a lower shelf that my dhter put a doll box in and when she pulled it out it came out with cob web style dust things dragging behind it  Gross  The room was quite pokey but I had read about NYC hotel rooms being quite small  The bathroom was tiny the hand basin had no room to put toiletries on whilst getting ready  The hair dryer kept overheating at least     times whilst I was trying to dry my hair in the mornings which was really really frustrating because I had to leave it to cool down before I get started again  We used to put the quotdo not disturbquot sign up so that we could have a sleep in in the mornings but when I would duck out to get coffees whilst my Husband and kids were still in bed I would find housekeepings cart parked outside our room   waiting for us to get out of the room  I found this to be bit pushy and really wanted to wheel their carts down the hallway The foyer also needs a bit of a makeover a lot of gold metal which looks very s  The foyerlobby were always busy  They would put these sheer white curtain things up to try and make an impromtu room within the lobby to host functions   if I had booked a function and it was wedged in their foyerlobby in that fashion I would be most disappointed  Location of hotel is good  I discovered a great fresh food ket around the corner Lexington   part of Grand Central I think it was called Grant Central ket   not sure but it has fresh breads cold meats cheeses fruits veges seafood cakes nuts and heaps more  Towards the end of our stay we got sick of eating out so I would get some fresh bread rolls cold cut meats chesse etc and make our own bread rolls  The variety of food sold is outstanding and the smell when you walk around is delicious  Lastly the rooms do not have fridges but you can request one I think it was  per stay  Recommend it if you want to grab your own supplies from the ket  Overall would probably stay again if I really had to but would demand they clean the dust up in the room  
N => Good location away from Times Square This was our th trip to New York and this time we were travelling with friends on their st time in NYC  We have always stayed in The Times Square area but felt this  be too chaotic an experience for our friends who had their two children with them  On the strength of Trip Advisor reviews we ided to try The Grand Hyatt  The hotel is in a good location  minutes walk to Times Square and  to th Avenue  The check incheck out staff were considerably more friendly and helpful than we had previously experienced in New York  This was the only contact we had with the staff although our friends had a bad experience with their neighbours on the first night and the staff could not have provided a better service for them in arranging a different room  The room we had was large by NY standards and quiet with a very comfortable king size bed on the nd floor  We did not use any of the eateries in the hotel as there are numerous places in the area to suit all tastes and budgets  My only complaint would be the inability to get a coffee in or around the hotel after pm All in all a good place to stay without being exceptional  
N => Not worth the  My husband amp I took our  year old son to NYC as a graduation gift for  nights amp  days  It was a first trip for all  of us to NYC and we were so excited so we figured wed splurge and stay at a nice hotel no matter the cost  Well Id have to say for the first time I felt like I didnt get what I paid for  Ive stayed in a family suite at the Sheraton in Maui on the beach for  the cost yes HALF the cost of what I paid to stay at the Grand Hyatt  The room was small which I expected however when I purchased the quotDELUXEquot room I was expecting a little more room than we actually had Room   I had originally asked for a room with  double beds but when I booked they didnt have any available  Upon check in I asked and they said that they only had the King size bed available  So I requested a roll away for my son simple enough right Nope We went up to our room which was extremely small trying to stay positive and not show my son my disappointment I went down and asked if a double room became available if they could let me know so we could change rooms  They never did contact us  Once the roll away bed was set up there was absolutely no room to walk around the room  Then there was mold in the shower which never got cleaned the entire time we were there  The air conditioner made noise the entire time it ran which made it difficult to sleep  There is ABSOLUTELY no counter space in the restroom to set your toiletries on while getting ready  There was only one very very small dresser under the TV which had tiny drawers in it  You could hear the dinging of the elevator all night long  Needless to say I was highly disappointed with staying at the Grand Hyatt and wished Id spent half the money to stay at another location  I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone that I know is traveling to NYC I do have to say though that the employees at the Concierge desk and out front of the hotel were extremely polite and helpful  Always smiling and very courteous The location of the hotel is great because you can walk to alot of the sites from there  Im just sad that I came home feeling disappointed in the hotel but we still had a fabulous time in NYC 
N => Could be so much better This was our fourth time staying at this hotel and we chose it mainly because of its convenient location next to Grand Central Terminal  We usually stay for  weeks on each visit but this year my husband was there for  weeks on business  The room was unusually small and bathroom sink was tiny  The last couple of visits the rooms have been small but this one couldnt even accommodate a chair in the room  It was right next to the bed so no walking by space The rooms do not come with a coffee maker so we brought ours from home  We had inquired earlier if a coffee maker could be provided in our room but we were told that we would have to check with Housekeeping when we arrived but they could not promise we would have one as it first come first serve basis  I feel they could be more accommodating to people who are staying longer and paying a very expensive room rate andor arriving later in the day  No discounts or reductions given here in the room rate for a longer stay  The rate we paid did include one business shirt to be laundered every day as their website offered but after the second day the laundered shirt would be returned with a  invoice attached to it  When I called down to the desk the guy told me it was only one shirt laundered per visit  My husband had to print out their website the next day at work to show the front desk  The desk agreed after seeing the ad that we were correct  However Housekeeping kept including an invoice on the laundered shirt when it returned to our room  I went to the desk and they told me that the charge would not appeared on our bill upon check out  Indeed we were not charged  Somehow you think they could come up with a better method so not to confuse their hotel guests   The walls in the room are thin and you can hear all the conversations in the next room  If you are a light sleeper this  be a problem  The one thing I can rave about is their breakfast buffet is excellent  Its very expensive and there is no menu  I think it was  per person so you have to be very hungry to enjoy the buffet fresh fruit eggs made to order waffles bacon sausages incredible pastries fresh squeezed orange juice etc   Otherwise they do have a coffee stand that sells muffins bagels amp salads but it was a bit annoying that you couldnt order from a menu  I overheard a few other guests not happy about the discovery when entering the restaurant The hotel is in a great location but I think the next time we are in NYC we will be looking at other hotels to stay at  
N => Clean central location and service with a smile After a delay with our flight my friends and I were ready to just check in and get to our room  We arrived late thanks to our flight checking in around  pm  This was no problem but we were notified by the front desk that because it was a busy week they were unable to give us the two double beds we had requested  Instead they would provide us with a King bed and a cot which by their standards is not the typical fold up uncomfortable bed it was a full out twin sized bed rolled in on end  At the same time another clerk had just told the same thing to another group had been and they were flipping out  We on the other had a little lh and said it was fine  Because we responded so politely the clerk gave us complimentary cards for coffee that lasted us the whole week we were there  Once we got up to the room it was clean and beautifully orated  The only issue we had with the room was the day we asked for our room to be cleaned housekeeping did not provide us with enough replacement towels for the three of us Each time we used the concierge they were very friendly and very helpful  The hotel was only blocks away from Times Square Broadway Rockefeller Centre and Central Park  We really could not have asked for a better hotel  The Grand Hyatt was affordable had friendly staff and couldnt have been a better location for the sights  
N => Great Stay at the Grand Hyatt We booked our trip through the hotel website and received a great rate through a quotStay Four Nightsquot package  The rates ranged from  to  per night  We couldnt believe we could get these rates in NYC Check in was fairly smooth and we received the room that we had booked  We were a little nervous about the noise after reading the reviews so we booked a quotquiet roomquot rm   The room was great The view was the back of the hotel and surrounding buildings which we were willing to sacrifice for a quiet room  We heard next to nothing from our neighbours and very little street noise  We also requested a fridge which they delivered a few hours after check in  As it turned out the electrical outlet for the fridge didnt work at the time we thought the fridge didnt work so requested a new one in the morning  When we returned in the afternoon the fridge hadnt been replaced so we called again  The new fridge was there when we returned again at  pm  I also checked the cleanliness of the bathroom when we arrived a few negative reviews on bathrooms  The shower curtain was not moldy my only complaint was a few hairs left in the tub and sink  There was an ironing board but no iron in our room  It took about  minutes for them to get one to us  Much faster than the fridge Our room was cleaned well everyday The room was really large by NY standards  We stayed at the Doubletree in  and found both the room and bathroom to be much larger at the Hyatt  Although the bathroom was smallish there were some shelves under the pedestal sink to put some stuff We never ate at the hotel since it seemed pricey and there are so many places to eat in NYC  Thanks to reading previous reviews we were aware of the dining concourse at Grand Central  Also fellow Canadian Tim Hortons fans a Tim Hortons opened just down nd St    min walk west Also there is a Duane Reade across the street with some food and supplies no produce though  Check out was great as well we found the woman Patty to be extremely friendly and helpful Overall we were very pleased with our stay  It was a very nice hotel and the price and location were hard to beat Enjoy 
N => Dont believe everything you read I just got back from NYC and We stayed at the Grand Hyatt  I was little concerned when I booked because the reviews we not looking so good I thought be I should see if I could cancel my booking  I am glad that I didnt  I am not sure why people complain about noise  I did not hear one thing and I was there for  nights  We had a room with a king size bed which was perfect  The room itself was quite spacious the bathroom was little small but really all you are doing is taking a shower or using the toilet so do you really need a huge bathroom  It is right next to Grand Central Station and about a   minute walk to Times Square  This feature itself should draw you to this hotel  Overall a great stay 
N => Not a great hotel This is supposed to be a  star hotel according to Priceline I was here for two nights after spending  nights at the Omni Berkshire Place  Absolutely no comparison  The Hyatt is worn loud crowded with less than stellar service  I was on the Club floor but was not given access to the regency club room  Ordered room service food was not as picutred in the menu but tasted allright  Restaurant was closed upon checkin for some reason  Bathroom had no hot water at  am so I took an ice cold shower Fitness center was nice and the lobby bar was pretty nice as well  Paid night on Priceline which I thought was a good rate  Also the location is good for families or groups   close to times square the subway and all midtown amenities Overall unimpressed by this property and I think it is not up to the standards Ive seen at other Hyatt hotels Honolulu San Fran etc  
N => Pleasantly Surprised My family wife  amp  year old children booked our room via Priceline com and were a little worried once we found out the hotel was the Grand Hyatt because there were quite a few bad reviews  However once we arrived we were able to breath a sigh of relief  The staff was very courteous and we were checked in quickly with no problems at all  The room was fine  It wasnt huge but that wasnt an issue for us  The room was clean had no funky smells and the bed was very comfortable  The chair folded out to a bed for our  year old and a roll away bed was brought in for our  year old  We were only in the room to sleep in and it served that purpose very well  The location of this hotel is fantastic as it is close to so many good destinations in the city  Cabs were always available outside the doors so getting around was very easy if we ided not to walk  We would stay here again with no issues  
N => Okay  but would stay else where next time I have been to NY before but was staying for  weeks this time so I was able to get a good price for a long stay  In general it was okay but it is no frills and I expected more for the price I did pay  No coffee maker or fridge even in the suite I stayed in  To get coffee and bagel for room service it was over   The sit down breakfast you only had a buffeet option  The lobby is a lot darker than in pictures to the point I had my map super close to my face to see  It was not easy to check in and was given a run around  I struggled with luggage out of the cab with the Hyatt staff just standing and watching with no offer to help  When needing to store luggage the man was blatantly rude  Walked into my room as it was being cleaned and I was told I could take a seat while she finished  The bed pillows were thrown on the floor tons of guest have walked on   which then placed on the bed to be slept on No storegift shop to buy basic things like advil or a brush  
N => Great staff disappointing room nice location  A great beginning our rooms were not yet ready so the man at the bell desk soothed our travellers wearines with a round of complimentary drinks  Once settled in our rooms the heater inexplicably came on  Repairman was there in minutes although the option of a room change was offered  Business offerings like high speed executive suite etc were up to par but in room usb charging staions would be a great addition in these days of handhelds and st phones Hated the extra cost fitness center  laid out an extra  for sweat glistening exercise equipment in a badly ventilated room Over the near riot continental breakfast my clients found we had all been serenaded by the amorous newlyweds next door  Nice if youre invited to the party but annoying if youre not  
N => Great Great Great location     and the hotel is OK  Used to live in this hotel for several days in e   It was my first trip to New York and all i needed was the city itself you know views walks etc  The hotel was a   hit The hotels location was amazing Beautiful Grand Central is adjacent to the hotel with direct corridor between them Short walk to a very inspiring and intimate Bryant park  minutes to Times Square  minutes to Fifth Ave etc  etc  etc The rooms were more than just OK but i should admit   not exceptional  Small bath tube broken plunge  Asked service to mend it they just took it out   But this is a trifle in comparison to a price you pay for the location Recommend this place to tourists who can survive without Ritz Carlton   
N => Everything you could possibly you could need for your trip  I cant say enough how great it was to stay in this hotel  The staff was more than accomodating and they were always eager to help  It started from the time of check in  The guy standing next to the check in machines wouldnt even take a tip after he had been so helpful with us  The hotel couldnt have a better location  You are so close to time square but still far enough that you dont feel overwhelmed with the crowds  It is connected to grand central station so you can be anywhere you want in the matter of minutes  
N => Passing grade be worth half price be Im staying at this hotel right now  I got a solid deal off Pricegrabber which considering the location   makes it worthwhile even if it was a rat infested dormatory  Its not nearly that bad but youd be disappointed if you paid anything close to rack rates  Heres why Im not impressedRooms are noisy   walls are paper thin can hear phone conversations of next door neighbors  It sucks bring earplugs problem solved Bathroom has some nice products but definitely showing some age  Shower pan is crackednasty at edges reminded me of a nasty college shower  Maid service is good however everything is wiped clean No view from my room   theyve got loads of interior ish facing rooms that are basically worthless for a view  Once again fine if youre paying    of rack rate not if youve ponied up the big bucks Location is good but not great   not many lines connect to Grand Central and Ive found myself walking a fair amount to get to most of the fun places  What do you expect for Midtown East Very functional not much charm I paid less to stay at the Hilton up on th last year   which had a much nicer room  It was a bit smaller but much more sophisticated and well finished  Location was also a bit more desirable steps from Central Park Lettermans studio etc  
N => XMAS AT THE GRAND HYATT   A comfortable family room  modern finishes excellent location you save on cab fare being attached to Grand Central Terminal  Also good places to eat at the terminal They however do not have a coffee machine in the rooms so you need to buy amp I found myself paying bet   for a cuppaWithin easy walking distance to theatres and attractions Also got a good deal by booking on the hotel website I would definitely stay here again 
N => Very convenient We go to NYC every Christmas arriving Christmas Day amp departing New Years Eve  We have stayed at the Grand Hyatt Christmas  amp   Our first trip was very positive we celebrated our th anniversary and the Hyatt upgraded us  Last holiday season we got a taste of a regular room pretty typical small NYC hotel room  Cleanliness was not up to Hyatt standards the last trip  Obvious that room had not been vacuumed amp not all bathroom amenities were present we had to ask for some  Last year I did notice bare spots in elevator carpets amp lobby furniture looked v  tired  Also no in room coffee  Have to use small kiosk in lobby to buy it and lines can get v  long  How frustrating  I did write the manager about the above complaints amp never received a response expected to hear since we are Hyatt quotfrequent stayersquot membersPositive Staff very friendly and helpful  Short indoor walk to Grand Central Station where almost all trains amp subways can be found including  minute shuttle to Times Square  Also some wonderful shops and nice restaurants  Pretty lobby with waterfall We will probably stay there again since the location is so convenient for us to catch the subways and Im hoping the Grand Hyatt will be up to Hyatt standards this year  
N => Great location OK hotel The hotel location is fantastic  For NYC the value of this hotel might be just fine  When I checked in early I spent the day wondering around and came back to find out that the room they set aside had been given away already  The negative parts to this hotel was the room we were in smelled a bit musty the clock was an hour off this was not around daylight savings time either the caulk in the tub was moldy and there was not a fan in the bathroom  The furniture also was surprisingly frayed  However we could open the windows which helped circulate the air a bit  Again if you are in NYC chances are you are not spending a lot of time in your hotel room and be it was just our room  I was expecting a little more from a Hyatt  The concierge was wonderful and again the location has you accessible to many of the sites  
N => Good hotel Pro location large room cleanCons internet access day a bit noisy a bit too expensive We booked through a promo night pre paid non refundable  I knew the hotel I paid previously night and swear I would not return  But for  was acceptable I had to do the booking in a rush  Room was fine this time  I hate when they request a lot of money for internet access seems like a luxury  HELLO it should be like electricity nowadays Imagine paying a fee per day for electricity    
N => You almost pay to breath Very beautiful and well located hotel beside the Grand Central Terminal  But as a hotel that has a average price of U  p day is difficult to understand why they charge the use of wi fi internet    each hs and why I payed almost U  to receive a package with some clothes that my wife both  When I was doing my check out I was worry if they where charging the air that I breathed during my stay  
N => Grand MOTEL Hyatt I had to wait for a couple of weeks before writing this review since I was too upset to be objective What a stay  days just pain from first until last day  I am a Diamond member I love Hyatt but this one exceeded my expectation in the disapointment section Check in long waiting line they installed automatic check in machine like in airports but in  days I have never seen anyone using them Room Small old and tired awful bathroom no space to put anything my bed was  inches from the door  bed room only positive bed was comfortable  Door closing mechanism is very noisy door doeant close I could see through the door Noise As mentioned by other writers if you want to sleep go elsewhere  This is a motel not a hotel  Student groups everywhere Easter partying all night  I had to threaten reception to call  for them to do something about it Club lounge nice but too small too many people and no free alcohol not even a beer  USD the rooms are the same so dont bother to pay the USD  difference between non club and club floor  Unhelpful staff unless you want to book a show   tried to ask about check in NO check out NO i e  go down and queue like everyone elseStaff never there no one answering the phone unless it is  am and you cannot sleep because of noise Location the only real positive point next to Grand central easy NorthSouth commutingCheck out can we stay until  no until  can I speak to manager bla bla bla Diamond member   who caresI am not a specialist in NYC rarely go there  I trusted the Hyatt brand but it shouldn t apply to this hotel  Sell it or close and refurbish but please work on accoustic insulation  
N => Great NYC Hotel Check in was great and we were upgraded to the club level  The room was spacious by NYC standards and was clean  The linens were really nice and the bed comfortable  The bar was nice though pricey and was open late  Our only complaint was that someone in the room next to us left room service items in the hallway and they were not cleaned up for several hours  
N => Great Location Great hotel We found a great deal for this hotel using TravelZoo  Centrally located next door to Grand Central Station  blocks from th Ave  The Check in was all done electronically which was easy to follow but it would have been nice to actually speak to someone The concierge was extremely helpful every time we went to his desk area  Everyone working at the hotel were friendly helpful and always smiling They seem genuinely happy to see us The elevators were arated into the first  floors and then   so we were express to the th floor which meant no milk run elevator rides  We were on the rd floor  near the top and had a fantastic view of the Chrysler Building Our room was comfortable with a very good chair for work at the desk  lumbar support  Flat screen TV too  The beds could have been a bit cushier but there were lots of pillows and extra blankets if we wanted them  I had a couple occasions to speak to housekeeping and to the front desk  Both times my questions were answered in a friendly way and anything we required was seen to immediately  There was no fan in the bathroom but it wasnt a big deal  We had a window in our room that opened  There are vending machines and ice on every floor and every morning there were newspapers available on each floor  There is a shuttle service to the Newark Airport only one block away from the hotel    to the airport  We loved staying here and will do so again and again 
N => Walls as thin as paper be it was just my room but I could hear people in the hall and those next door as if they were in the room  Every time the elevator came and went I knew it  Every time the people next door were talking with each other it was as if they were talking to me  
N => Great Hotel  Me and my girlfriend stayed at the hotel ch th amp th   It was my first trip to the city and was very pleased with the hotels close proximity to Grand central station since we took the train  The staff was very helpful and friendly and very accommodating  We asked for a view of nd street and when we got to our room we were a little dissapointed because our room did not have a clear view of the street  The bathroom was rather small but the room itself was very nice and clean  The bed was a king size and was very comfortable  
N => Its ok not the  Star its built up to be Ok great location so give it serious props for that  I mean you can be anywhere in the city in minutes thanks to its connection to Grand Central Station but the hotel Average  Only the weary traveler would complain about escalators up to check in but revolving doors that dont fit checked luggage just kind of irritates me  The staff is friendly enough and the lobby is massive  Impressive with a water fall  Then because I Pricelined my hotel I was stuck in a room that was amazingly bad  Old  Thats the best way to describe it  O L D  I realize Trump did this as his first hotel ades ago but it feels O L D  Worn  Cold  Clammy even  everything worked and the room was a nice size by NYC standards though my view of the air conditioning unit was hysterical  Its not a bad place just not the  star billing  one more thing who still charges   a night for the internet  Shame Shame Shame 
N => Cheap with bad quality Very expensive in any other services but you can bid on priceline to get a good price if you want to stay close to Times Square  Staff and service are bad  Location is excellent and safe 
N => Great location My sister and I chose this hotel for the location  Located right beside Grand Central Station you are walking distance to Time Square and close to subway lines  The room was spacious by New York City standards  The bathroom was small and clean but was in a need of an update  The bed was very comfortable but the pillows could have been fluffier  We found our room to be very quiet as we had a corner unit  
N => would reccomend this hotel and would go again just got back after staying  nights in grand hyatt found it very good valu for money good location clean and staff very helpful we did have an adjoining room and could hear everything next door were saying but just went to reception and told them said it was no problem and put us in another room straight away this was excellent  the location was good but would have liked tea making facilities lovely being next to Central station no noise from this but was very handy for meals   would go again to t his hotel went to Rosie O gradyson the night but made the mistake of getting a rickshaw type bike ride there charged us  for  min ride   in a taxi  
N => Not as Grand as I would have liked it  If you stay in a lot of hotels you  be as disappointed as I was  If you dont travel a lot you  be as happy as some of those who have given positive reviews  Heres how I see it  The Good Stuff Very Friendly Staff Room size location concierge lounge fast elevatorsThe Bad Stuff Hotel Room  dirty stained carpet mold in the bathroom broken or warn furnishingsIf you can get a good rate below  a night I think you can get a good nights rest  If you have to pay more for that then find another hotel  Safe travels  ttz 
N => Great Location Stayed in a kingsize room on nd floor room   The room was a ent size bed very comfortable bathroom was small and dated but adequate  The lack of tea and coffee making facilities is something that the management of this hotel need to get sorted  New York is a very cold place in ruary and I dont think this is alot to provide take note management Its the difference between getting a repeat booking and not  We didnt experience any noise from other rooms just the usual corridor noise but even that wasnt too bad  Couldnt really hear the street noise either which was great  I have stayed in some bad hotels in New York and paid good money so I was pleasantly surprised this time  Tina on the concierge was most helpful  Overall a good experience  
N => Good location average quality for the price As a Platinum Hyatt Gold Passport member I have stayed at my fair share of Hyatt properties around the world  The Grand Hyatt New York is worst to date  The deluxe king room was a ent size but old worn dirty and noisy  Housekeeping was far below par with sub standard room cleaning taking place each day   even after complaints were made to management  Beware if you end up in a connecting room as soundproofing between rooms just does not exist  For the money I would suggest trying to find another hotel offering better value  
N => Great location great price through Priceline    I booked this room through Priceline for  a night for a long Valentines Day weekend  I was not expecting a large room or a bathroom as it is NYC  The room was not small and our queen bed fit perfect in it  The bathroom was small but I was able to get ready it in with no problems  I had no problem hearing our neighbors but I did hear street noise th floor which I expected  The staff were friendly maid service started very early though  am so make sure you put your privacy sign up if you dont want to be bothered that early  To get to the hotel I paid  via cab at eleven pm  Grand Central Station was great to have next door good food choices and the subway  I would definitely stay here again for the price   
N => Dull   Much better alternatives in NYC Good location but I found this hotel to be a little dull and uninspriing and pretty dated  Its not cheap either and I think there are better places to stay nearby like the Bryant Park I wouldnt stay here again by choice but wouldnt be upset if I had to for business  
N => Felt Like I was Camping Stayed on the th floor  Room looked modern while on the small side but thats normal for Manhattan  Our room was adjoined to someone elses so VERY loud all night long  While we were all in bed my  year old told me to get off of my cell phone  It was the room next door talking that he heard You could literally hear every word spoken by these strangers  Also no hot water and shower was broken  I asked to be moved the next night  On the th floor the room was a corner room and about   larger no charge  All night long I could hear the people across the hall screaming in the hallway  My wife yelled at them from bed at one point and they quited  Hotel staff were very friendly the hotel is just not sound proof  Even on the th floor you hear sirens and horns all night long  Location is perfectly central  Overall the stay was not restful so perhaps try a different hotel I stayed at the Raddisson on Lexington last time and the room was not nearly as nice but hotel was quiter  Also valet tried to charge me  upon checkout for parking that Id already paid  
N => Great Location This hotel is located next to Grand Central Station which was very nice  It is in a central location which made cab fare to our destinations inexpensive  The staff was friendly and able to provide information on sites and train travel  However the room was small and very dusty  You could literally see the dust on the phone and nightstand  The hair dryer had dust and lint build up in the fan  The shower had a strange smell to it  The menu prices were rediculously high  Not to mention valet parking is  for every  hours which we did not discover until later in the evening  We took our car to a parking garage just across the th street bridge and was able to pay  a day and took the train back to the hotel  When we checked out the cab ride back to our car was only  for a total of  compared to  for valet  
N => great weekend We arrived very late at the hotel because we had problems when arriving at the airport so the room we should have had was not available so we were upgraded to a larger room  The room had a great view out onto the main road but high up so we were not effected by road noise that you could complain about  The size of the room was great with a sitting area and a large TV  The bed was very good and of a very large size for me and my wife  We did not have breakfast at the hotel as it was expensive but a cafe across the road which was great  We also found the bar priced expensive as we only used this once on the night we arrived which was very late to go looking for a bar  I would go back to the hotel as it is a great location and the reception staff were great  Also the hotel was clean and tidy at all times and not noisy  
N => liked it but    We stayed for a long weekend just before Christmas and as has already been mentioned we found this hotel to be in a really good location although NY is really easy to get round no matter where you stay The lobby is lovely and looks quite classy loved the Christmas orations   really tasteful and the restaurant which overhangs the entrance served some very nice food at lunchtime which we really enjoyed albeit at a somewhat elevated price We found our room to be of a good size Club floor   bags of room even though we had an extra bed for our dhter  The beds were really good including the extra one   nice proper mattress amp boy did we need them to be as we all went down with heavy coldsmild flu while we were there typical The club lounge was somewhat small amp lacking in character but it served a reasonable breakfast but I really didnt like the coffee machines   felt a bit motel like to me   really expected some sort of service So all in all a nice comfortable hotel for a short stay   so why the butWell customer service was not exactly consistent  We had problems with our room key when we arrived amp it took a few trips down to reception to sort out club concierge near our room let me know that it wasnt her problem   have a nice dayIt also took  requests amp another trip to reception yes you guessed it club concierge just smiled to get the extra bed set up in our room even though I asked for one when I booked I have to say however service did seem to depend on the individual as on our second day we had a lovely lady in the club who was more than helpful My second but refers to the bathroom   OMG its small I also notice that although it was generally clean it was in a superficial way ie dirt behind things   yes I know thats picky but cleanliness is important to me amp when you find someones used sock when you move a chair in the room you kind of start to question things Anyway overall a good stay but I would probably look to stay somewhere else next time  
N => Well exceeded expectations From the reviews read prior to staying here expectations were not too high but ided if nothing else it would be a central base for our week in New York between Christmas and New Year  However from the moment we stepped out of the cab outside the hotel we were greeted by pleasant smiling staff until the end of our stay  The hotel lobby was very busy and quite impressive  We arrived earlier than our check in but were offered a room straightaway  The room was a ent size the bathroom compact but absolutely fine clean and well laid out with a walk in wardrobe  The king bed was very comfortable  The cleaning staff seemed to be very efficient  We were lucky not to be bothered by any external noises Im quite a light sleeper Location of the hotel couldnt be better right beside Grand Central with a passageway linking the hotel and station We didnt dine in the hotel restaurant and the bar although pleasant was nondescript Both check in and check out was very efficient All in all it was a very enjoyable experience and we will certainly stay here again  
N => Not the best Hyatt     I used points for my stay so I guess I cant complain too much  The hotel was just fair  The best part of it was its proximity to Grand Central Station literally right next door  I was upgraded to a quotlargerquot room which I guess is larger only by NYC standards  The room was clean however just not your typical upscale Hyatt  The next morning I called room service and tried to order  cups of coffee or a pot and  croissant  Luckily I asked how much the total was because they did not have these items on the menu  They came back with a charge of   Can you believe it The only reason I would stay at this location again is if I had business in the east end area as it is so close to the train  
N => Excellent for the price Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor before I booked I wasn t expecting too much  Small beds small rooms but this is New York what else could you expect We must have just struck lucky large cosy room with one of the most comfortable beds ever  We ended up staying at the Hyatt for a week in room   No view as its towards the rear of the hotel but also very little street noise The cons  Very expensive room service  plus service for a coffee  No in room facilities coffee tea or mini bar  the cost of the room service put us off using other facilities in the Hotel so I can t comment on the bar or breakfastThe Pros  Excellent size room huge comfortable bed large LCD TV with choice of in house movies not free  Speedy lift service especially as the th floor can use either lift bank  En Suite although not the largest always had plenty of hot water and a good shower I did hear other people complaining about room noise but either we had quiet neighbours or they liked listening to us or our room was jus lucky to have thicker walls The hotel reception is very modern and grand but sometimes we felt it a bit impersonal  We like others found the link to Grand Central to be very useful for the restaurants and for getting about  On our last trip to NYC we stayed at the Casablanca which although was a lot more personal wanted to charge us more than double the rate that we obtained at the Hyatt through Expedia  We would definitely stay here again even if both rates were the same  
N => Christmas at the Hyatt Just back from Christmas in New York and a stay at the Grand Hyatt  After reading previous comments posted was a bit concerned but did not need to be  Staff were extremely friendly and courteous location excellent next to Grand Central  Room absolutely fine beds very comfortable no problem sleeping  Did not have a problem with noise from rooms next door never heard a thing  Check out was smooth facility to leave luggage and also travel documentation in safety deposit to save carrying it around  A fantastic stay would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay there again without hesitation  
N => Definitely not a four star hotel My mother and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York for Christmasas a short holiday break  Upon arrival we were really impressed with the grand entrance lobby  Check in was also nice and easy with unpretentious staff  Judging by the appearance of the lobby my mother and I expected to have the same wow factor in our hotel room  Sadly that was not the case as our room was small in every way  The window bathroom and beds were small in size compared to what we are use to  Such a disappointment as all the money was obviously put into the grand entrance lobby and nothing else  Someone had to fix our heating system on the first night  The bathroom was a bit worn with an uncollected hair on the soap dish from a previous guest the night before  The bath products were horrible the soaps had an awful smell that made me almost vomit  Ive stayed in three star hotels that had better bath products than this  Shame on you Hyatt you can do better  The rooms were so dark with hardly any natural light coming in  Putting on my makeup was a challenge as the only bathroom mirror was hard to see things close up  I advise to do all of your shaving and plucking before you arrive as you wont be able to see properly otherwise  Im a neat freak so I notice small details that someone else might not notice  The staff was very helpful and approachable  The beds were small but very comfortable as I slept like a baby on both nights  The internet service was quick and easy costing me   per night  The restaurant manager gave me a cup of tea on the house to take to my room from the bar lounge because I was feeling at bit tired and did not want to sit in the lounge to drink my tea The hotel serves Starbucks teas and coffee which was a big plus due to the fact that I love Starbucks  The bag check guy came over to get my ticket for my bags before I was even near that section  That showed good observation by the staff   The self check out was great as we did not want to stand in a line because we were to excited to hit the shops  Lord and Taylors is in walking distance along with other shops and attractions  If your looking for a beautiful retreat like room that makes you feel like your living in luxury sorry this is not the place  However if youre in New York on Business or you want a nice modern and convenient place to bring the family than I would definitely recommend the Grand hyatt for your stay  
N => Quick stop in NYC A huge hotel in the middle of Manhattan but also as many of the big chains hotels very common and standard  The location is the best part of this hotel but the rooms standards are not that special  The bathroom was very simple  I would say its not worth the cost but probably more for business travellers Location Right in the middle of the city with easy access to everything  Grand Central Terminal in the same building a quite large and busy street so its easy to get a taxi  Walking distance to shopping restaurants museeums etc   Its not the best location if you want to be just in the middle of shopping or places with sights ie  Times square but its not far to walk nor expansive to take a taxi LobbyCheck in The entrance and lobby area is gorgeous and nice  A arate diamond and platinum check in where also we as gold members were alowed to check in at  Large seating areas with very comfortable sofas and chairs to chill in  Room We were upgraded to a better level of room don t ask me which one I did not but I was dissapointed  It was a small room that was not well planned in my mind  Large closet which is good if you stay long a few drawers where the flatscreen was placed on top but this was almost in the middle of the room so you saw all the cables and the back side of it  We were also unlucky to get a room beside the ice  and soda machine and the doors and walls seemd to be made out of paper because we could hear everything outside also the walls when the neighbour had the TV on made us wake up at  am   The bathroom was large especially the part with the washbasin but there were no hangers around for towels so you had to lay them on the basin  The minibar had been taken out of all rooms  Room faced another building and the windows were tiny but what did that matter with that view Restaurants naNo comment because I did not even find out what kind of restaurants they have OtherNo comment but not the best hotel I have stayed at  
N => Great location with substandard service The location of this hotel is superb just next to Grand Central train station and a  minutes walk from Times Square  The room I stayed was large and comfortable with all mods and cons  Good and inexpensive wifi access through Tmobile  However as this is a huge hotel the service was pretty bad  Laundry service was bad they forgot to pick up my laundry twice the front desk was unpolite and unhelpful  Never ask for the manager Adam as he was the most unsympathethic and unhelpful  It gets worse The second day they woke me up by error at  am  When I checked out they forgot to charge my laundry when I pointed it out it took them half an hour to charge it to my account and I ended up being late for my meeting  I felt stupid at the end of the day as I ended up being the one who suffers their incompetence and afterall I was trying to pay my bill that for which I was not asked to pay but yohey sometimes it does not pay out to be honest and the Mr Millers was not thankful You have to pay for left luggage and if you want to charge it to your room you have to face a very complicated process I did not have any US dolar cash  And people are not very helpful  By the way I hated these self check in counters which unsurprisingly did not work  Furthermore the taxi assistance is a bit dodgy  The bell boy urged me to take a private cab advising me not to get a normal NY cabbie  Concierge did not know anything about this arrangement and could not comment me whether if it was allowed and safe or not but I ended up taking the private cab which worked out fine  Nevertheless I found this a bit dodgy  
N => Great for the price Priceline chose this hotel for me when I ided to book a trip to NYC just  days ahead of traveling  I paid night before taxes and was not disappointed  The location was great being connected to Grand Central  The lobby was gorgeous all orated for the holidays  My queen room was just fine for me I was alone  The bed was comfy it was very quiet I was far from the elevators and the shower was hot  The bathroom was not the nicest Ive seen          a little dated        but clean enough  I could not help noticing black mold in the grout of the tub but like I said it was dated  The concierge was helpful and friendly when I asked for directions and the front desk staff were cheerful when I asked them to make change for large bills on  occasions I did not order room service nor did I eat in their restaurants so I cant comment on that  Id recommend this hotel just for location but it might not be worth paying night as their website is now quoting  Just my opinion  
N => Excellent Stay Stayed there from   and had a very good experience  I had a room on the th floor and the noise from the open window a nice feature was not bad  Fast service at check in and very kind when I locked my key in the room Room was small normal for NYC but very clean  Lobby was impressive  If you can try and get the Club level as the breakfast continental was excellent  Health club was very clean and all of the equipment was very up to date  Will stay here again and would recommend it to anyone  
N => Major Disappointment I can say with confidence that this hotel is far from Grand  Its the last day of a  night stay here  Im visiting NYC for a business trip and have the luxury of expensing this  Even so this was a major disappointment to say the least  The lobby is grand but it stops there  Youre greeted not by a front desk but by a troop of check in machines  This was impressive at first since I prefer it to speaking with a receptionist but the machine ran out of room cards so I ended up having to go up to the front desk  It took double the time to check in They gave me a room on the th floor and my first reaction to the room was quotThis is itquot The room was small tired and the bathroom smelled like wet socks  What was in the room Queen bed tv not flat screen sitting chair sliding closet doors and cockroaches  yes COCKROACHES  I found them crawling around when I went to the restroom in the middle of the night and then again in the morning  The man that answered my call didnt seem surprised at all by my discovery  The staff switched my rooms very quickly gave me an upgraded room a couple of floors up and  credit for food  It was definitely an improvement  Room service took almost an hour to arrive even though they told me it would only take  minutes  Overall this was a disappointment considering the room was night  If I were paying for this out of pocket I would never consider returning  
N => Very Nice  but      First time at this Hotel   Great reputation    close to everything Room was small very clean  but walls are paper thin  We were on the st floor  Well orated room very comfortable bed   nice TV Small complaints     ready to jump in the shower only to realize there were no wash cloths So I had to use the small towels at that point as I was not looking to track them down at  AMClanging noise all night long  not sure what it was   we were not near the elevator but it was just enough to annoy you It was coming out of the wallsThat put aside  professional staff  very helpful  clean    nice ambiance Would I stay again YES  but I will bring my own wash cloths just in case 
N => Not Worth It   Shameful This hotel is far from Grand  The hotel room was average  The location was great but I can think of many others with a great location and value  After paying over  a night they wanted to charge us  for the use of a corkscrew claiming it as corkage fee  I have travelled the world and have not heard of such a charge  They told us we could always go across the street to the drugstore to buy one  Shameful  
N => Location yes service NO    stay somewhere else I wish I could give this hotel a great review because its in an excellent spot and it really is a beautiful place  Ive worked in the hotel industry before however and know that at this price point all that distinguishes you from another hotel is your service  The Grand Hyatts service was dreadful and I will not return because of it We attempted to check in early as wed indicated on our reservation and were told nothing would be available until  p m  and that the onus was on us to call and check when something would be open  Annoying but OK no huge deal    though we were tired from the red eye flight there was no guarantee of getting a room early  We then asked the snotty front desk clerk for a hospitality room or some sort of place to change our clothes and be even brush our teeth  He told us there was nothing and    get this    pointed to the lobby bathroom Im sorry but at  per night Im expecting slightly more than a point to the bathroom  Thankfully a nice lobby agent walked us there and tried to talk to us and make up for the front desk clerks snarky service  We changed in cramped stalls and went out to the lobby to rest for a moment before hunting for breakfast  As I sat down and placed my feet on top of a large ottoman not  seconds passed before a security guard came over and demanded I remove my feet    from an OTTOMAN  What exactly is it there for if not to rest your feetIn any case I explained that wed just come in on the red eye were just trying to rest for a moment before heading out     yeah nothing but another admonishment  That was the last straw  You dont have a room fine    but dont make the whole thing worse by being rude at every turn The rooms are recently remodeled so thats good and theyre spacious by NYC standards  Bathroom is absolutely tiny but clean  Elevator service is fairly rapid though a malfunctioning one did send us between our floor and the next one down three times before finally taking us to the lobby one day Again its not bad but not nearly what it should be at its star level and price point  For what youll spend spend it somewhere else  
N => What you would expect Stayed in the Hyatt NY over a weekend whilst I was out in the US on business partially due to getting Hyatt points on someone elses money but also as I know I will get a certain standard Hotels in Manhattan are always far more expensive than elsewhere and the rooms tend to be far smaller as an added kick in the teeth  Although I was not paying the rate was only a little more than some far less salubrious places around mid town and having done cheap in Manhattan I knew it wasnt a great idea to go budget On arrival despite or probabaly because of disrupted flights there was a pretty large queue but there were a huge number of automated check in machines that no one seemed to be using   walk straight up check in and get the key go  Not entirely sure why people werent using these as if you have a confirmation code or have booked directly with a credit card it couldnt be easier  Good way of avoiding the queue and although youre never going to get free upgrade you can change your choice of room on the spot even on the machines I wont go on about the lobby area ostentatious water features as to my mind they are extremely tacky but who caresThe room itself was despite being the towards the bottom of the range incredibly spacious for a NY room   the only downside was a pretty tiny bathroom but still stocked with good toiletries I cant comment on the room service as this being NY on my free weekend I didnt eat in  But I must say that the staff who do check that youre staying if you try to get in after around am were perfectly courteous despite me rolling back in a sorry state sometime around dawn The location is obviously good for midtown   you are on top of Grand Central and all that entails   but as someone who ends up downtown it is not perfect however hotels downtown tend to be either exceptionally expense boutiques or very rough and at least taxis always know where Grand Central is The rates here fluctuate quite a lot and it is never going to be the cheapest place in town but the standards are ones you can rely on more so than at a Hilton riott or other mid to high level hotels  It is a big hotel so dont expect the kind of personal service you can get from a boutique but everyone here seems to want to give you a good time in the apple  
N => Will never stay at a Hyatt again    My husband and I booked our stay at the Grand Hyatt for a wedding he was a part of in NYC  The hotel was recommended by the wedding party and centrally located  That was about all I could recommend about it  Because we have a small child and this was our first weekend away in over a year we phoned the hotel directly and upgraded to a the Lexington Suite and asked for an early check in  We arrived last Friday afternoon about pm  The room was not yet ready so we checked our luggage and went out to do some shopping and walking  We needed to get back to the hotel by pm as we needed to be downtown for the rehearsal at pm and we both needed to shower and change  When we arrived at pm our room was still not ready and they could not help us further  The manager actually interjected when we were complaining to the clerk and stated sorry first come first serve and we would have to wait until pm  After checking back twice more between  and pm   the room was still not ready and the desk clerks never once offered an alternative  Finally my husband demanded another room to change in but we were told we had to come back by pm in order to move to our original room  There was no offer made to move our things or assist in any way  We left the rehearsal dinner to head back uptown to check into our original room and then had to move our bags to the suite  I was extremely disappointed in the lack of proactive offers to help us  If we had not demanded a substitute room to change in Im certain we wouldve ended up changing in the lobby bathrooms  While the accomodations were ok the bathroom was not what was promised via phone  My husband specifically asked if there was a soaking tub and the response was yes it was a ble bathtub  Well the walls were ble but the bathtub was not deep enough to soak in and the bathroom was mediocre at best  What was planned as a romantic and fun weekend was soured by a very uncaring staff  This hotel caters to large bus tour groups   which we saw numerous members of come and go from the lobby  Not the kind of place you want to stay in if youre looking for any kind of service  
N => below average    rude clerks limited luggage assistance many other issues Did not like my stay and would not return The roomRooms are not large there is no teacoffee maker robe waters mini bar  I actually ended up staying in two different rooms over three days and the ipod docking stationradio did not work in one  Walls are really thin    you can hear the people in the rooms next to yours as well as in the hallway The foodI ordered room service twice once for dinner and once for breakfast  For dinner I called at  and asked to have my food brought no earlier than  I had plans in the interim  The person said quotSure we have a wait of at least  min anyway and your food will come at   quot When I returned to the room at  there was a message on my phone saying that they tried to deliver my dinner at  but I was not there  I called room service and they said theyll bring the food up  When the food arrived at  it was stone cold  I called them to mention something an omelet was  otherwise I  have just eaten it with all the charges and fees and an  cup of tea the total came to nearly   They said theyd bring the food up which took another  minutes  Not impressed though they did take it off my account in the end The serviceOn a couple of occasions no one was available to help me with my bags  I would either have to wait a while or carry them myself I opted for the latter  The check out person was rude dismissive and interrupted me several times as I was trying to clarify some of the charges on the bill  The bar charge was wrong by   instead of  but apparently it was too difficult to figure out how to fix it The hotel is close to a subway station and there are noises at night loud enough to wake you The location is convenient if you are a tourist in NY  I was staying at the Hyatt for business and did not have a chance to take advantage of the nearby shopping etc The gym was smallish and again average with no bottled water provided though you could fill tiny paper cups from water coolers Overall a very average stay with some problems  I would neither return to this hotel nor recommend it to others  
N => Disappointing I stayed here in y for  nights for a business trip  The location was very convenient    right by Grand Central station and all its amenities  I was surprised to see a self serve kiosk to check in but that worked fine  It did not work so fine when I used it a couple of days later to check out The lobby was impressive but my room was not  It was your typical tiny overpriced night NYC hotel room with shower stall  The window faced an office building and got little light  The room was noisy as well being close to the vending machines  be they gave me a lousy room because Im not in their frequent traveler programLighting inside the room was poor and I had some trouble connecting to the internet on my second day there for some reason ended up renting some equipment from the front desk Overall a pretty disappointing experience  I expected the rooms to be a little more quotgrandquot when I first walked in to the hotel  
N => Cant Beat the Location Contrary to other reviews on here we found our stay on the th floor to be comfortable clean roomy enough for two adults and you did  not  have to pay extra for cable television though there is a  night charge for wifi This was the best location for sightseeing  It was within walking distance to all the major things we wanted to see Empire and Chrysler buildings Times Square Central Park Roc  Center but so close to the subway that all other areas are very accessible For the price we expected access to the club floor for continental breakfast or at least an in room coffee maker  But no such luck  In any event this would be a great home base if you dont mind the night price tag  
N => Great Hotel Grand Hyatt was perfect  Checked in at  am and room was ready  Room was on the th floor  Bathroom was a little small but the room itself was huge  The hotels location is perfect  Its right next to Grand Central Station you dont even have to walk outside to get to Grand Central Station since they have a walk way from the hotel  Its only about  blocks to Times Square  Staff was very friendly and helpful helped us with directions  
N => Central location for exploring NY We enjoyed  days at the Grand Hyatt before our cruise departed  Booked by our travel agent she said it was a deal we loved the location central to everything  Our room was ok a little small but comfortable  At check in the clerk asked about our plans  I thought how nice and started telling her how excited we were to be in NY  She got this look on her face and continued an up sale of some theater tickets  Oh I got it  She was not being personally friendly or interested in us just doing her job of pushing the services from a script  So I put my heart back in my pocket settled down and enjoyed the rest of my stay  Services were fine they cleaned the room and changed the sheets  But the big draw is LOCATION  Amazing  Try to get a better price and avoid what looks like a car payment each day you stay  
N => Very nice hotel got excellent rate via Priceline Very nice hotel in the same building as Grand Central TerminalGCT you can get to GCT through a door in the lobby without going outside  Room was small but I dont care about that  Food was very expensive in the hotel itself but there are reasonable options in the food section of GCT Staff was excellent just one issue  You could hear everything from the room next door the sound insulation was inadequate  We had to call several times to get security to ask our neighbors to quiet it down a bit  
N => Beware the upgrade Hard to beat for location  Simply great Service very impersonal checking out is pretty much automated  No one readily available to talk to if a problem Room is adequate but poorly cleaned found previous guests keycard behind cabinet  Electrics dodgy   cartoon sparks from socket when I plugged in  No view whatsoever from window I booked business class so that I could treat my  yr old to breakfast each morning  This was a disappointment because they give you vouchers at check in which you redeem on paying the breakfast bill  So far so good but then I found my  per breakfast me and yr old only covered coffee and a Danish Had to upgrade again to get hot food another  each morning Nhty not to be advised up front when I booked especially as I seemed to pay tax twice   once when booking and again when paying the breakfast bill  Big mistake Upgrading to Business class didnt even get me a free TV channel   all TV was at extra cost  Not really a problem as this wasnt a priority for us but if you want to unwind with some local telly open your wallet  Also had to fork out extra  to access internet in the room which turned out to be so limited as to be useless to me Foyer is an extravagant aircraft hangar of a space  I loved it but others might find it too impersonal Fantastic city to have a holiday in but Ill look for another hotel next time  
N => Great location but oh so dark and gloomy Stayed here for business in e   great location to walk all over Manhattan  Very corporate hotel staff not very friendly  Worst thing though was the lighting   so gloomy everywhere  In the rooms in particular it was almost impossible to see what you were doing  The only bright lighting I had to get dressed in was in the closet 
N => Excellent Location for all sites Ok lets start with all the good  Check in smooth nice rooms rented  rooms King Deluxe for us doubles for kids  Limited view but what do you expect in concrete gle  Rooms clean no problems plenty of towels Ipod clock was nice Conicerge very helpful in pointing us in the right direction  Walking distance to the following Empire tour boats Times square central park MTA Subway right next door  We Subwayed to Ground Zero and Yankee Stadium to far  Problems Breakfast Buffett  a person yikes concierge set us up with a couple local cafes and they are perfect  Our Room on  kids on  had to go to lobby to switch elevators not a real problem but something to note All in all a big thumbs up 
N => Fantastic Got a good rate but was still worried about the reviews we saw  We did not experience any of the negatives issues brought up by some other posts  Everyone at the hotel was amazing  We were traveling for pleasure and had our  year old son  The woman at check in upgraded our room to a much larger room so there would be more room for him to play and more room for a roll away bed  While we were entering our room a member of the engineering staff saw us entering the room and asked if he could please change the air filer in the AC as he saw our son  He noted they were changed often but wanted to make sure we had a fresh one since we had a little one  Then he refused a tip  He again stated he just wanted to make sure our son was comfortable  The room was great huge for NYC we were not bothered by any noise in the hotel and the location is perfect  amp  trains right down stairs can take you almost anywhere in the city  
N => Great Location but Loud We just got back from a one week stay at the Grand Hyatt in New York  The location was perfect for us as we used the subway system daily to get all around the city  Although the hotel is adjacent to Grand Central Station you certainly dont hear the noise from it  The rooms are certainly not like typical Hyatt rooms  They are small with VERY SMALL bathrooms and lack the overall class of other Hyatts  The walls between rooms are ridiculously thin which can be problematic if noise bothers you  My room had a connecting door to the next room which made the situation even worse  I HIGHLY suggest you request a room WITHOUT a connecting door  The great location outweighed the noise for me but the noise certainly bothered me  We were on the th floor and could still hear the traffic outside so I doubt you are going to be able to find a very quiet place  Downstairs in Grand Central Station there are a lot of ent places to eat or grab pizza bagels baked goods etc  
N => Great Location      Great Hotel I stayed at the Grand Hyatt from y    y th  I booked through a special on TravelZoo  We paid  a night and our rooms had  double beds which I am told is abnormal in NYC  I was very impressed when we arrived at the hotel  It is smack in the middle between Grand Central Station and the Chrysler Building  The lobby is grand and comfortable  We arrived before check in and hotel staff put our luggage aside for when we returned  When we arrived back in the evening we were pleasantly surprised after a long day of sightseeing Our room was very clean and spacious with the exception of the bathroom there was not alot of space as far as a counter around the sink  Some of the reviews have said poor service from the staff we did not experience any problems in that area  We really had little to do with the front desk staff other than at check in  The concierge greeters at the door bell men and baggage people were all very friendly and the concierge was especially helpful with things like directions recommendations checking our flight departure etc  This hotel was about a  minute walk to Times Square  We said many times on our trip that we were glad that our hotel was not in Times Square     it is extremely hectic It was nice to get out of the crowds to go to our hotel  It is about     minute from the UN building St  Patricks Cathedral and the Empire State Building  We had no problems with noise from street level we were on the th floor  One night we could hear our next door neighbours t v  through the wall  The room did not have a coffee maker in it there is a starbucks in the lobby  We wanted a fridge in our room so we could eat breakfast in our room and we were able to rent one during our stay  I really have no complaints about this hotel  We got a great deal and really enjoyed our stay 
N => Great stay at the Grand Hyatt My wife and I stayed here y     I would regard this hotel an oasis compared to the bustle of the street Grand Central and the subway  As said many times before the location cant be beat  Steps the Grand Central and the subway  Walking distance to Times Square UN St Pats Rockefeller and we even walked to Central Park okay that was a hike  The front desk couldnt have been nicer  I have platinum status with Hyatt and be it helped  We got there very early to try and check in  AM  We coulnt get a room of course but in the quotnever hurts to ask departmentquot I asked if there was any upgrade  They asked me if I would take a larger room but it only had a shower  Sounded okay to us  we ended up with an end room that was at least twice the size of a regular room  had a nice sitting area and didnt have a door to an adjoining room  Overall very quiet but the door locks are such that they make a fairly large noise no matter how you close the door from the outside  Bathroom was an okay size  the shower looked like it could use a little work but Ive had far far worse  Dont expect a view either  this hotel is all about location  We didnt eat there  try Pershing Square just down the street for breakfastlunch or McFaddens Pub on nd about two blocks east  Also theres all the food you could imagine at Grand Central   except everything looked to be closed early Saturday morning in other reviews but do the Statue of LibertyEllis Island EARLY really I mean you must do it EARLY  I was able to get an hour later checkout on Sunday PM even though there were lots of people coming in for the All Start game  I like to try different places but I would absolutely want to stay here for out next NYC stay  
N => Better Than Expected Booked at last moment via www continentalguestservices com in a package with  Broadway shows  Normally hotel rates are cheapest when booked at last moment but apparently not in New York All prices were up across the board and availability was a problem  They came to the rescue at a price cheaper than other websites Hotel was better than I expected based on Trip Advisor reviews   no nonsense check in took  seconds and check out took  minutes room was bigger than I thought  Location at Grand Central was good as subway was next door Overall efficient but quotcoldquot service and no major stuff ups or problems  
N => Great location OK room Fantastic location  A huge soulless hotel but quite pleasant to stay in as long as you are not looking for atmosphere  I had a nice room   seemed to be in the older part of the building  I did hear noise in the corridor but overall it was very quiet  Room and bathroom were both nice up to date modern upscale furnishings though not high luxury  Charge of  to store bags is annoying  Ive often driven on the road that splits in two around this Hyatt   very exciting to get a taxi to stay there 
N => I dont understand the bad reviews    great stay After reading some horrible reviews of this hotel I was somewhat nervous about staying here  Our dhters school group had them booked here and we wanted to be close by so we took a chance  We got an excellent rate of night through a Hyatt promotion and were very pleased for the value we received in NYC We arrived at  pm and were allowed to check in immediately  When we checked in we were told there were no rooms with  double beds available even though that is what we requested when we made our reservations  month earlier  We were given a room with a king and a rollaway and a promise to move us to a room with  beds the following day  We had requested a high floor with a view but when we arrived at our room on the top floor it overlooked another wall of the hotel The front desk was very accommodating about offering us a different room but while it had a street view it was too small to accommodate the rollaway bed so we stayed in the much larger room with no view  Because our room was not facing the street we heard no traffic noise which is very unusual for midtown Manhattan The rollaway they provided was quite nice and appeared to have a full size mattress which worked well for our teenage dhter  The room was on a short corridor so we heard no noise from either the hallway or the street   Actually we ided the large quiet room with a king bed and rollaway was more comfortable than a smaller room with  small double beds so we stayed in that room for the duration of our visit  After looking a a couple of other rooms we realized that our room was exceptionally large with a walk in closet as large as the bathroom It served nicely to both store all our luggage and be used as a private dressing room complete with full length mirror  So if you want a large quiet room without a view ask for room  From the front desk to housekeeping and maintenance we were very pleased with the friendliness and professionalism of the hotel staff  We experienced a couple of maintenance issues toilet that flushed too forcefully with geyser like effect and safe not opening that were addressed immediately and professionally  They also readily accommodated our request for a  pm late check out  The lobby is beautiful and the connection to Grand Central and its food court made it very convenient  As the weather was unusually nice during our visit we didnt mind walking to the theater or Times Square  
N => Great location just ok rooms Stayed e   for first trip to NYC  Hotel is quite nice as far as lobby and other common areas but our room was rather small and just ok as far as or  Elevators were plentiful and quite fast so getting from room to lobby was quick  Biggest benefit of this hotel is location  Being connected to Grand Central made transportation easy as far as getting to all the sites  We took the   train to everywhere   Yankee Stadium Brooklyn Bridge Wall St  Ground Zero etc  Its about a  minute walk or  cab ride to Times Square  Stay here for the location first but the hotels ok too  
N => Horrible customer service Stayed here for  nights in il   I have stayed at many Hyatts and have usually had great experiences  The experience at the Grand Hyatt New York was not up to my expectations  I had requested early check in when I had made the reservation on their website  I know this is something that is based on availability and is not something that is guaranteed  Our red eye flight had arrived at  a m  so by the time we got to the hotel it was around  a m  When we got to the check in desk and inquired about early check in the clerk acted almost appalled that we were even inquiring  She said we needed to come back at  p m  which was the check in time  I understand that our room was not available but the attitude we received was not really appreciated or necessary  The clerk had a very thick accent and it was hard to understand what she was even saying so asked her to repeat herself several times  However her attitude was not hard to understand We stored our bags with the bellman who also had an attitude and almost scolded us  He said when we returned we must check in first before we try to claim our bags  When we returned at  p m   minutes after their check in time and the time they told us to return  We waited in line for  minutes to be told that our room was still not ready At this point I became angry  I explained to the clerk that we had requested early check in had been there at  a m  to be told to come back at  p m  and it was now nearly  p m  so there was no excuse for our room not to be ready  I was about to ask to speak to the manager and wouldnt you know it all of a sudden a room became available  Their elevator system was confusing  Certain elevators would only go to certain floors but it was not clearly ked  The room was small and dark and pretty ordinary  A few minutes after arriving at the room we heard something at the door  It sounded like someone was trying to get it  I opened the door and there was a hotel employee standing there and almost shocked that we were in the room  She didnt really have an explanation for being there and basically just walked away  I was too tired and exhausted to even call and ask why an employee was trying to get into our room but wasnt really looking forward to another employee with attitude  The next day we had gone out and when we arrived back at the room later in the afternoon it hadnt been made up  However the housekeeping lady on our floor was standing in the hallway talking on her cellphone on a personal call  How professional On the day we were leaving our flight wasnt until the early evening  I read in the hotel book that was in the room that they offered a late check out based on availability  The book stated that they could provide a late check out as late as  p m  without an additional charge  I called at  a m  that morning and I asked if we could have a late check out at  p m  The person I spoked to wanted to haggle with me  If it wasnt available all he had to do was say it wasnt available  I dont know why he insisted on almost arguing about it and then finally agreed  It wasnt an unreasonable request especially when it was stated as a quotbenefitquot in their hotel book  For over night and being a member of the Hyatt Gold Passport program I expected more from this hotel  
N => Good value I booked my stay through Priceline so I got a great price   including tax when most rooms of the same caliber were double for the same time period  Easy location though I prefer downtown or Central Park hotels  The rooms were fine in both size and furnishings  My one HUGE complaint was that the room next to us was having a full on party all night  We called security three times to ask them to have the people quiet down  No one came or called we would have been able to hear their phone  Eventually I had to call the room and ask them to be quiet  They were not too happy but thankfully they left the room within the next hour  about  AM  The next morning I complained to the front desk and was given a coupon for two free breakfasts  I am not sure it was worth it but it was a nice gesture  
N => Perfectly Located Grand Hyatt was perfectly located right next to Grand Central Terminal  Room   double beds was small even for NYC standards bathroom was miniscule but everything was clean and well cared for  Would I stay here again Yes for the location    but only if I got a better deal  paid   per night  
N => Two words thin walls We reserved and  paid  our room a month ahead from their own website  However when we went there they said they had no rooms with two double beds and we were given a one double bed room  Later they left a rollover bed in our room but didnt bother to prepare it for us  They leaned it with its heavy metal frame upright to the wall and we had to do ourselves However you see the worst part of this hotel in the night  The walls are very thin so anyone talking in the next room or in the hall is enough to wake you up  You cant complain either because nobody is particularly loud they are just having a conversation The final annoying thing about this hotel is that they charge you to store your luggage  I have never ever seen a hotel doing this  So if you are going to leave your bags in the hotel until your flight be prepared to pay  per piece For  per night they must serve better not recommended 
N => Worth Every Penny Beautiful hotel not a huge room but definitely better than most that you would find in New York  Worth the price dont trust those quotbargainquot hotels  this is worth every extra penny Great location right next to Grand Central makes traveling very easy  Close to Times Square and all the major attractions  Staff was extremely helpful and accomdating  
N => Big prize Big Luxury when you love to have a flashback to the s Hotellobby is Great so are the elevators                           For the rest bring your creditcard as every move you make has to be paid extra  
N => motherdhter weekend Roombath were as advertisedpictured and worth its cost but acceptable by many NYC hotel standards  Daily room service was inconsistent bed covers left on floor one day wash cloths not replaced one day though all towels were which seems wasteful when occupants do not put towels on floorin tub indicating desire for replacements  Luggage storage fee unacceptable for such a large chain  Hotel restaurantcafe unappealing but wonderful restaurants delis pubs etc  nearby  Hotel staff quite friendly and helpful  Easy to access Grand Central subway though would be much better to have La Guardia more readily accessible by subway and not having to use bus service   NYC taxi driver did not use EZPass toll lane upon departure reported to transportation authority  
N => ok not great Avalon better We got this cheap by NY standards on Priceline name your own price    Rooms pretty small cramped even  Ok location  Everything was a walk or a bus ride  TIP  Get the all day metro pass for   Bus is near by  This is not what one would expect for a  star or Hilton  Room service was quick and the food good  Easy to find off the highway and parking was a bit more expensive then other hotels  Staff friendly but not great  when we came back to NY we stayed at the Avalon which was a mansion compared to this room 
N => Awesome We stayed in this hotel from y nd thru the th  It was incredible  Stayed on the th floor thanks to everyones advice  We overlooked Times Square  The views from the room were incredible  The bed WOW  I wanted to take that bed home with me  The room was HUGE  The service was great  Room was clean and very spacious  Would stay here again and recommend it as well  
N => Quite noisy We stayed at the Hilton in y  We first had a room on nd floor just beside the elevators which was extremely noisy so we had to change rooms  First the reception staff said that there are only rooms available on lower floors  After telling them that I am a Hilton Gold Member they had one room left on the th floor so we changed rooms at  p m  This room was also facing a construction site which was again very noisy beginning with work at about  a m  but view was great with Empire State Building and Hudson River  First we were told that we can keep the room with no charge until  p m  then we could keep the room even until  p m which was very good The Times Square area is very crowded so if you are looking for a more quiet place you better look after any other hotel  
N => Hilton very average Stayed at the Hilton    We reserved a deluxe room because we know rooms in NYC are small to begin with  It was as small as your local Holiday Inn  The beds were very comfy but SMALL  We reserved two queen beds for our family of four  The beds are doubles not queen sized  Our two children ages  and  were pushing each other off the beds  My husband and I were squished to say the least  The room was clean  NY City as a whole is pricey so for  plus tax you ide  As far as security there were security guards present before you go up to the lobby but we were NEVER once asked to show our room key or anything else for that matter  Makes you wonder   We were in the City the day of the London bombings you would have thought security would have been tighter  You have to take another elevator up to your room  The guard was there however we were never asked for ID or room keys We had a room on a high floor  We had a view of nd street but it wasnt worth paying the city view additional price  When we travel we always get ocean front rooms or rooms with a view  In this case it was a waste of money  We did look out the window on the st street side by the elevators  That view was worse  There is also construction going on on st street  The front desk told us that the construction noise begins at A to A each day so beware unless you are an early riser If you are looking to purchase NY sweatshirts all the shops we went into they were   amp    We found a shop called R A G  at  Broadway between rd and th  The same sweatshirts as all the other shops and they were   They also had some the other stores didnt have  Nice quality T shirts for   Worth going toAs we said we found the hotel very average so we will probably try a different hotel next time around  
N => Definitely will stay here again  Loved it This was my first time in NY  I had read mixed reviews about the Hilton Times Square and knew to ask for a room high up and not next to the gym as I read it was very noisy The check in was very smooth the room was lovely  I even requested to change a room because it was adjoining and they agreed but liked the initial room they gave us so we changed back The room was very clean modern and spacious  We had a lovely view of nd Street We stayed for  days and the service was impeccable  All the staff from the reception concierge and doormen were so friendly kind and helpful  The security staff were so helpful We were travelling with a small child and the staff were so accomodating and efficient We will definitely be staying at the Hilton Times Square next time we go to NYC Thank You Hilton Staff You were fantastic 
N => Great location but       We stayed at Hilton Times Square il     We arrived at  and they graciously let us check in early  However in my reservation I had requested a high floor with a view away from an elevator  They gave us floor  lowest floor and put us next to the fitness room  The fitness room hours are AM PM  At AM in the morning we were awoken by a BANG BANG BANG    the exercise equipment in use  We didnt notice first morning since we had set alarm to get up early to catch Ferry to Ellis Island but next morning woke us up at AM  We called front desk and complained and the girl said she would talk to the manager about moving us and get back to us  No one ever got back to us  We paid top dollar didnt get through Priceline but through hotels website and felt cheated  Otherwise hotel is in GREAT location    cant be beat  All hotel employees with the exception of that one front desk employee were extremely helpful and polite  Would recommend the hotel but suggest if they put you in room  next to fitness room request to be moved immediately unless youre an early riser  
N => Clean and comfortable Very clean and comfortable  It was not quite the trip that I planned but the business center was a life saver  Since it was a pleasure trip I didnt bring my laptop  With the PC in the business center and Logmein I was able to get everything done  The rooms were immaculate and the food was great  I highly recommend this hotel  
N => Fantastic Hotel Just returned from our holiday in NY stayed at the Hilton Times Square from  to   Cant praise it enough everything was perfect  Room on th floor overlooking Hudson and nd St very quiet  Big room with two double beds plenty of space for us just as a hotel should be Late check out as we had a late flight and then baggage looked after for us while we went to eat and they had a taxi waiting for us as requested to take us to JFK  All staff really polite and helpful  Also in a great position for travelling to all areas and loads of restaurants within walking distance  
N => Great view Stayed at the Hilton Times Square with my mother during the New York City portion of our vacation  We spent a few days in NYC and then went to California to finish out the remainder of the trip  We stayed  through  Check in started out a bit rough  When I made my reservations I requested an early check in and I called the day before to verify and I was told that it would be no problem  We show up at the hotel and we were very rudely informed that we could NOT check in early  I nicely explained that we had been promised an early check in because we had a business meeting we had to get ready for but the female desk clerk refused to help us  We ended up just taking over the ladies room in the lobby and with the help of a VERY patient bellman Caesar we found all the clothes and makeup we needed to get ready for the meeting  Without the help bellman Caesar I dont know what we would have doneAnyway when we were finally able to check into the room we were on the th floor  We had an AMAZING view of the city looking downtown  The view made us forget about the trouble we had checking in The room was nice slightly larger than the room we normally have at the Sofitel the hotel where we usually stay  The beds were pretty comfortable and the hotel was quiet  With the exception of the desk clerk we encountered the staff was very friendly There needed to be more vanity space in the bathroom and the only mirror in the room was in the bathroom  There needed to be one in the quotmain roomquot All in all it was a nice stay and the hotel was nice  Im sure Ill stay there again  
N => Cant fault it We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from  th to nd and thought it was great  The staff were excellent as was our room  We were on the st floor and had a great view of nd Street and beyond  Although its very close to Times Square we didnt feel unsafe at any time due to the security presence  I must mention one of the doormen who was prepared to lend us money out of his own pocket when our transport to the airport fell through  Thats the sort of staff employed there and I would definitely go back  
N => Location We took our  year old dhter to New York for the first time      Exellent stay room on the top floor overlooking Times Square nd street  Rooms larger than i thought considering everybody told me that NY rooms are small  Maids came in every day extra comfy beds fluffy bath robes and towels and nicely orated rooms  Just around corner from hustle and bustle of it all  Too much to see and do  Empire and statue of liberty a must we prebooked tickets on net so much easier and go early to avoid crowds  Rockettes christmas show very good and WTC  Overall unbelievable had to keep pinching ourselves  Deffinately be going back to the Hilton Times Square we are really fussy so you cant go wrong 
N => Really good overall We had two rooms at the TS Hilton during the period st to th ember   We were happy with just about everything  Even the smoking rooms didnt quotsmellquot too bad  We had one smoking room and one non smoking room  Our rooms were on the higher up floors so we had a good view also towards the Hudson River  The front desk clerk on check in was helpful and very welcoming and fixed up our request for smoking room without any problem  He might have been called Alexander   Im not sure   I had thought to remember his name on check in because he was so nice to us Because we left generous tips in our room non smoking one every morning and every night we got good room servicing and at night we got our bed turned down and a replacement of bottled water and towels etc  This was important to me as we were able to shower or bathe at will without regard to how the towels would hold out   unfortunately probably without regard to the quotenvironmentquot  This was better service than our hotels here in Australia only two towels per room here  However the other room smoking didnt leave a tip for night time turn down and they didnt get any special treatment   although their room was pretty daunting what with all the clothes and things piled upThe security on the street entrance was a good thing  We didnt eat at the hotel generally except for one meal   which was Christmas night dinner   we had thought it might be Christmas oriented so thought we might splash out and at least get a Christmassy style meal   but it wasnt   it was just the ordinary menu There was a bit of noise coming from our next door neighbours   mainly I think through the inter connecting door   and that might cause a problem if you had really noise neighbours Also if you are planning on going to a Broadway show or the like make plans early   as far as I could see you have no hope of getting tickets unless you book in advance  
N => Just returned from my stay    to  I just got back from a stay at the Hilton Times Square  I loved New York and the hotel was in a fab location  Just a few steps to McDonalds Champs Applebees awful and Subway  I liked Hilton Times Square but I have had my resevations for over three months and when I got there to check in at  p m  even though I had requested an early check in I did not get into my room until  oclock which was two hours past there check in time  That left my family and I to roam around New York til then  They did store our luggage until then for us though which made it very helpful  Hotel staff was incrediably helpful and rooms were very nice  Hilton was not in what we think of as quotTimes Squarequot but was just around the corner literally  Overall I would probably stay there again  
N => Wonderful New York Wonderful hotel nice view close to Times Square    almost everything was perfect  mJust a bit of embarrasement once you entered the hall as you had to take the elevator to the lobbyalways had to show everything to the guards  Nice view from th floor room overlooking skyscrapers at Times Square 
N => Hotel Great   Room Service Terrible Just returned from a Thanksgiving stay at the Hilton  The Room was wonderful  We used Hilton Points for part of the stay and it could not have been better  Great service great view    terrific location   just a good experience  For part of the stay we booked a room that included VIP tickets to MOMA  Problem was no one could find the tickets  After a  minute run around I called the Hotel Managers office and his Assistant located the tickets immediately and had them delivered to the room  Excellent service  stars for the assistantI would have given this hotel a  or at least a  based on the overall experience   however I ordered the American Breakfast from Room Service one morning  It was unbelieveably bad  I mean awful  I just cant believe that the hotel could serve something that bad  The breakfast potatoes tasted like cabbage    I mean it was bad So do stay at this hotel do get VIP MOMA Tickets they worked fabulous    just have breakfast around the corner at a diner 
N => Fabulous hotel   no complaints at all Our stay in ember   could not have been better  From our early arrival  am they were very helpful  We gave them our cell to let us know when a room was ready and they stored our luggage for us until we were able to get into a room  By  am we had a call that indeed a room was ready for us  When we got back to the hotel they knew us by name our representative was wonderful and gave us our keys to go on up  The room was huge especially by NYC standards  Immaculate not a complaint at all  It was our dhters th birthday which we mentioned to the desk clerk upon our early arrival while hoping to get a good room  We left again to go sightseeing shopping etc only to return to the room and see a birthday cake set up for her  I thought my husband had done it but there was a card from the front desk  That is what I call above and beyond The cake was delicious and such a wonderful personal touch to an already impressive stay  The next morning my dhter went to thank the desk clerk for her thoughtfulness and she of course called us by name and asked if she had a nice birthday  The staff was very pleasant the rooms very clean the beds extremely comfortable  I will definitely choose this hotel again  I highly recommend it  There was no wait time for anything there  Whether business or pleasure this is ideal  The view was great  
N => New clean curteous luxurious  This hotel beats all expectations  My room was big bright luxurious had a great view and most importantly extremely new and clean  In Orbitz the hotel doesnt even rate as a four star place which got me a bit worried   but its actually as nice as some five star places Ive stayed in  I didnt want to leave  What a great deal 
N => Minor hitch but overall very good Mu husband and I stopped over for one night in this Hotel on our way back to Scotland after a wonderful holiday in the States  The room views service etc  were all we could have asked for except that the reception staff asked if we wanted a smoking or non smoking room  I had specifically stated when I ordered that I wanted a smoking room  This was not a problem as we were given a smoking room but the next morning at breakfast we were asked for vouchers which we had not been given when we arrived  Instead of a relaxing morning which would have rounded out our stay perfectly my husband had to leave the table and go back to our room to get the documentation to show that we were entitled to breakfast as part of our package  On this occasion the reception staffs oversights reduced our stay from   plus to    If they can correct this I would say that the Hotel although expensive is worth every dollar  Other reviews have stated that the food is overpriced  We found it to be well worth the money  
N => we made an excellent choice We stayed at Hilton Times Square for  nights  y  thru ust st  This was an excellent choice as far as location and service  The staff was exceptionally helpful friendly and accomodating  We were always greeted with a good morning or evening whichever the case was  Security is great too  The lobby is on the st floor and we had to show room keys to get on the elevator that would take us to our room  You do have to take  elevators to get to your room but we never ever had to wait longer than  seconds for one  Most times   of the time one was waiting for us  They were very fast also whisking you up  floors in a matter of seconds  Then the second elevator seemed to always be available and we were in our room in less than a minute  There is also  hour room service which we did not use because it was expensive  The location was great for sightseeing  There was a subway station about a half block away and it had trains going in every direction  We used subways a lot but also walked a lot  We were out past midnight almost every night and never felt like we were not in a safe area  There were so many people out at that time it was incredible  Anything you wanted was a quick subway ride away or within walking distance  We walked many many places in short time periods  We will for sure stay there again as we plan on returning in a year or two  
N => Great Hotel Stayed in this toel from y nd to y th   This was our first time in New York The room was spacious and clean Great View All the staff was very courteous and helpful  There was a torrential rain storm and the hotel provided umbrellas for us to continue our sightseeing  We felt very secure in the hotel because no one was allowed to take elevators to the floors without showing that you were a guest in the hotel  Will stay at this hotel again and will recommend to other people  
N => Big Mistake Because of many higher rates from the review we switched our reservation from Westin to this hotel  The bed was horrible  The bathroom was not perfectly clean  The doormen never greet whenever we were inout  The breakfast was very expensive but the quality was not even standard  The hostess and server were horrible  Everything we found in this hotel was nothing more than average except the concierge  This hotel was not worth for night  I always use Hilton Westin or Hyatt but this one was the worst I ever stayed  Watching the view of newly Westin Tower from our room I felt we made the biggest mistake choosing the hotel from this site  
N => Want To Go Back Stayed in a Deluxe Room with full American Breakfast amp bottle of sparkling wine cost  per room per night plus taxes  Our room was on the th floor and had fantastic views of the Hudson River and Times Square  Lovely modern spacious room  Had room service dinner from Hiltons restaurant Above  Delicious I can recommend the prawns amp avocado   biggest prawns ive ever seen  Lovely burger for main course and yummy strawberry cheesecake for dessert  Used the Concierge service a few times as we had never been to NY before so needed advice on how best to get to places where to go etc  Excellent service very helpful and SO polite  Cant wait to go back one dayAlso went to see Chicago which was brilliant     
N => Very good I thought The Hilton was very good  I was there on Business for the whole week and I have no complaints  The room rate was   Cant beat that either  
N => Sales Dept is AWFUL We attempted to host a meeting at the Hilton Times Square  WHAT A NIGHTE  They changed our contracted rates our sales rep changed almost daily and our meeting room rental fee kept going up  They originally tired to say the list price was  per day for a room big enough for  people  We cancelled our space due to lack of communication and organization on the hotels part  The hotel has sent multiple bills for K in damages however the meeting was held at their sister Hilton property  I left  messages for the general manager  it took him  weeks to call me back  The hotel is a nice property   just make sure you have everything in writing    especially if you think about conducting a meeting here  
N => Great experience  
N => highly recommended  
N => positive experience  
N => Tolles Hotel in bester Lage  
N => Me encant  la Habitaci n  No el precio  Pero es N  York   
N => Localizacion perfecta pero no es un hotel excelente  
N => Smallish but clean and conveinient The title sums it up  I dont have another hotel to compare it to but it met my needs  
N => Wonderful place to stay in NYC We were very impressed with this hotel   they let us check in early and leave late   staff were incredibly friendly and accomodating Randy the bellboy was very helpful and didnt appear to expect tipping every time we saw him but just enjoyed his job which we were very impressed with  We had a spacious suite on the th floor   it was overlooking office blocks and was very quiet and absolutely spotless  Location perfect for sightseeing  Free internet access on the lower ground floor and breakfast was a bonus Everything else has been said in the other reviews   but we will certainly be returning to this hotel 
N => Ok I booked this hotel from the rave reviews posted on tripadvisor  Upon arrival the receptionist was quite abrupt and not friendly  But it seemed that new yorkers I have met there adopt this sort of nature  The room I was given was near the emergency fire exit stairs  And the room smelt like cigarettes  I requested a non smoking room and told the staff but said that it was a non smoking room  But I told them it was not because I can smell it and then she replieds that there was not   guarantee of my request  I wanted to move to a new room which was non smoking but the staff would not allow me to move  They offered to quotsprayquot the room to get rid of the smoke  That ended not happening  I had given up trying to ask for a non smoking room and left it as that  The room was very small  The toiletbowl was not clean properly when I came but other than that it was quite clean  it had good cable TV which was good  The continental breakfast was fantastic but not much space to eat  Food was scrambed eggs sausage boiled egg yoghurt cereal toasts bagels pastries etc    There was free internet but because there are so many people in the hotel i had to wait for ages for it as there were only two computers  It was difficult to sleep because i was near the fire exit so heard the door slam quite a bit and I was near the elevator so heard many noises  Because hotels are so expensive in New York this would be the suitable alternative but I would not go there again for the price I paid which is  dollars a night  I would try to find another hotel  
N => Small smelly rooms The rooms seem clean but are very small  same for bathroomsnot alot of place to move around in roomOur real problem was that the room smell bad like urine  We tried to switch rooms but head the same problem  The reception could not really help out as it was late and we had a baby with us we ide to stay for  night  In the morning the reception confirmed it was bad filters that need to be changed in the AC but did nothing to compensate our unconfortable stay Other than that the location was great but if you need parking plan to walk about   blocks as it is not close very expensive and with an extremely rude staff 
N => Great for overnight stay We spent the first part of our holiday in another hotel which provided a bigger room for  people  On our return to New York for our last night we stayed in this hotel  The Hotel is in a great spot clean and pleasant staff  The only negatives were the size of the breakfast room which was really far too small to accomodate the amount of traffic and our room size  We could only open  suitcases at a time and then could not walk past each other without one person backing into the bathroom to allow the other past  Also couldnt open the door with case open This is impossible to see on the internet when booking  It was just by luck that our longer stay was in a bigger room  Its a shame one cant get dimensions of rooms before booking  I dont know if all rooms for  people are that size but for longer than an overnight stay it would be really uncomfortable  Not wanting to finish on a negative note we also booked through the Hotel Reception a car to the airport which was good value arrived at Hotel on time even a little early and our driver was a very pleasant chap  
N => perfectly fine   excellent location I brought a group of college students to NY and we stayed here  The service was great   everyone was very friendly  The rooms are tight but nicely updated and clean  Breakfast was included   and its a ent breakfast   eggs bacon etc  not just stale bagels like some places  i recommend it  
N => Very poor guest service I found very good deal nt for two nights at hotel website  We were family of four so I clearly ked  people would check in  Alas the hotel staff checked us in one king saying the hotel was oversold and not available to give us two double but would provide a rollaway bed  Unfortunately the room was barely enough for one king bed no way to put even a single rollaway bed  Again the hotel was oversold so we didnt have a choice but to stay at the other hotel  Front desk manager was not very helpful either he insisted that he could and would not refundwe prepaid even he admitted that there is no way to accommodate us in that room  It is a clear breach of contract by the hotel if they sold a room for four people they should have prepared a room for four no matter what  I know some hotels in Manhattan have smaller room than others but at least they have appropriate maximum occupancy rules My first negative experience with Holiday inn express  
N => Very functional but     Ideally I would have liked to give this hotel  out of five because although it was very practical it didnt really grab me  As others have said the location was ideal for a leisure visitor to NY  It was right in the centre of Midtown within walking distance of many major attractions including Fifth Avenue Central Park the Rockefeller Centre Times Square the Empire State Building Grand Central Station the Lincoln Centre MOMA Macys and Bloomingdales      Check in was pleasant and efficient   The room and bathroom were very small but clean and functional  There was a free standard HI Express breakfast which is a bonus in this expensive city  The only practical deficiency is that there wasnt a room safe  I am sensitive to this because on a recent stay at a HI in Paris I used the room safe for my important documents but neglected to put my mp player in the safe and it was stolen from my bag  It is difficult to assess value for money because I dont have much experience of NY  Another thing that makes it difficult is that the room rates seem to vary a lot with time when I made the booking a long time in advance of my trip I found that the room rate was  dollarstaxes online at HI website but just before travelling I looked again and the room rate had dropped to  dollars presumably because of the recession  It didnt matter to me because in the end I had ided to pay with my Holiday Inn Priority Club points but when I return to NY I will have to give this aspect of things some consideration  Why am I not more enthusiastic about this hotel Well sometimes when one is on holiday one likes a bit of charmstyle in the hotel where one is staying   this is completely missing from this hotel  I found the lobbybreakfast area crammed and rather scruffy  In iding whether or not to return to this hotel I will take all of the above points into consideration as well as the room prices of nearby hotels that have been recommended to me by friends The Library and the Hilton Times Square  
N => A relaxing place to unwind from the noise of New York Just stayed  Great location  Rooms are small but quiet  Enjoyed the breakfast in the am It was an enjoyable change from the noisy hotels we usually stay in in Times Square  Not having to wait for elevatorsetc  Free wireless in the room  Both my dhters live in NYC  one on the upper eastside one on the upper westside and we could get to either in a  minute taxi ride  I was really suprised at how happy I was with this hotel  
N => Clean convenient  incl  taxes no complaints Walking distance to Times Square Rockefeller Center Fifth Avenue shopping Hells Kitchen Port Authority etc  We had a small but perfectly adequate room on the th floor  Typical Holiday Inn Express breakfast in the ridiculously undersized lobby  Look this is not the Plaza but for  a night plus tax its a relative bargain  Note to get this rate we had to book AND PRE PAY through a hotel booking service    I think it was Expedia  The pre pay rate was not available through the hotels own web site  
N => Best price for location This is a very good choice for midtown Manhattan if you want to be within walking distance to the main attraction sites and close to the subway stops  It is a new hotel smallish rooms good prices  Breakfast is included which is good since other hotels charge up to   per person however the quality of breakfast is so and so coffee and omelettes should be avoided they were really not good  Our room was clean no view bathroom small but OK with good hot water  Overall it is probably the best pricequality hotel in midtown Manhattan just do not expect  star service  One small annoying thing on the bell service when you try to get a cab they will sway you towards private limos which are more expensive  Ask for a yellow cab instead even if they  not be too happy about it or just use the subway to go anywhere very cheaply  
N => I Liked It but Husband Says  Never Coming Back  Hotel has a convenient location on th between th and th Avenues  Easy to get to Grand Central  Considering the type of hotel this is and that there isnt a restaurant it has a fair no frills breakfast with both hot and hard boiled eggs meat and pastry hot cinnamon rolls options  The breakfast area is located basically right inside the door so it gets pretty cold when you are eating breakfast in the winter  Hotel does not have a work out facility but it does have  computers with access to the internet on the basement level  The rooms are quite small with no closets just a rack to hang clothes  We stayed in a room with  double beds I think there is more space to move around in a room with a king  The bathroom is also very small  The beds are hard which I really like but my husband hates so you have to determine how important that is to you  We had to call several times to get toilet paper because while there were  rolls in the room when we arrived they were both almost empty  We arrived very early  am with a check in time of  pm so they kept our bags until later  However they did say that as I am a Gold Member for Priority Club they would get my room ready and I could check in in a couple of hours  But being this is NYC I wanted to go out and explore and didnt come back until   My room was NOT ready and I was told to come back later  When I complained they got someone to get the room ready about  minutes later  I like the location but as its not a big main hotel its tough to get a cab at the hotel but my husband hates the beds small rooms elevator noise that we heard all night long and would prefer a place with a restaurant for breakfast to order  Only other point about the location you do have to walk several blocks to get a subway  There are lots of hotels in NYC with much more convenient subway access  
N => Great Midtown Choice My wife and I were very pleased with our  night stay  The location was near perfect for our needs walking distance to the Brwy theatres subway stations and bus stops  Our room although compact was clean quiet and equipped with ironing board iron and hair dryer  Included in the price was a daily breakfast that exceeded our expectations   eggs bacon sausage juices fruit coffee cake french toast yogurt hot and cold cereals beverages  The hotel staff was friendly accomodating and competent  We were able to get into our room  hours prior to the  pm specified time  There was no charge to check our bags for several hours after checking out so we could visit the Art Museum unhindered on the final day of our visit  A copy of the US News was slipped under our door every morning  Local calls were free as was use of  PCs and printers in the lobby  The only glitch was a  minute delay in returning our two bags to us when we returned to the hotel after our museum visit so we could proceed to Penn Station to return home  We will give top consideration to staying at this hotel on our next visit to NYC  
N => Enjoyable visit       but not as enjoyable as the last time We stayed in this hotel on our previous visit to New York and loved it  This time it was not as good  Despite being Priority Club Gold members we still had to wait half and hour for check in      even though our room was ready  The lift broke down one morning which meant you have to wait forever to get upstairs  Also the air conditioning needs cleaned Despite this the majority of our stay was enjoyable  The majority of the staff were very friendly and helpful  Breakfast was enjoyable  Rooms are on the small side but they are clean and more then adequate  
N => Great hotel in a great location My wife and I spent  days in NYC at the end of tember and had reserved a room at the Holiday Inn Express based on the reviews seen here on TA  The reviews are right on  The rooms were indeed small but we werent in NYC to hang out in our room  Even though the room was small it was very clean  The breakfast was good and the breakfast area was somewhat small but we were always able to get a table  The entire staff was helpful and friendly from those at the front desk to the cleaning staff when we asked about where to go for cheesecake a place called iors was recommended and it was very good  They even hailed a yellow cab for us when we needed to get back to the airport  The best thing about the hotel though was its location   blocks from Times Square an easy   minute walk to Central Park minutes from Grand Central Terminal and  minutes or so from Rockefeller Center  One thing to be aware of if you stay     the elevators can be very slow at times especially when the rooms are being cleaned  
N => Nice Hotel My husband and I booked this hotel through Orbtiz and it helped that it got good reviews  Our hotel room was small exactly like the photos but I found it comfortable enough  We had free wireless internet and the free breakfast bar boasts all sorts of stuff    eggs bacon bagels cereals etc One thing I didnt like was that our room didnt have a mini fridge and since it was summer when we visited we could have used the appliance to cool beverages  But other amenities were there    dryer iron etc  The location is great as well close to Times Square Rockerfeller Center th Avenue shopping  Overall the hotel was really nice  
N => Great Location Looks better than the pictures We read all the review from all the websites and ided it seemed like this hotel had a good location  Also all the reviews said the hotel rooms were very small and the lobby was tiny  So we prepared ourselves  Once we got there we realized it was much better than the reviews The lobby was full of people and it was a small bit cramped but nothing horrible  We checked in around am and they already had a room available  This was great Once we got to our room I was in for another surprise   it wasnt that small Sure its a bit shorter than regular hotel rooms  But just having come back from France this was a LOT bigger  The room was nice and clean and bathroom was a nice size  A little scum in the shower  The only thing I wished the room had was a refrigerator  There is a microwave in the lobby to reheat foodWe will DEFINITELY stay at this same hotel  The price was just right for Fourth of y Weekend  We are planning to go back for New Years  Im sure it will be more expensive  
N => Great hotel We stayed in HIE for  nights in    We got a yellow cab from Newark airport and it cost us  which I thought was excessive compared to the prices quoted on the website  The hotel was quiet when we arrived and our room was ready early  It was small but we did expect it to be  We had only just got settled when someone arrived with bottles of water and biscuits for us as we are Priority Club members  The hotel was really busy each morning for breakfast and often you had to wait for a table  The food was good   toast croissants fruit bacon sausages eggs and cinnamon buns  Tea and coffe were always available at the far end of the breakfast area but there was also a kettle in the room  The free wifi and computers on bottom floor were great  Overall this hotel was really good  Only downside was the fact that safety deposit boxes are at reception and we never got one as they was never any free ones  
N => Very nice surprise We go to NYC once a year and have stayed in several different hotels  For the past few years weve been returning to the riott Times Square  good location and weve always been very pleased with their rooms  They have always been very clean and roomy and the bathrooms pass my test  However this year the rates have gone through the roof and we ided it was time to try somewhere else  The reviews of the Holiday Inn Express on th on this site led us to stay there  I was a bit apprehensive going in as I thought surely no one had the bathroom standards I do  Well I must say it was a very pleasant experience  Yes rooms are small  but there was a very comfortable king sized bed there as well as a desk area and stuffed chair  We were a bit stretched for hang up space in the armoire but we managed  The bathroom counter space was a little wanting but the room itself was very nice and clean  The bathtub looked brand new and the floor was sparkling  Best of all the towels felt as if they had a little fabric softener in them  There was a hot breakfast buffet every day  no it wasnt fabulous but it was a nice added quotextraquot considering we were paying day less than most of the other hotel options with no breakfast  They also provided free wi fi as well as a computer amp printer in their basement for e mails and printing out boarding passes  Be warned there is NO ambiance in this hotel  If youre looking for a picturesque setting its not here  But for a couple of weary tourists it was wonderful to come back to a nice clean room and comfortable bed each night  We stayed  nights  It wasnt far from the subways and was convenient to the theater  Our one and only complaint wed asked the Front Desk to call for a taxi the morning we left for home  Up pulled an unked quottaxiquot  With everything wed heard about not using them we questioned the guy at the desk  He looked at the car and driver then at us and assured us it was a legitimate taxi service  So away we went  However it was not until we were loaded and on our way that the driver told us the charges were more than a regular yellow taxi about  more  I put the blame on us for not questioning him before we got into the cab but I also feel the guy at their Front Desk shouldve been held accountable  he knew what he was doing and that it wasnt a regular yellow cab hed called  Will we stay at this Holiday Inn again Probably but we will definitely call our own taxi  
N => Loved the HIEX on th st  My mom and I just took our very first trip to NYC and we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on th st  for  nights  The staff was very friendly and they always had a smile and a hello whenever we left the hotel or returned  Check in was quick and easy  They gave us a map of the city and answered all our questions  They even told us which subway to take when we needed it  The hotel is so centrally located we only took the subway once  Its walking distance to the ESB MacysGrand Central Times Square Central Park Rockefeller Center and the list goes on  The room was clean and the bed was very comfy and the shower in the bathroom was excellent  We were not picky on the size of the room because we did not spend a lot of time there  It was very hot when we were in NYC and it was so nice to come back to a nice cool room to rest our feet and cool off  Our room was on the th floor and our room faced the street but was not noisy  The breakfast was excellent and there was always plenty to eat and a nice place to sit  Check out was just as easy and there were no suprises on the bill  The price was right at   a night and I would stay here again and recommend it to all I know   
N => Do Not take Room  or  Noisy Beyond Belief The hotel itself was very clean staff very nice breakfast good location great price good  BUT    one warning    do not accept st floor room  or     the noise from elevator food prep area and storage area right outside is intolerable  I had to wear ear plugs to get sleep  And in the morning the smell of the cooking going on next door around am wakes you out of a sound sleep  
N => Tiny rooms   could barely walk by the beds I amazed that this hotel received such a high rating  The room was tiny   barely room to walk by the end of the beds  Nowhere to put luggage a quot wide night table between the beds The breakfast selection was good but the room was jammed in next to the reception desk and was cold   the outside door to the hotel was open The hotel was clean and the staff helpful  
N => Excellent location and helpful staff  This was our first time in New York and this was an excellent location   on th Street between th and th Avenues  We felt safe walking the streets in the area at night time  Walking distance to Times Square Empire State Building Rockefeller Centre  We also walked from the hotel to Central Park Bloomingdales and Macys  The rooms are typical Holiday Inn Express   Small but clean and comfortable  The lifts were quick and we were never delayed  We had no problems with the complimentary breakfast or the seating eventhough the area was small  The staff were always very friendly and helpful  There is a pizzakorean takeaway across the road from the hotel if you are too tired to go out for the night and you want to bring food back to the room it also sells bottles of wine  We had flown from Ireland to JFK and used Airlink www airlinknyc com for transport to the hotel from JFK Airport they collected us on a bus from the airport to Central Station where they used minibuses to take us to our hotel they also collected us from the hotel to the airport without any problems  Just one thing we found was that while children under  years are free on the bigger Airlink buses they are not free on the smaller Airlink minibus which return you to the airport but the driver would not charge us the fee for our dhter  We will stay at this hotel again on our next trip to NYC and we will also use Airlink for transport tofrom the airport  We booked the Airlink just outside the door of JFK Airport and the rooms we booked on holiday inn com 
N => Very good location Stayed ember  to th From Sydney AustraliaVery close to Times Square and a walk to everywhere  Very busy with Christmas shoppers  Did not have breakfast their as only very sweet and fattening things available  Could do with boiled eggs as some other Holiday Inn Express have  Across the street very close to places to have breakfast   Very good restaurants in street for dinner as well right next door  Room was small supposed to be king bed but in width ok in depth cut off too short obviously to fit in room our feet hung over end of bed if you stretched out and I am only quot tall  Some desk reception people need to be more friendly and helpful  Asked about arranging a broadway show were not helpful to us When leaving we asked reception to get us a car to travel to airport   after about  hours we got one   never been so frightened in travelling in my life private hire car and way too fast  Do your own hiring of cars  Also not one person from reception asked if we enjoyed our stay at end of  days   Also airconditioning outside motor in next door offices very noisy during week days   ok weekends as is turned off  Made the walls vibrate and had to wear ear plugs This should and could be fixed by office owners next door  Overall close to everything and very clean  
N => Horrible stay small rooms I booked this hotel through my priority points membership with Holiday Inn Express  I love there locations in New Hampshire  I think this will be my last time in New York City booking The Holiday Inn  The breakfast was very small but it was fairly good  The lobby was to small  You had to pay for soda or anything to drink  They offered free coffee tea or juice for breakfast  The staff was horrible  They were very rude and not polite  The manager almost overcharged me because he said I needed a government ID  I booked it through my priority card they hit the wrong key when they put my reservation in the computer The rooms overall were very small  Hot water was horrible I asked for more time in the morning to check out they said quotnoquot I have stayed in the riott Grand quez its much better more family like  I like the algunquin as well  
N => Its all about the LOCATION I booked two rooms here for one night  We took an overnight trip to NYC to see the Christmas orations  We were delighted with the hotels location It was just two blocks away from The Rock and Saks  It was also within walking distance of Times Square and Central Park  The staff was very friendly My children were each given candy canes when we checked in and every single time they walked by the front desk and smiled much to their delight We were able to get hot chocolate and coffee in the mid afternoon too  The rooms were small but very clean  The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the window had a sheer curtain and only one very small section of drape so the room was pretty light all night  The drape did not cover more then  of the window  That was rather strange  The other room did not have a window so that was not a problem  Breakfast was good  We were down at  am and did not have trouble finding a table  It did fill up rather quickly after we were seated  There is a deli almost next door that offered a tasty and inexpensive lunch  Although we were able to get a taxi from Penn Station to the hotel we were unable to get a taxi back to Penn  A very helpful staff member stood in the street for a good  minutes trying to hail us a cab but the taxi drivers only wanted to take trips to the airport  It was the Friday right before Christmas so I really should not have been surprised  It took us about  minutes to walk to Penn so that wasnt too bad  Of course the taxi issue was not something that the hotel could do anything about  They tried their best  
N => Not Up to Expectations Very small rooms  The lobby was cramped by the breakfast area however the breakfast provided was very good good quality fruits vegetables yogurt etc  The hotel lost a fax I received  The front desk staff had heavy accents that made it difficult to communicate  The hotel had only one of two elevators in service  This is a budget hotel with a great location  The criticisms in this review are constructive not meant to degrade this property  
N => Perfect Hotel for Location and Hospitality The rooms are small but you cant beat the location  In the  double bed rooms you cant share with another couple  Its way too small   be children  You can walk to Rockefeller Center its one block off from th avenue   many great stores Good restaurants nearby are Emporium Brazil and Natsumi authentic Japenese  The staff is wonderful they will keep your luggage early in the day so you can hit the town running  Watch out for the desk staff trying to talk you into a car to take you back to the airport  The girl at the desk told us it would cost twice as much to take a taxi in the afternoon traffic  She offered to order a car which never came and the price suddenly went from  to   We had to scramble to get a ride back to the airport in a SUV cabwhich ended up costing us only  plus tip Except for our ending experience everything was wonderful 
N => great hotel great location First of all I have to clarify that I stayed at this hotel using points so I got a great deal  It is regularly priced around   a night    which is average for a hotel in this location  I loved this hotel    the location was convenient to the    train that takes you to just about any place in NY you would like to see  The hotel was very clean and the service was great  I got directions every morning from the concierge   and he was very thorough and polite  The breakfast was good    nothing spectacular but it was nice to have a free breakfast in the mornings  As others have said the seating is limited but I prefer to take mine back to the room anyway so it didnt bother me  I would definitely book this hotel again    dont know if I would be willing to shell out   a night but it would be hard to find anything comparable for less than that  
N => Great location The hotel was only  blocks from Times Square on the same street and  a block from th avenue  It was central to almost everything  We walked everywhere amp only took the subway once  The breakfast was great lots of choices some different ones included cheese donuts amp french toast  We were able to get our own table each morning amp every morning we were there at different times If I was coming back to Manhattan I would definitely stay here again or recommend it to anyone I knew  The rooms were clean and the air conditioning was excellent we always had the room ice cold for when we returned from the heat  The rooms were also reated recently and are nice amp new  The staff was helpful and kind  
N => cant beat this location Just returned from a fantastic trip to NYC and one of the highlights was our stay at the Holiday Inn Express near Fifth Avenue  While the room wasnt cheap about  per night during our stay as they say in the industry LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION This hotel was located steps away from many of the attractions our family went to the city to see Times Square Rockefeller Center Empire State Building Fifth Avenue Broadway shows and convenient to subway transportation to other venues on our quotmust doquot list Also there are several quick service food options within steps of the hotel that we were very pleased with including Cafe Manhattan Milk amp Honey great bagels and Cranberry Deli cheesecake to name a few  Also there were a couple of Duane Reade pharmacies located around the corners from the hotel on th and th Avenues for medicine and convenience store type items  We also felt very safe walking in this neighborhood after dark  were from a small town so that was important to usWe were a party of four myself spouse and two boys so as others have stated the room was a bit cramped  Just enough room for two beds and a small bathroom  However the well appointed room was spotless with plenty of towels and an airconditioner that really cooled the room  We had no issues with noise whatsoever and the elevators were usually very prompt  The breakfast offered downstairs was always well stocked as long as you arrived before  a m  and we managed to find a table each morning  There seemed to be hundreds of channels including premium channels on the big flat screen television As far as service goes we didnt have any major problems with the staff  However two mornings we did not receive our requested wake up call  Luckily our backup alarms came through  The desk clerk offered us a car service to the airport the night before our departure  The driver arrived on time and gave us excellent service to LaGuardia for  plus toll we added a tip as well Apart from the hotel Id like to recommend the NY Pass  We purchased a three day pass online before our trip  The pass entitled us to entrydiscounts at over  places in the city including several museums Statue of LibertyEllis Island Ferry Empire State Building NBC Studio Tour and Madame Toussouds to name a few  We also got a  credit per person each day at Planet Hollywood food or merchandise  I know we more than recouped our expense for the pass  I know there are other passes that are offered but I can say that this one met our familys needs  Also Carmines near Times Square serves great family style Italian at a very reasonable price I would definitely stay at this hotel again and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to others  
N => Nice staff but some major issues One major problem with this hotel SMALL Great if you only have one or two people in a room but we had four people in a room and were SO cramped  Barely had enough room to fit our luggage and ourselves  There are two elevators and it took about   for the elevator to get to us then once on it stopped on nearly every floor  Also when we checked in and went up to our room much to our surprise   there was another family in there It was our room but somehow this other family was told it was there room as well and was given keys to our room  Staff is extremely nice and do their best to be helpful although often there is a lot of confusion and mistakes made  Location is good   very close to times square and rockefellar center  This hotel is okay   it just turned out to be a lot more to deal with than we thought and posed a few inconveniences  But who comes to New York for the hotel right 
N => Fantastic location We stayed here for  nights   our first time in New York   the location is great we walked to Central Park Upper West Side Rockerfeller Centre Empire State Building United Nations Chrysler Buillding Times Square and Grand Central where we easily cht the subway to Ground Zero and Liberty Island  The rooms are not huge but were very well equipped and spotless  It was great to be able to grab breakfast   juice coffee danish fruit yoghurt and leave early to begin a days sight seeing  We particulary appreciated the coffee and being English the tea which was available in reception  hours a day Would stay again when we regain our energy   New York is exhausting but a fantastic experience  
N => check with hotel BEFORE travel that they have room arrived after very long trip to find that hotel had double booked the room  with two children it was not a great start  stayed in twin had booked suite for  nights and was moved to booked room  had to get someone in britan to complain before anything done  staff ok some grummpy new yorkers dont smile  sofa bed awful and needed lots of spare quilts just to pad it out  room very cold at night because of hole in wall where fan plugs in  no newspapers delivered even though supposed tp get  great shop across the road sells all you need to eat  location great BUT view out of window was of tower block that looked like it had a sweat shop going on rats running around the rubbish that has been thrown from various widows etc  new york great to see but be careful on underground  would not stay again in america as to much trouble getting through imigration no one smiles cattle are treated better  service is added even if service bad  new york is a bit of a rip off  the big attrctions are really just empty shells  TAKE NOTE MR OR get the tourism act together as i could do better  
N => Not clean enough Good location but expensive and our room wasnt clean and smelled horrendous  Glad we were only there one night  
N => Fabulous Ive stayed here twice most recently in ember  and have been quite happy  I would not hesitate to visit again  The hotel is relatively new conveniently located and very clean throughout  By coincidence I stayed in the same room on both stays a king room  The room was small but quite liveable and the bed was very comfortable  The hotel has  floors and only  rooms per floor so you dont have to worry about too much hallway noise  My room was high enough up that I didnt even hear the street noise  Someone mentioned they only have sheer window curtains  I cant speak for every room but in mine there was a vinyl black out curtain but it was somewhat hidden behind the drape  I almost didnt find it but it was there The hotel staff were very friendly  There is no on site restaurant or fancy amenities it is a Holiday Inn Express after all but I will happily do without those for a clean comfortable NYC hotel room that doesnt cost me an arm and a leg  
N => Loved loved LOVED I was pleasantly surprised by this property to say the least  Booked last minute for a quick overnight trip in the city I didnt expect too much  This was only my second time to NYC ever and I really lucked out  This hotel was one of the cleanest I have ever been to and the staff was extremely cordial and helpful  But of course  the location  my goodness  So close to Times Square Fifth Ave  Park Ave  Central Park the Theater District and everything else We saw everything we wanted to see and more in less than  hours  Will definitely stay again  cant wait and have already recommended to everyone in my office as well as my family 
N => Hidden gem in over priced NYC My wife was reluctant to stay in a or   star rated hotel but was thrilled with this hotel  CLEAN friendly great location free internt access computer use fax and free breakfast   Best of all though it is reasonably priced in over priced New York  Our new hotel of choice  
N => Great location to all the sights We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for five nights after having been on a  night cruise  Whilst the Holiday Inn Express didnt have the luxuriousness of our cruise ship it was very clean and comfortable and the breakfasts were very adequate cereal toast pastries teacoffee  This was our first visit to New York City and we felt very safe walking around this area even in the evening  The hotel is very close to everything Empire State Times Square th Avenue and Theatre District  There are plenty of food outlets and convenience stores just steps from the hotel for snacks to take back to your room or for that matter to eat on the premises  Having free wireless internet access was a bonus to keep in touch with home  Despite having a street front room on th street we were not disturbed from any outside noise  Great little hotel to see the sights of New York City  
N => OK stay I usually stay at H I  Express for business and I would not have on this trip but I had points to use so I stayed here the night before my wife and I were heading to the caribbean for our honeymoon My first impressions   the hotel is located right off fifth on a tiny little new yorkishstreet  The lobby is small My reservation   I always reserve King beds but they had me into a double  After pleading with them and explaining that I stay with Holiday Inn   times a year they changed my room to a King  Room was not ready when we arrived but they put my luggage in storage untl we checked in later that evening  My room   Small The room was nicely appointed but cramped  If you just need a place to crash I would suggest  If you have a family or a lot of stuff like us go somewhere else  The room did have what seemed to be unlimited digital cable or satellite TV which was nice  Noise   There were kids playing with the elevators and running around making a racket from about  to   We were not impressed as we had a am flight to catch  Might stay there on business would not reccomend for a leisurely trip  Note There was a lovely italian restaurant right beside the hotel that almost made the stay for us 
N => Not for a family My family   teenage boys my wife amp I just got back from a trip to NY  First  nights we stayed   the HI Express  In general   if you only have   guests   you can probably bear to stay there to save some money  Otherwise   not worth it  The property is new amp nicely appointed   everything works   breakfast is fine  Past that beware  We asked for early checkin   front desk said they would call when the room was ready   we checked our bags amp went to lunch  No call   we head back to hotel   check about    still no room  Very crowded lobby   laundry folks are taking large carts of towels out through the lobby runs into several folks   including me  About  other folks are checking in   we get back in line   get to the desk a little after  checkin time amp the room is ready  On the checkin card it had room  the front desk person said  something my wife heard made here question if  was indeed the correct room   yes from the desk clerk  We get our bags and make it up to the th  Room was propped open had just been cleaned  Tiny room   but we unpacked  Noticed the fellow downstaris had given us one wrong bag  I took it downstairs   got the correct bag   came back up   tried the key   it didnt work  I call the front desk amp asked them what room we were supposed to be in   they said   I explained the situation   the front desk   they said we would need to move  I again explained and then asked who would pack us up amp move us   the next time the desk clerk came back amp said we could stay in that room amp they would bring us keys that worked  We got the towels we needed from the cleaning lady amp we were set  Came back from the Yankees game   keys dont work It went on like this for the  nights we were there  Had planned on staying    but moved to the Hilton   Times Square  On trying to reduce our stay from  nights to    the front desk clerk said we would have to pay full price for the  nights   but she might be able to work it out that we only paid night  On the reservation documentation   there was nothing of the sort   I showed it to her   she said we would have to speak to a manager  There wasnt one onsite amp there wouldnt be one on site until  the next monring  No way to speak to someone to try to resolve it  I called customer service for Holiday Inn amp got it straightened out after speaking with  different folks amp escalating  The room is small   if you take an average mans shoe   lengthwise between the beds   it touches the covers on each bed   that is how much space between the beds  A single person   or even a couple amp only one bed   would work  It is clean   folks were generally courteous though less than helpful   good location   not for a family   not even to save money  
N => Very Disappointed My friend and I stayed at this hotel from   for a quotmoms weekendquot  My husband and I are Priority Club members and have always had great service at Holiday Inns  Crowne Plazas  This trip however changed all that  We tried to check into the hotel at the pm check in time and our room was not ready until  so we felt as though we were wasting our day sitting in the lobby  When we finally reached our room a reserved  double bed room we were given a  king bed room and when I called the front desk to let them know they said the quotcouch pulls outquot  This was not acceptable to us and they did change our room to what we did reserve but after the late check in and the wrong room it was very aggrivating  But the kicker came on Sunday morning when at  someone was banging on our door and when we answered it was housekeeping asking if we were checking out We were SOUND asleep I have never in my life had that happen at a hotel  To make matter worse we laid back down and not  minutes later she knocked again  This time I asked her what time check out was and when she said am I showed her our Privacy Please tag affixed it to our door and told her not to knock on it again  I was outraged and called the front desk and received no apology  As I said we enjoy every other Holiday Inn we have ever stayed at mainly for their cleanliness and great service but I will never stay at this one again and would not recommend it to anyone  
N => Great PriceGreat Hotel Stayed  nights from  to   Yes the room are really small but the hotel is clean bed was comfortable free wireless that was fast breakfast in the morning and helpful  kind staff  Arrived at pm and room was ready to check in  Also requested higher room and was given st floor We were  teenagers and  moms all sharing one room  Since we knew it would be small we packed smaller suitcases and used drawers in the room  Do wish there was more area to hand clothes  be  items max fit in closet Others have mentioned elevators were slow  We did not experience this at all and the hotel was   sold out while we were there  Only once was the elevator crowded If you do stay here and need them to store bags on last day make sure you get down early  They told us they have run out of storage space small closet under stairwell on lobby level  
N => Will be back Great location   just off Fifth Avenue amp less than a  minute walk from loads of tourist sites Empire State Building Central Park Times Square St Patricks Cathedral Rockerfeller Center etc etc  Rooms are small but have everything you could want comfy beds coffee making equipment iron alarm clock      For breakfast be sure not to leave it till the last minute as it finishes at  am sharp and by that stage on the Sunday we stayed there was only cereal left  Only complaint would be you could hear the lift motor from our room although it wasnt loud enough to keep us awake and we did have to wait up to five minutes at times for it to arrive Would stay again   only exception would be if one of the expensive hotels was doing a special and came in at a cheaper rate  
N => Irresponsible staff slow room preparation Lost the paper which proved that I paid to my travel agency  Unwilling to refund my deposit although it was obviously THEIR problem  Irresponsible and bad attitude  Untrained staff  itors cleaned slow and occupied the elevators most of the time  Had to wait more than an hour to get my room although made a reservation Not professional overall  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL  
N => Great little hotel  We had a wonderful stay over a Saturday Lincon Birthday weekend night  We had reserved a doubledouble but they only had kings so we were given  king rooms  Total price before tax was   total not per room  This was amazing for Manhattan Times Square Area  Nice albeit a little slow staff  Rooms are small but nicely appointed with lots of TV channels  Location is extremely convenient to Broadway even in a blizzard     We missed the continental breakfast slept in but others seemed to have enjoyed it  Free computer in the basement for guest use  Free wireless internet in room though not strong enough for a Dell Axim  While this is not a Luxury hotel it is well above budget  Fine place to stay  
N => Very nice hotel small rooms but great overall  
N => Wrongly priced  
N => A good place to stay in Midtown NYC  
N => Great stay for great price Booked this thru Priceline and got a great deal  per night  Hotel is in a great location  Rooms small but very clean and quiet  Desk clerks were very pleasant  Would have liked to have a mini fridge in the room  One odd thing was towel storage was inside the shower enclosure forcing you to find a place to put the extra towels in a small bathroom while showering  
N => Close to the action and clean A friend and I were visiting a friend in Brooklyn and at the last minute we ided to stay in Manhattan to be closer to restaurants and to Broadway and to be a bit more comfortable too  We didnt want to spend a lot and tried using Priceline and got this hotel for  for  night compared to the  advertised The hotel was a quick walk to Time Square and the staff were friendly and efficient  We had a king size bed and the room was clean and roomy enough for the  of us  The bathroom was clean  It was a great stay  We were also up on the rd floor and heard no street traffic or noise  The only complaint was that some of the TV channels were fuzzy but we didnt go there to watch TV  
N => good position and not bad value for money Was clean and good service  Great position to see everything 
N => Clean but small rooms Hotel is located close to Port Authority bus terminal times square empire state  Very nice location   Rooms are small but clean especially beds were very clean  Down side someone ate chips and drunk sprite and left the empty boxes in the room  I asked the reception to check what happened but they never get back to me  I think one of the cleaning personal just watched TV in the room  I did not want to pursue more because I do not want someone to loose a job because of me  HeShe did not touch any of my belongings 
N => Clean Comfortable Stay I went with a group of about  young people   We stayed for a weekend and personally I enjoyed my stay at this hotel  The people at reception were very accommodating and patient  We found the service personnel to be kind and helpful  I was expecting to have a bad experience in New York hotels from reading negative reviews about how small unclean and uncomfortable some places were but it was quite the opposite  The rooms were very clean not too small with widescreen tv a desk w modern lighting  an armoire ironing materials a night table a cofee pot  In other words they worked very well with the space they had  We lacked nothing we needed  It also helped that we were on the th floor where there was an ice amp snack machine  I liked the simple and abstract designs in the double bed room where  of us stayed  The bathroom was great  Clean and big and white with toiletries that were replaced often Its refreshing not to see flowers and pompous bedspreads  Breakfast was a plus but you had to get in early or later in order to find good seating  It was good  They had cereal milk eggs with cheese toastcoffee cranberry apple and some other type of juice  There was a small sitting area in the lobby and another area where they had two PC stations for internet use  We also had internet access from our rooms for our laptops  Check out times were listed as  on the internet when we made our reservation  only discrepancy is that on the hotel booklet each room has says check out time is  am but it turned out they were pretty flexible anyway  They also held our luggage for us for a couple of hours after we had checked out which helped us find appropriate transportation to get to the airport later  So overall we had a great and affordable experience in NYC staying here 
N => New hotel startup problems ok for  person in room It is a new clean place with in general reasonable rooms  Price level is standard to others around  OK to stay but will not be comfortable as you have to tolerate the following  Lifts slow and crowded  Especially because the housekeeping staff with laundry carts use same lifts as guests  On our  day stay on numerous occasions housekeeping would crowd a cart into an already crowded lift cage hold the doors open to talk with housekeepers on various floors where the lift stopped   minute waits normal   Breakfast    free and no complaint    also crowded at peak times around  am  Long lines no seating   Room air conditioners seemed to be of the binary control blast cold air blast hot air type  If you can dont take the xbedded rooms as in these the AC unit blasts direct into the closest bed  Try the king room seems to be better   Little coordination between front desk and housekeeping on reservations  One day housekeeping knocked  times to ask when are we leaving when we werent going to  On another day our two rooms were not made up as housekeeping was waiting for us to depart which we were not scheduled to do  An hour to sit in lobby while housekeeping was rescheduled to do the rooms   One of two reservations lost by reception and had to be dug up from emails The reservation issues seem teething problems in a newly opened place and should quickly get sorted  Others are a tougher challenge This hotel is a quotsisterquot or the Candlewood Suites and Hampton Inn brands next door literally  and  meters away  Prices appear quite similar  Would recommend trying those two as alternatives in case internal details are any better there  But especially housekeeping staff seemed to be a mix and match of the brand uniforms so  not have much meaning  
N => Beware   Not Open Until ust      While checking for dinner reservations near our hotel we noticed the first quotBewarequot and followed up  Indeed we would have arrived late at night   party of six including two small children to a hotel that is under renation not even taking reservations until e   When I called Holiday Inn customer service confirmed my reservation for the first weekend in e   a reservation made in uary  Then she told me the hotel would not be taking reservations until e th Then referred me to customer service who confirmed the hotel would not be open until ust th Why wasnt I told six months ago So I spent the better half of a day trying to find another hotel   gave up our continental breakfast and proximity to our destination in the process  By the way I called the telephone number on this website and spoke to someone under the pretense that he was IN the hotel   who confirmed we could leave our bags with the concierge after check out to sightsee and that there was a restaurant in the hotel all the while the hotel isnt even open So be careful you are actually speaking to THE hotel personnel  Good Luck 
N => Beware   hotel was not there We arrived after a long trip to NYC ready to check in at our hotel  We arrived at the address listed here and given to us in our confirmation by Holiday Inn  The hotel was dark empty   the only evidence that perhaps it was a Holiday Inn was that there was a peice of paper taped to the glass window saying it was a Holiday Inn  After calling the reservation number the HI rep on the line didnt know it was not open  We ended up staying down the street and were told this has happend to other people  He said that the hotel was being remodled and was behind schedule  
N => Location Location I just got back from an overnight trip at the Showboat to see Dhtry at the Trump Taj Mahal    Trump was too much money   got a GREAT deal with the Showboat   and did not have to go outside to get to the Trump Arena Room was very large  View overlooking the ocean Big bathroom with arate room for toilet Downside   internet was  day    walls a little thin but not too noisy Staff was very helpful  would def stay here again 
N => Not bad for the price The room was a little small but always clean  Good AC  Staff was always very helpful  Wanted to be near the Garden and we were  Just have to make sure when you come back in to your room that the maid staff has replenished everything they were supposed to  Not big on waking up early for breakfast but for those who are they had a full assortment including eggs sausage bacon etc  Easily saved  for those who eat early  Would definitely stay there again  
N => Great bargain for a NYC hotel I dont usually stay in hotels in NYC because I usually stay at my friends apartment  But I needed a room for one night because of some scheduling conflicts  I got a great deal on this room and the location was ideal just a few blocks from Penn Station  The staff was great  I got there around noon and they were able to let me check in right away  I had to very quickly get back to Penn Station to take a train to Long Island so I was most grateful to them  The room was nice clean and comfortable  I dont recall there being any sort of street noise  I believe all Holiday Inn Expresses have free internet and breakfast which makes for a great bargain If for some reason I again find myself needing a room in NYC I will certainly consider this hotel again  
N => Great Location This was our first trip to NYC and we ided upon this hotel due to location and value  It was in a really good location  close to all the touristy things that we wanted to do  Times Square was really close Madison Square Garden was around the corner and the subway was easy assessible  The hotel offered a really low rate in this city of expensive hotels  It was adequate for our needs  Rooms small but from what I have heard this is standarded for most hotels in NYC  FREE breakfast was included  The breakfast area was crowded but it was free so we just waited patiently  The only problem we experienced was the hotel ran out of linens no towels or wash clothes  When I called they sent someone who gave me  wash clothes and told me that we would have to quotsharequot  We survived and overall it was a pleasant trip  If you are a luxury traveler I doubt this would be the place for you but for those of us who spend limited amount of time in a hotel during a vacation this was perfect 
N => Holiday Inn   works out fine for NYC trip The four of us stayed in a single room   room was small but worked out fine  Was close to bus and subway lines  Breakfast was OK  I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly  A real plus was the outside tables in front of the Hotel where we could eat our takeout and just people watch  
N => Nice hotel with a central location We stayed here with my PC points and got a nice room  Location was nice Breakfast was a complete chaos  There were roughly six table for all hotel quests which lead to compleate chaos and I ended eating my breakfast while waiting for the elevator to get back to our room Im happy I didnt pay any actual money for the stay Concierge was nice though we felt a bit ripped off when trying to get a taxi to the airport when he suggested renting a driver amp car instead of getting a taxi All in all not a nice memory of this hotel  
N => New York City bargin The first few days of our trip we stayed in Times Square which was fun but very busy and very expensive  We moved over to this place which is still walking distance to everything  It was a bargin  We got a rate of night which includes free internet hot breakfast  The rooms were bigger than our Times Square up ket hotel and the service was probably better  Rooms were clean breakfast was good      Would recommend it and I would definitely stay here again  Some reviews talked about it being noisy and yes you can hear the doors shutting but again our one we paid a lot more for we could hear the people next to us VIVIDLY  I think it is just the small NYC hotel rooms  It is basic but for NYC this is a fine  
N => Good for the Money This was our rd trip to New York mainly to see the Yankees in the new stadium  This was the cheapest place we have stayed in NY and for the price this was an excellent choice  The furnishings were updated and the bathroom was nice  Good air conditioner fan runs all the time which is nice to drown out sounds  Provided free breakfast but be prepared for crowds and limited seating  Very close proximity to a subway station and Penn Station  I felt very safe walking around outside as well  Very helpful concierage who helped us get a taxi when we checked out didnt expect that type of service at this hotel  There were a few negatives listed below but overall this was an excellent place for the economical visit to NY if there is such a thing  Negatives included  very small rooms and bathrooms we knew this before we went but still surprises you at how they get  double beds in the room   Hall noises were loud  Our room was next to the stairwell door and everytime someone used that door we could hear the door slam in our room  Not so great when youre trying to rest or sleep   Never had our wash clothes replaced  Ended up using hand towels by the end of our  night stay  Requested wash clothes at the front desk and they said they would send some up but I never saw them   SLOW ELEVATORS AND SMALL ELEVATORS  Very annoying   Limited seating at the breakfast area and very crowded  You kind of have to battle for the food but its better than spending  and finding breakfast in NY In spite of the negatives I would definitely go here again and I recommend the Pizza Suprema on th Ave next to Madison Square Garden for a good slice of NY pizza  
N => No clue on how to operate a hotel The hotel is new and clean  Beyond that you can expect nothing  They overbooked the hotel and had no room for our reservation upon arrival  They first gave us a room somewhat dirty and without pillows next to the only ice machine in the hotel  After further complints we got another room  This room was fine except that they forgot the towels and did clean the room for two out of four days  They then claimed our reservation was one day short and made us pay extra fees  We never had the lobby breakfast as it was always packed with tables occupied completely  In short they built a good hotel but they have not a clue how to operate it  
N =>  Tips use stairs  Location Great Cleaning Staff Great but the breakfast is like something out of a pig farm We stayed here for  days and it was really to get sleep as we were sight seeing all day  The days we stayed the lifts stopped at every floor up and down and on checkout it took us  mins to get in a lift  we were used to using the stairs but with all the luggage we couldnt  One of the lifts had a family group in it and they would not get out of the lift they just kept going up and down for the whole time When we complained the counter staff said they were customers like anyone else and if they wanted to stay in the lift then the staff were not going to stop them  This was not taken well by the growing numbers waiting to check out  Overall the stay was fine but the staff need to be a bit more sympathetic to the majority of their customers well being than to one family  
N => Great location very nice staff It was our first time in NYC and we were very pleased  I spoke with the staff for advice many times and they were extremely friendly and helpful  Especially compared with the hotel we had to change to for our last evening  Rooms are small but I think that is typical  Breakfast was good but again breakfast room was too small for number of people there especially since it was raining and exterior tables were off limits  Subway was just around corner and I guess the discount parking was convenient  AGain they offered a discount and we paid half of what we paid when we changed hotels  Would definitely stay again  Jeremie was particularly helpful 
N => Hit and Miss We had reserved a non smoking  double bed room for  days all pre paid on my credit card weeks prior to our trip  Upon arrival at the hotel we found out the only room available was a smoking room with king size bed  THey had overbooked  We slept  people on a king size bed that night They did not even have any extra blankets to provide us nor were they very apologetic about the situation  Upon speaking to the manager the next day we were told that the room type is only a request and is not guaranteed and there was no compensation bc the king size bed room is the same price as  double beds  All of it sounded pretty unreasonable to me and I had already prepaid the whole amount but we let it go so as not to ruin our vacation The next day they switched us to a  double bed room  As we were getting ready for bed that night there was a knock on the door  My mom went over to the peep hole and saw  men standing on the other side  She was about to open the door when to our surprise the door began to open  They had a key to the room The door was opened halfway before the man saw my mom standing there he said sorry and hastly shut the door  We were pretty freaked out  We talked to the front desk and they were concerned as well after calling around they found that some workers had been instructed to enter to clean the room by mistake  What hotel does housekeeping at night it was already past midnight at that time we could have been sleeping and  strange men were coming into our room  I shudder at the thought The key cards kept on malfunctioning and we had to get them reset at the front desk multiple times  Probably we put them too near our credit cards or what not I heard that older key card systems are sensitive that way but it was quite annoying  The other  hotels we stayed at during our trip did not have this problem Pros about this hotelcheapgood location convienent and good shopsfood closeby safe close to subwaybreakfast included and tea and water available all day a couple parking garages right next door at a reasonable price for NYCClean and updated rooms and bath  not very big but it is NYC internet cafe and workout room in the basement was niceYou get what you pay for take a chance if you will  This hotel is hit and miss  
N => awesome hotel to stay at my friend and i were going to nyc for spring break and didnt book our hotel until literally right before we left  it was more than we wanted to pay for a hotel but we ided in the end that it was worth it  our room was very clean there was a complimentary breakfast in the morning that was kindof crowded but had a nice selection  the employees were friendly and they had hot tea and coffee in the lobby all hours of the day  it is also very conveniently located with tons of attractions and penn station nearby if you want to commute further  would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to nyc 
N => Great hotel for the money We paid  USD a night for  nights and found the hotel to be great  It was about a  minute walk to th street subway which was  stops to time square  Hotel room was very small which is expected for New York  Very quiet street which was good as halfway between th and th avenue  Free breakfast was good but got very crowded best to head down early  Breakfast consisted of hot cinnamon rolls bagels muffins coffee juice cereal fruit yoghurt  Small but good gym which had  x treadmills  x bike and free weights   x computers offering free internet  
N => Friendly staff clean rooms and in a great location  ProsStaff were friendly and helpful Hotel was st and clean inside Room was a good size room and was clean and tidy  King size bed was very comfortable Breakfast was busy but people were always moving on  Not a huge selection of food but there was something for everyone Luggage claim was very handy if you have a late flight as check out is  Easy walking distance to attractions ConsYou can hear the room doors bang if theres inconsiderate or drunk people about so take earplugs if you are a light sleeper  Was there  nights but only one of these where we were awoken throughout the night by the doors  Think the hotel should advise guests to close the doors with a little more care but it would not put me off going back at all  
N => Great place to stay great location but room doors make so much noise We stayed on th floor here for  nights last week great complimentary breakfast cinnamon buns to die for although very busy at times as it is quite a small area to sit but we took breakfast to our room instead  We were at the front of the building above street but with window closed at night didnt hear a thing Amazing view of Empire State from window wireless internet was brilliant  The only thing I have to say is that the room doors are very poorly designed they make such a noise when closing them even when trying to shut them quietly as to not disturb other guests  Most of the guests in our neighbouring rooms just let them slam which when you are fast asleep at am sounds like an explosion Not the noise you want to hear Other than that a great stay 
N => Excellent NYC Hotel I stayed at this hotel one night and would highly recommend it  Check in was very quick and hotel staff was friendly  We recieved an quotupgradedquot room without asking  Room was on the th floor  Did not hear any street noise what so ever  The walls are also not as thin as other hotels  We did not hear any neighbors  No trouble at all with the elevators  The room size for New York was surprisingly big however that  be what the quotupgradequot was  We went to breakfast very late in the morning  Just about  minutes before it was set to end and there was still a good selection  Seating was crowded but I enjoy bringing back to the room any way  Cant recommend this hotel enough  
N => Excellent value great experience I stayed here with my dog that was entered in the Westminster Kennel Club dog show  I got an excellent rate through the Holiday Inn Priority Club The location to Madison Square Garden was excellent  The hotel was easy to find and it was relatively easy to get a spot to unload our luggage  There are parking lots next door but the preferred parking garage is a street over and  blocks down  Be prepared to walk back to the hotel if you park there Even though parking is listed for day on the website that price is for small cars  To park my minivan it was  more per day  Still an excellent price The hotel staff was courteous and check in was done as promptly as possible even though it was quite busy  Our room was small as other reviewers have noted  It was very clean organized and fresh  The bathroom was larger than I expected and included a  tub with good water pressure  Our  double bed room overlooked a patio courtyard and was not at all noisy  The high speed internet was free fast and easy to access  The adjustable electronic thermostat worked great and we were quite comfortable The continental breakfast was nice  Priority Club members can avoid the long breakfast lines and have food delivered to the room each morning  Items included pancakes cheese omelets cereals muffins fruit etc    The coffee service was availabe  I will definitely stay here again  
N => Bad Experience Date uary  to ruary  Reviewer Lee Pu ShengWe have just returned from a week stay at the Holiday Inn Express Madison Square Garden NYC and the experience was terrible My wife left her purse in the room the only time and found out that someone took US from her Four T shirts were also missing from our luggage after we check them with the hotel since we had a late flight home Ironically one of the T shirt had the new American presidents picture on it Yes We Can  StealquotThere is certain a negligence on our part since we should have all our stuff with us when going out also we would not be able to provide any solid evidence to prove the said thefts were carried out by abyone in the hotel still we would like to remind all possible customers Be Prepared 
N => disappointed We often stay at the holiday inn express hotels throughout the USA I was really disappointed with the size of the rooms we had  people in our room with  double beds and there was absolutely no room to move The buffet breakfast was crowded and there were not enough tables to fit everyone and the whole experience was awful This breakfast was one reason we stayed there and most mornings we didnt even bother to eat there as there was no room The location was good although i think it is better to stay closer to Times Square Also while we were there the lift broke down so we had to climb the stairs which was exhausting Wouldnt stay at this hotel again  
N => Great location but some inconveniences I stayed in this hotel for a weel and in general I am satisfied with my stay  It was walking distance to a lot of places and attractions as well as to bus train and subway stations  There are restaurants close to it and also plenty of stores The breakfast in the morning was always warm fresh and very good although it was hard to find a place to sit and most days I had to take breakfast to my bedroom  Also there was always coffee and tea available in the lobby  There were a couple of things I was not satisfied about  One is that the heater in my bedroom was so loud that I didn t get one night of good sleep while I was there even using ear plugs if you have sensitive sleep I don t recomend to take the risk  I complained because the heater in my father s bedroom was not that loud and they told me to turn it off    not much of a help considering it was ember and I d rather sleep bad than get a cold in my vacation Another thing I was not satisfied about was that the room service was inconsistent  In  days I was there I didn t get toiletteries nor clean towels nor tea or coffee in my bedroom for  days  The bedroom was always cleaned and the bed made but to forget to leave clean towels  out of  days I think is a thing to mention  I also complained about in in the reception and I got woken up at  am with clean towels Besides these two things I would recommend this hotel for its location for the breakfast and the fact that it was neat and clean Also I must say that the street where it is located felt quite safe to me which I think is important if you plan to go back to the hotel at night  
N => Great place great rate We just returned from a weekend get a way to NYC  It was our first time  Our family loved the trip  The sights and sounds of NY were wonderful  The hotel was great The rooms are not huge but its NY and I didnt expect them to be big  But they were clean the hallways quiet and the hot breakfast was outstanding  We were close to everything  We didnt know how to navigate the city but the front desk staff couldnt have been nicer  They gave us maps tips on travel recommended routes etc  They were very friendly and efficient at check in and at check out  We truly had a great stay and will visit this Holiday Inn Express again  
N => Great Little Hotel While the rooms were small they were clean and modern  We had three staying in each of three rooms  No problem  The breakfast was terrific  I expected stale rolls and some coffee   I dont know why my expectations were so low Everything was really good and there was a large choice  The hotel isnt in my favorite location but it was easy to get to the subway taxis and a very short walk to Times Square  Finally the concierge was extremely helpful  Actually the entire staff was wonderful  A rare thing for New York Id stay here again  
N => Beware these Rip off Artists I booked this location for business the week before Thanksgiving for the first day of ember  My client changed the trip dates on us and the hotel would NOT let us cancel  Even though I called them more than a full week before my planned stay they told me they could not allow me to cancel the room more like would not  THEY BILLED ME OVER   FOR A CANCELLED ROOM that I never used We all they being in Manhattan they were able to rent this room The Holiday Inn NYC MSG basically STOLE over   from me  BEWARE 
N => Worst hotel room I have ever stayed in  I reserved a suite with a king size bed and Jacuzzi tub on the Holiday Inn website  Then I discovered a friend would be traveling with me and I added a comment to the reservation asking for  double beds in place of the king suite  I called the hotel and the receptionist said she got the request and would try to accommodate the request and to ask about it when I got to the hotel the following week  When I arrived too early to check in on Saturday ober   the receptionist said they have rooms with double beds available and to return at check in time to get the room  I returned to the hotel at  p m  to check in  The new receptionist said they were out of double bedded rooms and the only way to accommodate us was to put us in the wheelchair accessible room with a queen bed and to request a roll away bed  I asked him to get us the roll away bed right away to ensure we would have a place for my friend to sleep  He did and we went downstairs to the subterranean level to room  As we got off the elevator we were shocked that the entire hallway was blocked by huge laundry bins and dirty laundry piled up throughout the floor space  It was so clogged up that the employees sorting the dirty laundry had to lift our luggage over the piles for us and we had to climb over them to get to our room  The hallway smelled like disgusting wet towels and sheets  It was so filthy Unfortunately since there were no more double bedded rooms and since the hotel was completely sold out we didn t have any other option than to stay in that room That night in the middle of the night the workers outside the hallway were being very loud  My friend had to ask them to quiet down which they did and apologized  Then half an hour later the noise started up again  We came to discover the next morning that the employee break room was next to our room and the employees were bringing their small children to work with them  If we could not get down the hallway without the assistance of the employees with our luggage it is absolutely inconceivable that a disabled person in a wheelchair could possibly navigate through the piles of dirty laundry and the bins taking up hall space  This is a violation of laws governing disabled access  I encouraged the hotel to investigate and solve the issue for future disabled guests  I have forwarded my complaint to the hotel twice and followed up  I still have not received a response  I hope my experience will serve as a warning to future travelers 
N => Kind and polite but not pretentious Everything in this property was as expected and some things we re even better  Almost an instant response from front office to an email concerning details of the rate we had chosen before our arrival was perfectly in line with everyhing else kind and polite but not pretentious  Everyone we met at this hotel we re doing a wonderful job being like thatIf you re thinking about staying in this hotel you re probably not looking for some luxurious options that New York City has plenty to offer but good basic accomodations for a reasonable price I think this is one of the best ones in this gategory and it is quitepossible that we ll be staying there again in the future especially when staying in Chelsea  
N => Excellent stay and very good value for money Im very picky when it comes to hotels but this one was really good value and defintiely exceeded my expectations  Rooms were quite large for NYC and bathtroom was very big  Location is excellent you can walk to anything really  Breakfast also included and very good value much better than most continental breakfasts  I booked a very low rate and got a room just next to reception which I was worried was going to be noicy but wasnt  However in the morning it smelled like fresh baked goods due to its proximity to the breakfast bufet I would feniteiyl recommend this hotel  
N => Totally Satisfied O K  If youre doing N Y  on a budget and you need a very centrally located accomodation that is affordable cant beat it  My sister got an amazing rate dont know how she did it and we were able to walk to all of the midtown sights shopping Broadway and beyond  When we ventured beyond we were able to cab it back quite affordably  My feet were tiredRooms are compact but newly refurbished comfy beds super clean and noise what noise I was too zonked after the all day sight seeing and shopping to notice  Breakfast included and sure the breakfast seating area is tight no biggy we took our plates outside and sat on the benches conveniently located in front  Defintely nothing to complain about  If not go to the Park Plaza or Waldorf and pay the big bucks  Staff was very courteous and helpful even gave us a later checkout no charge  It was a Monday and many guests had left that day  Goes to show that they are willing to help if they can  We took a shuttle bus back to JFK and preferred our location to the other  pick ups the shuttle van made on the way to the Airport  Both my sister and I commented on the money we saved in cab fare had we been accomodated in any those other locations Exceeded our expectations 
N => Great Place This was the first trip to New York for myself and my ten year old grandson  The hotel was walking distant from Penn station  The staff was friendly and helpful  The room was small but comfortable and clean  The morning breakfast was very popular with travelers  I opted to grab a cup of coffee and a piece of fruit rather than wait for a table  The hotel is conveniently located which allowed us to walk to many sites  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good deal   
N => Bad rooms nice people O k    so we didnt book this room ourselves  It was for a job I had  basically had no idea we were staying here  Im hardly ungrateful since the room was paid for us  That stated I probably would not stay here again  Even by New York standards the rooms were small  Barely any space in the bathrooms and no closet  just a small dresser  It was hard to even move in the room Room was very noisy and the view was looking into a dirty alley outside  There were stains all over the carpet as well  On the plus side the beds were very comfortable  The staff was also really really nice  Genuninely really good helpful people  It is a shame that the rooms were so unclean and too small because the staff was just so sweet and attentive  BTW the free breakfast in the morning is very crowded  Get a seat early if you can Location was convienent to Times Square  
N => Unhappy    Overall stay was o k   The hotel was clean but rooms were VERY small  A good deal for seein the beatiful city  Booked a room with double beds but got a room with one king  Front desk did nothing to fix the problem  They said they had no other rooms available but when going back to front desk to see what could be done other guest were offered what we asked for O K  hotel but will never stay there again   terrible costumer service 
N => Location location Never having visited NYC before everything I booked was a shot in the dark  We flew into Newark with no plan on how to get to the hotel in NYC  As luck would have it a train runs from the airport to Penn Station    blocks away  The hotel is also walking distance to Times Square and of course the subway a block away can take you anywhere  After exploring it is so nice to have a clean comfortable room to come home to  Its not big by any measure but it does have everything you need  
N => Wonderful Hotel Stayed  nights at this hotel with Husband amp Son and really loved it Had stayed in New Jersey for  nights prior to this and upon arrival was slightly worried about area No need it was perfectly safe Rooms spotlessslightly small  DBL Bedsbut hey this is NY Bathroom lovely too Breakfast was great a little crowed after am but nice variety to begin day  Macys five minute walk away and everywhere within easy reach Coffee maker in room and complimentary tea amp coffee available all day in lobby Internet available also Found the staff very helpful and in particular Joh hotels day concierge  Joh was extremely helpful and plesant on all occasions and far exceeded his duties I had trouble buying tickets for a Yankee game Son had to see before old stadium closed as booking site could not complete because my credit card billing address was Ireland  I e mailed phoned etc   etc    and it proved impossible I was resigned to not going as going to the Bronx without tickets  have really disappointed As we were heading out for the day Joh enquired how we got on with tickets I explained and he offered to put tickets on his debit card and I could pay him which he did We were ecstatic we all enjoyed the gameNot sure how scoring worked but atmosphere was brilliant and a few home runs also Joh has travelled and knew what seeing a game means but it was very kind of him to help us By the time we were leaving hotel felt like home  Highly recommend the hotel for NY trip  
N => st Stay in NYC we will stay here again The stay at Holiday Inn Express Manhattan ChelseaMSG greatly exceeded our expectations  From the sincere friendly and knowledgeable service at the front desk the fast and efficient luggage check inout to the extreme cleanliness of the facility it was a breath of fresh air  We have traveled extensively over the years and without a doubt the breakfast offerings were the best we have experienced given it was  just a hotel stay  It was delicious varied and changed every day  The time saved and was very welcome in NYC The Internet room made it great to access our e mail and for me to check on my business  There was no need for our laptop  We did not use the exercise equipment but it was there if needed and available most of the time  The facility validated our parking at a recommended secure parking ramp saving us even more money It was our st trip to NYC  The only negative was the room was small  It did not matter though as the space was very efficiently used with plenty of storage  There is no doubt in my mind that I will be looking to stay here again and would highly recommend others to do so also  
N => Great  I stayed at the Holiday Inn Madison Square Garden in uary and found it to be more than I expected  It seemed like it was in somewhat of a bad neighborhood when we first got there but then we realized that the only really nice areas of the city seem to be in Times Square and parts of midtown ManhattanCentral Park areas  So for the price we paid night on Hotwire com it was worth the stay  I never spend much time in the hotel rooms when I am on vacation anyway so we used the room for sleeping showering and ate breakfast  The rooms were somewhat small not alot of room for moving around or storing luggage  They were basically big enough for the beds desk and entertainment center  The breakfast was great I was expecting a small cold toast bowl of cereal continental breakfast but it was far from that  Different meal everday consisting of everything from omelettes to biscuits amp gravy to pancakes  Very good  The staff were very nice housekeeping was great hotel was clean  Another great thing about this hotel was the location which is usually why I pick the hotels I do  We had a view of the top of the Empire State Building from our room which was a site to see especially at night  It was a block from Madison Square Garden in the center of Manhattan so about   minute walk to the tourist parts of Manhattan but the subway was also only a block away and we used this to get pretty much anywhere we went  It only cost about person for the  days we were there  The only thing I wished was different about this hotel was the fact that it did not have a pool however Holiday Inn Express does not usually have a pool so I cant complain about this particular one  Also had complimentary newspapers free internet vending machines coffeehot chocolatejuice in the kitchen  hours and within walking distance to a convenience store and some good places to eat  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Great Stay I just wanted to say we had a wonderful stay at this hotel  Check in was quick and easy The front desk staff was pleasant  Our room was nicely sized for a NYC hotel room  The bathroom was small and poorly set up but did the job  For anyone interested shampoo conditioner lotion body wash soap and mouthwash were provided  The room was very clean and the amenities were great  I was able to accept a fax at the front desk use the business center to get online and print and they also had a faxcopier down there but it was out of order during our stay  The complimentary breakfast was great   sausage eggs toast biscuits yogurt cereal donuts muffins and much more  It appeared that coffee was available throughout the day and a complimentary USA Today was available outside the elevators so make sure you line to have it delivered to your room saving you  day  The  subway line is just around the corner which was convenient  Make sure if you need any snacks though to get them early in the day as the drug store on the corner closes quite early PM be and there isnt much else close by  Another example of their helpfulness   I had a bunch of stuff to ship home  I asked the front desk if they had a box and packing tape  She told me I could use their packing tape but I would have to go buy a box at fedex   I asked one of the housekeeping staff though and they were more than happy to empty a box for my use  We got a wonderful rate through hotwire  Again we had a GREAT stay this trip and I would highly recommend this hotel to those who are looking for a nicely priced clean place to stay in NYC  
N => Very good deal well located clean This hotel is very well located near subway stations and in the middle of NYC which allows to easily go West  East or North  South Even if rooms are pretty small they are comfortables and clean and bathroom seems to be brand new The only weakness would be the breakfast room pretty small compared to the number of people that rush into it between am and am but having breakfast outside the hotel in NYC is so nice that this weakness did not seem important to me Last point I used Priorityclub points to pay the hotel so I am not able to judge price to quality but would easily pay  to stay there according to NYC standards this h tel is well priced  
N => Good Hotel Stayed here with  friends over Thanksgiving Weekend and got a good rate on lastminute com  rooms at    per room for  nights This hotel is in a very good location for shopping sights and transportation and we did not feel unsafe at any time Rooms are clean but very small which meant that after our daily shopping we had to pack everything away rather than leave things in a corner as you would not have been able to move around the room  Breakfast was fine except the pancakes   dry around the edgessince it was free hot and cold drinks available day and night which was nice  Local calls are also free which was very useful The hotel charges  per bag to store your luggage Ill definitely stay here again  
N => Holiday Inn Express NYC Madison Square Garden  No problems  We stayed for two night      Had no problems at all staff was very friendly and accommodating  Phoned ahead and got into our room at  am  Close enough to all of NY sights and sounds but quite enough to sleep  Rooms very small but we were not planning to be in there much anyway  
N => Good hotel in great position Stayed at this hotel for a week in late ober got a cab from the airport  plus tolls and tip  Room was ready when we arrived at  pm  Rooms are small but perfectly adequate there was the two of us plus our  year old dhter and we never felt the room was too small  Bathroom very good clean and new  We had a view of the Empire State from our room Room was cleaned rather late in the day around  or  pm but was not much of a problem  Did not experience any noise only a few slamming doors but no noise from rooms either side  The location is fabulous a short  minute walk to Times Square with plenty of restaurants and shops the subway just round the corner on th St  Other subway line which takes you directly to th Avenue from th Avenue at Penn station Breakfast was very good seeing as it was free Plenty of fresh fruit and cereals etc  Appreciated the coffee and juice available anytime Very nice garden terrace to sit after a busy day and very handy business centre downstairs to check emails etc  we even managed to check in online for our BA flight homeAll in all would recommend not the most luxurious but very clean comfortable and very good location 
N => What a dump this place is    This place was a dump  We arrived at noon and they wouldnt allow an early check in  Someone was coming to get my bag and check it and then they forgot and the manager FINALLY helped me After a late dinner we got back at midnight and it still took forever to check in  Got to my room and someone was inside of it cleaning it I want back downstairs Im very tired at this point and they basically didnt have a room for me and I waited and waited  They assured me earlier in the day that checking in that late wouldnt cause any issues Finally they gave me a room on the ground level   lucky for me it was right next to the maids cleaning rooms and they were chatting up a storm starting about am  Then as breakfast started at am people were shuffling around and making more noise The breakfast was barely edible  AVOID this place at all cost  Too much hassle and noone seemed to truly want to make things right I was ready to give them some feedback when I checked out and nobody even asked me how my stay went  
N => good position Just returned from a touring holiday in North America and this was our first stop Location was very good as we were able to walk to most of the sites we wanted to see Central Park was about  mins walk would have been quicker if it wasnt for all the traffic lights  We thought it was a better view from the Rockerfeller Tower than Empire State and a lot shorter queues Subway was just around the cornerloads of restaurants nearbyhelpful staffwould definitely consider this hotel if we were to go back to New York  
N => Nice hotel good location Just returned from a nightday stay at Holiday Inn Express in Chelsea  The hotel was sold out for almost the entire stay  When a hotel is sold out you can usually expect some problems  However during our stay we didnt experience any problems except for be long wait times to use the elevator Overall the Hotel is clean and neat The room we were assigned was right next to the elevator which makes it smaller than other rooms to start with For whatever reason even in this small room they chose to put in a king size bed I appreciate a big bed but a big bed in a small room makes for limited space but it was not a problem Bed was comfortable too The temperatures hit the low s over the weekend with high humidity but the airconditioning in the room kept it cool without a problem  The breakfast provided by the hotel in the morning was excellent  Even tho the dining area was packed constantly with dozens of people coming and going they never ran out of food and the dining room never got messy  Appreciated the food very much We would definately stay at the Holiday Inn in Chelsea again  
N => Great value Great location Great Stay  Just got back from a three night stay in NYC and we booked two rooms at this hotel through Hotwire  We paid around  a room   pretty good value for a hotel in this area  We had a very pleasant stay  The hotel is only around  months old and is modern and clean  We arrived at the hotel right at the check in time of pm and were told that no quotnon   smokingquot rooms were available right away   it would be another hour until they were ready I guess because we booked through hotwire we didnt have specific rooms reserved right away  We could however get a couple of smoking rooms on the th floor right away  As none of our party smoke we pondered this for a few minutes and as it was raining out and we had already been soaked we ided to take those rooms  Both rooms were spotless   there was a very very faint smell of smoke in one of the rooms but it wasnt strong enough to cause us any bother at all  The rooms were very well appointed and comfy   with two double beds in each  We also never noticed any smoke odors coming out of any of the other rooms on the th floor All the staff I encountered were very friendly always smiling and obliging  The bellboy was helpful and friendly and answered all our questions with patience  The cleaning staff were very polite and never made us feel like we were in their way  Our room was cleaned thoroughly every day and we always got fresh linens and lots of clean fluffy towels  A breakfast was included with our reservation and this was also great  Plenty of good hot and cold food was available each morning  It was busy down there every morning which shows you how good it was It was crowded but not impossible to find somewhere to sit if you have little patience  There are three PCs on the lower floor for internet access etc  and a lovely little garden terrace which we unfotunately were unable to take advantage of due to the weather Overall we had a perfect few days in NYC my family really enjoyed the visit their first time in the city  We would not hesitate to book this hotel again  Ive stayed in some real dumps in my time   last time I stayed in NYC I was at the Pennsylvania which was awful  The Holiday Inn Express is superior in every sense and far better value  Highly recommended  
N => Bad Experience I booked a room through their toll free number  I had a couple a couple of questions for which the booking agent gave me positive answers  After the booking was made I thought I should confirm it with the hotel management and they gave me totally opposite answers which really annoyed me  Nevertheless I did not cancel the reservation  When I reached the hotel the day I was supposed to check in they said the room I booked was not available and gave me a really bad room in its place even though I had given my credit card info for holding the desired room  The management did not seem very friendly and were unresponsive  On top of that they charged me incorrectly for the stay and Ive been trying to contact their billing department for the past  days to sort out the problem but get no response  
N => Terrible Unresponsive Management While the rooms  be fine the management is TERRIBLE  We had booked a block of rooms for the weekend given a credit card to pay and on Friday morning they told us they didnt have the rooms even though on Thursday we were told everything was all set  The city was completely sold out   The management was unresponsive even refusing to take our calls  They over booked and would not even assist in finding us other rooms  The general manager Joe Montagne would not take our calls and did not return repeated messages  The sales manager Andy Henricks also would not take our calls or return messages  This is no way to run a business  This hotel  be OK unless you run into a problem and then you will have no one to assist you  I would not suggest booking this hotel when the city is sold out  or you  end up on the streets of New York with nowhere to stay  
N => Clean hotel great customer service We stayed at this hotel on y   for  nights  The hotel was reated last year  The room was very clean but smaller than we thought  However this must be common since it was NYC  The breakfastwas tasty but the room too small overcrowded  The staff was SUPER They were very helpful with parking hints we parked right in front of the hotel which is on a commercial street  That saved us  days of parking day approx  We were lucky because we arrived ony  early evening and y  was a holiday When we left the hotel staff gave us goodies for our trip heading towards Florida and the kids were absolutely impressed They sure made them feel specialI would recommend this hotel to my friends and I would stay there again  
N => Okay at best  I stayed at this hotel from       and it was okay at best  The rooms are small but thats not a problem considering we only slept in them  The major problem was the faulty air conditioners  Our room stayed at  degrees all day despite sitting the thermometer at  degrees  At first we thought it was a broken unit so we switched rooms  TWICE  We had a total of three rooms and none of the air conditioners were very good  Thank goodness it wasnt uest  I dont expect sub zero temperatures but when I pay  a night for a hotel room I do expect ent temperatures  That was our only complaint albeit a large one  A maintenance man was sent to each of our three rooms to check out the AC and each time he said the unit was fine it just needed time to cool off  When we would return  hours later the room was still hot and the temperature did not change  Other than that this hotel is fine  The breakfast is nice so is the free coffeejuice in the lounge all day and night  It is VERY close to everything    we walked to Times Square with no problem   The city is amazing  I reccommend catching the Phantom of the Opera  It was spectacular  This hotel wasnt BAD but it wasnt great either  It is doubtful we will stay at this Holiday Inn Express  
N => It should be called the barking dog hotel  Hmmmm  Well Im not so happy  A few major problems  Front desk was friendly but very unaccommodating  Also it has a  star rating but Ive stayed in much nicer  stars downtown in NYC The first problem is the barking dogs  This apparently is a pet hotel  Saturday night was horrible  The room next to me left their small yappy dog in the room alone all day  And the dog barked yelped cried and winded all day and all night until  in the morning when their owners returned  WHO DOES THIS TO THEIR ANIMALS I would never leave my pets alone scared in a hotel room  Im in town for a job interview and I got no sleep  none  No exaggeration  You hear everything through these walls and the dog sounded like it was  feet away from me  The hotel did nothing about it  The hotel was sold out so I could not move rooms  They sent security up who verified there was a yappy whining dog in the room  That was about it  Next the heatair did not work  Again I couldnt switch rooms because it was sold out  I had to keep the window open to try to cool it off in the room Also I wanted to do a late check out  I was   willing to pay to do so   I wanted to check out at  and not noon on a MONDAY and they flat out said no to it  After inquiring and saying I would pay to do so they said there would be a  charge  I asked how long that would give me and hey said a  an hour  CRAZY  CRAZY  CRAZY The room was clean and well sized for a NYC hotel  It was clean and secure  I would not call this Chelsea  Technically it is but its closer to Madison Square Garden and the Empire State building than anything quiet and trendy like Chelsea  Location was just fine though its close to all the subway lines  I got a good deal here through hotwire  Equal to the price of a  star shared bathroom this weekend  Would I stay here for the average full price of  a night  No way Never  I would go to The Exchange or The Avenue for a much cheaper and pleasant experience for that money The barking dog was the worst  Im very unhappy  
N => Comfortable No problems to report very clean amp comfortable we had a whirlpool bath which was fantastic to relax in after a day walking  Only stayed one night  Breakfast room is very small if the hotel is busy I expect there could be a wait for a table Continental breakfast was good quality  Quick check in amp check out  Everything you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express  
N => Pretty Nice Room but      Holiday Inn Express Chelsea is a nice little hotel conveniently located    not really in Chelsea actually closer to mid town and Penn StationMadison Square Garden  The room I stayed in was clean and comfortable and best of all QUIET  On one of the upper floors with very little street noise The room was nicely appointed and modern though small  My experience at the hotel was good overall except for one thing hotel parking is a problem  The hotel claims to have a deal with a garage about   blocks walk from the door  The problem is there are three garages on the same block so if youre looking to get Holiday Inn Expresss overnight parking deal for  you have to make sure you have the right garage  I located the correct garage parked my car for less than  hours then when I went to retrieve the car was told the hotel had stamped my parking tag as a quothotel employeequot so I was not eliglble for the  overnight parking deal  When I returned to the hotel to explain the problem and try to get them to credit my account for the difference I had to pay for parking from the amount they advertised the front desk clerk refused with the explanation that because I had booked my room through Hotwire they couldnt make any credits to my account Not very good customer service  I had no choice but to pay the extra  for parking if I wanted to get my car back    after sloshing through the rain for several long city blocks to park the car in the first place  I was willing to accept this inconvenience in order to get the hotels advertised parking rate which ultimately I did not get and the hotel would not make right without making me jump through hoops and make all sorts of calls long after I had left to anonymous quotmanagersquot      ie the buck was passed with no satisfaction Be prepared for a ent room and convenienct location but much less than stellar customer service from this outfit  
N => Our First Trip to NY   would stay here again We stayed  nights location was goodclose to Penn StationEmpire State buildingth Avenue  The staff here were very helpful   we had a problem with our room on arrival but this was soon addressed  
N => I would not recommend this hotel I was not at all happy with our stay at this hotel Accomodations were booked thru      for one room two nights three people  The reasons are as follows No parking garage at the hotel  We had to park  blocks away   The room had two double beds  A double bed is very uncomfortable for two adults to sleep in together and I can tell you that I had two nights of very bad sleep   The complimentary drinks were not available b c the coffeejuice machine had a notice on it that stated it had been shut down by the dept of health   The complimentary breakfast ended at  am NOT  am as stated in the Guest information booklet in the room  We found this out when we went down to breakfast at  and found that breakfast was over the management had neglected to inform us of this change   The housekeeper did not leave us any soap when she made up the room in the first morning  We asked for soap but she did not give us any she told us to use bath gel instead  
N => very noisy Hotel was overrun with school parties we spent  very sleepless night there in ch  having complained three times we were never taken serious the manager was never in he was gonna get back to us that never happend If you are travelling with a very large school party we think this hotel would suit you and you want to be up all night with kids running along corridors and banging doors it was   kids in the hotel very very noisy while lying in bed we could hear someone in the adjoining room urinating and the flush disgusting  
N => Great Location Awesome Breakfast Went to NYC to sightsee with a friend  We loved the location of the hotel close to a lot of transportation shopping and restaurants  As women we felt   safe  Hotel staff was extremely courteous free wireless access in the rooms  
N => Great Place to Stay Just returned from a weekend stay  For a NYC hotel this was great and priced well  My room was clean the staff was friendly each night of my stay they recommended GREAT places for dinner  I arrived early am and they checked my bags  Breakfast was free and was more then I expected  I would highly recommend this hotel and have plans to stay here during my next visit to NYC  
N => Cleancomfortable  A very clean comfortable modern hotel in a central location  minutes walk to Maceys and the Empire State building Helpful friendly staff  Breakfast was bit of a scrum due to more people than seating nether the less we managed and the food provided was adequate  The hot and cold drinks available f o c   in the lobby are an excellent extra as was the perculator in our room The hotel arranged our transport back to the airport and happily stored our bags for the afternoon The free use of the internet was another plus factor  Would not hesitate to stay here again  
N => Excellent Location and very Comfortable We stayed at this Hotel over New year  for five days  having never been to the US before we were not sure what to expect in terms of hotel standards however we were pleasantly suprised The hotel room was quite large and very comfortable  The room had a very large double bed a wardrobe wide screen television with cable channels and a dressing table  The hotel rooms bathroom was very well finished in ble from top to bottom with an excellent bathshower the brand of which you can actually purchase from the hotel  The room was also airconditioned  The hotel room was very modern finished to a high standard with new furniture  It was extremely clean and tidy The hotel has a breakfast area and serves a buffet style breakfast in the mornings which mainly consisted of processed fast food but the cinnamon danish buns were delicious  We found the hotel to be excellent value for money and the location was superb close to Macys the Empire State Building and transport links  We stayed at a busy time of the year and found the breakfast room to be of an inadequate size to cope with the volume of guests staying at this time  It was also difficult to get to our floor as we sometimes had to wait a while on the lift  The hotel advertises gym facilities however this is misleading  Its a room with only two treadmills and an exercise bikeWe sent a number of items to be laundered in the hotel and they all came back shrunk so be aware of thisAll this said we really enjoyed the hotel and would definitely recommend it to other travellers  
N => Great deal Four days before a weekend trip to New York our hotel plans fell through  After bidding for a room on priceline amp praying that we wouldnt get a dump for the cheap price we paid I have to say that we were more than pleasenly surprised with this hotel  It was new clean amp the staff was very helpful with anything that we needed  It being New York we were expecting a very poor experience for the price that we paid  It was instead one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to be in New York and needs to stay on a budget  It is close to Penn Station and a quick hop to anywhere that you would like to go in the city  The complimentary breakfast was also more than we bargined for   you can plan on eating at the hotel instead of having to eat breakfast out  Although I do recommend that you get to the buffett early it gets crowded the later it is in the morning  The room was small but in New York it doesnt really matter anyway  
N => Very pleased overall Sticker shock for New York hotels in ember was terrible  Finally hit this hotel through Priceline  Price was still high but better than other choices The hotel is either new or reorated  Room was small but clean with new furnishings  Staff was helpful and friendly  Its not as close to my favorite haunts as other hotels but still fairly convenient  Buildings along the street were under reation and it was a bit scary walking under scaffolding at night at first but there were enough pedestrians to make me feel safe There seemed to be lots of families and tour groups staying here another sign of good value Free breakfast was adequate but nothing to write home about I would stay here again especially when everything else is pricey  
N => Good overall  but please sort out those slamming doors We booked this hotel after iding pretty last minute that we were going to NY for xmas and new year  It was a complete chance as there were no reviews at the time and limited details available but it was reasonable for manhattan and I just went with the fact it was new  We were more than pleased with the hotel when we arrived  Its not exactly luxury but more a room rate that varied between  and  dollars over the festive break we could not complain  Room was clean and adequate size good toiletries often replaced  I didnt use my own  The bath wasnt big enough for my partner but fine for me  Breakfast had a good range on offer the bagels and muffins were delicious but it was so busy that when new items came out there was a scarm for who could get  bowls each first and then leave them on their bowls uneaten  The breakfast room really was very small for the number of guests and I always felt very sorry for the staff that were trying to replenish stocks amongst frustrated guests wanting more doughnuts etc  One day my own frustartion got the better of me as I watched one worker trying his best to get food out whilst people shouted for more  I went to reception where  staff were seemingly just watching this taken place  I asked if there was anyone that could help him as it wasnt fair for people to be shouting at him  The lady behind the desk was very pleasant but there was a man who acted like he was above it all and simpley replied its always like thisquot Aside from this the other big problem for me was the noise I was pleasantly surprised to find that outside noise was minimal thanks to great double glazing  However the doors constantly slamming really needs to be sorted  The walls betwwen rooms are really way too thin as well we could hear tvs talking and the worst  one couples nurnal activities  If only these things were not an isssue I would have given the hotel   as it was a good price good location free internet access and the drinks machine that you could help yourself to was a godsend a lovely touch that saved us so much money  
N => Brand New   Great Find  
N => Normal Bien  
N => Un prezzo straordinario per un bellissimo albergo  
N => GREAT HOTEL TO STAY THOUGH WISH THE MGT MORE FLEXIBLE W Lugguage Policy Stay  night on t   using the Priority Club Points as we had to join a tour in the nearby Chinatown the next day and the location of this hotel from the pick up point is about  blocks away  Everyone is VERY NICE upon check in as my  yrs old dhter was crying out loud her heart to learn that we didnt stay in Sheraton LaGuardia as we did the previous  nights but here I was really embarrassed but the check in staff was fanstastic came out and tried to calm her down but futile  Beat me sometimes todlers are so quotsensitive quot amp quotpassionatequot about the hotel that they once stayed  The only complaint that I have is that the hotel will not hold our luggage for  nights if we dont have a future reservation and quoted us due to liability and suggested that we stored our lugguage in Penn Station  This is a crazy suggestion as we arrived in the late evening that night and will have no time to travel to Penn Station that night as we only need to store  piece so that the next morning we didnt need to drag  pieces of luggage when we joined our  days  nights tour to Philly Washington DCNiagara Falls and Thousand Island  We explained that we are going to book their car service upon our return on rd day to Jersey City and would this change No SORRY that is the reply I found this VERY DISCRIMATING as a guest as it sounds like they will hold luggage for you if you have a future stay otherwise once your stay is over SORRY you are not my guest anymore and that is your problem In my prior stay of hotel like Sheraton Vancouver they willing to hold and charge you a nominal fee per night of holding   This is at least an option and being helpful to your guest and not give us a rediculous suggestion that we store at Penn Station  So apart from this issue of not able to hold our  piece luggage since we have no pending reservation which I found unappreciated as a guest as well as being an UNHELPFUL hotel meeting guest needs Overall room is clean and comfortable as they put us on club floor and indeed no street noise or subway train vibrations  Staff are friendly amp helpful apart from the incident that not able to hold our  piece luggage for  nights even though we booked with them the car service upon our return I would still recommend this hotel stay to friend and family though would advise them to take into consideration the no luggage hold if there is no future reservation with them  
N => The worst hotel I have ever stayed in    Do not know where to start   this hotel single handedly ruined my holiday in NYC  It was the first time a hotel room has made me cry The room was small   no make that tiny smelly dirty and looked NOTHING like the photos on the website   do not get sucked in about their claim of spacious rooms that were reated in   I cannot believe they charged what they did for the room over US  night   to think of the hotels i could have stayed in It is NOT in the middle of Soho   it is on the very edge of Soho across the road from Chinatown  It is not a glamourous part of NYC   and travelling solo I did not feel safe in the area  I still cannot believe I was stupid enough to stay there   shame on you Holiday Inn   you  not be the most glamourous hotel chain in the world but there is still a level of expectation that you did not meet at this hotel  I doubt I will ever stay at a Holiday Inn again  
N => A Nighte Travelling to New York for the very first time with family I selected this hotel from the net because of its price and perceived location and most of all the name Holiday Inn  Little did I know what I was getting into  The issue was much greater than small  dirty rooms or noisy airconditioner and vibrating floors due to underground trains  Upon arrival the hotels Bell Service saw us being dropped off by an expensive car service and promptly mentioned to us that they have a cheaper service available    which could drop us off to JFK airport when well check out  We said okay  After about three days when we checked out the hotel arranged its economical taxi service The driver of the car started off with the flat tire which we realized after  minutes  He ignored the people on the street waving and pointing this to him  He did not pull over the car when we asked him to do so until such time that the smoke from the tire started to come out  Then he kept driving insisting to get the tire changed from some specific shop  When the car finally stopped at the tire workshop       some Spanish guys came and asked my whole family to come out of the car so that they can change the tire  In trying to take out the spare tire from the car our luggage was put on the road Then one guy tricked me into the tire shop and took hold of my brief case and ran off Incidentally the brief case had our passports visas cash and valuables Later we realized that another car had been following us all along that car was found parked at the tire shop and was most probably used by the gangsters to run away  By the time police came they had already fled As family with small children we were emotionally shaken The bottom line is    It was a set up in which the involvement of hotel staff can not be ruled out  We had opted for the hotels airport drop off service as it was considered to safer being offered by Holiday Inn  Due to this incident the whole trip is now a great tragedy  
N => GREAT LOCATION My husband and I stayed here for the th of y weekend  The room was small with a king size bed but we still had enough room to move around comfortably  The bed was comfortable the room was clean and we could not hear any of the noise from the street below or from the hallway even though we were right across from the elevator  The staff was helpful any time we had a question  We were given a map when we checked in and believe me when I say that map was used  
N => Never Again Will I Stay Here Again Even if Its Free This was my worst hotel experience  Believe me  I mean that  I have travelled all over the world staying in all types of hotel but this was the dirtiest hotel I have ever been in  It was so full of dust and mold that the first nite I stayed my allergies acted up so bad that I did not sleep all night but dealing with running nose sneezes and headaches  The supposed to be quotwhitequot curtains are grey  I moved the bed a little towards the wall so my little girl would not fall off the bed and there was sooooo much dust and dirt underneath the bed that it was absolutely disgusting  I left it that way in the morning and housekeeping still did not cleaned it up or vaccum the quotnow exposedquot area under the bed  I would not stay here ever again even if its free  When I complained to the front desk they were accommodating tried to switch me to different rooms but each room that they show me it was the same   moldy dusty and dirty  It was over  a night  I took my parents there we had  arate rooms and even my parents who came from overseas to visit said they have never been in a hotel this bad of a shape Dont make the same mistake I did  
N => Perfect  Got a very good deal on a room  on hotwire so this was the perfect hotel  Close to soho chinatown little italy etc   staff was very friendly room was very clean altough a little worn  we stayed with our  year old and  month old they had very little room to play in  but it was still manageable the only reason i did not give  stars is because of troubles with the vending machines there are  on different floors the first three we tried were either broken or sold only water   i have reccomend this hotel to familyand they will try it soon  
N => price was good this hotel is over  years old as a holiday inn  The location was great but the room quality is not good  The rooms are very outdated and need to be updated  The staff was not very caring  They lied to people trying to convince them to join the reward program and was not telling the guest the truth about the program  I had a very nice room with a good view but has mildew in the shower and the walls were very outdated  Overall the hotel was a good place and for the price it was great being in that part of town  
N => Outrageous Rate My husband took me up to NYC for a surprise getaway  I was not allowed to know what the price of the hotel was  We ended up paying  with room taxes for one Thursday night  When we got back home to figure out a return trip with the kids I was checking rates and all rates were ranging at the   low   I am appalled that my husband spent that kinda of money on a no frills midweek room  Upon arriving at the hotel my husband pulled over and blocked the road and let me out so that I could find out where we needed to park the car  I ran up the escalator to the front desk and was told the was a bellman below  I proceeded to head back down the escalator to look all around for a bellman  I didnt see one so I went back out to the card to tell my husband that I was looking for the bellman  He was stressing out because he was in the roadway  Then I went back into the hotel in search of the bellman  I finally found him and he gave me a claim ticket  By this point I head back outside and see that my husband has parked the car across the street  I jump in and tell him that I found the bellman  He starts to get out of the car to get our bags when I finally see the bellman on the other side of the street shaking his head  He then crosses the street and explains to us that we need to move the car to the other side of the street to the hotel loading zone which was previously full  After that we checked in to the hotel with no incident  We arrived at the room and it was a small double bed room with a bath  Nothing special  Upon departure I called for my car  I guess it is my ingnorance in dealing with the valet but when my car arrived the driver was rude to me and told me to wait  I didnt feel that the trip was a waste but felt that when I got back and saw the pricing I didnt feel like I got my moneys worth  I checked the following days rate which was a Friday and it was more than half what we paid  Beware of prices 
N => Great Stay This hotel was in a good location near the cool sites and subway  The beds were so comfy with a pillow menu and the hospitality was one of the best we have encountered in NY  Yes the room was small but no smaller than other hotels in Manhattan with all the things to do and see I really just want a clean and comfortable room to come back to after dinner The hotel was very close to little italy so we enjoyed a great pizza and fabulous meatballsWould highly recommend 
N => Best bet for downtown Couldnt be better located the rooms were fine just what we expected  Small but clean and manageable  One block to Chinatown two block to Little Italy  minute walk to Soho etc  Subway about  feet from front door  Staff was very friendlty and helpful went way out of their way to help us find what we wanted  Very safe area for NYC  Have stayed there often even when our trip was to other sections of NYC  Doesnt matter just hop on the subway and go  Many restaurants within a couple minutes walk   ask at the desk theyll help you  
N => NOT a  star hotel This is NOT a  star hotel Ive stayed at many  star hotels in NYC and trust me this is not worth the money you will spend  Whats even worse is I booked my room on Priceline I will NEVER again use this service so had no way to get out of the reservation once we arrived  The location is DIRTY right off Canal Street but the good thing was it was close to Broadway shopping and Little Italy dining  If you do find yourself needing to book a room here ladies do yourself a favor and pack your own shampoo and conditioner  This is the only  star hotel in NYC that offers  in  shampooconditioner go figure Ive also never known an upscale hotel to have slamming mechanisms on the doors  Our stay Saturday night the night before we had to be at work for a trade show we were constantly SLAM awakened by people SLAM moving from room to room SLAM after a night out on the town SLAM  Bring earplugs 
N => Will never stay there again Due to a flight problem I booked one room at Holiday Inn Downtown at past midnight mid e  Indeed the hotel should rather be named Chinatown  Fairly easy to find close to Canal St station and to walk from the metro elevator  The desk staff and the security guard were very kind and warm welcoming even I arrived at am  I was upgraded to an executive room the   ones on the corner of Hoaward amp Lafayette St  But the room th floor was very noisy due to cars lorryes and vans passing around in Howard Lafayette and Broadway  Even worse the air cond  are fairly old inside engines on  windows and made a very loud noise  Either you stop them and sweat either you let them run but could not sleep in both cases  Curtains do not close completely so you got light inside early morning  The buffet breakfast was good but not great for  tax amp service incl  The overall price I paid was good due to my corporate rate but it was not worth the bargain due to the noise  be executive rooms in the higher floors are better  But I will never test it again ps  I noticed many high standard european hotel chains offer lower quality level in USA Holiday Inn Radisson 
N => Watch out for credit card charges and poor customer service I stayed at this hotel in ch  and had a fairly enjoyable visit  It was undergoing construction at the time but the staff was friendly and helpful  I made an arrangment to go back to the same hotel in ch   I made my reservation in early   When I reserved the room the hotel website only gave me quotestimated charges quot Nevertheless my credit card was charged for a rate that I never agreed upon  When I called up the reservations manager yann she was extremely rude and not helpful  When I asked her to email me a confirmation email with the charges I was never emailed one despite being charged  she said she would   but I have to call continuously to have it emailed  Beware of charges at this hotel  I would not recommend to anyone 
N => Mixed We had some mixed reactions with this hotel  We originally booked it because we wanted a different experience from Midtown  However we ended up a bit disapointed  Its tucked into a boring corner of Chinatown be its technically SoHo but the surroundings and the writing on the hotel let you know its ChinatownWe ended up having to cab it quite a bit you can also subway to most locations within   blocks as there was a lack of restuarants and entertainment in the area Rooms were small and the rooms were a little dingy  But it was cheap at   Dont think Ill stay there again Ill be sticking to the Midtown and the UWS  
N => Perfectly Fine Hotel Stayed here with some friends for Columbis Day weekend  Found this to be a cheaper alternative to staying in Midtown  Hotel was very nice room was a bit larger than average because we had two double beds found room to be very clean  We walked the few blocks to Little Italy each night and being three woman we felt very safe  My only complaint was the hotel restaurant we did eat breakfast there on the day we checked out  The service was horrible as was the food not at all what the menu described it to be  However I would definitely stay here again but only as an alternative to Midtown simply due tot he long cab rides and traffic  
N => Dont be put off great hotel  Cracking hotel especially if you are on a budget and the hotel upgraded us free of charge as it was my wifes birthday Location wise youre only about a  minute walk from Union Square in one direction  minutes to Brooklyn Bridgesouth street seaport in the other  minutes from Ground Zero  Half hour from MacysSaks th Ave  It is a fair trek to the likes of Times Square Restaurant Row or Central Park but its a nice walk and no more than  in a taxi to get back to the hotel  Canal Street subway is literally round the corner less than m away Eating is no problem here the food in all the Cantonese restaurants was terrific  Jewellers on Canal Street were excellent too and we had to purchase another suitcase from Canal Street on our last daySome quotless than authenticquot quotDesignerquot handbags etc  to be had there too  Dont be afraid to accompany the card carrying reps from them  Chinatown on the whole is a total adventure  Embrace alternative cultures and just enjoy yourself  We were lucky in that we were upgraded to the superior suite where I have to say were extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean  Great views of Empire State Building and Midtown from one window and Brooklyn Bridge from the other Complaints about the wireless network We accessed it without a problem through a PSP to contact friends in NYC we were meeting but anyone who takes a laptop to NYC unless on business seriously needs their head examinedThe hotel was extremely friendly and welcoming  We organised a quottaxiquot to get us to the airport for  and the Taxi was this massive Lincoln with a chauffeur Thanks WilliamOur stay was over way too soon and we are currently making arrangements to revisit but we fancy somewhere more central this time  We wouldnt hesitate to stop off here again at a later date and would encourage anyone to quotloosen their bra strapsquot and just enjoy their stay in the greatest city in the world 
N => Good Good friendly staff ent location but found the room small and abit cramped Odd placement of the Air ConditinerHeater In window next to bed  
N => Good Hotel  best rates and nice staff With such mixed reviews I didnt know what to expect but I was very pleased with the room we got and the overall service was great  We were just the two of us for the first night but since a rd friend wascoming the following night we felt the initial room was too small  We mentioned this to the reception and they happily moved us to a bigger room on the th Floor The hotel walls were a bit thin  but Im not going to complain  All in all the hotel is situated in a very convnient location minutes walk from soho chinatown and spring street for shopping  
N => Not bad in Chinatown  not Soho The hotel wasnt bad  My friend had never been to NYC and felt mroe comfortable staying at a chain hotel  It is in Chinatown not Soho  The area had a lot of graffeti and was kind of dirty  But it wasnt a bad area  if I hadnt been to Chinatown before I  have been put off by it  We were on the th floor and still felt and heard the subway  We did get used to it after the first day  What I liked about it was that there were a lot of inexpensive places to eat its close to the subway and close to all the lower Manhattan attractions  We even walked to the Brooklyn Bridge from the hotel The hotel was clean the restaurant was good and the staff was excellent  Patrick and Kelly the concierges were the best  What I didnt like was that it was a little off the beatan path for me  Id have preferred to stay more midtown  I would probably stay there again and recommend it  
N => A hidden jewel By far this was the best stay I had with everything within walking distance  The price was hefty but it was well worth it  Guest satisfaction is paramount and the product is well kept  This is not your typical Holiday Inn Hotel  I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a memerable stay in NYC 
N => poor service We stayed at the Holiday Inn in Lafayette Street New York in ober   The Room and Bathroom are quite small but very Clean  Service was good and friendly  The onlt thing that really annoyed us is that we booked our Car back to the Airport through the Hotel Conceirge for  in the morning  On the morning of our departure there was no car for us even though we had paid for it  Not good when you have a flight to catch  
N => Good for a  day stay Very helpful personal  Room service good It had everything we needed or wanted for a day stay Rooms are smallbut I have seen smaller in NYC  Gym room enough for me  Chinatown one block away  Love that  Bought all the fakes I needed  SOHO not close as chinatown  A enjoyable up to SOHO area  Good eats in all areas  I thought Charging customers for lobby internet was Tacky  Plus it was expensive to use Little ItalySOHOChinatownSubway all in walking distance  New Yorkers are super 
N => One of NYs Best We had one of the best experiences EVER at the Holiday Inn DowntownSoHo last weekend  Our last experience in Manhattan was a nighte and we really were not looking forward to the hotel part of our visit  ided to try our luck on Priceline and we ended up with Holiday Inn in SoHo  First this area is a wonderful place to stay we were at the edge of LIttle Italy Greenwich Village and Chinatown  Now granted this much activity is not for everybody but we loved the convenience of the location  We saw a Broadway play went to the US Open and shopped until we dropped and only took one cab other than our airport transportation  The subway was clean and very safe  There were police everywhere and at no time did we feel in danger of any kind  That is after the evening match at the US Open didnt end until after am and we had to ride the subway to our hotel Of course you have to be st but where dont you these days  Back to the hotel   it was so quiet I thought I was someplace other than New York  The staff while very attentive was nearly invisible and the rooms were nicely appointed and very clean  The cleaning staff comes early which I like   but if you arent ready they will come back later in the afternoon  I am not kidding you   I cant say enough good things about this hotel Also   if you need a ride from the airport and dont really want to take a taxi   call my newest NY friend Geo         We found him at the airport and what a deal He is cheaper than a cab and has tons of information from a locals perspective  He is a college student and has a great personality All I can say after a weekend in NY is NY ROCKS 
N => rd time stay rd time happy Booked through the hotel website worked out slightly cheaper than hotels com I had  nights in the hotel and this was the third time that I had stayed there  All good again no major complaints apart from the fact that i requested a late check out of pm but even after asking at booking on the day I checked in and the day before I left I requested a late check out but couldnt get any later than pm  Have to say its a great place to stay  Its right beside the Q N and R subway  Compliments again to the holiday inn  
N => Very expensive for what you got On our road trip of the East Coast we stayed in many hotels including two nights at Midtown Manhatten and this was the most expensive for a   hotel   We paid  for one night and for that got the smallest room including small bathroom we had ever stayed in with a view of the outside AC units  The room however was clean and comfortable  The breakfast which was not complimentary was expensive and the service appalling it took ages just to be served  This was also the only hotel we had to pay for internet usage  Staff although friendly pushed to arrange transport to take us to the airport which we thought they would just hail a cab as other hotels had done but no they arranged a limosine with a price tag to match  It was too late to sort someting out ourselves  The location was not as nice as Midtown with lots of vendors trying hard to sell cheap bags etc  just outside the hotel entrance   Would recommend a visit to South Seaport and a walk across Brooklyn Bridge it took us about mins to walk from the hotel The hotel was close to Little Italy and we had a lovely meal where they closed a nearby street in the evening and all the Italian restaurants bring out their tables and chairs for diners  Just like being in Italy Great  Although ok wish i had looked harder for a cheaper   hotel 
N => Card Key Inconvenience My sister and I stayed at this hotel in ruary  for one night for an exam I had to take at the NYU  I chose this location due to the fact that it was close to several subway stations but more importantly just a short walk towards Canal Street is the subway station which would quickly take me to NYU the following day Also it is conveniently close to Chinatown where there are different Thai Chinese etc  restaurants to choose from  Many Chinese shops along Canal Street will also delight the designer knock off shopper  For cheap leather bags and watches Little Italy is also close by Check in went smoothly but the problem came when we went upstairs to our room  The card key did not work We had to insert it several times but to no avail  We had to report it to the front desk  Security came up to help us get in  He had to do something with the door to make the key work  He explained that the cold weather it was winter that time was making the card key malfunction  I had asked if it has happened before and he said yes  This was the first time I had ever stayed at a hotel where the card key did not work and was affected by the quotcold weatherquot Our room had one queen sized bed  It was a small room  It seemed clean overall until I noticed one of the towels in the bathroom having a small speck of hair I dont want to imagine which body part it came from but it certainly says a lot about their laundry quality I had booked this hotel from their website as a points member you can sign up for free on their website and it entitled me to a free cocktail drink from their bar however I did not use the coupon  If you would like to explore ChinatownLittle Italy this hotel is strategically located in such area  
N => Top notch service tiny rooms OK lets get one thing out of the way and dispense with it quickly  The negative things mentioned about this Holiday Inn in the other reviews here are absolutely true  Yes the hotel is located all the way down in Chinatown not SoHo so dont try to walk there like we did  The building does shake every time the subway trains pass underneath  Most of all the guestrooms are claustrophically dollhouse tiny   Throughout all my world travels Ive never seen a room this small    there is no way two people can comfortably navigate in such little space to the point where it actually becomes comicalThat said however it would be completely unfair not to mention that the outstanding service at this hotel more than makes up for all its drawbacks  We were treated like celebrities throughout our entire stay  Everyone fussed over us from the bellmen who double as valet parkers to the front desk agents to the restaurant waitstaff and housekeepers who seemed to survey our every move we definitely knew we werent in SoHo because many hotel employees were indeed Chinese  Anything we might have needed was already anticipated and attended to immediately  They made us feel very important and special and our stay was so much fun that we tipped generously all around  Ive stayed in quite a few hotels in Manhattan over the years but even in the poshest places uptown I cant remember any experience as pleasurable as this one  The valet parking was a breeze and definitely worth the extra money  The breakfast buffet was worth it  too they comped my childs meal  The hotel usually offers a very low rate through Travelzoo but the front desk suggests that you call the hotel directly and they can clue you in on other ways to save  Our rate was  which seemed more than fair for Manhattan on a holiday weekend If you can deal with the itsy bitsy guestrooms give this Holiday Inn a try for your next stay in Manhattan 
N => Broken dirty window overpriced poor breakfast Location is in Chinatown  My room was extremely noisy  Window did not close well  As I tried I got my hand dirty  Breakfast cost  for  and was horrible  Fruit was uneatable eggs were cold no doughnuts cakes or anything good  Do not go there  
N => Horrendous Response to Safety Issue I am a business woman who was staying alone in the Holiday Inn  There was an attempted break in into my room during the night  The hotels response was terrible  They did not call the police that night  Their response since has been quotthis is just weirdquot and quotno one saw anything out of the ordinary quot I did not even receive an apology from management until three weeks after my stay  
N => Dangerous inattention to safety After a attempted break in of our room management totally dropped the ball failing to call the police and follow up with us once we returned home  I would not trust them again  
N => Its okay and convenient I have stayed in this hotel for a few days during ch   The main purpose of this trip was to visit my dad who was sick  He stayed in a nursary centre somewhere close to East Broadway and therefore I ided to stay there which was close to the nursary centre  As my purose was not sightseeing my feeling might be different from others  All in all thats what I felt Its a bit small old but tidiness and cleaniness was okay  Facilities were a bit less when comparing to most hotels I stayed  I couldnt even find boileddrinkable water in the room  However when I asked for shaving cream amp blazor they provided me within a minute  Location wise I think its good as its in downtown of Manhattan  I didnt take any subway those days but I knew theres a subway station in Canal Street  I knew I could get to the South Street Sea Gate Wall Street Broadway th Avenue easily by subway or bus as Ive visited NYbefore  As its closed to China town I could enjoy my breakfast early in the morning  Theres a lot of choices if you like various Chinese foods  StarbuzzMcDonald is also nearby  The hotel is also very closed to Little Italy Overall its okay  No surprise but I think its too expensive to stay there  
N => Nice Hotel Three of us shared a  double bed room  The room was small and with suitcases on the floor not much room to walk around  But we didnt spend much time in our room anyway  After staying around Times Square for a few years I was ready to try something different  We were on the th floor  but couldnt hear street noise at all Our room faced to the side not the street  Beds were comfortable room and bathroom were clean no bugs and the staff was exceptionally nice and accomodating  The Canal St  subway station was about  min  walk from the hotel  Times Square was about  min  by express train I would definitely stay here again 
N => Central Location but terrible service This hotel is centrally located in Manhattan but I would advise avoiding it  They increased the price of our stay by   and charged it to my credit card without authorisation  The cleaners woke us every morning despite the do not disturb sign on the door  The reception staff were very unhelpful  The rooms are tiny even by New York standards  Certainly not worth  per night 
N => Central Location NYC Nice The hotel was very centrally located to Canal Street Little Italy Chinatown and Soho  It was very close to a subway terminal and felt quotsafequot at night  It usually only took about  miunutes to get uptown to Times Square  The room was small but adequate no fridge in the room   The bathroom was very nice and it was clean  No sighting of any bed bugs here on our trip  The mattresses looked brand new I checked   Overall this was a nice hotel but be a little overpriced  I guess it could be just the time of year St Patricks Day and normal for NYC   I would do some comparative shopping  
N => Holiday in the Holiday Inn Very clean comfortable hotel  Definitely in Chinatown  minutes to Little Italy Walking distance to Ground Zero Bring warm clothes as it can be freezingI was there in  Excellentcleansmallish bathroom Ive been in smaller in Paris  Good shower amp bath Staff exceptionally friendly amp helpful Very expensive   but I booked at the last minute amp it was high season mid  I felt it was worth paying extra for a room with  double beds to ensure it was a ent size  
N => Exceeded expectationsFine staff Room was small but clean  Staff was excellent Area is bustling Chinatown  very interesting  We were just steps from subway station to uptown  Little Italygreat pizza at Lombardis is just a couple of blocks away  We walked to Trade Center Brooklyn Soho Lower Eastsidehowever Katzs was a disapointment  corn beef not as tasty as our Detroit corn beef  I would go back again  
N => Definitely Chinatown Not Soho This hotel is surrounded by Chinatown has a majority of Chinese employees there seemed to be many Chinese events   birthday parties etc    when we were there   certainly not a minus but something one should be aware of  The room was average   tourism okay probably not for business trips  The bathroom was okay   definitely not luxurious  We were there for a week   the elevator was repaired twice   stopping once when we were in it   the elevator engineer was in it with us the escalator twice the hot water boiler once   the elevator engineer suggested that they werent getting things repaired well   just quickly  I must mention that the location grew on us   by the end of the week we could see more of the charm and less of the seediness  
N => We Made A Mistake The room we had was small with only one chair so someone had to sit on bed  Breakfast was the worst we have ever had away for home  All together we made a bad choise of hotel  But it is situated in interesting area  
N => Soho Not Exactly  Its a bit eptive The hotel is not in Soho but in the heart of Chinatown  Im sure they call it Soho to draw more clientele but its false advertising as well as a nuisance  For example if unsuspecting clients get off the subway in Soho theyll be in for a long hike 
N => Cant wait to go back Stayed in the hotel over thanksgiving   booked through a travel agent who quotforgotquot to send our reservation through  This was the busiest weekend of the year and the staff sorted everything out for us with no problem Staff were friendly amp helpful location was amazing I will be back in New York and I will stay in the Holiday Inn Downtown again 
N => bad attitudes AND service This was NOT my first trip to NYC being from CT originally  This experience was dreadful  Our  hired car from the airport sent from the hotel was a no show then we were refused laundry service at am on a Monday morning which was needed at pm for a Broadway show with no eager efforts to help us and AWFUL attitude and resentment from the assistant manager  I dont care how reasonably priced this hotel was I would of gladly paid more money to be treated with a little respect and dignity and believed that for even a second the staff actually wanted to provide customer service and make their guest happy  The management and front desk were simply rude and inefficient  The rooms were clean and simple but they were the only positive aspects  If you just need a place to lay your head and are not in need of ANY services   it will suit you fine   just dont spill anything on your shirt or expect a car    or for the management to smilebe kind or care in the least bit if you should need them to provide you with a service  
N => Immaculate hotel friendly service Our experiece at the Holiday Inn Soho was nothing but positive Upon checking in we found they did not have a non smoking room for us of the type we requested so the friendly desk agent gave us an upgraded room at no extra charge  The room was extra clean with comfortable beds  The room service was speedy and the food excellent  We did not eat in the restaurant  The neighborhood is true New York with everything from Starbucks to discounted jewelry and hand bags to subway stops just steps away  We were able to walk to the Wall St Ground Zero part of Manhattan in about  minutes  A pleasant walk in good weather an inexensive cab ride in bad  Everything else is accesible by subway  We will stay there again if we get the chance  
N => Friendly Staff  Comfortable Room I was worried when I read the prior reviews but I loved the Hotel  It was small but clean and well orated  The best part was the staff was so helpful  This was our first trip to New York and was concerned about finding our way around  They help us with directions the subway and even keeping our lugguge an extra day while we played   
N => Clean Comfortable   Predictable    
N => Should be called Holiday Inn  Chinatown  
N => Holiday Inn OK  
N => Great location Huge room snotty concierge and front desk We are a world traveling gay couple and rarely find homophobia  Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a young lady at the front desk  She asked us three times if it was correct that we wanted a king size bed  When we assured her that it was correct she sneered and looked like she was going to be ill  be she was to her defense  It was not a warm greeting The next day we asked the concierge what time the TKTS discount broadway ticket booth in Times Square opened and he said he had no idea and walked off  That stunned the both of us  Later on in the day a different concierge was on hand and was very helpful  The room was huge comfortable and clean  The location cant be beat  We will recommend this hotel for friends but will probably stay somewhere else on our next visit to NYC  
N => Beautiful Hotel but RUDE Front Desk Personnel get it low ks The hotel was surprisingly beautiful but the woman at the front desk was horrible  She misdirected me to my room and when I went all over the hotel trying to find it she kept insisting that he directions were accurate  It took her colleague to notify her that her directions were flawed and even with such notice she still didnt apologize but only looked down at her computer  Later I needed to call the front desk and this same person answered   she quickly interrupted my conversation with a response and hung up  Beautiful hotel but this staffer should be working in a MOTEL not a hotel  I recommend this hotel but be mindful of the rude staffers 
N => Will not go back If price is all you care about then this is the place for you  We were booked into this hotel by our company because of the price but could not wait to leave  The wifi connection was so terrible that I had to go to a local Starbucks to get any work done  The doors on the guest rooms slam so hard when they close so loudly that the walls shake  The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything around you  When you get off the elevator you are hit with the smell of old hotel  We were not impressed with anything at this hotel  The rooms were ent size and the breakfast in the restaurant was okay  We had one concierge that was great but the next one we spoke to was too busy counting money to give us the time of day  
N => A great deal  I booked this hotel because it was a Holiday Inn and was in an affordable price range for a short stay in NY  I was pleasantly surprised  The staff was very helpful amp accommodating  The hotel was clean quiet and comfortable and it was located near the places I needed to go  Its not a fancy place but was great for the price  
N => Great location and fine hotel I was a little worried after reading some of the other reviews but this hotel turned out to be perfect for us  We were walking distance to Central Park Times Square Rockefeller Center etc which made life easy for us  The hotel room was clean but a little dated  The cleaning staff were amazing The front desk and the concierge were not overly friendly but dont let it deter you from this hotel  I would stay here again 
N => Complete rip off This hotel is very basic and not in a particularly convenient part of town  Our party of  stayed for just two nights before embarking on a cruise  One night we met in the hotel bar for a drink  The barman was asked for two Scotch amp Drys  Without any comment he poured two measures of the most expensive Whisky he could find  We were charged USD each for the whisky  I think he hoped that being in a large party we  not notice but when we asked him what was the average whisky he had to admit it was USD  His tip is included in the bill so obviously the higher he got the bill the more he received in tip  No one at the hotel was able to help us as the bar is administered arately to the hotel and the regional manager would not be visiting until after our departure  Be careful about what you order in this hotel as they are there is get as much of your cash as possible  
N => dont do it location is nice but goes from bad to worse once you walk through the door  staff very surly and unhelpful  tried to charge me  more per night than confirmed in writing  room and hallway had a very strange smell  rooms very run down  so bad that i checked out immediately and went to another hotel  intercontinental chain should be ashamed  
N => MUST READ Hotel is ok but not as great as portrayed My wife and I stayed at holiday Inn Midtown for  days  She had surgery at Sloan kettering and was confined to the hotel for  days  The Pros good location for tourists ok for us  Cleaning ladies are stars of the hotel extremely helpful and kind  Hotel meal was good  Staff all apprear professional and orderly  The Cons room has damp musty smell Air condition off do to season change it was hot We had windows open all week at least the  inches they would open  Good sleep was hard to come by due to the noisy new york traffic just outside  During our stayed we saw one full grown roach run across the floor  The hotel does have a wheelchair my wife could use but customers are not allowed to take the wheelchair outside it was useless  After my wife surgery the Dr ordered us to stay in new york an extra  days However Holiday Inn was no help on extending our stay  We made resevations and move to another hotel a few blocks away  No continental breakfast  Meals were pricey and not included with rooms 
N => very good When we checked in the staff were very friendly and helpful  When we got to our room it was very big and clean and the beds were very comfortable however the bathroom was just ok it needed reorating  we didnt have any meals at the hotel and the other thing is that you have to walk quite a bit to the nearest subway station  
N => Do you like BIG cockroaches We stayed at this Holiday Inn for  nights   we got a good deal on the internet and the location seemed good   close to public transportation and a block from a PINKBERRY  Its an older hotel so it was showing its age  It was very noisy and we heard every time someone on our floor flushed a toilet  Both nights at  in the morning we were awoken by people running down the halls and screaming and yelling to each other  We would have been okay with that however the second night our dhter woke us up screaming because a  inch cockroach was crawling across her face  We cht it  When we checked out we brought it to the manager and he was not impressed  He did not even apologize and simply looked at the cockroach as if it was a normal occurrence shrugged and said quotTheres nothing I can do about itquot with a bored countenance  We will never stay there again 
N => Good stay in a handy location  We stayed at this location as the starting point for our roadtrip to Cape Cod amp Boston the hotel is a good average hotel nothing to really shout about but a great base to explore the city from no major issues our room was clean amp well maintained plenty of room for our family of two adults amp two children the rest of the hotel was also clean amp seemed well maintained the only stumbling point was the elevators only  elevators in a large hotel full of tourists adds up to a wait I know this but all the same bit of a pain at times The rooftop pool was great amp had a small bar serving drinks amp simple snackshot dogsice cream e t c a nice touch when the weather is hot As I have already said one of the good points is the location we easily walked to several places with no problem including Central Park amp Times Square from the hotelCheck inout easy amp quick  maid service very good  all in all a great place to stay when visiting NYC  
N => Not very good The room was clean but the bathroom     IUt needed major reation the toilet bowl was disgusting  The lobby also needs major reation This hotel is convenient only because of its location  It is not worth more than   the night    
N => Good Clean hotel We stayed at this hotel back in ust     I have to say the rooms were very clean   It is not a  star hotel but the location is pretty central to many attractions  The staff were very courteous although the lady at the desk when we first arrived was a bit standoffish but perhaps we were all tired from a very long trip and we were a bit hypersensitive The cleanliness of the room made up for it though      On one instance I left a little note for the cleaners to clean the glue off from around the toilets and to my great surprise they did  The corridors and elevator leading to the rooms were not so terrific but I would give this hotel a  star for overall cleanliness and location  
N => Not a nighte   just a bad dream We chose this hotel strictly for its location and price point so we didnt expect much since we just wanted somewhere safe and clean to sleep in that was in a good central location  The hotel delivered   but BARELY  Stayed from ust  to t   First the goodAs mentioned the location and price were definitely acceptable  Very safe and close to the subway and points of interest like Central Park  Housekeeping was very friendly and always greeted us with a smile  The room was spacious we were in tower B  We didnt have time to use the gym but it is very well equipped privately owned but free for guests  Head east to the end of the block and youll find a fantastic diner called Morning Star Restaurant  Family owned so the service was quotNew Yorkquot charming and I mean that in a very good way  Not much to see from the outside   not much from the inside but the food was perfect and the service very very friendly  I regret not remembering the two waiters names but they are really good guys  So friendly and helpful feel free to ask them for any advice directions or suggestions on what to do  This price was also very reasonable unlike many other flashy diners The bed was very comfortable and the ac worked well although despite being a little bit noisy Now the badFor us customer service is very VERY important  The parking guys were okay but I was not impressed with them leaning on our car as we unloaded our bags ourselves bell hops were no where to be seen  I guess they really didnt care since they dont work for the hotel but for a contracted parking company called Apex  On a brighter note the cost of valet parking was reasonable day and we did get our car back quickly without any noticable scratches  We interacted with  different front desk people on  different occasions and each clerk we spoke to never offered a smile or anything that resembled warmth    in fact one of them actually stopped smiling as I approached them  They did their jobs but honestly how hard is it to be just a little friendly HELLO You are in the HOSPITALITY business A small fridge will cost you day  I discovered this when I called to request one but ided to think about it  The next day I ided to invest in the convenience of a fridge since the ice machine was not on my floor the one above was broken but the one on the floor below was barely working  This time they inform me it would cost me day  I attempted to clarify why it was  yesterday and today it was    they respond quotwe are sending one up nowquot  quotWell how much will it costquot I reply to which they respond quotcomplimentaryquot  I still dont know what exactly happened there but this is one of those times when  wrongs actually do make a right   The wifi at this hotel is very VERY slow and inconsistent  There isnt a wired option and sometimes it would give you a message that too many users are connectedThe bathroom    NO counter space and an interesting stench   a body order  urinal like bouquet greeted the nose upon entering the room  The entire hotel also had a unique aroma   old cigarette smoke complimented with cheap air freshener with a delicate touch of must  The or was also very depressing and in serious need of reations Sumyide for yourself if this is the hotel you would like to stay in  As for us in the future we will invest a little bit more money for the niceties that this hotel apparently cannot deliver  
N => Run by idiots Disgusting hole When we arrived at the hotel we were asked for out credit card as security and told we would not be charged for the room until the end of our stay which we were happy to do  Later that evening when I went to purchase something on my credit card I was astonished to find that the Holiday Inn had cleaned out my credit card I demanded that the funds be credited back to my card immediately and the staff were rude and dismissive and simply refused  I had to have family transfer money from overseas because the hotel had cleaned me out When we arrived to our room we were over come by the smell of cigarette smoke  When I informed the front desk that we did not book a smoking room they were again dismissive  We were placed on the th floor and most of the time the lifts were not working  It was on average a half hour wait for a lift and the fire escape was locked so that wasnt even an option  It was so bad that we needed to factor in quotlift timequot to our daily plan  The room had minimal lighting and amongst the smell of stale cigarette smoke you felt like you were living in a cave  None of the power points worked and neither did the T V  The overall appearance of the hotel is depressing and run down  The staff are all suffering from chronic depression and the concierge just shrugged her shoulders when asked to recommend some activities  I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone  This hotel ruined my holiday  Its dodgy and disgusting  
N => Non smokers beware First time in NY and looking for a bargin  night  day break  This hotel fits the bill  Friendly helpful staff roof top pool although we were too busy sight seeing to see it good location spacious rooms which I believe are a premium in the Big Apple If you book with EBOOKERS who were great and efficient remember to read the small print because even if you book a non smoking room with them they can only request it to the hotel YOU MUST RING THE HOTEL DIRECT TO REQUEST ITth floor stinks of stale cigarettesOnce in your room its not quite so bad We couldnt change rooms as they were full and had to request new pillows as they also smelt  Didnt ruin our fantastic trip but just wanted to pass on the tip Also dont bother with the transit bus from JFK to Manhattan  We had to wait  mins for a crowded stuffy mini bus Take a cab it must be worth the extra few dollars Fantastic trip  Good hotel Already saving to return  
N => Acceptable stay again We stayed here again for one night to attend the NY International Gift Show  The check in staff were friendly and efficient  Our room  North Tower was large and clean  The furnishings were a little worn but acceptable  The air conditioner worked better this time  We had to ask the front desk to turn off the message light on the phone  I couldnt get it off  I also asked them to repair the deadbolt while we went to dinner but this repair wasnt accomplished during our stay  The concierge wasnt very helpful in finding a restaurant  we were told just to walk down th Ave  But overall the hotel is a great find  both for value and location  
N => Would definitely stay again After reading the other reviews about the hotel I was a little skeptical about what I was getting myself into  But upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised about how great the hotel actually was The lobby is open concept and very clean amp friendly our room was ready early no waiting we requested a refrigerator and it was installed not  mins from arriving  Our hotel room was very clean and we received great service every day    fresh towels beds made etc  The hotel felt very secure as anyone who comes in after midnight has to show their room key and check out was a breeze  We requested a later check out which wasnt a problem  And after once we were all packed up we left our luggage in the bag check which felt completely safe and it was FREE  All the staff were VERY nice which made our trip run smoothly and more enjoyable  
N => Long but Wonderful Stay It was with some trepidation that I made reserations here  Some reviews glowed and some glowered  I am happy to report that my stay was delightful and I have some answers for the naysayers Room too hot in summer Check to make sure your windows are closed  I noticed right away that a small side wondow was open  I prompltly closed it  this also lead to my discovery of the room darkening shade  Previous experieence has tht me that they can block out rays that can keep the room hot  Mine stayed shut for my entire six day stay However I noticed several open windows across the way in the south tower  Perhaps someone from the staff should go close those to keep the air in This is not to say that the room temp is solely up to the guest  Holiday Inn management needs to look at shortening the floor length drapes to sill length  This will allow the drapes to close completely without blocking the AC  The drapes were flocked with an insulating maerial so the heat should be reflected outside keeping the cool air in Antoher issue I fretted about was smoke scented rooms  I brought along a bottle of reze  I thankfully did not have to use it  Yet I have no doubt managment would have graciously honored my request to move if it had been necessary  And about the staff   they are efficient but they are not your best friend  When I needed help it was there  Do not expect these people to be joyous on every occassion  They have a difficult job  Requests made with kindness will be met with the same  
N => good value not the best but definatley not the worst I stayed here ember  with my  sister and mum for  nights for a christmas shopping trip  We all thought this hotel was quite nice but nothing out of the ordinary which might sound like we werent impressed but in terms of value for money it was really good  The rooms were a ent size and were clean but they could do with a bit of updating  The only downside was that I thought that they were a lttle out of the way as on a map it doesnt look too much out of the way but in reality when wed had a full days shopping and walking about the last thing we wanted was to walk back to the hotel  After a few days we used taxis which was great  To be honest if was to go again Id go back to the Wingate Inn by Wydnham which we have been to as to location was spot on but if that was fully booked id certainly consider this one again  
N => Dirty Hotel with Horrible Service This hotel was chosen for a function we were attending  Prior to arrival we attempted to change our reservations unable to deal with a competent person   so assumed we could do it onsite  WRONG  The customer service was horrible  Entering our room   it was dirty dust grime and a used cup requested a room change to be told quotnoquot     demanded a re clean   which they claim they did but not to my standards  We thought about going to a new hotel but there is no refunds given period  Also on our first night there were not wash cloths  We called the front desk and housekeeping for them to act like theyve never heard of such items  We could go on and on     but the bottom line is   we will never stay here again nor would we recommend it to anyone  
N => NOT THE WORST BUT NOT GOOD EITHER Very tired drab shabby hotel smells badly of cigarette smoke good location but thats theonly plus that I can think of 
N => Not as good second time around We have stayed here before and thought we would on our recent visit to NYC  However the hotel seemd to have gone down hill a little bit  Not in an obvious way but more subtely  The room was not vacuumed once while were there  days and neither were the sheets changed  Service was given if asked for but only if you tipped the staff  It just seemed to care a little less about the customer and more about how much money it could make than the last time we visited  We will not be staying for a thrid time at this hotel 
N => OK but if you need a taxi hail one outside dont ask the bell staff Hotel was ok the room was very spacious but the bathroom was small and there was nowhere to put anything also the shower was a bit rubbish  This was my second trip to NY but the travel agent mucked up the original hotel and this was a last minute booking  Got great seats for broadway show via concierge  Breakfast excellent as we were on a bb basis   lovely coffee and waiting staff  Only real negative was that the bell staff tried to rip us off re taxi to JFK  They said it would be  but the yellow cabs clearly state   tolls and therefore we hailed one outside  The shuttle costs  per person to JFK and you spend half the day going round picking up people from other hotels so if you are not travelling by yourself I suggest springing the bit extra for the cab  
N => Good enough This is not a hotel with a huge wow factor   but it is really ok  We had a room on a higher floor and there was not much noice from the street  Nice neighbourhood and about a ten minute walk to Time Square  Room was ok no lyxury but clean and comfortable  
N => Good location  Bed only nd stay  Hotel is well located but dont expecte too much  room was musty but you re not in NYC for the hotel rooms 
N => Great location and value We initially booked on internet for  nights but extended to    Only gripe was when we arrived we had booked non smoking but they only had smoking rooms left  We moved into non smoking the next day and sought compensation  We received vouchers for   cooked breakfasts  Tariff on we  weekday  both include taxes  Rooms are large with dated but functional fittings The beds were comfortable  Full size ironing board and free wireless internet but no fridge 
N => The Pitts try to find somewhere else This hotel is like a drive in motel  Needs a refurb   
N => Lousy service check other options HelloWe booked this hotel since we were able to use airline loyalty points  I wish that we would have made other ision We are family with  years old boy  I have booked hotel room with  double beds and also had a voucher stating it  When we arrived to the hotel we were informed that there is only a room with king size bed available  Since our teenager is over  cm tall I could not accept that he sleeps in roll over bed  Receptionist was very unpolite never have met anything like her We discussed with manager on duty and she insisted that roll over beds are brand new and comfortable  She promised that we could change the room next day if we like  They never delivered roll over bed to our room  I had to go to reception again since after long flight we wanted to go to sleep  When quotbrand newquot roll over bed came it was horrible  Dirty lousy mattress and too short to sleep properly  The result our teenager did not sleep and had problems with his back Next morning I had to go reception twice in order to get the room changed to one that was promised to us  We did not get any help with the luggages but need to carry everything by ourselves  Other challenges If you live in lower floors you need to wait a long time    minutes to get an elevator to go down  There are only three elevators and people staying in rooms above th floor fill those in  Breakfast is lousy  Go to deli on left side of the hotel just in the corner  They have excellent pancakes sandwiches and good coffee  There are small tables so you can eat in Due to recession there are more hotel rooms available in Manhattan  Go and check other options than Holiday Inn Midtown th street  
N => Great Location As  girls celebrating their quotTHSquotided to have a shopping trip to NY without husbands and kids Weve just returned after a  night stay at Holiday Inn Midtown  After reading some previous reviews we were unsure what standard of hotel to expect  We were pleasantly surprised       yes the or in some fo the corridors could be updated     but for the price it was clean staff were friendly and very helpful and the maids daily service very thorough  We were lucky to be on the th floor      a room with a view if you can get it The room was a super size Plenty of room to leave your daily purchases with  double beds which we both commented on being the most comfortable beds we had come across in a hotel The location was great  As it was our first time in New York we were delighted to find so many places of interest in walking distance  Close to Times Square Central Park theatre district and many good restaurants        We made use of the hop on hop off city tour buses which you can catch several streets away Would definately recommend this hotel if like us you are there to shop shop shop and take in all the sights  We both hope to return to Holiday Inn Midtown for our ths and possibly bring our hubbies 
N => A great location  This hotel is a great value  The room was a good size neat amp clean  Its in walking distance of Jazz Lincoln Center where we went that night  We had breakfast at the Gotham Cafe which we recommend   good service food amp price  
N => Very Convenient The Holiday Inn is a suitable family hotel  We arrived late at night and check inn efficient  Staff were very friendly with exception of breakfast room manager who could do with a lesson in people skills  His staff were fun in the mornings though  Rooms were more than adequate  We were able to walk to most venues including Broadway shows Those further away were accessible via the hop onhop off bus which also was within walking distance  We were told to get breakfast at nearby cafes but the hotel breakfast was not much dearer and much more convenient  Was of good quality and many choices  We dined in restaurants en route to night venues  Never felt unsafe walking  Rooms were cleanbeds comfortablebathroom well presented and fresh  
N => great location We stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown from th   th    Room was clean but beds small and uncomfortable  The other guests were noisy coming in late at night slamming doors talking loud  not the hotels fault just ignorant guests  We walked to Time Square most days took a  day quotHop on Hop Offquot tour bought tickets for the Statue of Liberty at the hotel but they neglected to tell us that our ticket didnt include entry into the Statue and that we had to book those tickets  days in advance  Hence we missed going inside  We found New York people to be generally unhelpful uncaring unless a tip was at stake and pushy  The restaurant amp room service at the hotel add on an automatic tip of   to all bills taking away our right to choose how much we think the service deserves  There are plenty of cheap take out places and corner kets to buy food amp supplies  We would recommend any other time to visit NY other than winter  As much as the city is beautiful with the Christmas lights the cold the crowds and the general attitude of the locals was hard to deal with  The traffic is a nighte and walking is the best option We had a fantastic day trip to Niagara Falls however the flights home were  and a half hours delayed due to the traffic at JFK  Then the shuttle back to the hotel took another  hours  Shopping in Canal St was interesting and a great place for bargains  We went to the Rockettes Christmas show which was an absolute hightlight of our stay along with the World Trade Centre tribute and site tour and the Intrepid Air Sea amp Space Museum 
N => Highly Recommend the Holiday Inn Midtown We travel a fairly good bit  Have stayed in everything from Westins to Mom and Pop Hotels in the middle of nowhere  So we ahve a wide range of experience  We were looking for four things in a hotel    Cleanliness  The hotel was very clean we did not experience any bugs dirty rooms or any problems  My wife is pretty picky on cleanliness and she was very content    Space for a family of four  We stayed for five nights  We need  double beds for two teenagers as well  The rooms for what we saw in New York other hotels were large    We wanted a good location  We were two blocks from the subway  A fifteen minute walk from Time Square and Rockefeller Center  We were two blocks from Central Park  The location was quotout ofquot the crazyness of Time Square but close enough to be there with hardly no effort of walking ten to fifteen minutes  The subway station at Columbus Circle got us anywhere we didnt want to walk   Price  For what we paid avg   a night you could not ask for more  The staff was tremendously helpful  Got us discounts to the events we wanted to go to  Gave great information  Got us a car back to the airport cheaper than a cab  Could not ask for anything more  
N => Basis with staff who need some customer service training Firstly I do have to say our trip overall was a bargain so taking into account price this hotel was value for money however it was not without some problems  On checking in we were given our room key on the th floor  The room itself was opposite the lift and on entering smelled damp but worse than that were the suitcases and belongings in the room  Our room was already occupied Luckily we are honest people and returned straight to reception rather than have a nose through other peoples belongings However the receptionist could not understand our disbelief at their error  She kept saying quotIts not my faultquot and was quite indignant rather than apologetic  I said that I hoped she would not hand out our keys to new arrivals to which she again replied quotits not my faultquot although after checking her computer finally said quotaah it was my faultquot although it was still not accompanied by any apology for the mix up When we finally got into an unoccupied room it was basic and seemed clean  Luckily we had brought earplugs as whilst on the th floor was still noisy and located near the lift  Sound proofing is not a strong point of the hotel  The room itself was chilly and we discovered our heating was not working however the hotel sent an engineer immediately to fix and once on the heat meant we were no longer freezing Our one and only experience of the hotel bar was using the free vouchers given to us by reception as an apology for the room mix up on check in however the surly girl behind the bar did not exactly make us want to stay and have a second drink or leave any tip as she was really quite rude  This was confirmed when a second customer arrived and queried something with her about a previous drink to which she responded that it was clearly shown on his bill  He then replied it would have been fine had she actually presented him with a bill  All in all it was a soul less bar area chilly and unfriendly Finally when we checked out which was early AM my friend screamed as a cockroach ran around the sink area  We assume it had been running over our toothbrushes on previous occasions which was a thought we would rather not dwell on  I reported it to the lovely not receptionist on checking out only to be informed quotmadame this is New York all big cities have cockroachesquot  Hhmmm yes I appreciate that but where was the customer service during this whole stay  Had I paid some of the rates quoted on this site for this hotel I would have felt very hard done by as it was we paid minimal rates as we booked a package so probably about   pppn  My advice would be if you are paying any more than this research other hotels even smaller boutique hotels where they actually care about the customer and wish them to return Yes the location was reasonable however cabs are so cheap you can get where you want at minimal cost  Personally when I return in ch I would not stay here at any cost Even the concierge told us to avoid the hotel for drinkscocktails 
N => Extremely Friendly Hotel Just back from a very enjoyable stay at the Holiday Day Inn West th St Midtown Found our room to be very large and extremley clean  Was very warm had to turn heating down but this was not a bad thing as it was very cold outside  Room was cleaned every day to a very high standard clean white fluffy towels clean sheets and everything that we had used replenished  The staff on reception and on the doors couldnt do enough to make our stay very enjoyabe  Great location for getting about could always get a taxi as soon as you stepped outside and was also within walking distance to most places of interest Would like to visit New York again same time next year and will definatly book this hotel again Well done Holiday Inn keep up the good work  
N => Great place to stay Will come again  This was a great hotel to stay in  We were going to Fox News to see Hannity and Colmes for my sons th birthday  I was told to stay closer to Times Square but the prices were out of my range  Finding the Holiday Inn was such a blessing It was clean comfortable and  blocks from the ACE subway at Columbus Circle  It was centrally located and the room was a good size  The staff was well informed and friendly  We had a great time and it was safe enough to walk home from the studio  I will absolutely stay here again  Great deal as well  The price was well below what you will spend in TImes Square and it is still very convenient to all areas of NYC  
N => Excellent Location As i was taking the trip to NY with my  year old dhter i was a bit worried about the negitive reviews although the Hotel requires a complete revamp everything was clean and the hotel staff very helpful room was large  bathroom small  strange with wash hand basin outside bathroom sited in room AC did not work  downside was all rooms when their toilets flushed the noise was unbelivable also no easy door closures so you heard a constant slamming of doors through the night  Did not use Resturant used Deli on corner good value for moneyLocation ExcellentStaff ExcellentRoom Clean Need revampBathroom Small Shower GoodFlush amp Doors NoisyAC Not working KELLY amp EMMA CARDIFF S WALES 
N => unhappy with room i stayed at this hotel three years ago and seemed pleased with stayso iided to take a vacation with my dhter and husband this  and stay at holiday inn again  i asked for two double beds which turned out to be the size of full beds difficult for two people to share  also the bathe room was so smallgetting out of the tub to be carefull not to step into toilet on top of that they only had heater connected so when we arrived temp was in low sixty  room was hot and could ony open a slight few inches for air the hotel gave us a desk top fan  very disapointed with hotel stay  and besides the rate of hotel was almost four hundred dollars a night  not good  
N => Not bad We were skeptical when we booked because the rate was so reasonable for NYC    a night  We booked anyway thinking we were going to be out and about and would only sleep here  We were pleasantly surprised  The hotel was very busy and the staff we encountered were obviously overworked but extremely helpful and eager to meet our needs  Our room was clean the bed comfortable and we slept great  We received recommendations for dinner bars subway travel etc  Our waiter even remembered us from breakfast and welcomed us back the next day  The only complaint we found were the female bartenders  They acted put out when they had to wait on us and one bartender even told us after two beers I have no more of that kind so you will have to pay up or try something else no offer to get more or offer another suggestion  Both women bartenders on two different occasions were more interested in checking their email and talking on the cell phone than dealing with customers  The male bartender on the other hand was restocking the bar greeted us upon our entrance and came out from around the bar when we were sitting to ask us if we needed a refill or snack  This hotel overall really was a gem find for us and we would stay here again  it is close to central park and Lincoln center and a short walk to times square  Far from Macys and ground zero but easy subway access  
N => Not to bad for a short stay Stayed here ober  and was not surprised as withall holiday inns they have a certain standard which isunchanged in most places though out the world Basic but clean The room was nice the bathroom big and all the generalstuff you like to have like and iron hair drier tea and coffeefacilities The main draw back we had was that we where placedin a room beside the elevators which where rumblingup and down the shaft all night  how we know it wasthe elevator was when it hit a floor you would geta noise like a microwave when the doors opened other than that this place is perfectly dine for a short stay would not recommend for  or  days  
N => Value for Money Ideal choice if looking for a value for money hotel near to Central New York   Times Square    mins walk or a couple of subway stops   Colombus Circle subway only  block away from hotel Rooms spacious and comfortable   not luxurious but value for money  We were given a non smoking room but smelt of smoke but once we asked to move they dorted out very quickly Swimming pool very nice after along hot day walking around Staff very helpful we had a pleasant stay and cant really fault anything  Would recommend if on a budget and not after luxury  
N => lovely hotel good value for money booked hotel then saw bad reviews on trip advisorso was a bit worried  hotel was basic but very cleanvery well situated about ten minutes walk from times square but away from the noise so you are able to sleep had most of our meals in hotel and found them really good and not to expensive and a bar in hotel for those who like a quiet drink after a days sightseeing staff were very helpfulland a waitress i the restaraunt gave my dhter tips on where to shop overall loved hotel  
N => Nice great location but tatty Old review but time fliesVery friendly lady in reception made me feel very welcome straight away which was good after the delays at Gatwick and a roller coaster taxi ride from JFK a unforgettable NY experience in itself I remember reading that the last reoration was  years ago and it showed  Not awful but was definately a very lived in look  Needed stripping and redoing  The lifts were good but the corridors outside were more tatty and often smelt of cigarrette smoke  The way room service trays were dumped outside the service room near the lifts wasnt that great partially because that was next to my room  Wasnt that it was there it was that it stayed there for ages But the bed was very comfy free wireless internet view wasnt amazing as I was in the south tower but I was out most of the time so that made no difference  Youre not going to get an amazing view here but you dont expect oneGood location  minutes walk from Times Square going south and very close to Central park and Columbus Circle metro going north  Lots of restaurants diners and bodegas nearby that will keep you fed even if you only go round the corner from the hotel great doughnuts This hotel was good for what I needed it for which was a base somewhere to collapse at the end of the day and somewhere to drop my goodies off in the day  
N => not good We spent five nights in the Holiday Inn and we were not impressed apart from its location which is in walking distanceto most things it has nothing else going for itthe whole building needs a good deep clean and update in our room someone had drawn over the walls in red crayon  our bedding had cigarette burn holes in it and the bathroom was horrid with the artex falling off the ceiling when we had a shower If you can stay some where else   
N => Good Value for the Money Well located   very reasonably priced hotel in Manhattan  We stayed four days  Room is a good size for the city very clean with very comfortable beds  No safe in the room however  so plan accordingly  We are two women who travel to NYC on business a few times a year  We would not hesitate to return to this hotel  Not luxurious but clean comortable and in a fine part of town  
N => Bad Breakfast and dirty glasses This Holiday Inn did not have the classy touches to which we are accustomed in other Holiday Inns  For example the Holiday Inn in Charleston S C  had free fresh fruit and bottled water at the front desk  The breakfast smorgasboard was impeccable and could suit ANY tastes  The breakfast at NY th was limited and truly not delectable or attractive  The glasses were dirty  Internet was provided free with access code at the Charleston Holiday Inn  When I asked about this at the front desk I was told that there are different owners of Holiday Inns across the world  So well there you have it  But we wont be staying at Holiday Inn th again  Oh yes the bathrooms need to be cleaner  
N => Great location   Good Value for the Money Would definitely recommend this hotel  Room was very large   bathroom was a bit tight and slightly dated  Staff was very attentive   Location was superb   close to the action but on a quiet street     blocks from the park  Rooftop pool was much nicer than expected   big pool and lots of lounge chairs  Had dinner   the Eatery which was close by     VERY good   reasonable prices and hip atmosphere  Be sure to consider this hotel when visiting NYC  
N => Good Value for New York New York   Holiday Inn th Street We had booked a  night stay in the hotel for  people sharing a  double bedroom  I had selected the hotel having read some comments from reveiws on Trip Advisor  There were some positive reports in there along with some negative comments  If you are booked to stay here   do not worry you have not made a bad choice  Upon arrival the reception staff were business like but not over helpful or friendly    Although if you ask clearly for a particular facility or request we found it was always met The corridors and rooms were generally tired looking and in need of refurbishment  The rooms were clean and of a good size  The bathroom was clean and the shower worked effectively with plenty of hot water always available  We had  double beds in the room and the air conditioning system worked effectively throughout our stay  I had requested prior to our arrival a non smoking room facing the rear of the hotel on the th floor or above  I was told that our request could not be gauranteed but we got exactly what had been requested  We had no disturbance from the noise during our stay  The longer we were there the more we appriciated our choice of hotel which we basically used as a place to sleep and nothing more  There was no safe in the room but a safe deposit box was provided free of charge at the reception  The staff also arranged our transport back to the airport at the end of our stay and this worked pefectly  We requested a late departure on our final day leaving the room at  pm  We paid an extra   tax and this also worked out perfectly We did not eat in the hotel but did use the bar and the swimming pool on the roof  The pool was a real bonus but this closes at  pm each day  I would stay here again as we found the staff to be helpful when any request was made  There are also a number of very good restaurants and breakfast diners on th Avenue  The subway is only a  minute walk away and we covered the whole of New York by using the day sub way pass at    this must be one of the bargins of the year  The MoonRock Cafe and Route  provide good breakfasts and restaurants of particular mention are Thai Basil  Nothing to do with Faulty Towers Puccini Kashkaval and Sombrero Enjoy your stay  
N => Not a Great Stay We stayed here for our annual girls night out in the city  The room was adequate although during the night we discovered we had a broken latch on our window and it wouldnt stay shut  The next morning we got stuck in an elevator  It was over  minutes before hotel personnel responded to our ringing of the alarm bell  There was no telephone in the elevator  We were stuck over  minutes in  degree plus weather and hotel management was not at all solicitous towards us when we finally got out  Would only recommend this hotel if youre looking to save money and dont care about being treated well  
N => slooooww internet Stayed here for  nights on a business trip  I only came to my room to sleep  Unfortunately I still had to get some work done from my room so I used the free internet and I have to say it was slooow  I think they regulate internet access since it is a ent sized hotel The room was adequate Checking in was quick  I forgot to check out but called them from my office and checked out  No issues with that  Location is not a great advantage anywhere in Manhattan since you are just a stones throw away from some sort of action  But yes if you fancy a walk in Central park after a long day it is not too far All in all an average hotel  I would not mind staying here again  For the price definitely got my moneys worth except for the low speed internet  
N => Its New York I was apprehensive about booking rooms at this location after reading the reviews on this website  However after hours of researching hotels I ided to take my chances  Yes its a Holiday Inn that you would normally pay  a night for elsewhere  But this is New York City try and find another room this large and with this rate at the time that you want it  I arrived to find that the staff was very helpful  The restaurant staff was very personable also  Yes gratuity was added in    but most places in NY are this way  What is the old saying    quotWhen in Rome    quot  I will say that in Tower B that air conditioning is something to be desired  I tried to keep the drapes pulled so that the afternoon heat did not heat the room anymore than needed but as we were not in the room much we learned to cope with it  Other than than the air and be an update to the bathroom this hotel was okay  Not the best Ive stayed at  but again its New York City 
N => Just as good on my second visit I stayed at this Holiday Inn in ch  and again in il   On both occasions I couldnt have been happier  When I booked this latest time I requested a non smoking room and also mentioned the room number I had been in on my previous visit  I asked if I could have a room in a similar position as I had loved the view over the downtown area  I was delighted when I checked in to find the staff had actually given me the exact same room  The room was   once again   clean comfortable and quiet  The breakfast in the downstairs restaurant was good too  I will certainly return to this hotel if I am lucky enough to visit New York again  
N => Holiday Inn Midtown Being a Priority Club member I have stayed in a lot of Holiday Inns across the country  When we ided to visit New York I checked out the prices and discovered the Holiday Inn Midtown to be reasonably priced compared to other hotels within walking distance of Times Square  The location was good  two blocks from the subway and  minutes walk from Times Square  But the hotel itself was a disappointment  Lots of painting was going on during our stay so our first impression wasnt the best  The room was a good size but even at the coldest setting the air conditioning was less than satisfactory  There were cobwebs in the corners of the ceiling and the coffee maker looked like it hadnt been dusted in quite a while  The paint in the tiny bathroom was peeling but other than that the place was clean  We stayed four nights and asked that the bedding be changed after the second night  One of the new sheets was torn  The desk personnel were friendly but the concierge was abrupt and always in a hurry  The internet service in the hotel did not work the entire length of our stay  When we went to the cafe to use our free continental breakfast coupons we waited minutes without any acknowledgement from the waiter so we left  I guess you get what you pay for but this was the worst experience Ive had with a Holiday Inn and paid the highest room rate ever  I dont think Ill be returning to this hotel  
N => Dont go there First impressions when we entered the hotel lobby was only okay then approached the front desk only to be greeted by the rudest people i have ever met From leaving the elevator to our room the smell off the carpet old green carpet and dirty walls we were not impressed at all then went into the room to be greeted by a dirty bedspread white net curtains that were supposed to be white but a filty dirty yellow colour  Honeslty if anyone is thinking of staying in this hotel DONT for the the money we paid for it i think it was altogether   for four nights which was ridiculous and you do not get a breakfast in the morning  I wouldnt mind spending the money if you are getting good value for it but here you are not  One things for sure if it was a hotel in Ireland or Uk it would be closed down  we are a young couple and very easy going but this took the biscuit i know you probably say to yourself sure all we want is a bed but when there is a smell off your pillow as you go to bed at night you begin to wonder has the rooms ever been properly cleaned 
N => No rave review here My husband and I stayed here on the last three days of our honeymoon and I have to say our first impressions of the hotel were not great  Upon arrival we checked into our room only to be given a smoking room  We requested a non smoking room to be told there were none available at all but if we were to come back by am the next morning we could be swapped the next day  When we got to our room it had two double beds which were tiny and basically resulted in my husband and I sleeping in arate beds for the remainder of our honeymoon  The stench of cigarette smoke was by far the worst Ive ever smelt in my life and it reminded me of some seedy dark bar  It caused my husbands asthma to flare up as well  When we arrived at our room the television was on and would not turn off at all  When we called front desk for assistance it seemed like we were causing them much inconvenience and the handyman also seemed a bit peeved to be called out  The next morning at  am we went to the front desk to follow up on our request for a non smoking room only to be met by a very unpleasant staff member behind the desk  She told us that we could not be assigned another room because we already had one and there was nothing actually broken or wrong with the room to warrant a change  I understand if the hotel is fully booked however she was quite rude in the manner of dealing with our request which annoyed me the most  Cleanliness was not great   we left our room at  am one morning and I noticed some breakfast dishes in the hallway outside one of the rooms   no big deal except that the exact same dishes and leftover food were still sitting there when we returned at pm that dayUnfortunately those few small things managed to really sour my view of this hotel  The rooms were generally adequate and other staff were quite helpful  The location was fabulous easy to walk to lots of food shops broadway and times square  My advice to other travellers would be that if you want a queen size bed and non smoking room be absolutely clear WHEN YOU BOOK that you must have those and that you will not compromise 
N => Adequate accomm  This hotel is perfectly adequate if you are travelling to New York and dont want to blow most of you budget on your accommodation  We were a group of  girls on a shopping trip for  days  We had a room with two double beds  The room was pretty big   well able to hold all our stuff plus all our shopping  Having the washbasin outside the bathroom was a bit strange but we got over it  The hotel is in a good location with a bus just around the corner which goes downtown  its only a   min walk fron Central Park  Overall Id stay here again if just using as a base for shopping  touring and not looking for luxury  
N => As good as you need Stayed for  nights amp found the hotel fine  The room was so much bigger than we expected unsure at first that the basin was outside the bathroom but it worked really well in the end as my partner could shave in peace while i hogged the bathroom  The bedwas really comfy  One night we used the bar amp found it very quiet amp didnt bother again Location was fab approx about  mins walk to Times Square Unfortunately on the last day my partner left his wallet in a cab but the staff were amazing amp couldnt have been more helpful   in the end the manager asked his friend to run us to the airport as we were really pushed for time for our flight home we waited as long as possible trying to locate the cab  During our journey to the airport the manager rang his friend amp he retuened us quickly to the hotel as the wallet had been handed in complete with everything untouched Would recommend this hotel the time you spend in the hotel is so limited it suited us fine  Although it could do with a make over 
N => great location I took my dhters ages  and  to New York for a motherdhter weekend  We had Holiday Inn points so we stayed at the one on th St  I thought the hotel was perfect for what we wanted to use it for    a place to sleep  We spent very little time in the hotel  We arrived at noon and were able to check right in and go to our room    we didnt have to wait until  for check in as is custoy with most hotels  We didnt get back to our room until after  both nights  The room was pleasant and we thought the beds and pillows were comfortable  Although that could have been because we were dead tired every night  Because of the location we walked everywhere we went  I had read reviews about the staff being rude but I did not have that experience  Everyone we encountered on our trip was friendly and helpful  Some reviews also complained about dirty or smelly rooms  Again that was not our experience  We are not pretentious about where we sleep as long as its clean quiet and cool  That is exactly what we got here  Our room was on the th floor of tower B  Only once did I hear a door shut   other than that it was extremely quiet  It was rather warm in the room the first afternoon but the next day we closed the curtains to prevent the hot sun from coming in and it was nice and cool when we returned in the late afternoon  I would recommend this hotel to a family or young people who want to spend most of their time out enjoying the city  Its not fancy but its a good value and excellent location for anyone who wants a quiet comfortable clean place to lay their heads  
N => here at last After travelling from Washington then Baltimore on to the Niagara Falls we were glad to arrive at our destination The hotel was fine and centralclean roomthe only fault we found was the lobby staff were a bit abrupt This was our second visit to the city if we ever returned we would find different accommodation  
N => ent stay but better options Dont know what was paid for the hotel so I really cannot comment on the value  Basically this is a no frills HI that would be less than night anywhere than NYC  Ok but youd get a much better deal via any travel site or do better paying a little more for nicer digs  Good ent but small lobby rooms were actually large by NYC standards had interior courtyard room away from city noise which was good since we were on a low floorOther rooms were spread in other towers odd configuration average basic furnishing and linens mixed cleaningBad small double beds when two queens could have easily fit very noisy with hallneighbors dated dirty small bathroom 
N => Good price no real complaints and smoking rooms Just got back stayed from  for  nights  two  couples first visit to N Y Booked via Hotel web site  by pre paying we got two  double beds rooms for   pn each  Rooms were very spacious and clean we were on the nd and rd floor and heard little noise except on one night when there was a do on and it was loud but a quick call downstairs and reception assured us it would finish at midnight which it did Drinks in bar expensive  for a small glassof wine   for a bottle  go round the corner and you could get  litres for  and you can buy a corkscrew from the local liquor store open until midnight  Breakfast was good   for Juice teacoffee bowl of fruit to share eggsbacon fried potatoes and toast for four including taxes  No problem getting about walking to Times Sq enabled us to come across districts we might have missed  th St th Av Jazz club plus  course meal   We also got the  hour Grayline pass which included a free night time tour  Staff Fella on the Tours and info desk was really friendly and helpful  Plenty of bell boys  yes they still call them this but no offers to show us our room or carry our bags  and we had a tip ready  Bags were stored for no charge on last day  even though the notice said there was a charge of  per bagWhen we went to pick up the bags we were asked if we would like them to order a taxi to JFK For   we pointed out that the flat rate was  but the odious fella said we would have to pay tolls and tips and  have to wait a while if we tried to get one ourselves  this worried beloved so we agreed  I followed him out and he just hailed a cab and got one within a minute  deffo a scam and left an unpleasant taste after a good stay No problem with lifts always available and it was nice getting a smoking room withuot feeling like a social outcast 
N => great price huge rooms for NYC My sisters and I stayed here throughout memorial day weekend this past   I was expecting a regular holiday inn and figured the rooms would be small  they were anything but  Probably the biggest room you can get in NYC  there was four of us to one room and we were not at all cramped  The bathroomshower was a little smaller than we would have liked but it didnt affect our stay whatsoever  We couldnt figure out how to turn the shower on so we called down to the front desk and someone was sent up within  minutes from when we made the call  Excellent service  The busboys are wonderful and as soon as you left the hotel lobby to the streets they were hailing cabs down if you needed one  Very efficent  Plus to park our car there for the weekend was extremely cheap The only downfall I had was when we checked out of the hotel we put our bags in the storage room so we could walk around before we left  Nothing was stolen but the man was pretty rude and kept reminding us that whatever we leave here they are not responsible if something happens etc   he must have mentioned it  times  I would have liked to be a little bit closer to Times Sq and Broadway considering we were there for a girls weekend and theatre trip  But honestly for the money you cannot beat it  
N => Typical Holiday Inn  Theres better in NYC I found a very low rate for this hotel   on a Thursday night  so ided to try it out based on the reviews Id seen here  I was surprised to find a typical not special holiday inn  The hotel was nothing special  The staff seemed inconvenienced by my presence  From check in to the wait staff in the breakfast restaurant to the really annoyed man who took my money in the breakfast restaurant to the rather put off man at check out who really did not want to make change for a   bill everyone was phoning in their customer service  It was the first time in a long time Ive experienced such a lack of effort on the hotels part The elevators were always crowded  They are simply too small to accommodate the number of guests using them  I was lucky enough to get a top floor room so could enter the elevator easily  But it always stopped five or six times on the way down and could really only hold about six people so people on lower floors were not able to get in not that they did not try  There is a sign in the elevator that asks guests not to steal the elevator signs  Not a good sign  The room was comfortable and heres one real plus very quiet  I did not hear any street noise and there was very little plumbingmechanical noise  I usually wake up a couple of times each night when staying in NYC and slept through the night here  The linen and bathroom were clean and fresh the bed comfortable and the television worked very well  The hotel wireless internet was free and worked well  The location is a little north of Times Square and a little out of the way from the sites of NY but its just three blocks from the subway and the hotel seemed to do a good job securing cabs airport transport etc  for guests  It was worth it to take advantage of the low rate but I would not say it was in the thick of things  Id stay here again if the rate were low enough to be a really big saving such that I would be willing to put up with the indifferent staff and the somewhat dated and overused fascilities  
N => Terrific Family Hotel Stayed in the busy Holiday week between Christmas and New Year  Absolutely terrific hotel for a family  Had such a bad experience with accommodation back in ch in New York was really stressed about bringing the family and suitable accommodation  Holiday Inn was in the perfect spot close enough to walk to times square etc but further enough away that the noise wasnt too bad at night  Nothing fancy here but reasonable sized rooms clean well priced and in a good position  Had a fantastic time will always stay there now we have found the Holiday Inn  
N => Really great hotel My sister and nieces and myself stayed in the holiday inn  We went to NewYork for a shopping holiday and a chance for a girlie holiday  I have to say the Holiday Inn was a great hotel staff were so friendly and helpful  Rooms were to a high standard beds were dressed every day and towels were changed and rooms were cleaned on a daily basis  Coffee machines in all rooms this was a big plus we all love our cuppa Restaurant was great we had breakfast and lunch there on a few occassions  The only little problem we found was we did have a nice walk to get to th avenue and maceys  It was at least a  minute walk  But we loved the hotel it was a great holiday and we will return again to NewYork and stay in the Holiday Inn  
N => All that we required We stayed here for  nights in early ember   It was all that werequired  We found the room to be spacious clean and reasonably quietYOU ARE IN NEW yORK FOR GOODNESS SAKE  We were happy with the front desk service and the concierge went out of his way to advise us on howto get where we needed  
N => Good hotel and great price So  of us booked our trip through hotwire months ago to be in NY for New Years Eve  The price was great We paid  a person for hotel and airefare for two days  Sunday  Tuesday No problems checking in Room size was great bathroom was great size Staff was very friendly and helpful  Room service was good  Great cheese sticks and chicken strips for a late night snack Best part about this hotel is the location its on a less busy street so the noise level was not bad at all  We were on the th floor and yeah you can hear some cars but it was hardly something that would wake you in your sleep  This hotel was in walking distance to basically everything as long as you dont mind walking  FAO Shwartz Central Park right down the street  We walked to Time Sqaure Rockefeller Center Top of the Rock tons and tons of shopping  It was great  We got help flagging a taxi when we were leaving it was raining pretty bad and the cab was right there waiting for us  It was great  We will stay here everytime we go to NY in the future  A few bad points nothing major some wallpaper coming off of the wall in the bathroom behind the toilet  No biggie oh and the toilet there was problems flushing it you just had to put some muscle into it and then it was fine  Nothing I called front desk about  Ice machines are located on even floors and pop machines are located on odd floors but the pop machines we found were all sold out  Our room didnt have a refrigerator so that sucked  Bring your own snacks for night  After room service stops there are a few delis that are open down the street but just bring your own snacks so you dont have to walk late at night  
N => A Lovely Stay Stayed in this hotel from the th to the rd of ember  Holiday Inn Midtown was clean and comfortable  The lobby was grand and the lifts were plentiful and in working order important in a NY hotel  LocationA short stroll from Broadway  Once on Broadway you just walk on a bit before you are at the heart of it all   minute walk to Times Square  Not close to Century  Ground Zero or ferry to Statue of Liberty but overall the location was pretty good and you arent more than a short walk or taxi ride to the major sights and places Rooms My room was very large for a single room   I was actually given a double bed The bed was extremely comfortable best few nights sleep Ive had in a long time  The rooms were warm and well insulated  The television had the big channels on it as well as options to buy movies etc  Bedroom was lit by a series of lamps  I like having just the one switch in a room for a main light but didnt really mind this system  There was also a service directory telephone and phone book in the room  The coffee machine wasnt used Im a tea man and there was no kettle Bathroom Small but sufficient  The showers were grand and there was new shower supplies dropped in every day as well as towels  Toilet flushed  Not much else to say here reallyEating Had breakfast in the hotel every morning  Good service  Not mad about the food but it wasnt a quality problem   just not to my taste most of the time Atmosphere Staff were friendly although the Conseirge was a rip off  Everybody had a smile on their face Facilities No hot water first day  This was due to a problem on that block not just in the hotel  Eating facilities were ent but really itd be nicer to eat out  Gift shop was good value and useful  The bar was comfortable and a nice place to relax after a hectic day  Internet facilities cost a dollar for ten minutes  No complaints there This being a Holiday Inn the aim is to deliver a ent spot to stay rather than to delight  There were no chocolates on the cushion for example although the free USA Today on the first morning was a nice touch However I have no problem saying this is a great place to stay especially seeing as you will be spending most of your time out and about  Good value and will hopefully be back again  
N => Suited me just fine I visited NYC with my mom for a few days in mid e  Our room was at the end of a hall on the th floor  The room itself was huge compared to the budgetEuropean sized hotel rooms Ive grown accustomed to in recent years and clean  No complaints about the bathroom either  The hallway smelled of a bleachy cleaning solution but I guess thats better than it smelling like a dumpster The front desk staff were very friendly especially during the late hour we arrived  If you dont need to sleep near Times Square this hotels location is prime  Its close to a subway stop near the SW tip of Central Park and there is a bus stop close to the entrance to the hotel so getting around was never a problem even at night  While mom had to work I was able to walk alone in the morning and afternoon but I dont ever recommend walking alone at night a typical precaution though  
N => Lovely Hotel Worried about some reviews but the hotel was excellent  Clean and friendly staff  Nice bar area to relax in etc  Food available but never tried it I could not fault it  Not too far to walk to times square etc quite a few eating places close by Recommend to all  
N => nice place to stay by the andos just returned from a  day stay at this hotel  it was a large clean room with huge king sized bed only problem was this was for  people we advised the staff and they had this sorted in no time all members off staff we spoke to ie porters waiters reception etc were very plesant and ready to help  rooms were average looking but very comfortable have seen much worse but who goes to nyc to look at wall paper location of this hotel was good top of street was a subway and found these easy to use and took you to almost any destination required  short walk also to times square radio city music hall and the rockefeller center all in all i would stay at this hotel again as staff were great and found this to be a good location for getting about   
N => Great location   average hotel This hotel was in an excellent location literally round the corner from Central Park and right nr the subway  In New York you cant get a hotel which is nr everything as its such a big city but this location was definatly one of the best the furthest things away from us where the statue of liberty and world trade centre site as they were both down in the financial district  We were only there  days but managed to fit quite alot in we went to the empire state building maddame tussauds Times square World trade centre site statue of liberty central park battery park and also shopping on th avenue We never used the buses while we were there we always used the subway which was only   But to be honest you can walk to times sq from this hotel Only problem was the staff at the front desk were quite rude we only ever ate breakfast in the hotel which was nice quite a bit to choose from  
N => Only average Stayed here last week with friends and to be honest it was ok  The locastion was good with easy access to the subway and Central park  Room was clean and well kept  Only critism is the lack of the quotpersonnal touchquot my friend wished to surprise his girlfriend with flowers in the bedroom on arrival but the hotel wasnt able to accomadate this request also you can only book breakfast to be brought to your room on the morning your request it  On the whole a good place to bunk down  
N => Better than Mid Travelled with  girlfriends  Price from airport to hotel was  inc toll and trip  Check in was quick no queue  Room  on th Floor with two double beds was spacious and very clean  Storage was limited but adequate with plenty of mirrors  Bathroom was small but modern shower was fiddly but good water pressure  There was no extractor fan in the bathroom so it did get steamy but overall we were happy with the room All staff we encountered were very helpful we didnt eat at the restaurants or drink at the bar but they looked very good and the prices seemed reasonable  
N => Great location I was bit worried with bad reviews but was pleasantly surprised The room was very big with  double comfortable beds  We were on the th floor and it was very quiet  The or was dated but it was clean and who spends time in their hotel to look at the wallpaper Was in good location only  blocks from subway and bus stop outside  The lady concierge was really pleasant and helpful  I would go back to this hotel again 
N => Dont be be too hard on the place Stayed here with my grown up son the main reason we chose it was we could get a room with two ent beds   we werent going to share a double bed and two rooms would double the price The room was OK yes I agree it was a bit tired but it was large with two king size comfy beds no fridge no safe but good aircon and although we were on the road side th floor traffic noise not a problem  Good location easy walk to Central Park Times Square th Ave and port area for boat trips  The staff we experienced were friendly efficient and couldnt be more helpful So it was cost effective and served our purpose well   we were enjoying New York shopping watching the Giants and the Yankees  having a ball not skulking around in the hotel thinking about the bad review we would write when we got home 
N => hate the holiday inn midtown warm in manhattan tonight and hotel has only heating  i am a platinum card holder so called anyway to ask about situation  manager on duty ms  judit had nothing to say other than she would send security to my room  so security arrived i guess to assess whether or not i might be a terrorist  appalling property and misleading description on internet  have a rate of night with up to  for breakfast  this translates as a coupon for one of the following muffin croissant toasted bagel or toast  thats not a  contribution to breakfast  the only good thing about this hotel is that one does not have to pay for internet  but one has no option of being upgraded  and i have to say that it was funny when i was offered a   discount for tonight and after i pushed this suddenly went up to    am not sure where i am at this point  didnt expect to bargain in nyc  but this is after all a cheap place in spirit and i would never recommend staying here  the holiday inn express at penn station is much better if one is looking for an ic property  otherwise it is worth paying more for a real hotel  
N => Good for tourists Rooms were fine for family of  to be comfortable  Clean and not noisy  Free Wi Fi is great to stay in touch with office or do quick NYC check for updated info  Not a place to spend more than a couple hours each day very basic  Easy to get to trains and bus  Walked to shows from hotel  minutes  hail a cab right outside hotel easily  Felt very safe   concierge asks for proof of room key after pm  Chose not to eat any meals here   a walk to Hells Kitchen area has much better food and great atmosphere  
N => Good Price But Not The Best Stay Well well well New York City was a blast and I absolutley loved it there From Times Sqaure to the Statue of Liberty every bit of New York is beautiful The Holiday Inn was not so much the same  Im not saying it was horrible but it was definetly not the greatest  Here are some positive and negative aspects towards the hotel I experiencedPositive  Free Internet  Iron and Iron Board in room  Good Location  Friendly Front Desk and Staff  Spacious RoomNegative  Got Stuck in the elevator  Window washers appeared outside my window twice at am  Carpet was dirty  Bathroom was small  Toilet sounded like it was crying everytime I flushed it  No Conditioner and small shampoo bottle bring own toiletries Im not sticky and Im not snobby at all but i expected a little better of a hotel  It did not ruin my trip but if I were to be staying in New York City again I would rather choose another hotel  
N => What a horrible experience Not for business travellers I was here on business and will say I have no desire to ever repeat the mistake I booked a non smoking room got to the hotel only to find that they had booked me in a smoking room  I mentioned that I had booked a non smoking and the clerk states they could not make any changes until the manager came back from break  I was kinda pissed so I called American Express they confirmed that it was a non smoking they talked to the clerk who could not do anything because the mgr was on break I was too exhausted to move to another hotel  Mgr comes at  apologises and promises me a room at  pm gives me a drink voucher  I come back at  room is not ready I had to wait I was told by the front desk clerk she would let me know when the room was ready  She never did I walked up to her at  and she comes up with some lame excuse Ithat she could not see me in the bar  I was the only African American man in the bar with a drink order coupon The room when I get in had a mediocre AC yes the week of the tornado in Brooklyn  I called to get it fixed and kept getting promises that they would fix it  I woke up one early morning to go outside to cool off that is how bad it was The only bright spot was the bellhops who helped people get cabs and car service when the subway flooded  They were a dedicated bunch  I hope another hotel steals them away Verdict if the you are on business this is not worth it you need to look professional and be rested for the next day of business meetings and this hotel is not going to provide you with the right amenities  If this is your only choice I would look at finding a hotel in Jersey  
N => Ok but no AIR The hotel was clean and the rooms were a lot bigger than expected  Honestly though the room was hot muggy and none of us got a great night of sleep  We had issues with our AC unit and the managment did nothing to help us out  I have read other reviews and this has come up several times  Seems either the management or Holiday Inn really doesnt care  
N => Great location Hotel is located near to some good bars and places to eat  Room was good and staff very helpful Did not have the chance to try out the pool as we only stayed  days  
N => Only in an emergency   moldsmelly and more    This week we were stranded in NYC due to weather and some problems with our airline  We needed a room for two nights as that was how long it would take to get out with confirmed reservations  This place was one of just a few with any rooms left so I was glad just to have a place to sleep as we had been flying from Europe for a long time  I booked from the airport a non smoking room etc  upon arrival only thing they would give me was smoking  took it what choice So for over three hundred dollars yes you read right we were in a very dismal dirty room that smelled way more than smoke had mold on the tub and the plumbing did not work properly  Way too tired to deal with it we just slept and left the next day for a much better option at a lower price  Only pleasant thing was the coffee shop in the morning   I was almost scared to go down however it was fine and the service was good   did find it interesting that for just two people they add   service   bet they get lots of extra tips as most people will not see that on the bill and just figure it is yet another NYC tax   it is not identified clearly other that a small sc on the total bill  Anyway if you have a choice you can do way better than this one and for less money   location was not good for us either depending on what you want to do   again with so many choices in the city not sure why anyone would choose this  
N => Not too bad again Stayed here again second time in about six months  HI gives a fairly ent military rate  so were satisfied for what we got  Yes hotel is outdated but the rooms are quite large for the price  AC TV watershower all worked fine  Breakfast was the only meal we ate there and was ent  Service quick so nice to get quotin and outquot and on our way  We like the location   right near Central Park few blocks to Columbus Circle metro stop lots of restaurants and stores within walking distance One thing struck me as odd   we bought a bottle of wine while out shopping and took it back to the hotel  We asked the lounge for two wine glasses to take to the room and they charged us a  each glass deposit Now seriously folks where am I going to run off with a cheap wine glass Had to take the glasses downstairs to the front desk at checkout to get the fee taken off my bill  Not a big fan of that  Overall will probably choose this hotel again if we can snag a ent price  
N => not unpleasent All Staff very helpful rooms clean only downfall was the air conditioning never worked though it was promises everytime we asked  New York is very Humid at times and it was very uncomfortable without AC  The telly kept turning off Very annoying  Carl at the ticket desk was fantastic if you want to book anything in New York he is the person to see  
N => average but comfortable Stayed in il  Had a good holiday  room large and comfortable  location ok but depends what you want to do  reasonable walk to time square but close to central park only had breakfast in hotel twice and it was ok  Pleased that we had no noise or temperature problems Did not find reception staff either helpful or otherwise The concierge was not helpful in fact quite patronising the one time we ask him a question Missed having a fridge and being able to make a single cup of instant coffee Considering prce and lack of extras was disappointed you had to pay when they stored your bags for a few hours post check out Was not sorry we stayed here considering price but would only stay again if I could not afford something more central  
N =>  doesnt pay for much  Not what I expected The location and the concierge staff were wonderful close to time square central park theaters shops and restaurants  However everything else was pretty substandard This was my fist visit to the big city and I wanted to stay in a central place  My trip was work related so I wanted a hotel that was functional at a low price  my employer wont pay more than  per night  I arrived at the hotel and they did not have a non smoking room  One of the elevators was broken and there were over  people waiting in line  The room was small and it was stinky  I had to buy Lysol and candles  The bathroom was too small  not enough counter space for my toiletries  In fact the bathroom door could not be closed without whacking the toilet seat  The closet was also too small  I was there for  days and needed more room for my stuff  Skip the restaurant When I arrived I was starved and I ate a club sandwich  It was expensive and pretty awful During my stay there was an incident on my floor  Someone kept yelling call security call security  Well I called security The next morning I tried to complain and they said that the computer did not show a reported incident  The manager was not in so if I wanted for file a complaint I had to wait until the next day   doesnt pay for much in the big city To think that I stayed at an beautiful resort in Cabo for half as much  I am glad my employer is paying the bill  
N => No A pure kiprooms were dirty   carpet was shockinglocation poor too far up the citycheap and cheerful 
N => Large room for NY Holiday Inn Midtown offers a larger than average room when it comes to NY hotels  Its  blocks from Columbus Circle so location was fine too  Room was clean no problems in that area either The window curtains did not block the sun very well  That was a problem for me cause I wanted to sleep until  Also my room had no fridge  I dont know if this common in NY but I never paid  dollars per day on a hotel without a fridge  
N => Great Place To Stay Just returned from NYC staying at this hotel great location within walking distance to most attractions staff at the front desk were a bit unfriendly the restaurant staff were first class we ate there every morning the breakfast was great giving you a good choice of food the rest of the hotel staff were great very helpfull  The hotel could be doing with an upgrade the toilet in our room was very small but over all it was fine Clean and house keeping staff looked after you well Will definetly be back next year as it was our first time in NY we did not know what to expect we never at any time felt uneasy going about even at night St Patricks day was brill the parade was excellent shops were great restaurants plenty of them  I would not hessitate to recomend this Hotel to anbody  
N => Ideal base to experience New York My stepmum and I were treated to a trip to New York for our birthdays by my Dad  We arrived at the Holiday Inn tired but eager to go searching  The staff could not have been friendlier and acted as great guides and advisors to this city  The rooms were clean and comfortable and cleaned every day  We had  large double beds in our room although the bathroom was a bit small and dated  I would recommend the Holiday Inn to anyone who wants a good base and I will stay again when I return to New York in the near future 
N => sooooooooooooooooo disappointing  We travelled to New York with friends for a long weekend break expecting to enjoy our stay in the well known HOLIDAY INN chain but were sooooo disappointed The staff were so far removed from friendly amp courteous it was shocking APART FROM HOUSEKEEPING amp CONCIERGE WHO WERE ALL HELPFUL amp NICERoom was not as booked smokingRoom was dirty upon arrival  reception sent someone up to clean make bed etc amp offered a free breakfast the next morning as compensation the following morning then insisted we paid for it on checking outNever again the experience ruined our stay in New York  Shame on you Holiday Inn  
N => very good stay Had a very nice stay at this hotel good location clean and tidy friendly staff  beds a bit old and food just ok but overall it was a very nice visit to the big apple Thankyou Holiday inn  
N => Great location and very comfortable hotel We stayed in this hotel from th  to st  and have to say the stay was most enjoyable  The conceierge was very helpful the staff were really nice  The rooms were spacious and clean bathroom was a bit small but we managed be careful though when booking cos not all rooms have bathrooms  The location is great would recommend this hotel as its very comfortable  
N => Well beyond my expectations I have never written a review for anything before but after reading some of the reviews and actually staying at this hotel myself I felt compelled to do so  I know there are lots of other hotels that are more luxurious and no doubt pricier but the Holiday Inn Midtown was very clean affordable and more than met our needs  The purpose of my trip was a girls trip to visit friends in the city and go see a broadway play  We stayed for two nights  We arrived about two hours prior to check in and there was no problem getting into our room early  The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything from restaurants to shopping to subway routes  The rooms are huge for NY and the linens were very clean I love crisp white sheets  The water was very hot and you never had to wait between showers  The location of the hotel was close enough to almost everything if you dont mind walking  For people who dont want to walk a few blocks this might not be the hotel for you  When we checked out they stored our luggage because we had a late afternoon flight  We didnt even have to ask  Finally something that I have never had happen in all my years of travel   when we received the bill the nightly rate was actually lower than what we were quoted when we booked  That was just icing on the cake  My friends and I go to NY at least two times a year  This was our first stay at Holiday Inn Midtown but after much discussion this stay wont be our last  
N => Loved the Holiday Inn Our room was very large and clean Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very good but not really cheap The location is very good for all midtown attractions   to walk Also the subway is not far to walk Would stay again here 
N => Great place to stay Booked Holiday Inn after cancelling the dreaded Hotel Carter Check in was smooth and receptionist was very polite amp chatty  We had a king size bed which was very comfy  Room was warm and clean but like other reviewers said its a bit dated but Im not bothered about furnishings as long as the place is clean then Im happy  Maid cleaned room daily Our room was at the back so was really quiet  Location was very good  Close to Central Park about  min walk to Columbus Circle Subway  mins from Times Square  felt safe walking around the area late at night Booked theatre tickets from the hotel and had them at a great price  Better than queuing at box office  Dont have a drink in the hotel its expensive instead walk around the area and youll find some great resturants amp bars Also dont be pressured by the bellboys into booking a limo taxi to the airport for  they say its the cheapest way to the airport its not Just get yourself a cab or shuttle bus All in all I was impressed by this hotel and would stay again  
N => Desperately Needing Refurbishment ON THE PLUS SIDE Good location on th Street  minutes walk to Columbus Circle subway  minutes walk to th Avenue  Fairly good amenities   bar restaurant gift shop  Some staff very helpful  Good local diners especially The Flame on th  Good size double rooms ON THE MINUS SIDE The whole place looks tired dated and grubby  I had a mouldy crumbling bathroom with a toilet that only flushed sometimes  Sinks are in the bedroom not the bathroom Stained carpets furnishings and walls  Slow elevators  Some staff downright rude  Drinks and food in the bar and restaurant vastly overpriced  Room service available but no menustariffsdetails of this in rooms  Everyone in my party of  said their rooms were cold Not good value for the price  
N => Would recommend We did lots of research and when our first and second choice hotels werent available we ided to go for this one which had some reasonable reviews  We were really impressed with the hotel nothing fancy but the staff were all really friendly and helpful  We had a slight flood in the bathroom our fault and maintenance were quick and sorted the problem out with no fuss  The bathroom was a bit small but the room was fine with two double beds we were on th floor overlooking th Street  We didnt find the room to be noisy in fact one of the advantages of this hotel is it is just away from the noise main routes through NY but convenient enough for all the attactions  Didnt use the hotel restaurants as there were a couple of diners just along the street which were great value  We would definately consider this hotel next time we come to NYC  
N => Necessary Evil We were able to priceline this hotel for a Wednesday night for   tax and fees  We had a horrible time finding a hotel at a reasonable rate even though we were able to get a three star beautiful hotel downtown for  a couple days later so we finally bit the bullet and upped our bid in order to receive a hotel in Midtown  We had Letterman tickets so the location was ideal  The hotel was at least safe the lobby generously sized but the rooms were small and run down  Check in was fine  we were able to check in at  am which was pretty early  All in all it was a necessary evil and sometimes in Manhatten you have to take what you can get  At least the letterman tickets were free 
N => nice location We just returned from a long weekend in NYC  We booked the Holiday Inn on th after reading many reviews  We were a little concerned when we checked in and were told that there would be no heat or air conditioning during our stay because they were switching over the system  We stayed on the th floor and we were able to open the windows a few inches which actually kept the room comfortable  To start the location was excellent  Many restaurants and pubs nearby and close to the subway  The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful  The beds were comfortable and we had plenty of pillows  The tv worked well  Now the not so good the bathroom was not in very good condition  There was mold growing on the ceiling and on the grout in the tub  The sink had a leak and would create a puddle whenever you ran the cold water  We only paid   per night and were not expecting much and were satisfied overall  If your on a tight budget its not a bad place to stay  
N => location location After reading other reviews we were really apprehensive about staying at this hotel but most of our fears were groundless  Our room was fairly large and very clean  the housekeeping staff were great The pool area was clean although the staff up there were very brusque and unwelcoming  The restaurant was also very good although again the staff were not as helpful as we had found everywhere else in the States The bar was as others said  you had to wait for your drink for some time as the staff were doing paperworkfetching food or talking on a mobile phone That said the concierge were great with advice and booking tours etc for us and the hotel was in a great location in walking distance to Times Square Central Park and the shopping the Shows You have to see a broadway show We went to the TKTS office to see what shows were half price the night we wanted but nothing grabbed us  We wanted to see Lion King so went to the box office and got brilliant tickets for  and it was well worth every penny or rather cent 
N => Great hotel Well Im very remiss in reporting but we my son amp I stayed here last uary  for  nights  We enjoyed this stay very much  Hotel was great  We were on an upper floor in the tower  We specifically asked for tower when we checked in  Room was large and everything was neat and clean  Would definitely recommend  Very convenient to subway and Central Park  
N => Never Again My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week in    We had been to New York several times previously and we chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Lincoln Centre as we had booked to go to three operas  The location is fine   not the best bit of town but quite acceptable and safe and the room was very spacious  However the price was far too high and I felt that the room was dingy and unappealing  The bathroom was even darker and very old fashioned and the lobby doesnt have a welcoming feel about it at all  While we were there various groups of young people were staying and so the entrance area always seemed to be full of luggage people and noise  I did not think it was up to what I would consider to be Holiday Inn standards and I would never stay there again  I did try to change hotels after a couple of nights as we hadnt paid in advance but unfortunately it was around graduation time and most hotels were full  
N => Would go again My family of four loved the location of this hotel  The room was very very quiet and the beds were very comfortable  The curtains were the quotroom darkeningquot types of curtains so this allows you to block out the daylight if you need to  Sink area was arate from the tubtoilet area  There was an ironing board with iron in the bathroom  I thought the bathroom sink area could have been bigger but that is really my only complaint  Room AC worked well maid service was good front desk staff was very friendly  We would return to this location because it was quieter than some sections of the city  We were within walking distance of Times Square and Central Park and we managed to walk to a lot of places we probably should have taken a taxi to  What a nice city 
N => Small but adequate OK   say it with me quotTINY ROOMquot  The hotel was fine clean and centrally located but the rooms were painfully small  The service was good and the food was OK but for  per night for the quotsmallest room I have ever hadquot this hotel was overpriced  
N => Hotel fine staff not Actual hotel fine  good location quiet with amenities  Room modern and large but no minibar  However we had problems when checking in the room had been booked in uary and we didnt arrive until  and fully paid for or so we thought but the staff informed us that they had tried  times to get paymnet from a credit card but that it hadnt worked but that had not bothered to contact us once and did not apologise  So when we tried to change a  dollar bill for quarters for the phone to try and sort the mess out they were very reluctant  Not only were the staff reluctant to do this they were MOST UNHELPFUL and UNFRIENDLY our whole stay and acted as if every thing were a total hardship  One membr of reception and a bell boy was rude and never smiled once  So if you are looking for a hotel with friendly and courteous staff DO NOT stay at the Holiday Inn th Street Midtown  
N => Really a very good place to stay I liked this hotel very much we felt at home during our  day visiting to NY  Rooms were very spacious lobby very nice personnel very friendly bagboys helped us for NBA tickets etc  Really you get a great hotel at a moderate price  
N => Wonderful price good location felt very safe This hotel was wonderful after being stuck at the Carter Hotel firsttotal dump   Our room felt very large as compared to other rooms I have stayed in in the city  It was fairly basic but just perfect if you arent the type to never leave your room on vacation   and actually see the sights  I felt comfortable leaving my belongings there and the security at night made me feel extra safe   checking keys when people entered the building  Overall I would recommend to anyone on a budget but still wants a comfortable place to stay and feel safe in  
N => old and noisy So so hotel  rooms good size  tired looking lobby  doors slam and really need modernizing to keep noise level down  We moved after a night to Holiday Inn Express  Much better there  
N => Great location Cleanlarge roomsWalking distance to most everything Close to all attractions we were interested inall eating places were better than averagepeople in and out of hotel were friendly and helpful wireless internet was great  Rooms were large and clean along with bathrooms  Our room looked like it had been recently remodeled  Walked to all attractionstook the tours to downtown Manhattan and within walking distance to Central Park  Felt like we were always safe in and out of hotel even on the subway  If ever in NY again we would very likely stay here again  
N => good location and value but Would stay again but would advise missing breakfast as staff to a man did not appear to understand the language of English speakers Much better to obtain breakfast elsewhere or in the room  
N => Avoid at All Costs We stayed at the holiday inn on Saturday ober nd  After checking in at pm and settling in the room we discovered there was no heat in the room  We called down to the front desk and they said there was no heat in the entire hotel The staff was rude inconsiderate of the fact that we were freezing and accused us of checking in to the hotel after being told that there was no heat  We didnt sleep but a few hours that night because of the cold  The room service was horrendous  The staff managers etc  were beyond rude and totally unprofessional  The room was small cramped smelled of smoke and dingy  Stay somewhere else We were charged the full night for the room and are fighting to get a partial refund of the rate     
N => Good Valu for Money in an expensive City Second stay in New York though first at Holiday Inn  For   a night you do not get a lot in NYC but though the hotel rooms are a bit tired the facilities were clean and the accomodation average in size  We were on the back of the hotel which was a lot quieter than the hotel we were in last year so that was a bonus though we did hear more noise in the corridors as there are large gaps under the doors The location was good being near enough to Central Park and th Avenue to walk to and also to the Intrepid Museum which we enjoyed  It seemed a safe area at night as we walked to restaurants in the evening of which there are many recommended by the hotel  If this part of town suits what you want to do then good value but do not expect posh 
N => A honeymoon ruined We were on a tight enough budget for our honeymoon however we did pay   for flight and accomodation for a  night stay in New York from Ireland  In the brochure the hotel was given a four star king  The hotel were notified that we were a honeymoon couple and yet we were given a twin room  The room smelt awful and it took us several days to air it out as the window would only open so far  The or was s roadside motel and the wallpaper was coming off the walls in the bathroom  There was a tired wicker basket containing the complementary soaps and facecloth that were always covered in a layer of dirt  There was absolutely no soundproofing so we were often woken by people leaving for early flights or the arguing couple next door  I had been recommended this hotel for its rooftop pool but we were never advised that it only opens between e and tember and from what we could overhear in the elevator we were not the only ones to be disheartened by this  The staff were rude and had no customer service training evidently and looked bored having to help you out  We spent most of our time walking around the city exhausting ourselves so we wouldnt have to face going back there too early  It is a well situated hotel and Im sure it will make a good story to tell our kids about our terrible honeymoon but at the moment I cant see anything much to lh about 
N => Great Service at Holiday Inn Midtown I spent  nights in the Holiday Inn Midtown in    The service and support by the frontdesk was great  Congratulations The room was huge  double beds even though I was travelling on my own  My room was on the th floor and to my very positve surprise taking a shouer was a pleasure hot water from the very moment the tab is switched on   even   hotels have troubles about this Location is great  Don t miss to walk to Columbus square at night Two things to improve the lifts are to slow and the aircon needs some cleaning and efficiency  enhancement Definitely recommend this hotel  
N => Ok for the price but nothing special about the place We requested a room in the reated A tower and we got one there eventhough we did not have a membership card which I read was a requirement accoring to earlier reviews of this hotelThe room was what I had expected can t find anything to complain about  We paid  USD for a room for four people We where served at the lobby by three staffmembers two where really nice and helpful one even searched the internet and called to find us the nearest Ihop restaurant  One was however really rude and I would have fired her if I would have been in charge she had no service mentality what so everOne major complaint is however the elevators they where really slow and far to fue to care for such a big hotel  We stayed on the th floor which was a good thing the elevator would be empty when it arrived but we would stop at almost every floor going down  This happened every morning The hotel is two blocks from Columbus circle subway station  
N => warning    Although I reserved with a credit card a double room  a night weeks in advance I got there and was told it was not available amp they switched me to a single without even reducing the rate  It took   hours to get a hamburger via room service  Conditions were filthy e g  remote amp phone were layered with scum amp toilet was clogged  Worst Id get back at  or  in the afternoon wanting a shower amp short nap before the evenings activites and housekeeping had never touched my room even though by the second day they agreed to clean the room if I called when I left  Management couldnt have cared less  Their parent company ichotels wont even respond to my email complaint to them I didnt expect much for my money in NYC but this was a real burn  
N => Adequate hotel with unfriendly staff We stayed here for  nights in y   Arrived at the hotel about am in the morning after an absolute nighte trip from the airport aboard a quotsupershuttlequot blue minivan service that we had pre booked not recommended  Upon arrival we went to check in and there was not one ounce of friendliness about any of the staff  Not even an quothelloquot or anything  Just quotWhats your name   quot very regimented  Coming from Australia which prides itself on customer service I thought New York would be even better but have to say I was bitterly disappointedThe hotel itself was pleasant enough  Bed was comfortable and air conditioning worked well  I think we were in the newly reated block which helps  The bathroom was average it took a while to work out the shower but it was enough to get yourself washed All in all the Holiday Inn was Ok  The staff need a good kick up the bum to provide a more friendly service   they almost treat you as though they are doing you a favour by being there but unfortunately I found that to be the case wherever I went in New York  The location isnt fantastic but well within walking distance of Times Square  
N => Never Again I stayed here for  nights and my god that was too longUnfortunately at the same time a load of teenagers were staying too   presumably on a school trip What follow was having to listen to them in the hall ways Another great delight was the ice bucket machine which was opposite my room and the door wasnt closable to the room   again lots of nice noise The room was huge but not fantastic  The bathroom was grotty and looked like it needed a good clean down I barely saw any staff around to be honest and when I had to go down the receiption to get my suitcase they didnt seem bothered that I took it myself upstairs even though portage was included Went down for breakfast and they werent organised at all the food looked manky and cold and the hosts didnt speak English  I walked out and headed for Starbucks which is close by If you dont care about class and want to stay in a cheap place then this is ideal   not bad location thats all Ill say but as my first trip and hotel stay in New York it didnt make me want to go back any time soon  
N => Too many errors On our trip in ust  we received the wrong room had to return twice to lobby to get correct room  Small and slow elevators  Then when checking out we were over charged on our room and had to talk to manager to get it resolved  They blamed it all on the computer system  Rooms could have been cleaner  Food was good and staff in restuarant were very nice  Would not choose this hotel again 
N => Great Location Good Points Location was Great Front desk staff were nice and friendly room was small but clean the elevator was small as I read in other reviews but we never had to wait more than  minutes the buffet breakfast was good Bad Points Restaurant staff was rude to visitors that did not speak English I coulnt help but overhear this a few times The prepaid breakfast coupon for  did not cover breakfast on the days there was no buffet we had to add  and  plus tip and this is too much to much to pay and in the bathroom   the side of the toilet seat was  inches away from the wall and the toilet paper holder jammed into your knee Who would have designed this and last but not least   The cleaning staff do not understand the meaning of quotDo Not Disturbquot  This became quite annoying Overall I would definitely stay here again especially after my husband and I spoke with other vacationers while touring the city  They told us their hotel horror stories and we were shocked to say the least  I did my homework before my husband and I went on our Honeymoon and it paid off Im glad I chose this Holiday Inn  
N => Is a pool worth a permanently stained and smelly bathroom I just returned from a trip to New York and stayed in the worse hotel yet  I felt like I was traveling back in time  Everything was from the s including the shower curtains  Really how much would it cost to replace the shower curtains once in a while  I know that this is a reasonably priced hotel but I expect things to be clean and they were not  The tub was permanently stained and the bathroom in general had quite an odor The only saving grace was the pool and the beds were ent  Is a pool worth a really bad bathroom 
N => Disabled friendly close to Time Warner  Both of the moderately priced hotels near Lincoln Center in which I used to stay are now closed and I booked a very good rate  non refundable directly with the hotel last uary  Last ch I broke my hip and although my dor cleared me to travel e st I was still quite disabled  Called the hotel and asked for a shower chair and grab bars in the bathroom  Although they did not have any quotrampquot wheelchair which I did not need rooms available they upgraded me to a disabled room at no extra charge King bed not needed but larger room  Although there was no shower chair there were sufficient grab bars that I felt safe taking a shower although beware ble floors Holiday Inn is a moderately priced chain and I did not expect anything special from the room but it was larger than I expected also not needed but nice  There are ramps in the lobby and to the bar  I am a Priority Club member so did not need to wait to check in  The bellmen were very nice about getting me cabs and one even suggested taking a private car to the airport not a limo because the trip had been very tiring for me and he thought it would be easier which it was and only about  more Although the building is old and not as pristine as a pricier hotel it certainly was adequate  The hotel bills itself as being at th Avenue but it is actually mid block between th and th which puts it close to a microneighborhood I would not venture out in alone at night but when my disability heals I would feel reasonably safe walking back from Lincoln Center down th and over th  I had thought to use the pool which I enjoy for relaxation after sightseeing but did not as I had never seen it and was afraid I might fall The housekeeping staff was very understanding about my keeping my quotdo not disturbquot sign on all the time as I kept having to come back to the hotel during the day to rest  There was a somewhat depressing view from my room of buildings across th Street and it took me a while to figure out how to operate the drapes and air conditioner  I never did figure out how to operate the television certain channels worked at certain times of day and not at others and I never did figure out how to operate the alarm clock but travel with my own  There is in room coffee but I had brought my own There is a pleasant bar with pleasant staff to have a drink after a performance and although normally I would not eat in a hotel restaurant because of my disability I did once this time and the food and service were acceptable and pleasant There were some noisy events held during my  day stay which affected the bar and restaurant area but were not audible in my th floor room  The hallways are a little run down but for the price I paid I think it was good value  I am planning another visit to New York in ch  and will definitely stay in this hotel again  
N => worst front desk in the world paid upfront in ruary for  rooms too many kids for one room in y  hours to check in to be given  rooms  floors apart  min wait to access safe deposit box in reception cheap but not cheerful 
N => fantastic first visit to new york city Before our trip to nyc we were led to believe that our choice of hotel was not the best and were slightly worried on reading comments through this website  However on arrival we were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff  The hotel was very clean and tidy as was the room with everything that we could possibly need from ironironing board to coffee maker  We enjoyed our stay here and would stay again and shall certainly recommend this hotel to others  Location great short walk to times square   
N => A very nice stay As I am an avid NYC visitor   its always hard to determine whether or not I am a good judge of the NYC hotel experience  In my many years of staying overnight in NYC   this has been by far the best This hotel was clean modern and very obliging  As I was attending the NYC film festival   this was a very convenient hotel to the Lincoln Center and the walk was very refreshing  The staff was welcoming and very kind to hold our bags while we shopped and stayed in the city well after check out time  The bar was lovely to have a cocktail in as well  
N => We escaped to this Hotel We stayed at this hotel ember   to uary   We first stayed at the Park Savoy Hotel on th street but we fled from there as soon as we could  The Park Savoy was dirty small and dangerous no fire escapes  We had stayed at the Holiday Inn on th before and they were able to get us a room on short notice during this busy period  This is a good hotel not great  The rooms are big for New York city standards  We had a real bath in our bathroom not just a shower  Everything is clean and the staff is helpful  If you like the walk you can get to Time Square in  minutes  But you can also take the bus or subway  
N => Also dissapointed We stayed at this hotel in    for  nights and we were very dissapointed  We had read in advance that Tower A was recently renated but when we arrived we verified that when we checked in and we were told that Tower B was the one that had been renated so we took a room there instead  If this room was renated I would hate to see it beforehand  Also the towels were practically as thin as papertowels and the pillows not much thicker  Worst of all the housekeeping   on our first day we went to the Carnegie deli and put leftover sandwhiches in our ice bucket  We ended up not putting ice on them and as of our last morning they were still in that bucket  be the next guests will be hungry and will appreciate them A cup of tea remained on top of our tv for our entire stay as well  And speaking of cups for this amount of money and this location we expected them to be made of glass at least the ones for teacoffee but they were styrafoam and plastic instead  We wont stay here again  The only good thing was the location but not worth the poor conditions  
N => very disappointed Stayed on  original reservation was for  nights but due to the condition of room  in Tower A checked out early  Our reservation requested non  smoking room when we walked into the room the air reeked of stale smoke  The bathroom smelled of sour towels  wallpaper in the room was FILTHY Furthermore carpet had lost its life about  years earlier it was faded dirty and smelled  When we asked the front desk to change rooms the response was a smug we have no other rooms available  We are filled to capacity  All this for   a night Will never stay here again  
N => Good Good clean hotel situated a quick walk form Columbus Circle Metro station and Central Park  I expected not much but was pleasantly surprised by the rooms  Just make sure you ask for a reated room  It is a hotel with like  rooms so do not expect to a personal reception and service from the personal working there but the rooms will not dissappoint you  I would go there again  
N => A Pleasant Surprise On a cross country trip we ided to stop in NYC for a night and found a pretty good rate on hotels com for the Holiday Inn  I had not expected a lot but I was pleasantly surprised with what a nice hotel it was  The lobby was nice and has a terrific bar  We had some assistance with our baggage which was nice  Without asking we received a room with a great view There is a great rooftop swimming pool which I was eager to try out  Its really neat to enjoy the New York skyline while taking a dip in the pool  Our room was a nice size and was in good condition My only criticism would be in the valet parking service  The staff was overwhelmed and quite rude in dealing with getting peoples cars  I needed something from my car during my stay and got a bad attitude when I asked for it to be retrieved  I even offered to get it myself  But when the attendant brought me the wristwatch and sunglasses I had requested he also gave me the digital camera Id left in the car thinking I might want that as well  That was a really nice touch of customer service when I least expected it If I was going to New York again I would not hesitate to stay here again  Its in a good location a quick walk from Central Park  
N => Another relieved traveller Like the last couple of writers I was very apprehensive about this hotel following negative reviews in the last few months but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised on arrival there last week While the hotel is by no means fancy which    Holdiay Inn is the rooms our party were allocated were large comfortable and clean which was all we wanted We found the staff at the hotel to be efficient and amiable  On requesting additional pillows these were delivered to our room within  minutes of phoning the reception desk on the night of our check in  The negatives we experienced were that the lifts were very slow at certain times of the day one morning the shower was cold and on the day of check out the reception area was quite chaotic as there were insufficient staff to deal with the number of bags being retrieved from left luggage  My advice in respect of the latter would be to give yourself additional time to get your bags back   we didnt and ended up paying a waiting charge to our driver to the airport All in all we were quite satisfied with the hotel in terms of value comfort and excellent location very close to Central Park subway station and within walking distance of Bloomingdales other shopping  
N => Hotel should read comments It was our first visit to NY and I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn W th with my dhter  I am a Priority Club member but purchased my tickets through another entity  After coming in on a red eye we stood in the Prioity Club check in line  Before even being asked if we could be helped we were asked if we were PC Members there was no one else in the lobby  I indicated I was and was hoping there was availability for an early check in in thequotrecently reated tower quot The Front Receptionist was very rude however she did remind us that we were indeed in New York City The Receptionist then told us the reated tower was only for Priority Club members I reminded her that I was a Member and even offered to provide my number  She stated there were no rooms available at all and told us to return at  noon  We explored the area great location lots of small restaurants Starbucks  block away and came back at noon  We stood in the regular check in line and a very nice Receptionst assisted us and gave us a room in the reated tower without asking  The location is great for exploring the city two blocks from the Metro Columbus Circle Central Park Theater District however the hotel staff are not very helpful  When we first arrived the Doorman watched us take our luggage from the taxi to the reception area and did not even assist us with opening the door  This occurred throughout our stay even with our hands full of shopping bags  It semed to be the people staying at the hotel who were the most helpful  The rooms were very comfortable although the shower sometimes would not easily shut off  The rooms were always clean and the beds made every morning after we left  We often would return late evening to the hotel and felt relatively safe walking in the area  There is a ket  block up where we bought fruit and water   blocks up are several restaurants Chinese Steak which stayed open late  There was even a small clothing store next to Starbucks where we bought gloves  Watch out for doorman when checking out  We were running late and asked for a taxi to be waiting  We were lead outside and then our luggage was placed in their Lincoln which they then proceeed to tell us how much it was  Since we were short on time we said ok  After our not so nice check in we ided not to use the hotel other than for sleeping  We loved NYC and will return next year however we will not be staying at this hotel  This could really be a great hotel if only someone would teach customer service to all the hotel staff  
N => What a relief Phew I did as the person who reviewed the hotel before me did   emailed in advance of our check in to request a room in Block A  We did this after reading some terrible reviews of the hotel  And we got what we asked for Hotel room was excellent    double beds clean and comfortable Carpets in the lobby seemed ok too Bit noisy as we were fronting th street and other guests were inconsiderate and let their bedroom doors slam at all hours of the morning  Hotel employees were ok   I think the problem is that they are ALL speaking a second language english to them Bar was quite expensive but hey youre in a major city what do you expect We paid      approx for a bacardi and coke but they were pretty strong  No problem with getting our bags to our room or anything at all  Bar snacks are LARGE portions but cheap so be careful if youre not that hungry  All in all Id definately go back to saty at this hotel if I visited NY again 
N => Terrible hotel We stayed there  nights on  ober   When I checked in the hotel I asked the lady at the front desk if there are any privileges for Priority Club Platinum member like complimentary room upgrade or complimentary continental breakfast  She replied in a very grumpy and unfriendly way quotNo you get your points already and you get more points than the others since you are platinum memberquot  I found her very rude and of course I didnt get any privileges from the hotel at all  What a service Besides there were a lot of the doormen standing at the front door when we arrived by taxi none of us intend to help us to carry the luggages  When I was paying my taxi bill my colleagues helped me to unload the luggages from the taxi trunk and put them on the ground behind the taxi and one of doorman even pushed away my luggages as he was intending to help someone else guest already checked out to load a luggage into the taxi trunk  None of them even said a word to me or my colleague if we needed any assistance on our luggages  Probably they think Asian dont like to pay tips and they hardly make any complaints that was why they were trying to ignore us 
N => Reception bar a ripoff We already had reservations for this hotel when we arrived but we were left waiting at the desk even though there was someone counting a till behind the desk they never greeted us or said quotsomeone would be with us soonquot or called anyone  We had to wait for someone to come out from the back  We just went straight to bed because we were tired from the flight but we were woken at am with a loud ringing noise at first we thought it was a fire alarm and ran out into the hall but there was nothing going on so we rang down to receiption and they told us they would investigate this and that it probably was the lift alarm  Our room was very near the lifts  The ringing went on for another hour before it stopped next day we complained and we were moved to another room  This room was fine  Reception in the hotel is very nice but carpets through out are very dingy also we ordered a brandy and glass of water in the reception bar and we were charged  Ridiculous 
N => Awful Please do not stay in this hotel  The Holiday Inn at Midtown  be cheap and in a good location but the rooms are terrible and the staff unhelpful  The first room that I was allocated was dirty and full of damp so much so that the beds were wet  When I complained I was informed that this was standard  The second room was not much better either  The white plastic curtains did not fit the window and the lamp shades were covered in burn ks I certainly do not recommend this as a place to stay and I am sure that you can find a better deal for your money 
N => Not so cheap considering poor quality New York was our last stop on a month long honeymoonworld trip  We booked the Holiday Inn as you generally know what you are getting and NY Hotels are in general quite expensive  Having stayed in some luxury hotels around the world we wanted budget we could trust as we knew we wouldnt be in the hotel much with so many city sights to take in    it was very disappointing and rather expensive compared to the quality we had found in Australian hotelsThe desk were indifferent and abrupt towards us tour desk guy was nice though and helpful  A very childishly grumpy man who seemed to hate his job and everyone he encountered took in our luggage on the last day we checked out as our flight back to UK was late afternoon  After letting me stand for some time with the bags and fiddling around ignoring me he practically demanded a tip there and then   despite having being rude and unfriendly  I had spoken to him and he completely ignored me only grudgingly answering the same question from my husband We said we would tip when we collected bags as we genuinely had no cash   he wasnt happy Thankfully someone else who we did tip was on when we returned to get bags I dont care how much these people rely on customer tips in the US there is a limit in my book   and this was it    he was downright arrogant and nasty and nothing on earth would have forced me to hand over money for the so called service he provided The room was shabby and had badly stained ceiling bedding clean but threadbare in places we seemed to be on shampoo rations as these were not replaced bathroom dark and tiny  Poorer than expected  Not the best Holiday Inn and I wish we had spent more on somewhere else now Overall I think the staff annoyed me more than the shabby room which is a shame Location in fairness was spot on and easy enough to walk to times square or central park etc   
N => Cheap and it shows  Stayed for two nights  Very rude front desk staff  Felt I was putting them out if I asked a question  Room was not clean and the bed spread smelled very badly  I had to ask for a replacement  Had not been changed in a while   smelled like feet  We were not in the room much because we sere sightseeing    thank god  Ok value if you are not going to be using the room much  
N => Glad to Check Out     We stayed here once and believe me once was enough for four nights and we could not wait to get out of the place  Someone warned me that New Yorkers are not as laid back as Floridians but my god some of the staff at this place took arrogance to new heights When we checked in wed been given the wrong room   wed asked for a double room with a king bed and been given one with two queen beds and it was a good job we hadnt brought the cat because we couldnt have swung it round  This is probably the first hotel room I had ever been in where I could touch all four walls at once with every limb  When we asked to change to the room wed booked and paid extra for I expected the receptionist to pull a revolver and shoot us at the very least judging by the look she gave And so it went on downhill all the way from there   whether the staff k an X against anyones name who complains about anything but the level of service in this establishment lacked anything remotely associated with manners  It was awful dont go there 
N => For my first hotel stay in NY it was ok    I stayed in Tower B th floor  Didnt know until we went to our rooms via the elevator where the info was posted that remodeling was taking placeon the st thru th floors  When asked if construction would disturb us the front desk assistant responded that it would not  Needless to say at approximately am we heard drilling and hammering  Fortunately we were checking out at noon  Also there are only sheer curtains hung at the windows which made me a little uncomfortable about dressing in the room since the window faced a couple of buildings Other than that it was a pleasant stay  
N => Really good  
N => Good location but
