P => Great staff large rooms but dirty and outdated Room was big and spacious for NYC  Location was quotoff the beaten pathquot th and st ave  The rooms were very dated they need an update  The light switches were disgusting dirty filled with crud Heater was noisy  The one thing positive was the staff was great 
P => Argentinos en NY I was in NY in an excellent trip  Except our stay in Beekman everything was great  However the hotelis very well located leaves much to develop  The first day my son was locked in the bathroom because it locks the door a bad screw in doorknob  The second day the bathroom was flooded and part of the room with WC water  The same thing happened on the third day  The hotel staff is very nice but except to apologize I did not receive any manifestation of the hotel soon felt the inconvenience caused  
P => Beekman A Quirky Gem The Beekman is an excellent choice at this price range in NYC  The rooms are large although the furnishings are a bit dated  The bathrooms are in need of updating yet clean  But again   given the price I usually pay for a room at the Beekman its definitely a good deal  The hotel is pet friendly and the neighborhood seemed quite safe for a late night walk  Theres a nice deli across the street that delivers  
P => ROOMY CLEAN and CONVENIENT My family of four booked a  night stay at the Beekman Towers for ember  uary  We loved our suite on the nd floor  We had a small kitchen included coffee maker toaster microwave dishwasher sink oven and cooktop a nice size den with a sofa that made into a bed and a nice size bedroom with a queen bed  The bathroom was very nice and clean and nice soaps and bath gels shampoos etc  were left for us each day  We had ample closet space and storage space for our clothes  Two TVs  both had excellent reception  We had a nice terrace with a nice view  We asked for a roll away bed and although it was not all that comfortable it was fine for our  year old dhter  Maid service was excellent  People at front desk were nice  Doorman was really friendly  Elevator service was ALWAYS good  I loved being across the street from the small  hour quott quot They had good bagels and we stocked up on OJ cereal milk and bananas so we could eat breakfast in  The Beekman provided coffee packs we could brew ourselves  A lot cheaper than going out  There was a diner across from the United Nations  had a wonderful selection of food and prices were reasonable  We enjoyed the walk to Rockefeller Center Bryant Park and Grand Central Station  We even walked as far as Times Square several times  Although some might prefer to stay in the midst of the hustle and bustle this place was definitely NOT in the thick of the hustle and bustle  I liked that aspect of the Beekman and I would definitely go back to this hotel  
P => Fair Enough Another trip back to the city another city hotel review  We got a good rate through priceline and ided it was worth it especially given the fact that we were just in for a quick New Years weekend visit and had a feeling the city would have been filled with tourists abound  Our room wasnt ready upon check in so we left our bag with the doorman  Initial impression of the lobby was nice nothing overly fancy but nice enough  Odd though that there were no restrooms in the lobby area and was given the key to the nd floor fitness center to use the bathroom there  Just be sure to knock before entering as the bathrooms are equipped with a shower as well and people REALLY do make use of it after a work out I was lucky enough to discover that When we got to our room later in the day it made a nice first impression  Spacious enough and clean  And yes while the hotel  be a bit older and their furnishings arent sleek and new it made a great place to flop for the night It was a quick walk from Grand Central Station to the hotel and located in a nice quiet part of town  Getting a cab was no trouble and we found the location to be convenient to major city attractions The only complaint I have is that upon check out the woman at the front desk informed us that there were  phone charges from our hotel room a long distance call and a local call  They were made at times when we werent even in the hotel room  She reversed the charge so well see if that actually goes through on the next credit card statement  Hopefully no one snuck in while we were out and placed the calls  That would then be a whole different hotel review  
P => Good value for Manhattan Given the exhorbitant cost of staying in central Manhattan the Beekman offers great value for money and if your expectations are realistic you shouldnt be disappointed Other reviews that mention tired or and furniture are certainly correct but we couldnt fault the cleanliness of the bathroomlinen or the helpfulness of the staff  Im not sure I agree that the hotels soundproofing is second to none but then again we were on the street side which I suspect is noisier than if you are in a room at the back Excellent diners nearby and we found a few nice restaurants on nd Avenue  The bar at the top of the Beekman is also pleasant Overall a good value place to stay but you do need to sacrifice the glitz to get it  
P => Exceeded expectations I was pleasantly surprised by my studio suite at the Beekman Towers  Although usually rated at three stars it was still a very comfortable hotel  The rooms are very clean and spacious  Yes they are a bit dated and worn so if that is a problem you should look elsewhere  The queen bed was quite comfortable and the sheets were reasonably new  I did not try the pull out bed  Having a kitchenette was very convenient  The staff were warm and friendly  We did not eat in the hotel restaurant but the view from its rooftop location is wonderful  The United Nations Cafe across the street is a good place to go for breakfast  The hotel was not close to the subway so we took cabs a lot  The neighborhood is worth wandering around  Just to the north there are many consulates and we found Irving Berlins house just a couple of blocks from the hotel  I would definitely stay at his hotel again  
P => Large suites helpful staff clean but worn We booked a deluxe king suite for   a night for Thanksgiving weekend  Our suite had a large living roomdining area a small arate kitchen with a gas stove microwave coffee maker full fridge utensils etc  There were   baths one with a tub and shower head  The shower was great Everything was clean but the furniture was worn and scratched  The sofa had a slipcover on it that kept coming off and exposed the slightly stained upholstery  We had a king bed which was very comfortable and our dhter slept on a roll away bed that we requested ahead of time  We didnt try the pull out sofa bed because weve never slept on one that was even slightly comfortable  The restaurant called Top of the Tower was very elegant and and romantic   A pianist was playing on a grand piano and it was dark with candles and soft lighting  The view was stunning  Unfortunately we didnt eat there because we had only brought casual clothing  Room service is available  The staff and the doormen were very accommodating and were always available to help  Valet parking was   a day and you werent able to access your auto until check out  That was fine with us because we mostly walked or took taxis  A parking garage down the street was only   less per day  The neighborhood is mostly residential and very quiet and safe  We had a view from the bedroom of the East River which was nice  One block west on nd Ave  were lots of shops and restaurants  We had breakfast both days at Morning Star Cafe which was inexpensive and the food was good but typical diner food  One thing we loved about it was that they serve breakfast all day for those late risers like us  The burgers and fries looked great too The other restaurant we ate at on nd Ave  was Zarela  The food here was some of the best Mexican cuisine Ive had Not typical enchiladas and tacos but they offered very inventive and fresh dishes  We also purchased some wine at the liquor store on nd and brought it back to our room  To get into midtown we took a cab which was under    We also purchased Grey Line Hop On Hop Off tickets and would walk to the U N  to get on it a few times  Just a hint on driving to the hotel   enter st Ave  at th St  or below  Make sure you stay in the center lane on st Ave  and go through the tunnel  Whatever you do dont keep left or you wont be able to get over to the right easily to make the right onto th St  Its an accident waiting to happen  From th make a right onto Beekman Pl  and then a right onto Mitchell Pl  The hotel will be the last building on your right on the corner of Mitchel and st  There are spaces for unloading  My GPS kept trying to take me on the FDR but I later realized I had it set for highways vs  local roads  I used my own common sense to get there anyway  
P => Great location good hotel Good hotel at a great price   and thats unusual for New York  Upket location close to the UN buildings  Quiet area in the evenings busy during the day  The hotel is very quiet we were on the th floor and heard no noise as long as the windows were closed  The staff were very helpful in every respect and the room was well maintained throughout our stay  We got clean towels every day and fresh bedding every other dayThe accommodation was very comfortable apart from a rather ancient sofa bed which was suffered by our dhter  The bedroom was well appointed and the bathroom very serviceable although small  The power shower was fantastic  It was great to have a small kitchen  It meant that we could bring take away food in rather than having to pay restaurant prices all the time  Speaking of restaurants theres a small restaurant across the road on the corner   we only found it on the last day and it would have been useful to have done so earlier The blueberry and banana yoghurt muffins at Tal Bakery up the road are to die for We had drinks and one breakfast in the Beekman Tower   well worth going up there for the amazing views  
P => Great Location Good and clean Well finding somewhere less expensive in New York is impossible if you want to stay in Manhattan  We booked this through expedia as it was on a hr sale and found the reviews were pretty accurate  It is a funky boutique hotel that is clean with huge rooms well ours was and a small bathroom not that that matters and the shower was EXCELLENT Location wise this hotel cannot be beat we walked everywhere from here or got the subway The area is lovely as its close the UN building the restaurants are plentiful and varied and lots of delis too plenty of places for breakfast  loved the location   go to the UN building and send a postcard with your photo on the stampI liked the hotel alot it was very clean and the staff were very polite it had everything we needed and it had the BEST sound proofed windows once we were in our room we couldnt hear New York at all which some people  not like Would definately stay here again 
P => My first visit to New York I stayed at the Beekman when visiting New York on business as it was very convenient for the UN building  This was my first experience of NY and I was hooked The building has an interesting history having been built for use by the Sororities of the US Womens Universities  It has an Art o look to it and it is still impressive in a city of skyscrapersThe receptionist was friendly must have been the Brit accent and the suite was more like a small apartment It was clean well furnished and each bedroom  had an en suite  The views were amazing looking out over the East River and the New York skyline The only real letdown was the hotel restaurantbar which was very expensive and very limited  We ided to forgo the views over the city and head into the neghbourhood where we found a nice Italian restaurant which I have since been back toThe hotel is just a few blocks away from Central Park and the Empire State Building and we felt quite safe walking to the latter at night  
P => Never been happier Visiting my dhter in the city with a few friends required a hotel stay  We were so pleasantly surprised with our stay  The trip started with one of the most wonderful drivers recommended by the staff picking us up at the airport ended this way too  But the middle was what counts  The staff treated us like we were royalty  I have stayed in far more elegant hotels but this establishment made us feel as though we were diplomats at the nearby United Nations  The location was great but I cannot say enough about the staff  I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat 
P => A Nice Stay We stayed two nights while in town to attend the Metropolitan Opera  The Beekman Tower located very near to the UN has a roof level restaurant with wonderful views of the city and the food while not Michelin star quality was fine  The hotel entryway and lobby are small and not outstanding but the room was fine  The room enters from the hallway onto a small kitchen that has a table and chairs  The bedroom was spacious enough and the bathroom was OK  It wasnt the Ritz but then the cost was quite reasonable for an NYC hotel  
P => Spacious Clean Great Location The hotel staff were both helpful and friendly  I was unsure of what the hotel would be like because it was cheaper than a lot of hotels  My concerns were put to rest when we entered our room  We had a studio which came with a small kitchen and a large room with a double bed and sofa  We had a great view from the th floor which looked out to the East river  The room was a bit dated but who cares it was clean and comfortable  We ordered room service for breakfast on our first day and were disapointed with how greasy it was also if you do ide to order breakfast make sure to buy your own juice and keep it in the fridge as the beverages on the menu were expensive  There is a small ket right across the street where be purchased bread eggs and fruit to make our own breakfasts for the rest of our stay  It was a great location the streets were very safe as they were mostly residential buildings and the doormen are always out front on the streets so you feel quite safe walking home at night especially for women  You are about a  minute walk to th ave and about a  minute walk to Times Square  I would stay here again and recomend it to anyone going to New York  
P => Served its purpose but wouldnt stay again A family of  adults and  teenages we were really looking forward to this hotel after seeing its website  We had just left the Sherton in Boston which is pristine and I thought things could only get better plus the Beekman Tower was art o in style  When we arrived and got to the room the or and furnishings looked really tired and it looked like it could do with another hovering  There was one double bed and a sofa bed which wasnt very comfortable  I was really very disappointed There was only one mirror in the room and that was in the bathroom so getting ready in the mornings took some time  The airconditioning was quite loud On a plus side it was good having a proper fridge and if I had wanted to cook I could have done  A bit of a walk to the centre but being in New York is all about experiencing the place so we didnt mind  The staff were polite and kind On reflection if the or and furnishing could be updated it would be a great hotel  For couples and families with small children 
P => A little out of the way but a good value If youre looking for a location in very close walking distance to the main tourist attractions in Manhattan this is probably not the best hotel as it is several blocks east of the beaten path  But the walk is only a few minutes through safe quiet residentialcommercial areas  There are restaurants and bars within a block or two that are worth checking out  The hotel is pretty quiet the rooms are the typical size found in Manhattan e g  a bit small and the staff is friendly  The rates seem to be pretty attractive for Manhattan  Our only complaint would be the poor bedding that was in our room as it was quite stiff  Aside from that I would definitely consider staying here again and would recommend it to others  
P => This should be a  star hotel This was the worst stay Ive had in New York  The room was dirty the furniture stained and thread bare  Ive read some of these other reviews and we must have stayed at different hotels  The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is its location  
P => Great Time I stayed here with my partner for  nights  We enjoyed excellent views on st Ave and the East River from our room on the st floor  Yes the interior seemed slightly dated and there was dust to be found here and there  But the real luxury was SPACE  We used our well fitted kitchenette every day and appreciated that there was a real table to sit down and have a coffee in the morning when planning our days  As an extra perk a free copy of the New York Times was delivered daily on our doorstep You shouldt stay here if you dont like walking getting to the main midtown spots takes about   mins on foot  To save us some of the walking we took the M bus several times  It serves the whole length of nd Street in both directions and starts from the UN just a couple of blocks down from the hotel The reception staff was extremely nice and helpful  When we enquired about taxis to Newark airport before our departure they recommended their hotel limousine service which turned out to be cheaper than hailing a cab in the street For us the Beekman was the perfect base for a great week in NY  
P => Good Hotel For the Price My Wife and I spent two nights at The Beekman Tower during a New York weekend getaway  PRO s The price  For two nights with taxes and everything ended up being around  Having done a lot of research this was a good deal for a hotel with ent reviews in NY  Size A lot of people reviewing other NYC hotels complained about the size  The room had a small kitchen and thus was bigger than most other NYC average hotel rooms reviewed on trip advisors  Location This might be a negative for some but for us it was nice to feel a little away from it all when we finally came back to the hotel to relax  The hot spots such as Broadway and Times Square are a little bit of a walk but my wife and I love to walk so it wasn t a big deal  Neighborhood Because the hotel is close to the United Nations the neighborhood has a lot of houses that serve as the office space for different countries missions to the UN  Just by walking around you can see many different countries represented with their flags out front  Around the hotel are restaurants and shops that are fun and a lot less pricey than Times Square or other NYC tourist hot spots  One of our favorites was Zip Burger  nd Street which tasted a lot like  Five Guys  for those who are familiar with that Mid Atlantic burger chain  Zip not only had great burgers and fries but shakes as well  Service and Staff We didn t order room service or have to much interaction with the staff  They were helpful in storing our baggage when we checked out and answering any questions  The hotel delivers a complimentary paper every morning to your roomCONSThe hotel has a worn feeling to it and yes a small lobby  The rooms are functional but could use a remodel getting new carpet and updated bathrooms etc  Some hotels have showers that feel inviting and leave you refreshed  The Beekman does not  The shower had problems with mold and the bathroom looks very worn out  TipsGetting Around Not being from NY it took a little while to get the swing of the subway system  The actual Subway stations don t give out free maps  We purchased a  Street St  NYC walking map and were able to get around great  It had all the streets in Manhattan and overlayed all of the metro stops  Little Italy is well  really little  This was probably our biggest disappointment as we thought that the neighborhood would have at least   blocks of great Italian restaurants and stores etc  What exists of little Italy these days are only a   blocks or so of mostly tourist focused restaurants and is not a full  neighborhood  at all  Broadway Tickets Like many visiting NY we took our chances and stood in line for half price theater tickets  www tdf org We were able to get   price tickets to see ry Poppins  The show was wonderful and the set was absolutely amazing  Bus Transportation to NY We traveled to NY via the DCNY bus  www DCNY com Two round trip tickets purchased on the internet cost  total which beats hands down driving gas parking fees and the NY  congestion tax  to get into the city  The ride up confirmed just about every stereotype you could have about taking the bus to NY  While still in DC the bus was clipped by another car which delayed us  Midway thru the trip the stench from the bathroom was overpowering  The driver finally cht wind of it all the way up front and got on the bus PA system and asked that someone go to the bathroom and flush it so the smell would hopefully go away  Finally the driver had bad directions and missed the exit  Some people on the bus who knew the route well started to flip out  We ended up being about  hours late  Those who had Mac s could also not use the wireless internet and one girl almost lost it when she couldn t log on  The ride down was the exact opposite  Fast efficient driver no weird smells from the bathroom and an on time schedule  So I guess it s a mixed bag with this company depending on the bus the driver and the bathroom being clean and functioning   Dinning We loved Serendipity www serendipity com It a very cozy unique restaurant that has great tasting food but above all amazing desserts  Because its so small seating can be a challenge  Since their was only two of us we were able to get in quicker  It can take awhile to accommodate larger groups  
P => Ideal Hotel for Midtown Adventures We stayed at the Beekman for two weeks in early  selecting it because of its proximity to the UN where my boyfriend had business  Overall we were very happy with the hotel  Location   The location is excellent  Its a quick walk to most midtown attractions but away from the touristy insanity of Times Square  We liked the many small delis grocers pubs and restaurants in the quiet area that surrounds the hotel particularly SipSak Turkish Cuisine the Manchester Pub and Buttercup Bakery all on nd Avenue between th and rd  Its also a short walk to Times Square and Little Brasil th between th and th and a rather longish walk to Restaurant Row in Hells Kitchen  The hotel is also only four blocks to the st Street Subway station which I took full advantage of in my explorations  There is also an uptown bus stop right outside the front door and an crosstown stop across the street  Using the metro or buses you can get anywhere in the five boroughs Staff   the staff were friendly and helpful  We didnt have any problems with our room although others who were attending the same event did and they were quickly and politely rectified  The kitchen was nice to have given the length of our stay  A few groceries from UN Gourmet across the street meant not having to eat breakfast out every morning and cold beer in the fridge at the end of a long day Room   We were in A and while yes the or is a bit tired the room was clean and comfortable  Ask for a higher floor when making a reservation  That way you can leave your window open at night without the noise and fumes from the street being unbearable Services   We didnt try the gym my boyfriend was working and I prefered to traipse around Manhattan for exercise  We did use the front desk and the doormen for dining and sightseeing information and they were very helpful Restaurants   We didnt eat at the Top of the Tower but its well worth the pricey cocktails for the view  We also didnt try room service  Actually the lack of a lobby lounge would be my only complaint about the Beekman  The Zephyr Bar and Grill was closed during our stay and some days we just wanted somewhere casual to regroup before heading out for the night Overall we had a great visit to NYC and would certainly choose the Beekman again  
P => The Beekman Tower has its advantages This hotel is in a good location next to the United Nations  It is a fairly easy walk to th Avenue and other midtown locations  There are lots of places to eat nearby The lobby was a disappointment  the Beekman Tower is an art o style hotel on the outside so we hoped for something more stylish  We were happy with the room  it was a one bedroom suite  My friend stayed in the bedroom and I took the pullout couch which was not bad  There was a nice bathroom and a full kitchen  The housekeeping staff was very attentive We did not try the restaurant but we did get room service and the pizza and burger we ordered were just fine  We brought our own wine and had fun hanging out in the room  We were so busy during the day we were very tired at night  The room was quiet enough we both slept fine The ugly old green carpet is still there which others have mentioned  The rest of the room was just fine for a three star hotel  
P => Good value hotel Stayed for  nights at this hotel in ch found it absolutely fine  It was a little on the old side or wise but comfortable and clean  Plus because you get a suite you get space to lounge on the sofa and watch tv which we tended to do most nights because we were so exhausted fromthe days sightseeing and the jet lag   we bought beer which we kept in the fridge in the kitchen and felt right at home coming back to relax after a hard day out The hotel is walking distance from most central NYC attractions eg     mins to ESB and near to tube for other sights  Dont miss the Nations diner across the road fantastic for breakfast and absolutely no need to look elsewhere  OK its not right on Times Square but we managed to walk everywhere and saw plenty that we wouldnt have if wed been right in the heart of the tourist area eg different restaurants shops etcAll in all a fine budget hotel with lots of comforts and a great base for exploring NYC 
P => Loads of Room While this hotel is slightly off the beaten path  block north of the United Nations   ie not close to the subway system   blocks and a hearty walk to the Theater district  blocks the room we had C was clean and spacious  Our hotel room had a King size bed in the bedroom a arate living room that included a dining room table and a small full kitchen and a great view of the city  We had more space than we knew what to do with for just the two of us  That said the or is definitely out dated and the carpet needs replaced  Not that it was too dirty to walk on just that it was green and looked like it was ready to retire  That said management will be in the process of remodeling the hotel soon  My only complaint is that we must have been close to the exhaust from the restaurant as we could smell food all the time  We overcame that by just keeping the windows slightly open and it was no big deal  Many of my other family members stayed at this hotel as well and the rooms varied some with more updated bathrooms than others but all had the same green carpeting and furnishings   If you chose to stay here and you dont like your room   just ask for a different one  The higher up you stay the better the view  I would definitely come back to this place with my kids as having the spacious rooms and a kitchen would be a MUST  This hotel has a ton of potential and I am sure the price of these suites will be a lot higher once it is re done  So take advantage of this hotel while you can Also dont forget to stop up on the th floor for a drink at the restaurant as the view is amazing but not its food  
P => A few bucks and the place would be  star I stayed at the Beekman on a Friday night  Because its on the far east side there is typically safe and free street parking all weekend  Thats worth  right there  It is also away from the NYC night life so it was relatively quiet at night  Thats good because its not a high rise where you need to be above the th floor to get away from the noise and lights  I was upgraded to a large suite which is basically a one bedroom apt  Like many NYC apts the bathroom and kitchen which I didnt use were small  The carpet was about  years past replacing  Except for the shower head the bathroom was about  years past due for an upgrade but it was clean  The TVs there were  were old but not so old that there were channel change knobs but close  There was a dining room table large enough to seat  which I think was put there to fill the large living room  The couch was something out of a s movie  If the owners put about  into the suite it would equal or exceed the better hotels of NYC  
P => Rave reviews for the staff Our dhter is a freshman at Columbia University and we have been experimenting with different hotels in an attempt to find a hotel that we can depend on when we come to the city for visits  The Beekman Tower which we found from a Hotwire email promotion has ended our search  I booked a studio queen for night over a weekend  When we arrived there was some confusion at the front desk because there was a staff person in training and she entered our name without the O so the printout she asked me to sign had the wrong room rate  The manager on duty Chris Brown was hovering nearby and was quick to jump in help her resolve the problem without embarassing her and for our quottroublequot upgraded us to a king bedded suite with a full kitchen dining area living area two bathrooms       and a view I had been kidding him about how we wanted a view knowing full well that we had gotten an internet deal and were probably going to be relegated to the nd floor and he had been reviewing the room availability with the trainee and told me before the error that he could put us on the th floor  When the error was discovered he did not backpedal at all gave us a great room for the same price           in fact when we ided to extend our stay over Sunday night he graciously honored our discount rate for that night           and if youve read this website for other hotels before that rarely happens  In addition to this the doorman advised us on Saturday night that we didnt need to pay xxx to park our car in the garage that the city allowed overnight parking on the street in front of the hotel from Sat until  am on Monday and telling us exactly when he was on duty so we knew our car wasnt being quotguardedquot the entire time saving us easily       the restaurant at the top of the hotel is just ok but the view is worth the concession in dinner            unless its your only night I definitely wouldnt waste a meal on this restaurant unless I had one to spare  We had had a late lunch with our dhter after a track meet so my husband and I went up to the restaurant later in the evening and had drinks and their sampler plate from the appetizer menu and it was fine  Oh and did I mention that the doorman remembered our name the next time he saw us after saving us the parking fee we did tip him  but not enough that I would have expected this treatment he acknowledged us by name  All in all well be staying here every time we visit our dhter      assuming of course we get the same great rate but not expecting the triple upgrade every time   though it would be nice  
P => Loved the Beekman My husband and I have just returned from New York and stayed at the Beekman Hotel  The occasion was my my birthday and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel The room was spacious with two large wardrobes and the kitchen area had fridge for the beers and wine coffee and machine for the morning after and plenty of towels in the bathroom We ate at the Top of the Tower restaurant on my birthday and had a really good meal  We didnt drink in the bar but it looked lively and the views from this place are fantastic The location of the hotel is great   Eastside is full of restaurants and quirky little places  You just have to do a bit of walking to find them  Lasagne italian restaurant served fab lasagne and the Irish bar Pig and Whistle serves good food too Breakfast at the Nations cafe across the road is really good and sets you up for the days sightseeing and shopping We were asked if we would like a car back to the airport and this was arranged by the bell hop  A yellow cab in was  including toll charges which is a set price from JFK to Manhattan  However they charge on the meter going back so can be expensive  We took up the offer of a car from the hotel and for the same price we went back in style in a limo  
P => Mixed bag I m not really sure how to rate the Beekman Tower Hotel because there were things about it I liked and the things that detracted from our stay  not bother other guests  First things first the hotels just north of the UN and yes there is a bit of a walk to the st Street subway  But the M goes along nd Avenue inbound and st Avenue outbound which was a big timesaver  There isn t a heck of lot right in the immediate vicinity   it s mostly residential   but it was quiet  We did not make it up to the th floor for a drink but the view from our st floor suite was pretty cool I booked the hotel for two nights after finding a Travelzoo special  for a studio queen and it was quite a deal   a roughly  sq ft  space with a arate full kitchenette including a dishwasher stove wine glasses etc  dining area bedroom and private bath  There s a convenience store across the street for breakfast fixings the hotel provides the free NY Times each day for your lingering over coffee enjoyment  So whats the problem Well I have an allergy to dust mites and haven t had a flare up for over a year  Ive since stayed in hotels without incident but for each of the two nights at Beekman my symptoms kept me awake and unable to sleep  On my second night NyQuil knocked me out for five hours but that was about it  I woke up again with the same symptoms Also our room was just too warm and the fancooler function wasn t working  We alerted the front desk to this and the concierge left a message with the maintenance staff but as far as I know this remained unfixed during our stay  Once we found that the windows opened though we got around the problem that way   we left one window open about  inches during the day kept it open during the night and things were better I did not have this issue before going to NYC which leads me to suspect that perhaps the room was not as clean as it looked on the surface  I m reluctant to say that because I could be very wrong and what I experienced was a fluke the bed linens certainly  looked  clean but I m at a loss to explain why my symptoms flared up when they did  They subsided when we returned home  Perhaps the sheets were fine but the mattress was too old   my husband complained of a sag on his side I know that hotel rooms are never fully clean and its caveat emptor  But its too bad because otherwise this is a very good value for NYC  YMMV  
P => Good value good location   a good choice Stayed here one night for business  For the price I got via Hotwire  and change I cannot complain  Location is fine east midtown if you dont mind being a bit of a walk from the real midtown hotspots Room was much larger that what I am accustomed to with NYC hotels and had a kitchenette  It was not fabously orated or anything like that but that was not something I needed  I found it clean and quite Front desk staff was quite helpful  I grabbed a drink in the bar at the top of the hotel  Fabulous views of the city  I would not recommend if you are looking for a honeymoon or other highly romantic or special once in a lifetime desintation hotel   but for a quality reasonably priced hotel in Midtown this is a good option  
P => Beekman Tower   Fantatic My husbard dhterboyfriend stayed at Beekman Tower for nights  uary   It was our dhters birthday present to go to New York and shop The Beekman Tower hotel was brilliantly placed   a short walk down th to the shops et al  We had two suites which we had been upgraded on and they were perfect for our stay  We ate in the restaurant on our first evening due to being too tired from the flight and we were not disappointed  The view is fantastic from the th Floor Cocktail lounge  We actually used this facility every night before we retired really the view is breathtaking Our room was furnished comfortably and the bedding and towels were changed every dayStaff were very accommodating and our bellboy was a hoot  My dhter is saving to go back later this year and she is planning on staying here again This accommodation is priced correctly and I would highly recommend it  Also just across the street is the UN Cafe   superb breakfastsEnjoy  
P => Fantastic Hotel   great value Where do I start I thought this hotel before we went would be just be a typicl value for money type hotel as we got a great deal  And before I start properly I should say that a hotel room is fine for me if it is comfortable clean and functional as we spend very little time in a hotel room when on holiday as were too busy out exploring This hotel was just that functional comfortable and clean but you can also add Spacious with a huge extremely comfortable bed great maid service great room service menu great hairdryer at most hotels you usually get some tiny thing masquerading as a hairdryer but not in the Beekman erate kitcheneating area lounge area with tv prompt courteous service I waited around a minute to be bought additional pillows and a hairdryer and a great power shower in a clean bathroom The shower is awesome  insignificant things please meThe location was fine for me granted it wasnt slap bang in the centre of Manhattan but we like a walk and you can get a taxi to most places in Manhattan for less that  plus tip  It took us ten minutes to walk to the Rockerfella centre and a further five to reach Times Square  It also takes around  minutes to walk to Grand Central to take the subway to most places on the island  Side note   if you want a very very central hotel this might not be for you but if you dont mind a few short walks then its fine But nearby there was the UN Diner opposite for great value breakfasts as well as a grocery store if you wanted to take any food back to the hotel and an off licence We found a great little irish bar McCanns on st which was really friendly and very cheap for a few drinks two minutes walk on st Avenue just up from the hotel   head northwards Theres also lots of nice restaurants on th street as you walk towards Rockerfella centre The best part of this hotel is the lovely restaurant at the quotTop of the Towerquot serves food till pm and drinks till am  If you like great food and drink good service fantastic nighttime views over Manhattan and a great environment then make sure you use the restaurant at least one night if you can The queue of people before us as we checked out all complimented the hotel on check out When we return to New York in the future we will be staying at the Beekman and I highly recomment others do too  
P => Mixed bag at the Beekman Tower The room was very large for an NYC hotel room   a suite with a arate bedroom and living area with a sofa bed and a kitchenette  The room furnishings were in poor condition  The first thing I saw when I walked into the room was the sight of a sofa with stained fabric and frayed piping around the cushions  Having booked on Hotwire not knowing what I was getting myself into I worried that I really went wrong  Fortunately the bathroom and bedding were clean  Staff were helpful and friendly  I would consider a stay again as the price and location were good and the room would be good for a family stay as kids could sleep in one room and parents in the other  But if you want a room with nice furnishings I would suggest that you choose another hotel  
P => A NY rarity   a superb value hotel My wife and I recently stayed for a short break over the holiday period  We booked several months in advance and got a great rate  We could not have been happier with the Beekman  The hotel is located on st Ave near the UN building  Its an easy pleasant walk to th Ave  Rockefeller Centre and everything in Midtown  Plenty of taxis stream past the hotel if you prefer  A nearby diner and local restaurants kept us well fed The room had a kitchen bathroom large wardrobe and a sofa   it was great to be able to sit down other than on the bed after a day walking around The Cocktail Bar the top of the tower offered great views of the river and across into Brooklyn  The tinis were fearsomely strong As a frequent traveller to NY in the past the Beekman represented something new and surprising  It was quiet clean the rooms were large the staff pleasant and friendly and excellent value for money  I will use the hotel again A few niggles   the carpet in the hotel could do with replacing and the TV was also showing signs of age  But otherwise it was perfect  
P => Perfect for the Price  Stayed here with my husband over Christmas and what a treat Not only was the room a very good size for Manhattan hotel it was spotlessly clean spacious comfortable and importantly quiet  It was an ideal location for us a few blocks from the hustle of Mid Town with a great diner opposite fantastic cocktails on the top floor of the hotel and just a friendly hotel in a good neighbourhood  Ive stayed in NY for over many years and this is one of the best hotels  Try it 
P => Wow what a Room I went with a group to New York to tour the United Nations  The UN was a few blocks away The room was huge with a kitchen living room and bedroom  Everything was clean and comfortable  The lounge on the top floor is the perfect place to have a drink and relax  A cab to time square is only    Perfect place for a New York vacation  Stop by the Pressbox Bar a few blocks down and have a drink with bartender Shawn and the doorman great conversation and drinks 
P => Loved the Beekman   Old School Class The Beekman was amazing  We stayed in a  bedroom suite with a great view  We got the room for only  a night last minuteIt is not located in the centre of tourist Manhatten but I found this refreshing  After staying near Times Square and participating in the tourist life it was nice to come across to what felt like a more residential area  The restaurants nearby were quaint and we felt it was a very safe area  An enjoyable stay and a great end to a NY holiday  
P => Id stay there again The front desk guy was really helpful and accommodating  We checked in late so there wasnt a room with a view left but he put us in a room that had little street noise our nd preference  The view was of the building next door not great but at least it wasnt noisy  We only stayed one night and the bed was comfortable the room was clean and the showerheads had pretty good water pressure  We had the one bedroom suite and I used my credit card points for it  Although I had a good experience I wouldnt pay over  a night including taxes and fees  The location was pretty good also  We walked to the theatre district and it was a pretty nice stroll even with my heels on  
P => No Real Downside Just got back from NY   stayed  nights at the Beekman Tower Hotel  No real problems at all  The rooms are basic but clean with a handy kitchen area  We had  chaps in one room and requested an extra bed which was provided  On th street and st Avenue which is close enough to the action and when you are on the th floor you dont hear too much of the traffic noise in the early mornings Use the cabs   not expensive and you can get one in seconds    in New York I believe  Also the underground  for  days unlimited travel   great idea and beats the buses Iris bars everywhere    round the corner   good food in Clancys and The Jameson   better booze selection too The Beekman is a good base and from what I hear unless you want to pay serious money you wont do much better 
P => worst hotel poorest service in new york city The WORST hotel Ive ever stayed in  A lifetime traveller and someone who frequently stays in New York hotel I ended up in this pit after my usual was booked  The staff has an attitude  The front desk manager a man named Chris who must have graduated from the Al Queda School of Personality Dynamics is without a doubt the most hostile service employee I have ever encountered  In  a New York hotel where the heat television and internet doesnt work I spent nearly two hours on the phone trying to get online and complaints about heat and television resulted in NOTHING  At nearly  a night I would have done better sleeping in a cab for the night and it would have been a whole lot cheaper  There should a college course entitled quotHow Not to Treat Guests   a Case Study of the Beekman Tower Hotel quotIn a word DONT  
P => Beekman needs a facelift I had higher hopes for the Beekman based on other Trip Advisor reviews  This hotel hovers just above the acceptable level  It is true that the suites offer plenty of space for a family of four to spread out  theres a large living room with TV and a arate bedroom for parents also with TV  The bathroom is off of the bedroom and is rather small  And while the bathroom was clean enough it lacked the nicer fixtures and amenties that Sheratons Westins and other chains have to offer  The sink filled with water quickly and we had to be careful not to cause a flood  The entire suite was in desperate need of a makeover  The fabrics are dated and dreary the wallpaper peeling and the carpet a bit thin and stained in places  It was warm in NYC during our visit and the AC in the bedroom did not work at all  A large portable AC unit sat in the bedroom but the remote control did not cause it to turn on  We were able to open windows but of course the noise of the traffic on st Avenue made it difficult to sleep  The bed was far from the comfy quotheavenlyquot sort that so many hotels offer these days  And the linens and the quotvelluxquot like blanket were far from luxurious  There was some sort of dried matter on the bedroom blanket  better not to think about what that might have been The suite had a dated kitchenette with a sticky handle on the refrigerator door and a long dark hair sitting on the countertop  again not exactly appealing  I stay at the Beekman based on my companys arrangement with the hotel but I would not stay at the Beekman if I had a choice 
P => Great Hotel   a bit far from centre We wanted a one bedroom suite for our stay and the Beekman looked ideal   plus we got a very reasonable rate  On arrival we were initially a bit disappointed as wed imagined the room would be a little bigger from photos wed seen but our stay there was actually great  We were on the th floor and had good views of NY city   quite spectacular at night Sofabed was a bit uncomfortable for our son but we put mattress on floor and it was perfect   the maid made it up there for us too Our suite was beautifully cleaned every day   sheets towels etc  Having our own kitchenette was ideal and theres a grocery store conveniently across the street  Only downside was its distance from everything   subway is  minutes away so we either walked to most places about     minutes to Times Sq or tried to get taxis  Walking was fine but if you factor in that you then walk around any sight youre going to see as well             we were getting a bit tired of the commute by the end of our  days there  Recommend Nations Cafe across the road for fantastic American breakfastsLasagna restaurant at th and nd for fab lasagne Top of the Tower at Beekman has great views but is expensive 
P => An old class pearl We had a perfect romantic getaway there before our son was born  The location is good views fantastic at least from the upper floors and the rooms comfortable quite home like apartments  And we just loved the Sky Bar on the top 
P => Art o Agree with all other reviews   nice hotel huge rooms complete with dining rooms and kitchen in a quieter and pleasant area of the city thats handy for central locations  Great Staff slightly stand offish though but isnt that the NYC stereotype Great place Air conditioning convenience shops nearby and close to the UN building   stories of a good hotel  
P => Fantastic UN Location Friendly helpful Reception and Portersa must is the great views from th Top of Tower but as all food has to come from st floor dont expect the food to matchor servicereasonably priced especially given location though this  change when reations currently underway are completedanimal friendlymyself and many colleagues found the airconditioning noisy andor ineffectivethe inroom kitchen facilities are great esp if one is staying awhile the internet service is very poor another must is the art o including the brickwork in the East Tower lobbyrooms large and clean 
P => Perfect location and accommodation We are a family of  from West Midlands England  Just returned from  days in NYC  The trip was to celebrate our eldest sons st and we were joined by our  year old son  The Beekman more than matched our expectations  We had stayed in NYC on a previous visit in Times Square vicinity  Much preferred Beekman location  Quieter but with good restaurants within a few blocks  Yes there is no subway station close but it is only a  minute walk to Grand Central Terminal  Room very large kitchen very welcome particularly the fridge in height of summer  The UN diner opposite very good for breakfasts  Check in very prompt good service and bellman so helpful on last day with luggage and transportation to airport etc Would definitely recommend the Beekman after this experience  
P => Fantastic view from top of the tower Fantastic views from the cocktail bar at the top of the tower  Hotel was a few blocks to nearest subway but if you purchased a weekly subway ticket you could make use of the buses  Suite was large and well stocked if a little shabby  Quiet area but quite a few ent restaurantsbars in the vicinity  If ever in New York again would use this hotel however beware of costs to park car whilst in NY   could rent a hotel room in some other cities for the cost of a nights parking  
P => Brilliant Value for Money   Highly Recommend Booked this hotel through lastminute com after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor  We paid about   per night for a one bedroomed suite which was huge with a sitting room which had a sofa bed a fully equipped kitchen with dishwashermicrowavefridge freezeroven amp hob there was a arate bedroom and bathroom  Although the or was tired the room was immaculately clean with the cleaner even washing up the cups and glasses we had left in the sink during the day  The staff were very friendly and helpful  The Beekman was within easy walking distance of fifth avenuecentral park and all the museumsshops  Also lots of lovely little restaurants nearby including a brilliant curry house   Indigo   on th and nd  Would not recommend eating in hotel but worth visiting top floor for cocktails and the view  Excellent diner and deli across the road  Also worth using the hotel car service  for a stress free and comfortable trip back to JFK  Would definitely stay there again  
P => Amazing View We stayed in a suite on the th floor of the Beekman  The furniture and or seemed to be newer less than  years old but was in less than great shape  The carpet was stained and there was a tear in the couch  Air conditioner didnt work  I never bothered to tell the staff because the weather was mild and we didnt really need it  Sucks to be the next guy who stays in that room if its hot outside  The remote control didnt work  Other than that the place is great for the money  The suite offered two balconies overlooking Uptown with a fantastic view  The staff was great and the elevators were very speedy  The hotel is in a great neighborhood with Trump Tower and the U N  within walking distance  Id like to point out where to eat and shop in the area but everything is good That and the businesses there change hands often so even if I did point out a good restaurant it will probably be under new management by time you get there  
P => Surpassed our expectations We spent three nights mid week at the Beekman and would go back in a New York minute Our Studio Suite on the th floor was roomy and clean with a full kitchen including a microwave and dishwasher  Even though we arrived before the official check in time we got a warm reception from the staff who instantly allowed us to use the fitness room to freshen up from the boiling New York heat  A nighttime visit to the cocktail bar on the th floor is a must Well recommend the Beekman to friends and family and it will be our top choice next time were in NYC  Tip Try the Thai restaurant around the corner on st Avenue for lunch  Prices were dirt cheap and the food was velous  
P => Going back to the Beekman My wife and  year old dhter spent one night in a one bedroom suite at the Beekman Tower in   We enjoy taking short weekend trips to Manhattan for fun whenever we are able to get a good price on airfare  We booked the hotel through the Affinia com website as this hotel was part of the Affinia hotel group at the time we booked out trip for   We requested and got a high floor room with a balcony  The vistas from our balcony on the th floor were spectacular   almost unobstructed views of the river and Queensborough bridge  The one bedroom suite had plenty of space  The bedroom was a little small but not for Manhattan  The livingdining area was huge double the size of the bedroom and had a half bath  It was big enough to house two fold out sofas and they both could have been folded out at the same time with no problem  This was a huge room  The kitchen was functional and clean  The location is great as others have said  Its in a quiet part of town but the walks to tourist and business areas are very reasonable  The things others have said about the furniture being merely functional and a little on the older side are true  That said we are going back to the Beekman very soon for a two night stay  We found the hotel to be very clean and comfortable and the ability to have a child or children sharing the same space without being in the same bedroom with the parents is a real plus for the Beekman and for several hotels owned by the Affinia group  It appears that the Beekman is no longer associated with the Affinia group as it is no longer possible to book a room at the Beekman via the Affinia website  We are hoping that the quality of the property is at least equal to the quality when it was an Affinia hotel  I think a lot of people dont understand the Manhattan hotel scene and this gets reflected when they write reviews of Manhattan properties  A hotel suite the size of a one bedroom at the Beekman or at the Affinia Manhattan where weve also stayed that was orated to the standard of a luxury hotel would easily cost twice as much on a good day when you got your best deal  More often the rate would be three times as much  Check around and you will see that this is true  I would guess the one bedroom we stayed in at the Beekman was around  or be even  square feet total  There are many many hotels in the same price range in Midtown that offer  or so square feet of space for the same money as a large one bedroom suite at the Beekman  If you pay a ent rate for the Beekman you are getting a lot for your money  
P => Excellent  bedroom suite for  I saw the hotel advertised on Travelzoo a few months ago at tax and booked it immediately for y th  The hotel was very nice and the location on the east side was about  blocks from the fireworks  There is a nice diner across the street and several restaurants nearby  The  bedroom suite on the th floor was spacious and very clean like a small apartment in NYC  The room has a kitchenette with a gas stove and a fridge  The bed and couch were comfortable  All the windows open about  inches for fresh air  Parking was  but I easily found free parking on the street just  blocks away  The bathroom is small but who cares  I would definitely stay here again  Also a nice rooftop bar  Make sure you put your do not disturb sign on the door I forgot and was woken up at am by housekeeping  There is not subway stop nearby the closest is about a  minute walk  
P => Good Value for the most part Just returned from a five night stay with my husband and son  I agree that the rooms are a little dated but the one bedroom suite was comfortable for a family  At first I was appalled at the condition of the plaid sofa as it was heavily stained and so was the adjacent coffee table  But in the true spirit of a New York survivor I grabbed a few sheets from a housekeeping cart and draped it over the couch   After that it was smooth sailing and quite comfortable for our family  True the kitchen and bathroom are on the old side but very clean and very functional  Staff was very friendly however not knowledgeable about the immediate area  All in all the value was good for NYC  Average cost was  a night  I saw many families checking in and out and nothing but smiles The doormen and bell staff were awesome and seemed to run the show in the lobby  A good experience  I didnt expect perfection on our family budget  Cathy Arizona 
P => Service Beyond Belief Our car was in front of the hotel waiting for the valet to pick up when a suitcase rolled down the sidewalk and hit the car  knocked a quarter size piece of paint off the fender and a big dent  ive had experiences before where valets have done damage to my car and denied everything  Kathi Suprek the hotel manager told me what happened and took responsibilty  Knock me over with a feather  I got an estimate and they sent me a check right away  We booked a one bedroom suite and they are huge  ask for a high room views are great  fully furnished kitchen  my son lives in manhattan and it was bigger than his apartment  Top of the Tower is great  
P => Very good stay I stayed at the Beekman in ruary for five nights in a one bedroom suite for a very reasonable price The suite was very big size of a small apartment and spotless clean  The kitchen was fully equipped the room had a second tv    Staff was friendly and very helpful  The location is good for tourists and business  I absolutely recommend the Beekman  
P => Surprisingly good for Manhattan My wife and I stayed at the Beekman Tower in a studio suite with queen bed and kitchenette on the th floor suite B for four nights starting Saturday il    The costs AAA discounted rate per each night were     chronologically coming to  plus   taxes total    This was a surprisingly good place to stay considering what Manhattan lodging normally offers for this price The location of this hotel is reasonably good being centrally located north to south though not as central east to west with the nearest subway station being a  minute walk away at  St  amp  Ave   This area is relatively less bustling it felt safe and there are fine restaurant choices within a few minutes  walk  The building is a lovely  story Art o tower with a bar on the top floor offering wonderful views  It should be noted though that those not buying drinks are strongly discouraged from partaking of the views private parties often render this barobservatory unavailable to the general public and just two tiny drinks will leave one feeling light walleted by   Three elevators in the small lobby yielded wait times of no more than a minute or so  The staff we encountered during our visit were knowledgeable competent and rather friendly and courteous by big city standards  Although we discovered as we went to check out that we could have had a complimentary newspaper delivered to our suite each day had someone mentioned we could request it The good sized suite roughly  x  feet had a living roombedroom area with TV coffee table sofa two night stands by the queen bed clockradio a large dresser two windows which could be opened   though with some difficulty and a roughly  x  foot closet with a safe operated by a key  The bathroom was modest in size roughly  x  feet with almost no counter space but one large cabinet under the sink a tub with shower and a full flow shower head and there were the typical U S  midlevel hotel towels amp toiletries including body gel lotion soaps hair drier and as a pleasant surprise both conditioning shampoo and regular shampoo  The kitchenette roughly  x  feet included a small microwave small fridge utensils plates etc  a counter and two stools sink and range  All amenities in the suite were functioning properly during the time of our stay  We had a fine view of the East River and U N  We heard no sounds from neighboring suites and almost no street noise The only negative comments I wish to pass on are that there is no computer available here to check in and print boarding passes and the heat in the room was almost uncontrollable from within the suite and it was too warm  We either did not look for air conditioning or could not find it or it did not work I do not recall  So we kept the windows open  
P => could have been better Hotel room is very roomy but the upkeep is lacking  Rooms airconditioning was not sufficient to cool the room in summer and there was no hair dryer in the room  a feature that I expect in any american hotel The roof top bar is nice and worth a visit  
P => Started awful improved later on Stayed in this hotel in mid il for  nights At the beginning we were given a smoking room which was incredibly stinky so we barely could breathe there  It was also freezing though the window was closed and very very noisy cars trucks and there were some dirty towels and hair in the toilet It was also pretty small TV was inside a closet which open door blocks the entrance to bathroomWe complained but the reception said they are sold out so they cant do anything this night and they will try to move us to another room the next day In the meantime the housekeeping lady came replaced only  towel  and sprayed some spray against smoking that helped for  min Since it was impossible to stay in the room we spent half a night walking in the street and sitting in the lobby complaining again to every reception shift about this horrible experience The next day the manager came and indeed moved us to a non smoking clean  quiet and very big room with much nicer view and we stayed in this room the rest of the trip The stay in this room was much better the only minus was that not always housekeeping brought new soapshampoo though the one in the room was over  Luckily we also brought our own soap and shampoo   In overall all rooms have an old rug that is woren and the toilet seat also seems like needs to be replaced The location of the hotel is OK but not great    min  walk from UN its around  th and st Ave which means about  min  walk to  th ave and about  min walk to metro  
P => Loved the Beekman WE had a lovely one bedroom suite that came with a tidy little kitchen  Would have been comfortable staying there for a month They have a great exercise room and the staff was extremly accomodating  There are tons of good places to eat closeby but still away from the tourist traps in mid town  Only a short walk from Grand Central the UN Waldorf Saks and many other sites  We cant wait to go back  
P => Spacious and clean My husband and I took a short weekend getaway to NYC and found a great deal in one of their suites on Hotels com  Although we were on the th floor with no great views of the city we were very impressed with the size of the suite  Tall ceilings and three large windows lined one of the walls  There was lots of open space in the living room  Furnishings were older but tasteful  We were pleasantlysurprised with a kitchen but it didnt get much use as we were only there for two nights  Hotel staff were friendly  no major problems  No problems with noise Rooftop restaurant for dessert and drinks was nice but not incredibly impressive  It was a nice place to stay in a ent location  The hotel is about  blocks from th Avenue  Its a bit of a walk to the nearest subway  But its NYC   you should expect to walk unless you are planning on taking taxis everywhere which can get quite expensive  Negatives The heaters wouldnt turn off in all the rooms  So   we left a couple windows cracked open and the temperature was fine  Bed was on the hard side  not really comfortable for us  Id recommend the hotel suite for families or couples on a longer vacation  If you are looking for a good deal  ent and spacious place to stay this would be your place  If you are looking for luxury and amazing views you can find better hotels to stay at in NYC  
P => Very Good My wife and I have just spent a pleasant long weekend at the Beekman Tower hotel  We requested a quiet high floor and were given C which is near the top of the building with small balconies from the bedroom and living room  The suite was clean and well furnished  The service was excellent although the lobby is inadequate to handle the traffic at peak times and the front desk while efficient and courteous was perhaps understaffed at the height of the check incheck out times  Even so the staff were courteous and highly professional in coping with the situation  The location is pleasant and the immediate area seemed safe and quotresidentialquot but a rather longish walk or short taxi trip to the centre of the shopping or theatre districts  In short a good place to stay and certainly recommended if you dont need to be within shouting distance of Times Square  The building itself is of some interest and there are some excellent images and historical references to be found at      
P => Nice hotel especially for the price This was a nice clean hotel with a curteous and helpful staff  Our room had a queen sized bed a full bath and a pretty good sized kitchen in the next room  It was a little dated but clean and the room was ent sized especially for the city  The neighborhood was fine and you could walk to Rockefeller center in about   minutes  It was a bit of a walk to metro stops about   blocks but that was only an issue when it was raining  You could also easily catch a taxi on st Ave directly in front of the hotel  There was a small grocery right across the street which was great since we had the kitchen and a large drugstore pizza place and deli within  blocks Overall we had a nice stay and were especially impressed with how nice it was for the price we got it at about night which is great for that caliber hotel in Manhattan  
P => Great Value I booked a last minute overnight on Priceline for  and hadnt heard of the Beekman until my offer was accepted  We were upgraded toa HUGE suite on the nd floor complete with great views an outdoor patio kitchen dining room  bathrooms and  closets Were accustomed to overpriced TINY NYC hotels so this was a welcome change  Although the place could use an update Id rather live with the furnishings from yesteryear and pay these low prices any day The bed was comfortable but the shower pressure was weak  One minor complaint my husband wanted to use the rooms Wi Fi and called downto the desk for instructions but the woman he spoke with didnt knowwhat he was talking about  We learned that Wi Fi use costs  per day    a major ripoff  Other than that we were very pleased  The rooftop bar was great  
P => Good hotel with an ok location We stayed at the Beekman at then end of ch for  nights  The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable  The location was ok attractions are within walking distance  
P => Great Value and location We booked the Beekman for  nights at an incredible rate for this area of Manhattan  The room was a one bedroom suite with a kitchen that was well equipped  Comfortable accommodation although a little tired The Top of The Tower barrestaurant is worth a visit in the evening for a  degree view across the city  Expensive drinks but you have to do itThe Nations Diner across st Avenue is a must for breakfast  Excellent choice for vegetarians loads to eat and very reasonably priced  It will set you up for the day The metro is nearby for trips further a field China Town Little Italy and Battery Park for the ferries to Liberty and Ellis Islands  You can also walk to the main shopping areas  However instead of always heading west go  block east to the river  You can have a wonderful view across to Queens and further south to Brooklyn All in all highly recommended  
P => Great hotel great price My husband and I took a trip to NYC to celebrate my birthday and our first wedding anniversary  I found the Beekman online and got a price of nt through Travelzoo  We were very happy with the hotel  we booked a studio suite and loved the huge kitchen and bedroom  The bathroom was small but not terrible  Everything was spotlessly clean  The bedspread and curtains are a bit dated but nothing out of the ordinary  The kitchen was nicely stocked with a toaster pans silverware can opener dishwasher dishsoap towels plates glasses and wine glasses  Lots of drawers and several large closets in the room as well The front desk staff was friendly and check in was easy  We checked out at noon on our last day and left our luggage there all day  We took a car service to an airport hotel in the evening  It cost us  to get to a JFK airport hotel but we took the trip in a nice Lexus towncar with a very friendly driver  I recommend asking the front desk about the car service if you need transport to the airport  Our only problem was trying to find the hotel on our first night there  The taxi driver didnt know where it was and I didnt have the cross streets  We probably went past  times before we found it  The sign for the hotel is small too  Take the cross streets not just the address Its a great location for sightseeing  About  blocks from the UN a little further from other things but the subway is not too far away  We did a lot of walking and felt that we were in a good location to see everything  There are lots of stores and food nearby so you will be well fed  Definitely stay there if you have the chance 
P => Better than expected Just returned from a week stay in the hotel  Everything excellent large room we had five windows in our studio apartment Extremely quiet overlooking gardens in a side part of the hotel  Only one other room on our corridor so everything was silent apart from the gurgling heater but as the room was very warm switching it off remedied this  Very clean fresh fluffy towels every day fresh stocks of toiletries and tea and coffee provided daily  Full size gas cooker and good size fridge and freezer  Handy for deli Nations cafe good cheap breakfast open from six am until late wine and liquor store and frequent buses to almost everywhere  Would certainly book to go there again  
P => Superb Value Got a great deal at this hotel through a Travelzoo offer and were pleased to see the room was huge and actually rather nice  Location was ok too about a  minute walk from Grand Central Station and only a  minute walk from a nearer subway  The bar at the top of the hotel was good for a nightcap on one the of the nights we were there with a stunning night time view over Roosevelt Island etc  Defintely recommend  
P => Great Place To Stay My husband amp I stayed at the Beekman from  th for four nights  Having been initially disappointed with the fact that we were staying in an annexe to the main hotel same building different entrance doors we were pleasantly surprised the one bedroomed suite was excellent very spacious good size living room small but adequate kitchen good size bedroom and well stocked bathroom  Spotlessly clean maid service every day fresh towels and linen daily  Yes its a   minute walk to th avenue but on our return after hectic days out it was a relief to get back to a quiet neighbourhood   removed from the hustle and bustle of the city centre  Views from the Top of the Tower are spectacular   even if the bar itself is extremely expensive From the moment you walk through the hotel doors all the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful  We would DEFINITELY stay there again   though I notice the rates have soared since we booked  Well done all at the Beekman  
P => Superb value for money My partner and I stayed at the Beekman for  days in uary  for our first trip to NYC  Hotel accommodation in the city does not come cheap and when we found this hotel offering a one bedroom apartment for  nights for just   we couldnt say no  Its true that the interior isnt designed by Philippe Starck and no its not on Times Square but what this hotel does offer is space value for money and a ent location  We were in a room on the fifth floor with a view of another building and the back gardens of some neighbours  The room was a good size with sofa table and chairs with a well equipped kitchen off the living room along with a bedroom with en suite  I didnt think that the or was that dated it looked like a number of riotts Ive stayed in warm floral colours nothing too offensive  As other reviewers have mentioned the Top of the Tower is a good spot for a cocktail or two we didnt eat there but we did see the food and it looked pretty run of the mill for the prices being charged  Location wise it is a bit of a walk into the heart of Manhatten but we walked to Times Square in about  minutes  We would recommend getting a travel pass and using the public transport  A weeks ticket was about  and gave us access to the bus and the underground  Theres a bus stop directly opposite the hotel that takes you straight across Manhatten easy Finally it certainly looks like the Beekmans low rates have been discovered by many as when we were there the hotel was fully booked most nights  However the hotel never felt frantic and we appreciated coming back to the peace and quiet of st Avenue after the excitement of a day in NYC  
P => Good hotel soso location This is a fine hotel the in room facilities are very good but they could use some remodeling  Old Microwave old stove  The room is very clean and has a very nice space if you choose the one bedroom unit  Some disappointing issues The  bedroom floorplan indicated that the main room and the living room that had a sofa bed would share a bathroom that would stay in between the both rooms  Actually the bathroom were inside the main room if our third friend had come she would have to go into our room each time she needed to use the bathroom  The hotel has a  oclock check in time policy  As they were full  I had to wait untill  oclock to check in  It is a bit to odd to have to check out by  and check in by pm      The location is so so as it is  avenues from the nearest subway mind that the aveues in New York are very large and that means a lot of walking to get to the nearest subway  Friendly staff  Very nice bathroom shampoos and soap were provided  
P => Pleasant stay at the Beekman We have just returned from a lovely  night stay at the Beekman Tower  Negative first sorry Things didnt get off to the best start when we checked in however  Unfortunately   although I had requested a high floor through the booking agency lastminute com and had emailed the hotel arately requesting the same we were given a very cold room on the lowest floor possible   floor  The suite was nice but had terrible views a brick wall one side and st Avenue through a frosted smeared window the other and the bathroom and bedroom were very very cold   even with the heaters on  I reported our disappointment to reception who advised that they could not do anything until the next day  Sure enough we returned from being out the next day to find we had been moved to a new suite   on the th floor with a city view We were very happy and very grateful with the new room and the way that the reception staff handled the situation Location of the hotel was fine  On previous visits to NYC we have stayed in midtown Waldorf Astoria Roger Smith The Carlton but   although the Beekman is a little out of the way   it is not too bad  The nearest subway station   st and Lexington   is not too far about a  minute walk   depending on how fast you are  This is only a pain if youre tired and very cold and drunk   but then you can get a taxi as we did There is a diner and a grocery store across the road and a McDonalds and Starbucks a couple of blocks away  The United Nations building is a bout a   minutes walk away  Youre only about   blocks away from midtown where everything is The views from the quotTop of the Towerquot restaurant are great  We didnt eat there but had drinkscocktails one evening which was very relaxed and enjoyable  We did get room service one night which is from the Top of the Tower restaurant and the food was very nice  All staff   including doormen cleaners and waiters   were very professional and pleasant throughout our visit I never got time to use the gym or any other facilities at the hotel so cannot comment Roomssuites are very spacious clean and nicely orated  Ours had a nice big living room complete with sofa coffee table and dining table plus a nice size TV  The bedroom was a good size with a very comfortable large bed and TV and nice clean ensuite bathroom   good size wardrobes   one in the bedroom and one in the hall   plus an iron and ironing board were also supplied  The kitchen is equipped with a fridge freezer microwave coffee machine and coffee and sufficient cutlery plates etc Although the Beekman is described as a quotbusiness hotelquot I thought it would be suitable for all types of travellers although probably not best for families with younger children   though suite size could be a plus point for families  Overall Id recommend the Beekman Tower for its large rooms very friendlyhelpful staff and amazing Top of the Tower views   but its out of mid town location  be an issue for some travellers  
P => Nice stay at the Beekman Just returned from  night stay at Beekman Tower with my teenage dhter  The rate was fantastic so even though the location is a few blocks from everything it was definetly worth it  We booked king bedded studio suite on the Affinia site for night  We took advantage of the close proximity to the UN and went ona tour on Friday afternoon  We picked up snacks at the convienience store across the street and had the kitchenette to store our ice cream and juice  The rooms are a bit old fashioned but very clean  At first we thought the bed wouldnt be comfortable but we both slept well  I would recommend double or king beds over twin beds The water pressure in the shower was very powerful  We would stay there again or try another well priced Affinia property  
P => Enjoyed the Beekman Great location  Walking distance to just about anywhere  Very nice staff  
P => Lovely place to stay I stayed here with my two adult dhters and we absolutely loved the place After a long time travelling we arrived at pm to be greeted with very friendly staff so polite it was very refreshing  Particuarly the doormen  Check in was swift and our one bedroom suite was cleaned to a high standard everyday and the maid always left extra smellies for the three of us  Great cafe over the road which has already been mentioned they serve a huge selection of breakfasts to choose from  U N Cafe The Top of The Tower cocktail lounge has wonderful views of the city at night  The cocktails worked out at about six pounds each but was well worth it for the views  Again the waiters were very helpful and friendly  Location is okay if you dont mind walking times square is about     mins  The grocery store over the road is handy too Also very friendly Theres a little pet boutique up the road which had some nice things the gentleman who owned it was lovely and very chatty  The suite was huge and spacious by New York standards with plenty of cupboard space with a walk in wardrobe too  Having a kitchen was great and it was stocked with all the extras you will need  Dont hesitate to stay here I am already planning to return at the same time this year BEWARE  When we arrived at La Guardia airport we were approached by a taxi driver not a yellow cab offering us the whole deal for a whopping  inc  tip claiming we would be waiting in the queue for a yellow cab for a long time  When we actually only waited for  mins and only cost us  TIP   Do the empire state building at night there was virtually no queue We went about pm dont miss it the views are fantastic  
P => Great hotel This hotel was great We booked an arrangement in the Netherlands for a New York city trip We had a one bedroom suite and it really was great  There was a arate kitchen with dishwasher and a bathroom which was nice  The bedroom was nice too the bed was comfortable We had a room on the nd floor  We could heardly hear the noise from outside The staff was great and helpful and provided us with toothpaste and deodorant because our suitcases didnt arrive at the same time we did We really can recommend this hotel to you We had breakfast at the Nations cafe across the street the food was great 
P => great value wonderful neighborhood Yes the rooms are a little worn around the edges but where else in Manhattan in one of the safest neighborhoods in the city can you have a one bedroom suite during ChristmasNew Year time frame for  a night The hotel was sold in ember and major reations are planned  which means big price increases in the future  For anyone who wants to focus on midtown and the upper East Side this is a wonderful choice  The customer service is superb  The housekeeping staff is wonderful  I always look at The Beekman Tower at my apartment in New York when Im a guest in the city  
P => Friendly staff great location We arrived at the Beekman Hotel and quickly checked in with no hassles  The doorman and receptionist were friendly and welcoming and we soon up to our room  We had a one bedroom suite with a kitchen  First impressions were that is was tidy but a bit worn looking  The suite was set out differently to that I had seen on the Internet so that the bathroom was off of the bedroom  I was a bit disappointed with this as it meant my  year old stepson would need to walk through our room to the bathroom  Also the sofa bed when pulled out blocked our pathway to the main door  But I didn t bother changing as we were only staying for  nights  The kitchen had a dishwasher fridgefreezer and cooker with hob a toaster and a sink  A nice touch was the ice cubes in the freezer ready for your drink In the cupboards I found some saucepans and frying pan plates cups and glasses a chopping board and they had also left one dishwasher tablet washing up liquid and a cloth  No cutlery or knives though but be you needed to ask for them downstairs  We didn t use the kitchen at all The bathroom was tidy and clean except for what looked like blood splatters on the wall by the mirror which was slightly disappointing  The range of toiletries was good I had also noticed a sign at reception saying you could also get deodorant and contact lens solution if required The bedroom was an adequate size but only had enough room for one bedside cabinet  There was also a TV cabinet and a closet with a safe inside  We had breakfast at the Nations caf  across the road from our hotel  The food was really nice and the service superb   I heartily recommend it The location of the hotel was great as it was away from the main hustlebustle but it was an easy walk to Times Square and Central Park Heating in the room was a bit sporadic   the first night the heating stayed on until the early hours which I found stifling but the second night it was off quite early We didn t use any of the hotel facilities but on our second morning we did go to the restaurant at the top of the hotel to watch the sunrise before the restaurant was open 
P => great hotel at a great rate this was our second time to new york city and we wanted to steer clear of all the toruisty parts of the city we stayed at the raddison tinique on broadway our first time around and while it was a nice hotel the price for the size of the room was a little high which is to be expected in new york  we did extensive reasearch this time around and booked at several different hotels but then canceled due to multiple bad reviews on here  we finally booked at the beekman tower which was rated at the time    out of over  hotles on here  We got a great rate on travelzoo    a night when we got there the first rooms they showed us to were okay about the size of our previous stay   the tinique but the rooms were very hot and we asked if we could be relocated  they upgraded us without any hestitaition to the suites with a erate entrance  These rooms were amaizing while outdated the size and cleanlyness were great  the housekeeping was also great  we were never disturbed and always had a nice cleaned room to come back to  there was a huge kitchen equipped with full fridge sink dishwasher and stove  our room also had a dining table  there were only two rooms per floor which was great because we were traveling with friends which also were upgraded and shared the same floor with us  we herd very little outside noise  for those who complain about street noise you do know your in the city that never sleeps right The ac worked great in the queen suits and always had a nice cool room to come back to  if you want to stay in the heart of all the attractions this is not really the place to be  but if your in the mood to just walk the city and really soak up what its like to be a new yorker this is just the place  we walked EVERYWHERE we even walked from the hotel to central park while tiring it was a great expeierience and i wouldnt trade it for anything  if walking is not the thing for your there is a subway line about  blocks up on lexington ave and that connects to other lines but i believe that line runs to yankee stadium if you can catch a game  the staff was very pleasant when we had contact with them but with a erate entrance to our room we didnt really have too much contact with them  the restaraunt on top of the tower had a great view but the drinks were kinda pricey  i had a coke and it was like  bucks  i would recomend this hotel if its your second time around and dont want the environment of tourists all over the place  i would also reccomend seeing other sites besides times square we ate at a great restaraunt in tribecca called the tribecca grill  this was an awsome restaraunt while a tad overpriced the environment of the restaraunt was worth the price  it is partially owned by robbert denero if that makes any difference  also for sports fans Mantels is an awsome place to eat  it right across from central park and has everything a yankee fan could dream of there is also a little grocery store right across the street and the owner is awsome he even yelled at the hubby cause i was gonna carry the bag out lol he was great if you want to really expierience what its like to be a new yorker this is the place for you i might also add that the beekman is rated higher than the waldorf astoria 
P => Would return Stayed at the Beekman for Thanksgiving day weekend  I have to agree with most of the reviews  The people are very nice  The rooms are very clean I think the cleaning staff should be awarded the furniture is scuffed up and outdated the suite itself is not very big  We had a one bedroom superior suite on the th floor  Not too small but definately not big  The living room with the pull out couch was good size but the actual bedroom with the queen bed was small and the kitchen was tiny but we were not doing any cooking so it didnt matter  The location was great we could still walk to Rockefeller center plaza and times square  The restaurant on the top floor of the Beekman is definately worth going to for at least a drink  I loved that restaurant atmosphere was so nice and beautiful The nations cafe across the street was great for breakfast we went there  mornings in a row  The convienceket also across the street was open  hours and came in very handy  I really liked the location  From reading about other hotels in New York with rooms so small and tiny for   I guess the Beekman has good size rooms although Ive only stayed in  bedroom suites and would never stay in a regular room with  kids  We paid   a night plus tax  So compared to other hotels I guess this is a good rate  I did not like the fact that they allow pets to stay there and was nervous about that  But my room did not smell like dog and there wasnt any dog barking at night  I did see dogs but it turned out ok not a problem   I would go back again  
P => Good location or in hotel needs help We stayed here for one night in ember   We enjoyed being close to midtown and a short taxi ride from Union Square  We loved the quotTop of the Towerquot   I would definitely receommend going up there for a drink whether you stay in the hotel or not  The staff was relatively friendly and helpful a little slow at check in  In general the hotel was fine for one night but the or of the hotel was totally beat  I felt like I was in my grandmothers house circa   The flower bedspread with matching curtains the puke greek carpet and the dark green furniture is all outdated  The bed was one of the most uncomfortable ones that I have ever slept on  The price for this hotel was good so I guess for one night it was fine  But I wouldnt necessarily recommend staying there for an extended stay  A couple hints   ask the staff for a hotel on a higher floor  We were on the nd floor and there was a lot of street noise especially in the morning  We also had a little kitchenette so you can bring fooddrink if you want to  Be sure to ask for extra blankets and pillows  There was one extra pillow and one extra blanket that had holes in it in the closet  There were only two pillows on the bed and a very thin cover  
P => Loved It Myself and my husband stayed in the Beekman during the Halloween holidays and found it to be most pleasant we were placed in a suite on the th floor and it was huge and spotless  Granted it could do with a oration re vamp but the maid service was excellent and i couldnt fault the cleanliness of the room The receptionists were always friendly and courteous and very helpfull when u needed advice on the best way to see the sights and where to eat etc The Nations Cafe across the road served fabulous breakfasts   such a choice and value for money All in all i would definately return to the Beekman next time we go to NY  The location is perfect if u dont want to be right in the madness of the city but close enough to walk to the sights  
P => Love the neighborhood The hotel is old and a little noisy  Forget that  There are much better hotels in NYC  But we loved the neighborhood  A few blocks away are a lot of nice restaurants  Filled with New Yorkers  Not with tourists  The people at the reception are very helpfull and friendly  The guys at the door are the best  They really understand how to make you feel at home  
P => Good value for young famlly  We stayed for  nights at the Beekman in ust amp we had a very good experience  My husband  children ages  amp  Mum amp I shared a one bedroom apartment my husband amp I shared the sofabed in the lounge amp we found the cooking facilities for breakfast amp dinners mostly a big cost saver  We enjoyed a beautiful dinner at the Top of the Town restaurant amp the service was spectacular  Ahmed the doorman was very helpful organising a car service with child restraints for airport transfers for me  The or is very dated amp the beds are quite uncomfortable but it was rekably quiet amp we felt extremely safe  even at night  There is a laundry service amp mini ket conveniently situated across the road which was handy when you have small children  
P => Fantastic hotel   great value We stayed at the Beekman for a week at the end of tember and were thoroughly impressed from the moment we arrived  We booked our rooom through lastminute for   a night which was excellent value for what we got  I can understand some reviewers who paid much more for their rooms not being quite as impressed as we were with the Beekman it is a little dated and not in the same class as some of the big   hotels but if you can get a cheap rate like we did it really is fantastic value Having read other reviews on this site we asked when checking in if we could have a room on a higher floor both to avoid street noise and to get the great views  The staff were unbelievably helpful and went out of their way to get a higher floor suite ready for us even though this meant upgrading us at no extra cost we had booked a studio suite and were upgraded to a full suite  I would definitely recommend doing this as the views from our room were fantastic see pics attached  Our suite was bigger than some of the flats weve lived in in London   really amazing and spotlessly clean with huge living room and dining area full kitchen bedroom and bathroom and loads of storage space   very handy for all the shopping The or is a bit dated and the hotel is probably in need of a refurb but considering the price we paid we were more than happy  Im sure if it had been refurbed it would be at least twice the price We really liked the location the neighbourhood was lovely and didnt feel too busy or touristy  There are lots of great bars and restaurants right nearby on nd Ave and we would definitely recommend Pescatore a ent Italian restaurant less than  mis away along with other reviewers  It was only about a  min walk into Mid town and less to the subway on Lexington which was very handy  Also if youre new to NYC as we were ask at reception for a map which we hardly ever put down it was so usefulWe had cocktails at the Top of the Tower resaurant and it was worth it for the views although they werent really any better than those from our room but it was a bit cheesy and dated  We didnt eat there though   it was quite pricy and there are so many great restaurants nearby it didnt seem worth it All in all we had a fantastic stay and really cant fault the Beekman Tower at all   the staff were great and really couldnt do enough to help and for the price we paid it far exceeded anything we expected  A few tips for any NYC first timersThe top of the rock observation k on the top of the Rockefeller Centre was fantastic   much less busy than the Empire State Building and a huge roof area at the top is open so much more space too  Views are amazing and the building inside amp out is incredible  Also dont miss the Anish Kapoor Sky Mirror installation which is infront of the Rockefeller centre at the moment For any fellow Woody Allen fans definitely go to Elaines restaurant on the upper east side which features in Manhatten and various other of his films really great service nice homely food although we were a bit disappointed not to see the man himself Also Riverview Terrace where Woody and Diane Keaton watch the sun come up togther in Manhatten is just a few blocks up from the Beekman Tower by the Queensboro bridge and a great photo opAs for shopping you cant do better than Century  opposite the WTC site   amazing high end designer clothes so cheap its mind boggling  
P => comfortable hotel in a residential neighborhood Just returned from  nights at the Beekman Tower  I was very tired of spending  a night at midtown hotels for a room the size of a cell or inhabited by seemingly thousands of fellow travelers  This hotel offers a lovely respite from the intensity of NYC in a residential neighborhood although the location near the UN  not be ideal if you need to be midtown  However it is at th street so far enough uptown for me  Cabs are readily available at all hours  My little suite was like an apartment complete with living room couch TV complete galley kitchen and bedroom and bath  Clearly in need of reation however immaculately clean complete with high end toiletries  A nice sized fitness center and the staff is unfailingly helpful and polite  I felt extremely comfortable here and would return especially if staying for more than one night  At  a night a great weekday value  
P => Good hotel good location We stayed at the Beekman Towers at the end of a touring holiday taking us from Boston thru New England then onto Niagara Falls before getting a train to New York  We were mainly sightseeing in New York and we wanted a reasonably priced hotel in a convenient location  The Beekman seemed to fit the bill in theory and surpassed our expectations in reality We were very impressed with the friendly and helpful staff  It was in a pretty good location   convenient for subway under  min walk   to  min walk to many points of interest   th Ave  Broadway  Times Square  Central Park  We had  bed suite which included arate kitchen  longe area on the th floor  Kitchen had fridgefreezer dishwasher microwave  We would have given the hotel an excellent rating rather than good if the rooms had a newer feel   they looked slightly tired and could have benefited from some re oration   although to be fair everything was very clean and tidy  Cant comment on the food in the hotel as we ate out for both breakfast and dinner   as there were many good restaurants nearby  The Top of the Tower cooktail bar on th floor was excellent   good views and friendly staff  We would defintely stay here again We booked thru Skoosh first time we had tried them   and everything was handled very well   and very good price for the room   far cheaper than booking direct with the hotel  
P => Go Beekman Go After trawling through countless hotel reviews the Beekman Tower hotel appeared to have the best balance of quality and cost  I can happily report that my wife and I were not dissappointed  Everything lived up to expectations  Very pleasant and good size room for NY with a handy little kitchen to boot All was clean and in good condition  The rooftop bar is great for sundowners with views over the city  The location is slightly off the beaten track close to the UN buildings but its an easy walk to Lexington Ave metro stations  About  to  blocks Great stay all round  Our room was on the lower floors and therefore had no view we stared out at the wall of the adjoining building  Would suggest requesting a room on the higher floors if youll be spending a lot of time in the room  
P => Off the Beaten Path in a Good Way I had my wedding at the restaurant at the top of the Beekman and stayed at the hotel for several nights as did many members of my extended family  The staff was very helpful and accomodating and I was very satisfied with the rooms  You have to remember that this is NYC and in any major city unless you are staying at the Ritz the rooms are going to be somewhat oldersmaller than in smaller towns  That being said I think the rooms are perfectly adequate and were very clean  I also like that the hotel is a bit further away from the Times Squaretheater district  It makes it much quieter and less aggravating and it is just a short cabsubway ride away from any attraction that you might care to see  The restaurant on top of the hotel was very pretty and had an art o theme  There are several other nice restaurants reasonably close to the hotel  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Wonderful Place in NYC My wife and I have stayed at the Beekman several times and have always loved itIt has a nice cozy friendly feel to it  It has a rooftop restaurant which is a wonderfully romantic place to escape to at night admittedly expensive but hey its New York  On the upper floors it is quiet The rooms are large and you can book a suite with a kitchen  This Summer we stayed there with two teenagers  and   The one bedroom suite with a hide a bed and rollaway was perfect particularly for the price  In addition we saved on some of the NYC sticker shock by having breakfasts and snacks in the room We did have a problem with the air conditioning on one visit not the most recent but we have not had any issues with the service and they tried to fix it the air conditioning in the living room worked so we just slept there on that visit The location is a bit off center but New York City is fairly large and it seems like most places are close to some things and far from others  The UN is handy of course unless your a diplomat there are only so many times you can go there  In the end in NYC it always seems like you end up walking a lot  On the plus side right across the street there are a deligrocery store and a liquorwine store This is a great place for couples groups of friends and families I agree with the people who have commented that it probably isnt the best place for a single business traveler  We noted the oddity about the phonefax machine that one of the reviewers has mentioned but who uses those now and they dont have a business center Well definitely return 
P => Great Place to Stay I travelled to New York with my two children aged  and  and was hoping for a comfortable base to explore the city  I found the Beekman Towers to be everything I had looked for  The hotel was easy to find on foot  It is about  mins walk from Grand Central Station  The suite was beautifully furnished and very comfortable with plenty of space  we got a free upgrade on arrival  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly rebook if we find ourselves in New York again There is a nice all day restaurant across the road Nations Cafe which has a great breakfast menu The only note of caution   think twice before using the hairdryer provided it blew a fuse in the suite and when I rang reception they knew it had been the hairdryer before I told themRuth   Dublin  Ireland 
P => Great for family stay Beekman Tower is a great choice for families of three or more that need to stay at a suite at a reasonable rate  We booked through their website and got a very competitive rate  The one bedroom suites are amazingly roomy and come with a kitchen  This hotel has not been reated in a few years but is still very clean and cozy  If you are just looking for a room you will probably find better choices at other hotels  It is right next to the UN and a  minute walk to the nearest subway station some people might ide that the  mintue walk is too much we found it to be perfect because the walk is through a very beautiful residential neighborhood  You might want to consider the bus since you get to see the city while getting to your destination  There are three bus routes that pass by the hotel  There are a number of great restaurants within  blocks of the property  The rooftop bar offers great views   go there for a drink but avoid the food   not worth it  
P => a pretty good deal I stayed at the Beekman Tower for several days in e  for about night inc  taxes  a pretty good deal in NYC these days sadly  The hotel is in a safe residential neighborhood a stones throw from the UN and Trump Tower  If youre looking for a trendy neighborhood this isnt your hotel  Theres a kitchenette in every room and theres a deli across the street and a ent grocery a few blocks away the food court at Grand Central station is in walking distance  I didnt try the room service the newish restaurant or the gym I didnt actually know they had a gym til I got there  The service was very friendly and housekeeping kept the place very clean  I asked for a newspaper to be delivered which they forgot to do but not a big deal I was by myself so the room was big enough with a comfy bed and a choice of hypoallergenic wheat or feather pillows  Theres a large closet with double mirrors an iron and ironing board and more than enough wooden hangers yeah  The room could have used a sofa and a desk but there was a dining table w chairs and a comfy chair I rearranged the room and used the bedside table as a small table and sat in the comfy chair  The kitchen was well stocked with a mini microwave some pots and pans coffee maker fridge and a toaster all within reach for short me  The ac is adjustable and the windows opened another yeah A couple of quibbles  They had no nonsmoking rooms in the main tower so they put me in the nd tower which has an entrance several doors from the reception area so it felt a bit isolated  The room could use some spiffing up esp  the carpet visibly worn in several places and the ceiling ditto  The toilet wouldnt flush unless you held the handle down for a while and there was a mildewy mat stuck to the bathtub floor with a second not much cleaner mat to toss over it  The kitchen light worked only when turned off and on several times and the gauze curtains could use a serious cleaning  better yet a discarding  other than those problems however Id definitely recommend the BTH 
P => Beekman       its great man I defy anyone to get a better hotel for the price in NYC  This wonderful art o building has a great cafegrill and the top of the tower restaurant gives breathtaking views whilst enjoying a meal or a cocktail The first thing you will notice is the friendly staff at check in  And I mean friendly  A frequent visitor to NYC most of the time staff treat you like a bad headache  Beekmans staff are superb  We had a rd floor suite twin bedroom spacious lounge and lovely lounge with a super fold out bed  Again for Manhattan an amazing floor space for the price and the rooms are tastefully orated and very clean You are only a  minute walk to NYCs most vibrant area   the bars and restaurants on nd avenue are a world away from the rip offs in Time Square  The hotels location  seem a little distant  I would say it is Manhattans best location  A  dollar taxi or short walk to the Waldorf Hotel to catch the tour bus and Manhattan is yours to explore knowing you can return to a quieter oasis at Beekman Tower Great value enjoy your stay  
P => The Beekman Sauna Stayed at the Beekman Hotel for  nights because of the rave reviews on this site  There is a however a fundamental problem about this hotel which does not get a mention  The heating and air con system in the rooms is not adjustable at all and your therefore can not turn off the heating and the air con if it exists does not work when the heating system is on  I complained about this and was told that quotthe system is very old and is controlled centrally and depends upon the complaints of guest as to whether it is on or offquot  This is New York believe it or not  I ended up placing copies of the New York telephone directory over the airvents to reduce the heat output having concluded that the noise after opening the windows was unbearable   Apart from that the hotel was acceptable but in need of a refurb which I suppose is reflected in the discounted price on offer  The staff were friendly and helpful   The location is fine with lots of good restaurants nearby  
P => Wonderful stay    My first stay in Beekman Tower great rooms smal kitchen but with dishwasher and coffe machine daily refilled A bath a little small but overall very clean   Housekeeper efficient Desk agents very friendly and the restaurant in the lobby is not so expensive and food is of a good quality Two tv in the room made us happy one in front of the bed the other near the couch excellent comfort even at  floor the sight was poor but nights are very very silent I reccomend this hotel Warning to tourists  as i was  the closest subway station is about  mt far so keeep in mind whe planning you visit  
P => Where did all the helpful people go After reading all the reviews on Trip Advisor I thought the hotel and staff would be fabulous  They werent although my experience was more average than horrible  To start they couldnt check me in early saying that this East side hotel in a residential neighborhood completely sold out on the night before a Wednesday  I find that hard to believe but I didnt say anything because they really dont have an obligation to accomodate me  I told them I had a teleconference in a few hours and asked if they had a business center  They said they didnt and the conversation ended there  Absolutely no offer of help  However the bellman Henry saw my predicamant and told me where the nearest Kinkos is  One other point of how unhelpful the desk staff was is that when asked about amenities that were printed in black and white in the hotel guide in my room they treated me like I was making things up  In several places it said quotYour room is equipped with a printercopierfax machinequot and quotAll suites are equipped with a printercopierfax machinequot along with instructions on how to use it  When I called down to ask about this my room was a suite I was told both that my suite wasnt big enough to be equipped with one and that they took them out of all suites a while back  And when I went down to the restaurant for lunch during the hours printed in the guide it was closed and the desk staff said that the hours were for room service which is provided by the diner across the street  Overall Id like to know where all the helpful friendly people are  Also a fair warning to business travelers or people who might need to do any work at all this hotel is not geared toward business travelers  
P => Good for a family My family and I stayed at the Beekman Tower Hotel for  days just before Easter Sunday  We were three adults and two teenagers so we had two rooms with connecting doors  The rooms were smallespecially with a rollaway in one of them but each had a kitchen and a bath which we needed  Probably could have used another bathroom at times  Housekeeping was good rooms cleaned and fresh towels every day The heat was uncomfortable for sleeping until we realized that the windows could be opened with much effort  The elevators were efficient considering that the hotel is  stories high and full  But those with a view said it was great  Public transportation right in front of the hotelthe neighborhood is upscale the staff is pleasant and helpful and wed probably try to stay there again when we need to Tip Dont miss the view from the th floor  Makes it all worth while  
P => Amaing Value This was my second time to stay with the Beekman Tower and again it was excellent I arrived late in the evening but was given an upgrade to a HUGE Suite that was not only spacious but very nice with great views of Midtown and the East Riverth  floor  Everyone from the front deskMichael and the other front desk agents to housekeeping to the restaurant was really great and friendly  I love their staff I love this hotel its location and THE FACT THAT IT IS LOCATED IN THE MOST AMAZING CITY ON EARTH NYC WHICH I WILL BE MOVING TO THIS FALL I highly recommend this hotel 
P => Good value a little out of the way I stayed here several days on a business trip paying about  thru Hotels  The room was huge and included a kitchenette which I used for breakfast and midnight snack  Housekeeping and reception was outstanding One obvious drawback the hotel is not especially well located for a business trip although except in rush hour the crosstown bus stops less than  block from hotel is quick  The nearest subway stop is several blocks not something to do with luggage One disappointment the mattress was well past its prime  
P => BEEK tacular Superb stay at the Beekman Tower I have to say researching NYC hotels before booking on Expedia ca really paid off  Because I read all the TripAdvisor Beekman reviews there were no surprises  These reviews give you a really good idea of what to expect  My wife and I stayed for  nights days which worked out to about  Canadian per night  Ill try to sumize some highlights  We arrived at the hotel about  hours before check in time and yet they gave us a room right away    Our room was quite large  Not as large as some of the other descriptions on this site but it still exceeded our needs    What a bonus to have a kitchen in your NY hotel suite see picture  The kitchen came equipped with a mini fridge oven stove top dishwasher platesbowls microwave oven and knivesforksspoons among other things  It was nice to have a coffee maker as well which was stocked with ground coffee bean packets  There is even an ironing board and iron    I did not expect to get a room safe free of charge    The lobby makes a great first impression see picture and our room was nice and clean    Hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating  Hats off to the door men and desk staff who knew we had questions before we even asked them   I loved the location  The hotel is East of midtown so youre quite close to many of the major NYC sights  Aside from the UN headquarters youre close to the Chrysler building see picture and Grand Central Terminal see picture  I dont quite understand other reviewers who say the Beekman is out of the way  Grand Central is about a  minute walk away or less and no more than  minutes to Times Square  It would be even faster if there werent so many red lights getting in the way  If you dont like lots of walking then you should reconsider NY as your trip destination  Im not sure how one could truly experience NY without exploring by foot   Our flight left in the evening so we inquired about the check out process  Front desk said they could add a couple of hours to our check out time which was nice   but we didnt need to do this  We just checked out early and had the staff safely store our luggage in the lobby something I had read about here  I cant really think of anything negative about the Beekman that sticks out in my mind  I will mention that food in the hotel is overpriced but thats no surprise  They leave a room service menu in your hotel room and everything is abusrdly expensive they add on different charges in addition to the cost of the food items  I should also mention that we were hardly in our room  Typically we left the hotel by AM and would be back by PM  So if there were other problems perhaps we werent around long enough to discover them   but I doubt it  Other tips not relating directly to the Beekman   There is a free walking tour of Grand Central Terminal every Wednesday at PM at the info kiosk   its   hours long and very thorough    Go to the ticket kiosk at Duffy Square which is in Times Square to get big discounts on Broadway shows mostly Off Broadway shows   we got   off Slavas SnowShow and   off the Altar Boyz   but you can only purchase for day of performances    There are many cheap or free performances at Juilliard    Try to visit the Empire State Building just before the sun sets   this way you can see Manhattan during the day and at night the nighttime view is spectacular   Dont waste your time or money with the CNN studio tour  It is a let down and you dont see much of anything they mostly have you watch a bunch of videos   If you want to save some money and your flight is at LaGuardia you can take public transit  Just look for the M bus   it costs  per person in change they do not take bills  Once youre at th St  you can get off at Lexington Ave    head southbounddowntown on the Lexington subway line you have to pay another  each and get off at st St  or Grand Central Terminal  Now you just have to walk East for about   minutes along th street before you arrive at the Beekman  Taking public transit  not be for you if you have a lot of luggage  Also the transfer you make at th and Lexington did not feel like the safest place it is Harlem afterall  Im not sure youd want to be there at night waiting for the bus or subway  And the M bus is quite full during rush hour  
P => Best Value in New York City I used to have to travel to NYC on a regular basis and the Beekman quickly became my favorite place to stay  Spacious affordable suites great staff good location and I love the Art o style  For the business travler you dont feel isolated as the suites are like tments  The staff is super helpful as I did a lot of interviewing and held meetings there The also have a th floor which I found cool  The bar upstairs has amazing views of the river and Manhattan  
P => convenient Theres nothing I can really rave about or complain about when it comes to the Beekman  I stayed over a  week period in    as I was in NY on long business trip  I needed an apartment hotel and I got an apartment hotelThe room I had on the th floor was huge  It was bigger than most apts I have seen in NY   huge livingdining room lots closet space etc  For the price  USD   special government employee rate   I think it was well worth it  Having a full kitchen stove microwave fridge dishwasher toaster cutlery dishes etc  was a definite plus  The old green carpet and classic old furniture was ok  Two television sets one in bedroom one in L R  with a good selection of channels was also pretty good  The service was not bad  I never received a newspaper in the morning but a Newsweek would appear in my room once a week  The cleaning service was done daily and impecably  I just wish they didnt shut the armoir holding the TV everyday   but I never said anything  The front desk service was also ok  The gym onthe nd floor was small coverted hotel room but had the necessities  There werent a lot of users so I was able to do my thing without too many hassles What did I not like I hated being in Midtown East Side  There is really nothing going on there    Except the for the sketchy Deli across the street with over a dozen security cameras there were always a bunch of Asian guys in suits whispering in a corner of the store there isnt much action in the UN diplomatic area of Manhattan  The restaurant on the top floor had great views but was too expensive for the quality and service  I ate there once I had bad wireless internet service for a couple of days and the tech support was not of great help but that isnt really the hotels fault    I guess thats all I can say other than it was worth the price but I think I would rather stay at better located and nicer hotels next time    
P => Hidden Gem I stayed at the Beekman Tower in Mid ruary  When Im in Manhattan I always try to stay at hotels on the East side of town it tends to be a little quieter there The Beekman is a great art o building and I was able to get a mini suite for two nights  The or in the room is a little old  For instance in the sitting room area the carpet was a little worn as was the sofa bed  However everything was clean and fairly well maintained  The staff is first rate  They are prompt with their assistance and very friendly I also had the advantage of a nice view of the East River from the th floor The Beekman  be a little out of the way for some st Ave  a couple blocks up from the UN but if you like a part of Manhattan that is less crowded and less hectic the Beekman is the way to go  
P => A Fantastic Friendly Hotel Weve just returned from  nights at the Beekman and I cant sing its praises enoughThe hotel is in a great location near the United Nations  Our room had beautiful views over the East river and there are plenty of amenities nearby   a handy little grocery store across the street a broad range of lovely restaurants and delis a short walk away and only  minutes stroll from Rockerfeller th Ave and Grand Central Station  Its all really close yet its far enough away to feel like youre away from the hustle and bustle of NY The hotel lobby is orated in an art o style  Fresh flowers and chilled music really added to the ambience of the place making it feel welcoming on arrival We had a  bedroom suite for  people  Both bedrooms were a good size   one with a double bed and large bathroom the second with a massive king size and slightly smaller bathroom  A well equipped kitchen area and good sized dining space plus a good sized seating area and a very comfortable sofa bed in the lounge  There was also an additional small bathroom in the hallway  The beds were very comfortable and they offer a range of pillows for your comfort The or is more traditional than chic and modern but tastefully done if a tiny little bit worn around the edges on the sofa for example  But the room was very clean and housekeeping excellent  Staff were very professional and nothing was too much trouble  Housekeeping was very good toiletries very nice and they were happy to help with anything we asked and were friendly at all times  The complimentary wine and chocolates were also a lovely touchOther reviewers have mentioned problems with windows and heating  We found the lounge area a little cold but mainly because it was such a large space The windows we found fine although a little stiff needing two of us to open them  But no problems with noise The cocktail lounge at the top is lovely especially in summer I imagine  In winter though with the windows closed not as special as Id hoped The cocktails were good but the menu limited wine list good though and at  a cocktail we thought pricey but is apparently going rate in NY we found drinking expensive wherever we went Overall a great hotel especially for a slightly longer stay as the kitchen makes catering for yourselves a handy convenience  
P => Tremendous Value My wife and I stayed at the Beekman for  nights starting  th  We stayed in a  Bedroom suite on the th floor which was definately worth the   per night rate  The room was fantastic and clean with a huge sitting room and a bedroom with a great corner view of st Aveth Street  The Kitchen was very useful and well stocked with appliances Microwave dishwasher cooker etc  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful  As has been said it is a few blocks to the st StreetLexington subway but it only takes about  minutes to walk there if that  The UN building is a within easy walking distance of the hotel which is why I guess lots of diplomats stay there  Diagonally opposite the hotel is a great diner which serves excellent breakfasts  There is also a small grocery store opposite the hotel  I also found a much larger grocery store on nd Avenue only a two minute walk from the hotel  All in all an excellent hotel a real bargain in a quiet but upscale neighbourhood  
P => Perfect place to stay in NY I booked this hotel after reading reviews on various websites including tripadvisor  It is a fantastic hotel I cant think of a bad thing to say about it  The postition is fantastic  The subway is not really that far from the hotel and we found we didnt use it much anyway as the hotel is walking distance from some of the main attractions  The room was HUGE by New York standards  The room was cleaned to perfection every day     the cleaners even folded clothes that we had left out to dry The roomhotel facilities are fantastic and the Top Of The Tower bar is a must  The view is superb as are the drinks  The hotel staff were amazing always helpful friendly  Everytime you would walk through the door they would ask how you were or wish you a nice day  I stayed there when the transport strike was on and they were so helpful with any information needed  I honestly cant say enought about how great this hotel is  I would recommend it to anyone 
P => Huge rooms great for a family We stayed at the Beekman Tower for two nights the week after Christmas  We found great room rates through Travelzoo and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the suite for under  a night  We had a  bedroom suite which was great since we were traveling with our  year old  You can grab a few food items from the small but pricey grocery accross the street and the suite has a nicely equipped kitchen  Also on the same street are numerous quaint resaurants wine shops and even a McDonalds and Starbucks necessities for both the yo and the adultsThe location is a bit off the beaten path but after the crowds at Rockefeller Cntr  and Times Sq  it was a nice break  Do be warned that the building is old and the windows let in a lot of street noise  be this would be less if you were on a higher floor  All in all a great place to stay especially if you are traveling with family 
P => Typical Affinia hotel and thats good Had a one bedroom suite here for  per night via Expedia which was an excellent value  Same accomodation was  through the hotels own reservation desk  Shop around before you book  The hotel told me they could not match the Expedia price Rooms were spacious and very clean  Large livingdining room with a work desk dining table and four chairs sofabedcouch TV and one chair that wasnt especially comfortable  Bedroom was small but fine with a soft bed and a choice of pillow types  TV and remote in the bedroom along with a clock radio  Bathroom was oddly configured but good with excellent water pressure adjustable shower head and usual amenities  Kitchen was fully equipped with stove full size refrigerator microwave and dishwasher as well as table settings and silverware for four along with cooking utensils  Complimentary coffee and tea were supplied with coffeemaker and toaster  There were two large closets Two cautions about this hotel    it is a remote location in a mostly residential neighborhood  The th Street crosstown bus stops just across the street and its very handy to navigate those long blocks running east and west  Its a hike to the nearest subway and to most of the midtown attractions  Theres a small deligrocery across the street with uniformly high prices on everything Also the windows are not well insulated and a lot of street noise invades  Youll hear truck traffic and sirens during the night so that might be a concern for light sleepers  I could never seem to get the climate control adjusted and the room was chilly The staff is friendly and does its best to accomodate guests  
P => Very good hotel My girlfriend and I stayed at the Beekman for  nights in ember  The staff were very helpful and got us a room with a good view The view from the top of the tower is also very good The room was good with everything youd expect and very clean and tidy We got a great deal and would definitely return  
P => Truly Wonderful It was our first trip to the quotBig Applequot  I researched quite a bit and came up with the Beekman Tower through justnewyorkhotels     It averaged   per night with taxes amp fees for a  bdrm suite  The apartment was much larger than what I expected  Kitchen livingroom dining room bedroom with nice bath  We were in the east wing which has  apts  to each floor  Our own private entrance  It was like being a resident in this wonderful neighborhood for a week The staff at the Beekman are absolutely quotThe Bestquot  I was in the hotel hospitality industry for many years and would hire any one of the employees in this organization  The location is also quotThe Bestquot  You have to walk a few blocks up to Park or th Ave but taxis are readily available outside of the hotel  This is a very established and exclusive area  There are a lot of diplomatic residences due to the United Nations a block away  At  Beekman Pl  is where Patrick Denniss real quotAuntie Mamequot lived as well as many famous people  Walter Cronkite lives across the street at the United Nations Plaza  We would go for walks at night and never feel uncomfortable The Nations Cafe across the street is great there are numerous restaurants on nd Ave Please enjoy the Beekman the neighborhood and NYC  
P => An enjoyable stay My wife and I stayed at the Beekman Tower for five nights and could not fault this hotel  Staff are helpful and friendly rooms are well furnished and clean  The Top of the Tower restaurant has an excellent view the menu is limited to four or five dishes and is quite expensive at  for a steak for me and a chicken dish for my wife  We also had starters a sweet and a bottle of wine  It had been a long day shopping and we didnt want to do any more walking  There is an excellent cafe opposite called the Nations and we had breakfast there every morning  Also across the street is a deli and a wine store  We found the Beekman an excellent base for shopping and site seeing and would use it again  
P => Nice Place for the Price This hotel is probably a three star hotel but I gave it four stars based on the price I paid  per night   Orbitz and the friendly staff  We had a huge studio room in the eastern annex because we wanted a foldout couch for the kids  We had no view but we had a kitchen and lots of room  The staff was very nice  The room was clean  The bathroom was small  The location is a bit far from the action but the neighborhood is quiet and safe  The subway is a six block walk  
P => Well looked after Spent  nights at the Beekman in tember   Fantastic trip to new york made even better by having this hotel as base  With this length of time we wanted space and the one bedroom suite here with arate bedroom and a kitchen was perfect  Also reasonable as got good deal going through Justnewyorkhotels  minute pleasant walk to grand central station  Always able to get cab though if wanted  The main thing to say I think was in respect of the service we got from the staff here who really looked after us from arrival through the ten days The rooftop restaurant really is a must bit pricey for the food really but frankly the setting is what youre paying for and it is fantastic We were there during US Open tennis and some fairly big names were staying here so clearly gets their approval as well  Hope to return  
P => Nice hotel nice staff will return My wife and I recently stayed here on my th birthday  We live about  miles North of NYC and I have been going to NYC for dining concerts sports etc  regularly since I was a teenager  This was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in  The front desk staff could not have been nicer and the view from our th floor room was beautiful only to be outdone by the wiew from the top floor lounge  Room was clean and comfortable and the kitchen was spotless  The furniture was not your standard cookie cutter hotel furniture it was really nice   If you feel you must have that quotBig Chain Hotelquot feelwith waterfalls and fountains in the lobby this hotel is not for you  But if you appreciate the attentive staff of a smaller hotel you will enjoy your stay  Very nice art o styling and reasonably priced too 
P => Great stay This hotel was the perfect haven during our hectic week long tourist break in New York  The rooms were quiet spacious and clean  We had a studio suite with a double bed and our teenage children had a twin room  There was some confusion over the rooms when we arrived but this was quickly sorted by the excellent front desk staff The location is ideal its in a pleasant mainly residential neighbourhood but close enough to all the main attractions although the nearest subway is not close if thats important to you  If you want a big bold brash hotel in the middle of New York then dont stay here  If you want somewhere comfortable and relaxing with bigger than average rooms then you cant go wrong here 
P => Great hotel good location My family and I stayed at this hotel while celebrating our  year anniversary I had emailed the staff and they gave us a complimentary box of choccis and bubbly  The staff were very friendly and when our case got lost in transit they were very helpful  the view from the top resturaunt was out of this world but not very child friendly menu so we had a couple of drinks as recommended by others and ate elsewhere  the location was next to one of the trolley tour stops so it was helpful for us to get around although a brisk walk took us to Central Terminal and Empire State  Fantastis city for couple singles and families we will return 
P => Couldnt have asked for more     Rooms were spotlessly clean  Staff were extrememly helpful in every way   they organised a taxi to the airport for us stowed our luggage unitl we neded it made us a glorious picnic basket advised us where to eat   wonderful food in Angelos Air conditioning was more than efficient if a little noisy  Location vellous   near enough to most main attractions to walk but buses available nearby and the subway only a few blocks away  We paid   for  nights which is brilliant value and we had a ior suite for that price  Kitchen was very useful Top of the Tower has a fantastic view and the cocktails are very very strong Food looked great although we didnt eat there  Would recommend to anyone who is on a budget but has high standards if the two are compatible Those snobs who would only stay at the Waldorf or the Intercontinental Barclay are unlikey to receive better service than we did here  Loved it 
P => What a location  We stayed at the Beekman for  days at the end of y during New Yorks heat wave Our room didnt get freezing cold but it did stay comfortable  I mean seriously when it is  outside how do you expect your room to stay at  The staff has to be THE friendliest I have ever dealt with We had just gotten off of a cruise and ided to extend our vacation and I feel like I got better service from the Beekman than I did the cruise line  It was pretty much a  dollar cab ride to anywhere we wanted to go in New York and a reasonable walk to all the major attractions and shopping  I loved the Beekman and will definately stay again when I return in ember The room was large and although promised a King sized bed we received a queen  The room was very large and the kitchen was a great feature that I did use to store ice cream and take home food from the restaraunts  The Top of the World or tower was delicious and had amazing views The price was the best part of it all on top of the cleanliness of the room Overall the best in New York for those on a budget 
P => Grat experience My husband and I stayed at the Beekman over Labor Day weekend  We had a great experience   the staff was very pleasant and efficient and our suite was very nice  We were upgraded for free to a large suite on the rd floor we had originally booked the smallest and least expensive room available  The hotel is in a nice relatively quiet part of Manhattan  Its a bit of a walk to the theater districtnd street area but to me thats an advantage   in my opinion its better to stay in a quieter less tourist frequented area  I would definitely recommend the Beekman and would stay there again  
P => comfortable stay My husband dhter    and myself spent  nights at the Beekman  We had a great time in New York  The Beekman Tower was ideal for us as our dhter had her own room  The staff are friendly and helpful  when we had a problem with the air conditioning help was prompt and efficient  We all loved the Radio City Music Hall Tour and arranged prior to our visit a meeting with a Big Apple greeter which was informative interesting and a good way to familiarise ourselves with the subway  
P => Good choice We recently stayed a week at the Beekman Towers  We had a great time and would recommend this hotel  We arrived early stored our luggage and went to a local street fair for a few hours  Upon our return we checked into a one bedroom suite on an upper floor  The rooms were large more like an apartment than a NYC hotel  We had a arate bedroom with a tv in a large armoire a full bath off the bedroom with bathtub and excellent water pressure a living room with another tv and comfortable pull out sofa bed and a full kitchen with full size refrigerator range microwave toaster and all kitchen utensils  Our rooms were very clean although a little beaten up there was some peeling wallpaper on one of the walls and the edges of the sofa were a little ratty  Two minor concerns neither of which affected our enjoyment of the room or the hotel  A person sleeping in the living room on the sofa bed would need to go into the bedroom to use the bathroom  Also there were no dressers or clothing storage areas in the living room except for a closet to hang clothes and that foldable rack to hold an open suitcase  Every day our rooms were spotlessly cleaned by the housecleaning staff  Although temps in the city were in the s our rooms were always cool and comfortable  We never heard a sound from the street or any other rooms or in the hallway  All the staff we spoke with as noted by others were friendly and accommodating  We went online to the Affinia website and found a promotional rate of  which included a daily continental breakfast in the Zephyr Grill and a welcoming cocktail at the Top of the Towers restaurant  The breakfast was appreciated  There was a ent selection of fresh fruit juices bagels croissants muffins scones yogurts cereals etc  The coffee was very strong  We generally had breakfast as a couple and brought a tray of food up to our sleeping teenager  We usually ate at the different areas we visited in the city but locally can recommend the Nations Cafe across the street which provides room service to the hotel and Blockhead Burritos on Second Ave  Some have noted the location is not too convenient  We almost always took a city bus with our unlimited MetroCards downtowncrosstown  The buses we used were either right around the corner or a block away on Second Avenue  We never waited more than five minutes for a bus except for one evening coming home from Times Square  Note we did not travel by bus after about  p m  Although subways are quicker we enjoyed quotsightseeingquot while on the city buses  Our bus drivers were generally courteous helpful and almost always announced each stop  One morning a two year old with her nanny got on the bus  She sang the quotABCquot song and the full bus burst in to spontanous applause after she finished  I dont know who was more surprised us or the little girl  We found the NYC residents to be quite helpful to us tourists  One woman even went out of her way and ran after us to correct her earlier directions   One suggestion   since checkout is at noon we saved our tour of the United Nations until the last day  The tour is only about an hour and the UN is only a block away  We woke up ate packed and then went on a  oclock tour  We were able to get back to the hotel freshen up have a cool drink and check out before noon  We would definitely return to the Beekman Towers in the future  
P => First Class Hotel Loved the Beekman We stayed at the Beekman Tower Hotel at the end of ebeginning of y  for  nights  Having read reviews from other Trip Advisor members we had high expectations and were not disappointed We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the th floor overlooking first avenue which was surprisingly quiet  We had a kitchen with cooker microwave and fridgefreezer a arate sitting area with sofa bed and a arate bedroom with double bed The room was very clean and fresh towels and toiletries were provided on a daily basis  The door staff and ladies at reception were very courteous and friendly and after a long day sight seeing and shopping it was nice to return to the comfort of the Beekman Having stayed in New York previously I cannot recommend the Beekman highly enough  This is an excellent hotel and I would definitely stay here again  
P => We loved it My family and I stayed at the Beekman in e  duting the heatwave  The hotel was cool throughout it all  The suite was very clean if not a little dated  The bed was extremely comfortable and they offer several pillow varieties from which to choose Our suite was on the nd floor and we had a small patio area and could see the East River and the Empire State Bldg   Staff was very accomodating and we liked the location  It was very safe and not too far from bus or cabs  Although on a regular workday dont expect to get a cab between  pm and if you do get a cab dont expect to move very quickly  It just wasnt that far to Grand Central Terminal    afterall you are in New York City and you will be walking  There is a groc deli across the street and the Nations Cafe across the street that we highly reccommend for breakfast  It is a better value than the continental breakfast at the hotel We ate at the Top of the Tower and it was great food but not family friendly  Our kids did not want the full selection included for the meal and they adjusted our bill accordingly I would definately stay here again  
P => Beekman Towers Very Nice Stay My wife and I had a lovely Saturday   Sunday stay at the Beekman Towers on the East Side blocks from the UN  The nice folks at the front desk upgraded us to a suite with a balcony looking down st Avenue  The suite was wonderful  the kitchenette clean and tidy and room service was on time and prepared correctly but a tad steep Good neighborhood a huge grocery  salad bar across the street and other conveniences within a block or two  Plenty of cabs as it is away from subway lines Besides the hotel we enjoyed great jazz at Smoke on the Upper West Side art at the Frick Museum on th Avenue and a nice Sunday service at St Barts on Park and th A great  hour refresher on things that make NYC wonderful  
P => Trust Your Fellow Reviewers Great place to stay in NYC  The only neg is that it is a little far from the subway nearest station is Lexst but with that comment out of the way the rest of the story is quite positive  We had a small suite with a living room kitchen and arate bedroom  and what a view Staff couldnt have been more accommodating  Across the street there is a great ket that is open   Nice folks but be quiet late at night  theres a baby sleeping upstairs Lots of restaurants nearby  we ate at Lasagna Grill  chosen because it was overflowing with locals  Excellent food at reasonable prices and yes they serve quite a bit more than the restaurants namesake  We liked being in a neighborhood felt we really had a feel for living in this great city 
P => Clean rooms excellent professional service Stayed at the Beekman for  days il   Good welcoming by helpful staff initially disappointed with low floor accommodation as had asked for high room but more than compensated by good facilities and an excellent sized room  more an apartment Amazingly helpful staff when any small problem arose nothing was too much trouble Views were magnificent from the top of the tower bar probably the best in Manhattan at night although the cocktails and food were rather expensive Situated in a safe area with all conveniences situated nearby  The subway really isnt that far mins walk Also served by regular bus just outside hotel I would certainly consider using this hotel again and commend the hotel management on a well run professional and courteous service  
P => Pretty Art o but a little out of the way Nice hotel small foyer but the rooms are more than comfortable  I had just a single room and a kitchen I understand other rooms are larger having a  living room  The cafe on  only served a fixed price menu the night I stayed which was quite pricey at  or  plus tax but very nice for a cocktail  As others have said a bit of a walk to the nearest subway on Lexington and st but easy access to a good cross town bus on th and nd or th and nd if you are heading towards Times Square  
P => Excellent Hotel   Met our expectations Stayed at the Beekman for  nights commencing on  ch with our teenage dhters  amp    a fairly late change of booking when we ided wed like more space amp the reviews posted were all very encouraging In many ways there is not much to add to what others have said except to say that most of the comments are very representative  The staff are fantastic   nothing is too much trouble the nearby Nations Cafe is good and superkets across the road and  block west on nd Avenue are very convenient  The rooms are very comfortable and extremely spacious  We got an excellent rate via a UK travel agent but the hotels own rates are pretty good Dont be put off by comments about distance from the metro   its only  minutes walk but the regular buses stop just across the road on the corner of st Avenue and th Street you can use your metro card so no extra cost and these will take you to and from th Avenue  Times Square in more than  minutes Plenty of restaurants nearby and we always felt safe when we were out walking in the surrounding streets even late at night A great place to stay that provides lots of space and excellent value  
P => Great deal on a suite Got a great deal at Orbitz  At check in asked for and received free double upgrade  Great view from th floor but is too close to kitchen noise and would avoid this floor  Suite was huge plenty of room for family of   Hotel clean and pretty with excellent service  Absolutely would stay again  
P => Absolutely Satisfactory The Beekman is a very comfortable good quality hotel  While not luxury by any standards including the price the hotel is clean and comfortable  The service cannot be faulted and the kitchen is very convenient particularly during freak snowstorms that make venturing outside very uncomfortable  The kitchen is a little dated but fully functional but the bathrooms are lovely and the water pressure in the shower is excellent  The hotel cannot be faulted but is missing the oomph that would make it exceptional  All in all if you are looking for a reasonably priced comfortable hotel with a fabulous view from the rooftop grill and a location in the heart of the East Side the Beekman is for you  
P => Strongly recommend Have stayed here twice in the last two months for long weekends and strongly recommend this hotel for business tourist travelors looking for low frills professional service with excellent value  If you a comfortable spacious environment without the in your face glamour of some bigger name hotels this is a very good choice  Each room has a full kitchen which is very nice and the rooms are certainly large by NYC standards  On my most recent trip I was travelling with my fiancees parents and we each booked our own rooms but upon arrival the desk upgraded us to a very comfortable two bedroom suite  They are much less travel savvy than my fiancee or I and felt very comfortable at this hotel  
P => Great art o hotel We stayed at the Beekman Tower in ch  and were impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of the staff the size and cleanliness of the rooms and the lovely view of the city from the th floor restaurantbar  Architecturally speaking this hotel is an art o gem  Id highly recommend it though other reviews did comment that its not close to subway stops  We took cabs and walked  
P => Suite Success Booked a studio at a bargain price yet were upgraded to an Art o suite Lovely quiet for NY location close to the UN a bit of a walk from the other Midtown highlights but crosstown buses run from nearby  Friendly and helpful staff added to the pleasure of our stay  Excellent diner just across st Ave for breakfast  Will stay there again next time were in NY  
P => Absolutely fabulous Just returned from  nights at the Beekman Tower  The suites are really great just like having your own apartment  The location is really handy theres a general grocery shop and diner across the road  Its a few blocks to get to everything but the walking is easy and theres loads to see on the way  Taxis stop right outside without any effort  I loved this place the staff were really nice the room was spotless with excellent service and I would stay there agian tomorrow  Top tip Use the hotels driver service to go back to the airport at the end of your stay  We travelled to JFK through really heavy traffic a suited Lincoln collected us  hours drive with traffic    inclusive  A great deal  
P => great rooms with excellent views and staff arrived th  for a  nights breakroom was excellent sorry no this was not a room it was an apartment with lounge and kitchenette with microwave oven fridge freezer etc etc and arate bedroom with excellent views from  th floor  clean bathroom and linen  staff were very friendly and accommodating stored our luggage and arranged taxi ride back to airport with very friendly driver  well placed for all major sights  good range of restaurants in area  and was surprisingly quiet after dark try restaurant at top of tower good views of manhattan   this was booked on internet and would use again   
P => very well located and friendly Stayed there for  days from st ember  On st and th Streets and easy walking to the main shops and a short taxi ride to almost anywhere in Manhattan The staff were very friendly not what we expected in New York and our suite had a small kitchen with an endless supply of coffee bags for the machine supplied Staff happy to help with directions to a bagle shop how to order a NY pizza laundry etc I rate the staff as very highly trained and well above average My son and his wife had a sofa bed in the main lounge room which wasnt very comfortable they were better when they put the mattress on the floor Noise was an issue even on the th floor  but I think this is normal for a place that never sleeps A great New Years Eve party on the th floor and open to guests in the reataurant  we did not dine but went along just prior to midnight and could dance and have a great time An old building comfortable and reasonably priced as we booked through the interrnet and got a price about half the rack rate  
P => Got it right the first time Stayed  days amp  nights in  of   Great hotel great staff great rooms they really did quotget it right the first timequot  Found a great deal thru      If you get a chance you should use these guys their great in a city that does great as an afterthought these guys stand out L K TN 
P => Beyond great Stayed here for one quick overnight for shopping eating and theatering  It is a beautiful Art o hotel in a perfect location  Suite was more than roomy quiet and clean  The Top of the Tower is a perfect place for a late drink with views to die for  The front desk and valets were very welcoming and helpful  They are a group of young people who really seem to enjoy their jobs which comes from the top  They could not have been more helpful offering to call a car get a cab etc  This type of service is not typical of a huge impersonal city such as NYC  They make you feel comfortable safe and happy  They do it right Kudos to the management of this hotel group 
P => What a great stay Had a great  nights at the Beekman the beds are a bit small but fantastic having so much space  Rooms were cleaned everyday showers are brilliant after a long days walking Couldnt fault anything about the hotel a bit dated but most hotels in the city seem to be  Even got a bottle of champagne that we cheekily asked for 
P => Wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel My wife and I arrived at the Beekman last Fridayand stayed for  nights We were generously upgraded as it was my wifes th birthday  Although our original suite was far larger than most hotel accommodation and was spotlessly cleanour upgrade gave us superb views and even more space The suites are in really good order and kept very clean and tidy by the housekeepers and the toiletries supplied are of good quality The staffespecially Mr Laydon looked after us very well and were all friendly and helpful The view from quotThe Top of The Towerquot is breathtaking  Location wisethe hotel is in a safe neighbourhood with lots of delisrestaurants and shops close by We would unreservedly recommend this hotel and we would definitely go back ourselves 
P => Great service but     We stayed over New Year th     nd  The staff are very friendly and accommodating  However our one bed suite was clearly in need of refurbishment  Public areas looked a little better  The suite accommodation did afford us a good degree of privacy as we travelled with our teenage son The location on st and th means a short  minute walk to the Rockerfeller Center and shopping  We often hailed a cab cheap at around  dollars  The Nations cafe over the road offers ent food  especially good for breakfast  There is a  hour mini ket over the road too  
P => Affinia have it right We stayed at The Beekman for  nights     Very friendly staff  superb room and facilities  Great location Well done Beekman  
P => Nice hotel friendly staff huge rooms Very nice hotel and spacious rooms  Nice to have a erate livingkitchen area and  TVs The staff were very friendly and helpful breakfasts were huge and the top of the tower is something else  The only downside to our stay was that we requested a non smoking room and we ended up with a smokers room but we were checked in round thanks giving and the hotel was fully booked  I wouldnt have any problems in coming back to this hotel again 
P => Great rooms and friendly service A friend and I stayed at this hotel for  nights in ober   We were a little apprehensive because of the promotional rate half off  However we were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the hotel and our suite  The staff was friendly and helpful  It was great having a arate living room and a kitchen which we stocked with snacks sodas and water from the ket right across the street  The microwave came in handy for popcorn for late night TV  The bathroom was very clean and stocked with nice toilettries  Our room had a great view of the city E  The restaurant on the th floor is amazing  it has an enclosed terrace with gorgeous city and river views  An excellent place for cocktails before hitting the town The ONLY downside is the hotel is a good   minutes walk to the nearest subway entrance on Lex about  blocks  However I would definately stay at this hotel again  
P => liked it beekman hotel is safe bet for any person visiting new york  the hotel is located on the corner of st and th  the real only downfall would be that the nearest train station is on lexington and st which is about  blocks away  there is a bus across the street on th number m or m that will take you crosstown which is really convenient  other than that the hotel was nice  rooms are clean  service was great  
P => I cant rate this hotel highly enough I almost booked a hotel based on website details when I found tripadvisor and discovered that the hotel I was about to book had terrible reviews  I booked at the Beekman based on the reviews on this site and was not disappointed The suites are huge for New York standards with more than enough space to try on all of the clothes that I bought We even had a dining table to eat our takeout chinese on and a kitchenette if you want to cookThe staff were very friendly and helpful and although the hotel is not located right in the centre I found it to be perfect for accessing all the places I wanted to see with lots of bars and restaurants nearby The walk from Grand Central Station took only about  minutes I cant recommend this hotel highly enough and definitely intend to stay here again in future A great place to stay 
P => Great Hotel with fantastic service Three mates and I stayed here over the weekend of  and found the hotel to be a very pleasant experience  The staff were very friendly and welcoming  The room was clean tidy and spacious enough for all four of us to have arate beds with room to spare  One minor criticism is the lifts which do take a while to come when called however it is my understanding that the hotel are installing new ones soon  The location is excellent with only a five minute walk to midtown and the subway connections  There is a great superket opposite which stocks most things you would ever need  I have stayed at many hotels now in New York and this hotel was the nicest I have stayed in yet  I would definitely use this hotel again and recommend it whole heartedly to anyone thinking about taking a trip to New York 
P => try the Beekman first Any time I come to NYC the beekman is the first choice  The staff is very accomodating the rooms are spacious  The location is perfect  There is no better place to unwind it is like living in your own Ny apt  Cable small kithen clean priced competitively  the more great reviews  the harder it is to get a reservation or upgrade  The staff really aims to please and takes care of the guests bravo I always try the Beekman first  
P => a great value We stayed at the Beekman beginning of e  for  nights and really enjoyed it  The front desk staff were very helpful friendly and efficient and we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite Although they are in need of a little updating the suites are absolutely huge and you can pretend that you are living in Manhattan in your own flat  There is a good convenience store right across the street for stocking up your kitchen and plenty of restaurants nearby  By the way your next door neighbor is the UN If you like Indian food try quotINDIGOquot around the corner on th I believe  it was truly the best I have ever had  it was Tony Awards weekend so we got take out from a local deli buffet and cozied up in our living room You will like this hotel  it is not luxury but it is clean and very spacious  We love the walk isnt that what NY is all about so we did not mind the location  Even if you dont eat at the restaurant you must go see the viewOverall a great value  
P => A safe bet The Beekman Tower is a safe bet for anyone despairing after reading hundreds of bad hotel reviews  The suite we had was clean spacious and well furnished and the main bed and sofa bed were comfortable  The kitchen was nice to have although we didnt use it much  The staff were mostly friendly and competent  Traffic noise on the th floor was minimal  After checking out luggage could be stored and the hotel organised a car to the airport The hotel is in a fairly quiet safe area near the UN  There is no subway station nearby  mins walk but the buses  and  go across the town along th St returning along th St  Weekly Metro Cards are a very good buy if youre staying four days or more  Taxis are quite inexpensive for short journeys that are awkward by subway and bus We used the UN Plaza caferestaurant on the opposite corner for breakfast every morning which wed recommend  
P => The Only Place I will Stay When In NYC We travel to NYC about year and after having stayed at numerous other hotels over the years   we ided to try the Beekman after hearing from a friend about the excellent food and accomodations  Were glad we did  The suites were beautifully orated the staff courteous and welcoming and the food was scrumptious  We have dined at both the main level restaurant and at the skyline level   the view was breathtaking The waitstaff was courteous and we even noted that the head chef came out and checked on the guests and their mealsevenings   what a pleasant and nice touch Keep up the good work Beekman   Well be back 
P => Bad start   great finish My stay started very badly arriving at  hrs and being told that the hotel had overbooked despite the fact that I had booked well in advance and my arrival time was known  The staff were very apologetic and they called a cab and took me to their sister hotel a block away but this was a huge disappointment  I said I would return the next day and expect a room and that an upgrade would be a goodwill gesture  I duly arrived and was given a vellous suite with a balcony on one side that gave a great view of the th street bridge and on the other side the most amazing view of the Manhattan skyline particularly at night  I was also given a complimentary dinner that night in the Zephyr Grill and the steak was absolutely fantastic  The location for me was fine as I love to walk and when I needed the subway then Lexington was only a few minutes away  So nice hotel friendly staff shame about the over booking but can highly recommend so long as you dont need to be in the centre of things  
P => Like Having Youre own New York Apartment Stayed at the Beekman summer   Stayed on the th floor with great views of the UN Plaza and First Ave  Large clean  bedroom suite  Bathroom had a view Kitchen light never worked despite frequent requests to the management for replacement  Top of the Tower is a real classy place  Great views of Midtown  Staying at the Beekman again summer   
P => A Great Experience The Beekman Towers is the perfect place for families  The suites are spacious and clean the staff was friendly enthusiastic and very responsive to all our needs  It was a great value for the dollar  A perfect place to unwind at the end of the day 
P => Amazing time Had an amazing time hotel was lovely suite was clean good facilities and stunny viewsStaff were helpful and politeWould definately stay there again

P => Good stay   but avoid Rm  We chose to stay at the Bellclaire with our  year son as we were looking for a hotel on the upper west side close to Central Park and the Natural History Museum  Overall it s a very nice hotel with clean good size rooms with great hardwood floors  The beds are also very comfortable  Staff were friendly as well and the neighbourhood was appropriate for travelling with our  year old   more residential and less hectic than the mid town area  We recommend the Bellclaire but please stay away from room   On check in we were given this room which at first seemed fine until the night when there was this horrible hissing and clanking noise coming from this peculiar vent pipe in the bathroom  There was noise also from the street however that did not bother me since this is New York City after all  My husband went down to the front desk to enquire about a room change and was told that because the Bellclaire is an older hotel all of the rooms had this problem and they could not guarantee that if we changed rooms the noise would be any better  I ided it was worth the risk to stay in another room and we moved to room  the next day where I immediate check the bathroom to see if it had another one of those peculiar pipes  No pipe   no noise and I had two very comfortable nights of sleep  So stay at the Bellclaire if you are looking for a reasonable place in the upper west side but avoid room  at all cost Other tips   the hotel is also close to the subway the  Train local on  street and the amp trains express on  street  There were also good choices for eating  We enjoyed Big Nicks Burger Joint just around the corner and had a lovely Italian meal at a bistro two blocks up on th between Broadway and Amsterdam   sorry can t remember the name but the fresh pasta special was delicious 
P => FANTASTIC location excellent for young peoplethose on a budget My boyfriend and I were only going to be there for four nights  This was the cheapest hotel that still offered a location close to all the action We could walk just a few blocks to Central Park the subway station was one small block away and only a few stops to Times Square and there was everything we needed in the way of conveniences right on our corner Highly recommend the Manhattan Diner for a cheap big breakfast and Nicks Pizza is a MUSTThe economy room was very small but housekeeping was excellent  Considering youre in New York and hardly any time should be spent in your room the size really isnt an issue at all  The shared bathroom was not a big deal it was kept very clean and we never clashed with the people we shared with All in all an excellent choice in a city that is known for ridiculously expensive hotels great locationa and great service 
P => Hip hotel in great location This hotel is very stylish and comfortable  We have stayed here twice one time the bathtub was clogged and the other our room was net yet ready when we arrived at  PM  Both issues were resolved to our satisfaction and along with the broken and slow elevator kind of added to the charm of the place  We had deluxe rooms and they look much as pictured on the website beds were comfortabel and bathrooms were large and well stocked  They have a very helpful and friendly bellboy dont know if that is the correct title named Sare who made our long wait for a taxi very pleasant  Hotel is in a great location near Central Park Metropolitan Museum of Art Natural History Museum Guggenheim  We also enjoyed being in a residential area we saw people going to work and taking their kids to school  Cant imagine staying anywhere else in NYC 
P => Mediocre but clean beware of noises in the room The hotel was nice and on the small side  It was clean and mediocre if youre here just needing a place to sleep this will be fine  The subway is  blocks away and that made it convenient for getting around  The one part that was not okay was the noise I experienced the first night there  I was put in a room that faced Broadway on the nd floor  At night you could hear all the street noise sirens and dump trucks  It made it impossible to sleep  On top of that the hotel has a boiler system that runs heat through the pipes  This causes loud clinking sounds that can drive you mad  It sounds like someone is intentionally banging pipes to keep you up  After the first night I went downstairs to request a room change and it seemed that the desk person already knew what I was going to complain about  I was moved to the th floor in the back of the hotel and found more peace that way  
P => Lovely Hotel   Would stay here again We stayed here for a week and LOVED it The upper west side is a charming neighborhood with tons of restaurants and shops  The subway way only two block away Riverside Park and the Hudson River was only a couple blocks and Central Parks was about  blocks  The front desk and housekeeping staff were all very friendly and helpful  I cant say enough about the staff  The hotel itself is in a very charming historic building and the rooms are more like urban apts than hotel rooms  Wi Fi reception was spotty but the Cosi restaurant across the street has free Wi Fi  I thought the price we paid with the Autumn Special rates was an excellent value for this location  The Manhattan Diner across the street had an excellent and reasonably priced breakfast and was open  hours  Patsys Pizzeria on th streret was also an excellent place to eat nearby  Zabars and HampH Bagels are also close by  Filenes Basement is very close  Yes there is only one elevator right now and it is a bit slow but its workable and there is a service elevator down the hall that you can also use as well as a beautiful open ble staircase so you can walk to your room  I live in the middle of cornfields in IN so I come to the city for the noice and bustle  However if you dont like the street noise you  want to ask for a room facing one of the quieter streets and not right on Broadway  We were on the th floor facing Broadway avenue with two huge sets of windows with excellent views  You did hear lots of strett noise but I loved it and we did not even notice it when we were sleeping after the first night   I would definitely recommend this place to others 
P => Just what we expected Just spent  nights at The Belleclaire hotel no dissapointments or great surprises from what we were expecting a reasonable priced  star hotel in New York city  The location is convenient and the staff were very friendly  The room we were given the first night was on the third floor  and the only view we had was a brick wall but upon request we were immediately transferred to the th floor  this one had a reasonable view and was far more quiet The rooms are a very ent size for New York and were clean and in good condition  We had free wireless internet as advertised but it was a bit slow so just went to a coffee place just opposite Cosi which had free wifi available Yes the elevators were slow and one of them was out of other as we had read in previous comments but that was not such a big problem at all  I would definitely recommend this hotel for a private trip to the big city  
P => IN LOVE WITH THIS HOTEL Everytime we have friends come to the city we put them up in the BelleClaire  Sometimes we even stay there too The staff are like family the location on the Upper West Side means that this Brooklyn native gets to see a new part of the city  The  hour diner over the street is amazing and Anderson Cooper eats there The rooms are clean and classy modern and sleek Love this place 
P => GOOD VALUE GREAT LOCATION What Id have to say is pretty much in the title  Just a few points  First the hotel is in a great Upper West Side neighborhood  Great affordable places to eat the Manhattan Diner across the street was my favorite Central Park a few blocks east the Hudson River walk a few blocks west  Filenes basement just a few blocks north for great discount shopping  A CVS drugstore not far away     we even saw a movie     the theater was also just a few blocks north  Subway stop very close by  The hotel staff were accomodating  Talk to Sare the young doorbellman  I think hes a real up and comer in the hospitality field  Very helpful always smiling     remembers things     a good kid  The room was small but adequate pretty much as advertised  Sharing a washroom was not as bad as I thought it would be     its New York after all and no one lounges around the hotel much  One quibble     I would have expected the shower curtain to be have been magnetized so it didnt ride in on you when you were taking a shower  And just one more thing theres a small but funky gift shop in the lobby     it even had three internet stations  This was important because my wifes laptop wouldnt work in New York due to a company firewall  I must have spent an average of  dollars a day on the gift shop internet but I didnt mind due to the convenience  I thought that area of Manhattan would be crawling with Internet Cafes but it wasnt most locals just go wireless wherever they are  The trouble is I understand the gift shop will be shutting down in ch when the lease is up and the hotel will use the space for something else  If any Belleclaire people are reading this I would urge them to think about setting up their own internet stations in or just off the lobby  Seems like a money maker to me as they were always busy  
P => Great location in NYCs Upper West side  Would stay here again  Stayed here for a weekend in a  bedroom quotsuitequot with a bath shared by both rooms  It was advertised as a suite but is really one big room with a  length wall dividing it in two  Not for a romantic getaway but is great for friends traveling together or a family  
P => First time stay last time stay I stayed at the Belleclaire with high expectations given their fantastic sister properties e g  Washington Jefferson  Unfortunately my stay here was not so great  Upon my arrival the staff was extremely unfriendly  The bellman did not open the door for me nor offer to help with my luggage total of  bags  Though the front desk person who checked me in was courteous it ended after my arrival to my room  Thereafter most staff for discourteous  The biggest problem I encountered was that I was guaranteed a room when I made my reservation for Tues   Friday and then for Sun   Monday and was told that Saturday would become available  That never happened  I called daily for a Saturday stay and was told each time that all rooms were booked  No one offered to help me find a room at the sister properties or elsewhere  I was informed that I would need to find other accommodations for Saturday and then could return on Sunday  I was completely taken aback as no hotel has ever treated me with such little help as did this hotel  My only positives of this hotel are that the rooms are a nice size for the value and its in a nice location on the Upper West Side  Other than that I see no reason to ever stay at this property and will take my business elsewhere albeit one of its sister properties or another hotel  
P => NOT POSH BUT VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY Generally speaking I was very pleased with this hotel and would definitely use it again  The room was basic but contained everything I needed especially a fridge which was extremely useful  It did smell of smoke when I arrived but this cleared quite quickly  The room did not resemble the photographs on the website in any way which is a bit sneaky but no big problem  The bed was extremely fresh and comfortable Everything was very clean and the room was serviced every day  However the hotel looks a bit tired and is in need of a good lick of paint  The shared bathroom although kept clean needed retiling I found the service to be very good and the staff helpful The hotel is situated approx  miles out of the centre but the metro is very close and safe and its easily walkable into town  Excellent superket and two excellent American diners  mintutes walk  For the money   brilliant 
P => Just Right I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel  It is on the Upper West Side only two blocks from the subway  As a New Yorker and former Upper West Sider I was so pleased to find a quiet hotel away from the main tourist areas  My initial room  was small and dark and had construction noise  I called the desk and within a few minutes was given room  which was larger had a view and was very comfortable  The staff is very courteous and helpful  The rooms are modern with the usual conveniences including a small fridge and none of the unnecessary extras that add unnecessary cost  The floors are wooden but we didnt hear any noise from adjacent rooms  Overall a great value  If you are not from NY and are worried about the location dont  It is very convenient near the park museums subway water very safe and in my opinion infinitely preferable to any typical tourist options 
P => Clean but Out of the Way Adult sons and I had a two bedroom suite facing an air shaft  True to description no real room to lounge except the beds which were consistent with the photos  Windows were not  Staff reasonably friendly and helpful  Nearby diner ok and will deliver  Next time I would stay closer to Battery Park or Mid Town  This location is a bit out of the way although it is calmer than Times Square for sure 
P => A shared bath that is not adjacent to your room in all my travels I have never experienced this  This hotel is in the midst of remodeling and our view was of the debris piled on the roof  Upon realizing the shared bath was down the hall and shared by  rooms I produced my handicap placard and explained there was no way I could negotiate down the hall in the middle of the night  It was after pm and we were in no condition to find another hotel  With much insistence from my husband and myself we were given a handicap accesible room and told there was an addition   fee per night for the private bathroom  This has got to be a violation of the laws relating to disabled persons  Perhaps I didnt investigate enough but in  years of travel this is something I had never encountered even in the most economy grade hotels  The room was nice and newly remodeled and the location was good  
P => Exceeded our Expectations     We stayed at Belleclaire Hotel for  nights and could not fault it  The location is perfect   close to Central Park and to the Subway and the staff are welcoming and accommodating  As there were three of us we had a two bedroom apartment with one bathroom  The rooms do not have a door connecting them but had  x Queen Sized beds and were spacious and comfortable  The bathroom is small and I would imagine would be difficult for groups of more than  or  and the person sleeping in the room with the bathroom did have interruptions as the rest of us needed to go during the night We had a room at the back of the hotel so were not affected by the reations  We couldnt hear any noise at all from the street and as it was hot had the air conditioning on during the night the one in our room was extremely old and noisy and needs replacing though  Overall we were delighted with our choice and would definitely return 
P => Perfect stay perfect location great price We just loved the Hotel BelleClaire We were worried about sharing a bathroom but we found that was no problem the bathroom was very clean  We had a small room but the bed was very comfy with the all white bedding and was very clean  The staff was very nice and the location is awesome Great places to eat from Shake shack for burgers and fries to gourmet italian dinners  
P => Brilliant   rooms location  We stayed at Belleclaire for  nights and throughly enjoyed ourselves  It was a very reasonable price too The hotel is having reation work but we were not disturbed at all The room was spacious with a private bathroom we paid a bit more for that Brilliant location right near Central Park   we explored the whole city and liked the part Upper Westside that the hotel was in the best Only downside is that the air conditioning fan was very loud but luckily we didnt need to use it be in the height of summer this would have put me off but I loved the hotel  
P => Good location   tolerable for the price  We stayed her with our teenage dhter to do some sightseeing  It is an old hotel with small rooms  We changed rooms initially because the first room was too dirty  The staff was very accommodating The rooms are not quiet  You do have to choose your room carefully  Our room was on an ally side and we listened to cats howl much of the night  The hotel is close to the Natural History Museum  We were able to walk to Lincoln Center and enjoy an outdoor concert  tour Central park find the Dakota and the quotImaginequot mosaic  It is very residential in this area so there are many places to eat and drink plus theres a neighborhood grocery nearby We chose this hotel because of the price and location and for the fact that my wifenative New Yorker loves the older hotels  
P => Great home base for exploring NYC The biggest assets of the Hotel Bellclaire are its excellent location at th and Broadway  blocks from the Red Line train and its very friendly and helpful staff  We were lucky enough to stay in a King size room on the top floor one of the quotturretsquot and the view up and down Broadway was amazing Rooms are small in general but not for NYC standards  Bedding is extremely comfortable everything was very clean and the bathroom amenities were really upscale  Its always a bit of a wait for the very small elevator but not really that big of a deal  Free WiFi is a nice added touch  We will definitely return here on our next trip to Manhattan  
P => Its ok   especially for the price  Id stay there again I wasnt overly blown away by the hotel but it was a great value for the price and neighborhood Pros comfortable beds clean eclecticeuropean designcalm neighborhood close to Central Park friendly staff hardwood floors good size room for NYC refrigerator free wifiCons the main heatcooling system seemed very close to our room and made a constant humming noise we had a view of a brick wall outside the windowOverall it was ok  If you have a higher budget you can always stay somewhere nicer but for the money it was pretty ent  I dont think you can find much better for the price  
P => Stay away from the Belleclaire Ive never been displeased with a hotel EVER  and Ive traveled around the world for both business and pleasure  Sure sometimes a room could be larger or the staff better but theres always a lot to like  But the Belleclaire however is a nighte overcrowded bizarre smells in the halls and rooms beware the cleaners they used rubbing alcohol to clean the rooms and as an elderly woman this caused my eyes to tear uncontrollably undergoing reation and cheap practices  The room service was from some terrible diner around the corner  And the hotel is currently undergoing reation which they didnt tell us before we stayed  We were forced to stay on a floor where the reation was currently in progress  To top this all off the hotel staff is rude and unhelpful  I couldnt wait to leave the hotel when our group departed  There are much better hotels on the upper west side  
P => A great choice for NYC travel will be back My family stayed in the  people suite for  nights at the beginning and again at the end of ust  I must confess I did book a second more expensive hotel for the  nights at the end of the month in case the hotel was disappointing  I quickly canceled that booking after our first stay at Belleclaire the hotel is very good our room was big for NYC standards clean and had everything you  need plus  LCD tv sets and an iPod sound system Negative points were the lift only one is working so be prepared to waiting if you are on a high floor and the taxi booking for our trip to JFK turned out to be for a  seater were   Other than that we are very happy with the Belleclaire and will keep it in our address book for further trips to New York  Final tip the area is very nice and full of eating places but our personal choice goes to la Bettola an Italian restaurant on Amtserdam avenue just around the corner from the hotel try the quotfarrotto with mushroomsquot you will be delighted  
P => A Great Inexpensive Choice I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of my room at such an inexpensive price I booked a queen bed room with shared bath  The hotel is in a perfect location Upper West Side  blocks from the subway and is impeccably clean and very comfortable  The room was very large for a city hotel  I was a little nervous about having a shared bathroom but the bathroom was extremely clean and shared among  rooms only  My room key opened a door to a mini corridor which provided access to  arate rooms and the shared bathroom  It made me feel very comfortable as a solo female traveler that the bathroom was only accessible for the  rooms sharing it  The room was spacious with a very comfortable bed and nice linens  The staff was friendly and courteous  My room was on the th floor near the back of the building and was very quiet  I will definitely stay at this hotel again  
P => Has a European feel The Hotel Belleclaire is seriously a hidden gem  I am not someone that requirea alot of frills when I stay at a hotel   I merely expect a comfortable bed clean roomsheets when I request them amp helpfulcourteous staff if I were to need something  The Hotel Belleclaire has all of theseOne thing to simply remember when reserving a room at the Hotel Belleclaire is get a room with its own bathroom  Some rooms share bathrooms which is not something I want to do when on vacation Without boring you I will break this down with the Pros amp Cons   Pros    Great Location with a block of  different subway stops amp straight up Broadway if you were to take a taxi  Very Comfortable Bed if you are familiar with Crowne Plaza beds then you will appreciate amp enjoy the beds here  Staff is awesome Cons    Small Bathrooms no necessarily a con but unless youve traveled to Europe amp experienced there bathrooms then these bathrooms will be small to you  Obviously an old building its NY amp Id expect this but the rooms have hard wood floors so things can make more noise When the Intercontinental in Time Square is pushing over  a night the Hotel Belleclaire at half the price is well worth it amp is only a few subway stops away  
P => Splendid competitively priced hotel I stayed at the Belleclaire for one week with five friends  We didnt expect much since the price was very low for a Manhattan hotel  But the hotel surprised us in a very positive way We were a group of young people who are used to staying in expensive hotels with our parents and we all agreed that this hotel offered an amazing quality for an exceptionally reasonable price The rooms are very clean the cleaning lady comes every day and towels and sheet are also changed daily  The beds could be be a bit larger but since noone of us is  meters tall this was no problem The hotel also pays a lot of attention to details  The room was equipped with an ipod docking station which we enjoyed a lot  The TVs are nice flat screens and the red back part of the bed looks lovely  We had free wireless internet although the speed was subprime to say the least at peak times The staff was very friendly and fulfilled all of our wishes like looking for restaurant numbers  The other guests were nice as well for some reason a lot of flight attendends reside in the Belleclaire There is a bus station just  minute from the hotel and the subway lines  and  are  minutes away There is no question the Belleclaire Hotel offers the most bang for the buck in NYCI can highly recommend it 
P => A pleasant surprise Since this is a  star rated hotel we werent expecting much and moreover as its New York we thought itd be rather sub par   however we were pleasantly surprised by the condition of the hotel the quality of the room and the service we received  We stayed for  nights from th y and enjoyed every moment  The hotel is located   blocks from Central Park  All major tourist areas are only a short subway ride away Our room was spacious had a huge bed with a big flat screen telly on the wall  Theres no kettle in the room so remember to take your own Tips  Food portions in the US in general are HUGE just ask for a SLICE of pizza and youll see what i mean  Theres a little greasy spoon cafe round the corner from Hotel Belleclaire called Big Als   try their breakfast menu   its relatively cheap huge portions and above all   good food  You have to tip nearly everyone in the US   like everytime you receive a service What you  find is that somemost bars and restaturants will automatically add a    gratuity charge on your bill  This can be quite annoying especially when the service hasnt been anything special eg  a waiter taking your order and bringing food to you without any other interaction doesnt really warrant an   gratuity charge  But hey ho its ingrained in the american culture Overall very satisfied with the hotel and staff  Would definitely stay again  
P => Loved this hotel and the surroundings My husband and I stayed at this gorgeous hotel for  nights in ust  and we just loved everything about it  We had the most wonderful huge room with a view of Broadway  We had some noise but that is to be expected with that location  The location on upper west side is fantastic and you have everything just outside the door  We have since stayed on upper east side but I prefer the west side  The diner in the same building is great for sandwiches and cakes  
P => Fantastic Hotel great staff My girlfriend and i spent  nights at the belleclaire  We were delighted when we arrived to a friendly staff and a very helpful bell boy  we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a superior suite cause the room was not ready when we arrived  The or is wonderful beds were very comfy and having a fridge was a plus  The cleaning staff was great and very trustworthy the diner across the street is great  The shake shack is two blocks away and has the most amazing burgers around  i would gladly stay again and hope to go back very soon  
P => Great Value Great Service We stayed on the UWS on two consecutive weekends because we had some functions to attend there  The Belleclaire was in the perfect location for us  As a bonus we were walking distance from the Hudson promenade with a great view of the y th fireworks  The staff was always helpful and eager to be more helpful  They did their best to satisfy requests for room locations and all the rooms  we stayed in were quiet regardless of orientation  The first room had some cleaning lapses in the bathroom but after that the rooms were clean  Tip Only one passenger elevator has been in service for the past five months  Use the freight elevator or stay on a low floor and use the stairs  
P => Double room a good bargain great location We just stayed at the Belleclaire for  days and had a good experience  We had one of their  rooms that consists of two adjoining rooms with a door in between  Both rooms had a flat screen TV and an AC the kind you can easily adjust by choosing the temperature yourself  We have a  year old son so it was very nice to be able to give him his own space   good for him and even better for us We never heard one single peep from other rooms or any city noise  There is reation going on but we never heard any of it from our room  The beds are comfortable  The location is great     subway stop two short blocks away at th St which we used often to zip downtown Zabars a great grocery is just three blocks away and Central Park and Riverside Park to the west are both short walks away  Only downsides the bathroom we had is small and their free wifi is painfully slow     bring a book to read as you load pages  Other than these two things for families wanting two arate rooms I thought this was a very good space for us and I would book it again with no hesitation especially because of the primo location on the Upper West Side  
P => Disappointing We booked a superior King room for  nights that was very small with no drawers no storage space  Tiny bathroom  Okay king bed  Awful rubber pillows  Great view of Hudson River  We left after one night  
P => Good location clean  I booked this hotel for  nights after seeing the positive reviews on Tripadvisor and would feel confident in recommending it to anyone along as they were aware of the following  It doesnt look that great from outside as they are in the middle of reating it and you have a great view of scaffolding out of the window however its New York and you dont spend a great deal of time in your room  I loved the upper west side but BEWARE there is a fire station close to the hotel and those boys are in amp out all night long responding to anything amp everthing sirens blaring a good nights sleep undisturbed was not possible  Also after  nights are room key expired so everytime we returned to the th floor we couldnt get into our room  Despite the staff trying to reset the key this continued to happen  The room was very clean and I thought the housekeeping was excellent apart from one day when the room wasnt cleaned  The Manhattan Diner across the street is welcoming with good food they serve huge portions and its so handy toilets need attention use your own at the hotel We stayed in a two bedroom suite and through the scaffolding could actually see the Manhattan Diner and the street  It was clear the some of rooms only had a view of our bathrom window which wouldnt appeal  Overall its clean the concierge was very helpful and its good value for New York prices its a  minute walk from th st stn where the brillant subway will take you anywhere  
P => Great Area Hard to locate This was a trip for me and  kids age    The cab fare from Newark was brutal  book a car service if you can  The cabbie being from Jersey wasnt sure where he was going and the hotel was hard to spot due to construction but we did find it  I booked the quotsuitequot which suited it us well  I was a bit freaked by the web site saying some rooms had shared baths but the suite has one to itself which with kids was a must  The suite itself is basically  rooms but with a partition wall with and opening  read no door  During down time it is pretty much impossible to have one room quiet or watch  different shows on TV as there is not way to stop the sound  But we werent there for TV right The hotel was under construction with one working elevator and a service elevator for use  Luckily we were on the nd floor so could use the stairs  I  have found this more inconvenient if we were higher up The room itself is no frills but i wasnt there to hang out in my room  There were  good quality beds a couple of chairs and a desk under each of  flat screen TVs  The maids forgot us one day and we had a backed up toilet another day  The maintenence fellow was very quick to respond to the plugged loo  Also it was chilly and we had to get him in to turn on the radiators  dont try this at home  Again he was quick and effecient even bringing a space heater  Street noise was a nuisance because i am not accoustomed to noise and sirens all night long  but again NYC city that never sleeps  obviously not the hotels fault  And i suspect it was still quieter than other neighborhoods where we could have stayed The location is great with quick and easy access to subway and bus service  Definately get a metro card if you want to save some bucks  There are  reasonable kets close by and we had a small fridge  so milk snacks and such in the room were no problem  It also felt like a really safe neighborhood although we did see a girl get arrested at the restaurant around the corner for trying to skip out on a bill  I had no qualms about walking in the area at night or coming off the subway at night Walking distance to Central Park Natural History Museum and a quick cross town bus to the Met and the Guggenheim  I thought that all in all it met my needs and would definately stay there again if the opportunity arises  
P => I had to crumble over my parents bed to go to the toilet We booked a room for  with  bedrooms  It had only one toilet that was located in my parents bedroom so when I had to go to the toilet at night I had to enter their room and crawl over their bed to reach the bathroom   Location of the hotel is great near the subway and many restaurants and delis everywhere The hotel looked better on the internet and there was also constructions going on  We are not staying in this hotel again  
P => Great Location Clean and Safe Neighbourhood The hotel was very clean friendly and very helpful staff  The doorman is amazing and knows what he is talking about Our room was very nice clean and well orated  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a shared just outside the door  It wasnt bad sharing a  piece bath cause I think there was only one other room using it and there was never a problem of someone being in it when you needed it  The only thing is the sink is in your room so you have to wait to get back into the room to wash your mitts  The neighbourhood was fabulous  Tons of boutiques and restaurants everywhere  Very safe to walk around in  Close to Central Park Times Square and not a long subway ride to anything else  Would stay here again  
P => Love this Hotel This is the second time I have stayed at the Belleclaire Hotel  Each time has been wonderful  The front desk staff and doormen are very friendly and helpful  The first time we stayed we did not get a room with a view so I was sure to request a city view room this time and we had an excellent view  The room was very spacious clean and modern  We stayed in a  person suite  The location is fantastic great shopping and restaurants close by  I have to recommend Loehmans for great bargain designer shopping and two restaurants that are favorites of ours Amsterdam Ale House at  Amsterdam Ave just a block from the hotel  They have excellent food very reasonable prices and any beer you could imagine  For a special night out check out Vai www vairestaurant com The atmosphere here is very romantic and the food is unbelievably fresh All in all we will be staying at the Belleclaire Hotel each time we travel to NYC  You just cant beat the service location and rooms for the price 
P => Location Location Location  The heading says it all the Belleclaire Hotel is in a great spot on the Upper West Side in a priily upket residential area giving you wider tree lined streets clean and respectable neighbourhood  Our room on the th Floor No   deluxe queen had a view to the river and very little noise was clean and a comfortable bed slightly squeaky but we got used to it  Quality restaurants abound and the fresh fruit ketsuperket on the corner is very handy  The Manhatten Diner on the opposite corner is good for breakfast and coffee is reasonable they will deliver right to your room if required  We chose to walk all over the city but the subway was close by and taxis always at the ready  Central Park is a couple of blocks one way and the river is about the same in the opposite direction  Staying in a highly residential area gives the tourist a chance to take a step back from the busy end of town times square etc but still be close enough to enjoy it all  New York City is everything you would expect and more  
P => Super Loud     I should start by saying that you wont find too many hotels in New York at the  per night price that we got here  However that comes with many annoyances   the front desk staff is less than helpful example I wanted to order dinner in after a long day and the staff person who picked up had no restaurant recommendations     she said there was a menu book in my room which there wasnt and then without telling me what she was doing transferred me to a food delivery service   obviously just to get me off the phone   who of course asked me to place an order     there is construction in the hotel out Internet did not work and only one main elevator works and it is really slow so put your patient hat on  In addition our room overlooked Broadway one of the busiest streets in NYC  I felt like I was sleeping next to a truck stop  Also we had our baby with us and the crib they put in our room seemed very old and not all that safe  We ended up having her stay in the bed with us instead In my opinion I think there are better deals to be had   pay a little bit more and get a lot more for it  
P => Convenient location good hotel Four of us stayed in the two bedded suite which was very comfortable  Note no door between two rooms and also has only one bathroom as the room coould sleep six this could be a problem  Nice spacious room away from the street so no car noise  Room also had a fridge so was handy to keep some food and drinks as no cafe in hotel  Convenient to subway into centre as well as a few stores and diner across street Booked grayline hop on bus in small hotel shop but could not offer City tours which we were disappointed with as we hit a very wet two days and then saw more of the City tour buses had better roof cover  Most of the Grayline buses has so much advertising posters on the sides you could hardly see out and certainly not take photos so wait till you get to town to purchase and see what weather is like  Overall a very pleasant stay and good comfortable hotel 
P => Great Hotel in good location Stayed for  nights in  room suite room  Good sized rooms with nice bathroom   Only complains were scaffolding across front windows so no view at allMy Brother didnt like the room My wife and I in the rear room had small window with no view and ac unit outside that started and stopped all the time day and night   On hindsight I should of asked for a room change but didnt want to make a fuss  My wife liked the room and the ac didnt bother her at all  Have stayed here before and the staff are great very helpfull and nice   Maid service was excellent bedding and towels changed daily   Small gift shop in lobby with helpfull staff  will arrange car to airport for you  limo hire etc no problems at all Great location with good shopping and things to do  Superket and newsagent on your doorstep   Plenty places in area to eat  put a few pounds on  To sum up A great hotel in good area but pity about our room location  better with room overlooking Broadway  still get noise with traffic and fire engines but anything is better than a brick wall and noisy ac unit  Would go back to stay   
P => Great choice We spent  night at the hotel and had a very nice experience apart from the first night For the first night we were just my husband and myself so we stayed at room  we did have a problem with the radiator and on hindsight we should have complained but it was late and we were too tired and ided it might get better as we tried to turn it off completely  It did not work and it was a very hot night inside the room even if out there was around s The room is an ok size specially if we talking NYC and the bathroom was newly reated and very nice good light and nice tile The next day my sister in law join us and we moved to room   It is a quiet very nice size room the radiator was working perfectly and the room was clean and tidy  the only disappointment was the bathroom lights only ceiling lights made it impossible to do any ent make up jobThis bathroom is not as nicely finished as the one in room  but the size was ok it was clean and the pressure of the shower was rather a surprise as it was GREATAll in all if our stay was not perfect I have to say it was our own fault for not changing rooms that first night The only bad thing about the hotel were the pillows I will stay at the Belleclaire again just make sure I will bring my pillows with meBoth ia and Hector at the front desk were specially nice 
P => A nice stay but read the fine print    I stayed at the hotel for about a week along with a family member on the whole the place was nice enough  The good very clean good location nice staff reasonable services good price good neighborhood knowledgeable concierge  The bad the place is in the middle of construction and the elevators arent working PLUS the elevator that is working is TINY room keys stop working randomly and you have to go back down to the front and get re keyed next to a major intersection and the windows are thin so you get sirens car alarms etc  throughout the night and there are people who live in the hotel that are kind of sketchy  Here is where the fine print comes in I got an economy room and didnt look closely enough to see that it was a shared bathroom and shower between  rooms  So   I would probably spend an extra few bucks the next time and get a room that has a private bathroom  Otherwise its a very reasonable place to stay in Manhatten just go into it knowing its quirky  
P => Fantastic stay at the Belleclaire Me and my partner spent  fantastic nights at the Belleclaire  We stayed in a Deluxe King on the th floor meaning we had fantastic views  The room was massive   probably larger than most Manhattan studio appartments  Our bathroom was quite small but lovely and clean and functional  Our room was spotlessly clean with a very comfortable bed  Great turndown service too   as well as the usual mints etc they give you a little card saying what the weather will be like the next day Very helpful front desk staff they pointed us to the most amazing food ket about a block south from the hotel  Great location   you feel like youre in a quet residential area which is just what I wanted from my NYC holiday but its so close to all the sights and a few blocks from Central Park  Try the Manhattan Diner opposite   great pancakes 
P => Good Deal For The Money We spent three nights recently in a Deluxe King at the Belleclaire  The initial room we were given   was not acceptable   it was fairly small didnt look anything like the Deluxe King rooms on their website and had a noisy exhaust vent right outside the window that sounded like a train when it kicked in every few minutes  I wouldnt have slept a wink  The hotel promptly moved us to Room   which was very nice and spacious   just like the pictures in the website  The bed was comfy the free wireless was a perk and overall we were very pleased  The th Street location is terrific   a nice neighborhood kets and subways nearby   a far cry from the hem of Times Square and Grand Central  The st room merited a  star the latter a  star   average a  star  We would consider again if guaranteed the latter room  
P => Quirky but swell I really liked ths hotel though I have no clue as to how it got its  star rating  The room was large beautifully designed really clean and quiet even though it looked right over the street  The TV was a perfect flat screen and they had free wifi  It was very well located too in a fluid and lively neighborhood and within easy walking distance of one of the most interesting parts of Manhattan BUT  the bathroom was sooooooo teeny you couldnt wash or shave or bush your teeth unless you knelt on the toilet 
P => Great hotel great location This was the second time I stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire and it was another great experience  They have re done all the rooms with modern or  Our room had a king size on the first floor which was nice because we didnt have to wait for the elevator since one of them was out  Bed was comfortable rooms also had nice flat screen tvs and a mini refrigerator  Nice bathrooms clean bath tub was a bit narrow but nothing major  Front desk staff was courteous and knowledgeable  The weather was warm when we were there for that time of year so the room got pretty hot but we just cracked a window and all was fine Only two blocks from the subway and close to shoppingfoodbarsgrocery etc  Subway makes it easy to get anywhere in the city from this Upper West Side location  Also just a few blocks from Central Park  Free wireless internet was nice perk as well  Great value hotel for the location  
P => Great Location Great Bed Affordable Id make another reservation  My husband  teenagers and I slept in a quotsleeps quot room  The room was divided by a wall without a door with two full sized beds a flat screened tv table with chair on one side and on the other another full sized bed flat screen tv drawers and table with a chair and a full sized mirror  The walls were painted Ochre to coordinate with the carpet that had hints of that same colour  The carpets were a little drab in oration but not stained  The beds were covered in white linens comfortable duvet and fantastic pillows  I slept great  Movies phone calls playing the games using WIFI were all additional in cost  No breakfast was included but nearby restaurants can deliver  We ate out at a grill across the street  It was very crowded but the food was good  Parking is expensive  We paid  for one night  We drive a mini van  We suggest taking a smaller car if you can  The room has a small refrigerator  The location is fantastic and near many local attractions but wear comfy shoes if you plan to walk  Im in my s and out of shape and managed just fine at first but by the end of the day my feet killed me  The elevator is tiny and we ended up walking the narrow stairs most of the time  The staff are quiet but helpful  They could smile more  The hotel has character and despite its age is perfectly good  The shampoo comes in little tiny jars and I would recommend bringing your own brand  Perfect for location  Noisy street outside  People are up all night and the sirens woke me up a few times from the fire engines  But its a city and thats how a city sounds and to be expected  No privacy door between us and my teens so not the best room for a romantic time with the other half when you bring the kids along  I recommened the room for price and location  
P => Very friendly good service very clean  Ive stayed at the Belleclaire Hotel for only one night in uary   Right when I got in the hotel I could see it would be a nice stay  The lobby is very nice and clean  The staff there is very friendly  When I got to my room it was very clean good temperature and just as it looked on the pictures on the web site  I would definitively return to this hotel when Ill go back to NYC  The metro station is only  blocks away theres the Manhattan Dinner right accross the street and Central Park is in walking distance  Reserve with confidence  
P => Good wibe Whenever I travel to the city I usually try to find a hotel with some character that will give me the nostalgia of the city  I chose this hotel specifically for this reason and was not disappointed at all  Compared to the other hotels in the price range of USD I found this one among the best  Rooms are spotless and are very large for a NYC hotel  We stayed in a two queen deluxe and it fitted to adults just fine  The flat screen TV is more like a PC monitor but nevertheless creates a nice modern touch in a very typical s NYC room  Wood floors and large windows add tones of character  I stayed at a room overlooking Broadway and the Fire Station  When combined the two will be well enough to keep you up all night  If you are a light sleeper but still want to feel the wibe of the city when you are awake get some earplugs  Otherwise ask for a room facing the back of the building Lobby area and the hallways of the hotel might be misleading as a first impression but this changes as you walk in and out  It feels as if you are going to your apartment rather than a hotel room  I liked that  Location is great  Right on Broadway and about a very enjoyable min walk to Central Park with lots of places to eat on the way  Very close to the subway and plenty of busses stop right in front of the hotel  The dinner across the street is very good and convenient  They even deliver to your room as the hotel does not have a restaurant  There are plenty of places other places to eat around  You can also find a few grocery stores liqueur store and book store all within mins walking distance towards the Beacon Theatre I think this is a very nice hotel with plenty of personality  But keep in mind that it will not offer you the conveniences of  star chains but rather a well priced room with a good wibe  Hard to call it a boutique hotel though  
P => loved it this hotel is perfect and the staff is sooo nice  they upgraded us to a room with an amaing view of broadway and a king size bed because it was my birthday and first time visiting new york  this hotel is just the lobby and rooms upstairs but thats really all you need  the restaurant across the street delivers to the hotel but i recommend big nicks a few blocks away because they have awesome food and a huge menu  yes the radiator is a little loud sometimes and the street below can be kind of noisy but you get used to it and its new york of course its a little louder than what youre used to  we slept with the window open most nights so it was probably a little louder because of that  the staff also let us keep our luggage there after we checked out the last day so we could get some shopping in before we left  also they clean the room daily and leave mints and a little card on the bed with the expected temperature for the next day  this was an awesome trip and the hotel made it even better  i was sad to leave but yeah if youre high maintenance and like to complain about little things then you probably shouldnt stay here haha    
P => Good hotel We stayed at hotel Belleclaire hotel New York from      The hotel has the perfect location on th street right near the  subway on th  minute walk  Upon arrival we were greeted by the doorman and entered the nice clean lobby  Obviously newly orated  The hotel is simple in that it just has the lobby and then the rooms upstairs but to be honest thats all you need in NY  At check in we were given a free upgrade to a king size room I was still expecting it to be small but was pleasently suprised Huge king size bed spacious room with desk flat screen TV fridge erate walk in closet and big en suite with bath  The bathroom had fresh clean fluffy towels everyday and was well cleaned  the room was cleaned thoroughly everyday and at night chocolates were left on our pillow along with a card showing the next days temperature nice touch  There is a  hour diner across the road which has everything food wise and you can also get a delivery to our room  We didnt avail of this  All in all Id recommend this hotel as it is quite reasonably priced       per night in the middle of Manhattan and a stroll to Cental park  
P => Affordable New York ided at very last moment on a suprise trip to New York My wife had always wanted to see Central Park in the snow So on a whim biiked flights then started trawling for Hotels we had stayed in New York before but at midtown hotelsalways found them a tad small Took inspiration for West side from A Night at the MuseumFound Belleclaire website booked hotel and off we went with Pam oblivious to our destination Hotel is exactly as represented on website  Affordable  comfortable quirky central heating and spacious rooms ours was doube queen deluxe  Free wi fi in room ent tv Radio with Ipod docking station Only down side was no teacoffee facilities on site  not a problem though coffee bars within yards  nearest Starbucks  blocks away Central Park just a short walk  mins  American Museum of Natural History  mins  subway  mins Dakota building agian     minutes depending on your walking speed Check in and check out very efficientAll in all a very pleasant stay and will return to Belleclaire Convenient Affordable and way above average New York mid range hotel  
P => Great experience Our family was really happy with this hotel  The family suite had two bedrooms which was great for  adults and  kids  The staff was great the rooms were newly reated and in good shape and the location was convenient to shops restaurants and subway stops  We would definitely return 
P => No Frills But Great Value I stayed here with my husband and  kids for  nights in y   I am quite picky and didn t want to stay anywhere too basic but equally I didn t fancy paying New York prices for a hotel we weren t going to be spending very much time in The Belleclaire was absolutely perfect for us because it was such good value for money  We had a family room for  two interconnecting bedrooms plus ensuite bathroom  The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate  Both of the bedroom windows looked out on the quadrangle in the centre of the building  This made it a little dark but again not a problem  The room and bathroom were spotless  Some thought had gone into the or and interesting modern furnishings  The only negative thing I can say about the room is that I found the AC quite noisy  I was awake a lot of our first night  However in all fairness we were straight off the plane from London and rather jetlagged  So this is more likely to account for the bad night s sleep I also liked the location  It is perfect for families  We felt safe walking around the neighbourhood with our children after dark  The Manhattan Diner across the road is an authentic NY diner  Art o style with massive breakfasts and lots of pies  We found other very good places to eat nearby  Isabellas    a st bistro on Wth and Columbus  Also on Columbus  Ocean Grill  for top notch seafood  There is also a grocery storedeli on the same block as the hotel heading south on Broadway which has a huge choice of salads and sandwiches to take away We were unaware of any street noise or sounds from the corridor or neighbouring rooms  Nor was the small elevator a problem there is a staircase  There is no restaurant no lounge area apart from a couple of sofas in the lobby and generally there are no  frills  to the hotel  However I will give it a  star rating because it is clean comfortable in a very nice part of town and excellent value for money  I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again  
P => Great for families Having read mixed reviews on this hotel we were pleasantly surprised with this accomodation  Located in a nice clean and safe area all amenities close and subway within walking distance  Best of all the hotel was clean and friendly the room for  people was excellent  Our children were in the same room in  doubles which was arated by a wall to our own double area  Small but modern and clean would definitely go back  Manhattan diner over the road also perfect for families and extremely welcoming  
P => Good value great location Hotel Belleclaire is located on Upper West side just two blocks away from nearest subway station  The area itself is nice services diners superkets etc located close by  Hotel doesnt offer breakfast but  h Manhattan Diner just across the street has great and affordable breakfast also delivered without any extra surcharges Hotel has been reated recently it was originally built early s and rooms are clean modern and practical with tv and iPod dock with radio  There is also a small fridgerator for free use not a minibar hair dryer and iron  During our stay it was freezing in NY but out room was confortable and warm  Air conditioning worked well too  However at times there was some noise coming from air conditioning andor plumming Staff is also very helpful and rooms are cleaned often  Rooms are reasonably priced for Manhattan  
P => excellent value a safe clean comfortable hotel We boked a family suite which was spacious for  people warm and light  The beds are very very comfortable the lift is tiny the staff are very very helpful and the location was great Fantastic restaurant downstairs called Big Nics 
P => An OK Hotel in a good location My  yr old son and I stayed for four nights before Xmas   Our economy twin room was fine   pretty large by NY standards clean clean linen and towels warm despite F one night and the bathroom shared by two other rooms was kept clean at all times  A large fridge and large LCD TV were fine free WI fi and the only thing missing of note being a room safe  The windows whilst not soundproofed to the best standards kept out most of the NY backdrop apart from those NY fire engine horns The reception area looked recently modernised and there always seemed to be at least two staff on reception who were helpful and courteous at all times  A small gift shop in the lobby also had internet access PCs for  for  mins and able to print out online tickets etc  plus theyll arrange a limo to the airport if you want   at  we thought it expensive but the drive out to JFK was log jammed took forever and I dread to think how much it would have cost in a yellow cab The location was great    yds to the nearest subway local Line  and  blocks to another good diners and a superket and shops very close and good restaurants too with Central Park in easy walking distance I think Ive worked out why this hotel gets such mixed reviews here   I looked in the doorway of some other rooms on our floor when the cleaners were doing their thing   its clear some rooms have been modernised whilst others havent  Ours was classed by the hotel but not on the internet booking site as economy so I suppose not only do you pay your money and take your choice but it will be worthwhile making sure what type of room you are going to end up in especially with some other reviewers comments about the hotel messing up some booking arrangements As for previous comments about the small lifts   big bloody deal and theres a goods lift down the corridor if youre into big open spaces Overall we did not have a single issue or problem at this hotel and Id recommend it for the budget traveler looking for good value in a good location  
P => Liked the location but an older hotel The location of the hotel is great being in the Upper West Side away from the chaos of Times Square and like everyone said walking distance to the subway which we took to get to everything The thing is   and this is just me   it took a little getting used to an older boutique hotel as Im accustomed to newer chain hotels that are new and spic and span  This was my first time in New York so I wasnt used to the old building construction stairwells and never wanted to look outside because the view was of a dirty alley and rooftop trash  I was definitely new to the old heater   we had no idea how to use it and it spatted amp spurted throughout the night  Nothing bad on the hotel just thought Id mention to viewers who are not suited for this type of hotel  Yes the elevator was a tad bit small and I wasnt a fan of the dark grimy green bathroom tile but we got used to it  For those who are OK with this type of hotel I would recommend  
P => Reasonable Prices on the Upper West Side I stayed here for a conference I was attending that was in lower Manhattan  The subway was just  blocks away and theres good restaurants in the area  It took me a night to figure out how to use the radiator in the room but luckily they had upgraded me as I checked in I didnt ask and I ended up with a  bedroom and there was a heater in the other room I was able to use  The bathroom was chilly and a bit dark and their products werent anything Id heard of before and smelled ok  Unfortunately they took away my shower gel after the first night and then didnt replace it until the rd nite  The halls are small and I believe that there are permanent residents in the building who have the better views  But if the price you pay is what you want to keep low then this is a good spot  I did not get a room where you shared a bathroom   that creeped me out and if the bathroom in my room was an indication of the bathroom to be shared then I wouldnt want to share it  
P => Sketchy Very disappointing The pictures online look nothing like the actual hotel and to say that this hotel has been updated is really stretching it There is no restaurant or bar in the hotel and the lobby is tiny  The hallways are very narrow and the appearance makes you feels as if rats are going to be running past you at any minute  The  elevators are the smallest imagineable They were broken while we were there one day which made you pretty nervous to get on them the rest of the time  The bathrooms were very old and simple  Even in ember the room was extremely hot so we ran the AC which made loud noises each and every night keeping us awake  The bellman flagged us a cab on our first day in NY only it was one of the quotunregulated black cabsquot that ripped us off  We were charged   for a  mile ride  Needless to say we didnt ask for their help for the rest of the trip  We would never stay here again nor would we recommend it to anyoneThe Manhattan Diner was great It was across the street and has wonderful food and a friendly staff  The Gin Mill bar is nearby and fun and the Stand Up NY Comedy Club is nearby  However it is very small dirty and has a  drink minimum   the drinks were terrible 
P => Ripped Me Off I booked a room at the Belleclaire Hotel for Thanksgiving weekend  Later I was offered a friends and family rate at another hotel  I called the Belleclaire back only hours after booking my room to cancel my reservation  Unfortunately the Belleclaire did not keep a record of my cancellation and CHARGED ME FOR THE ROOM ANYWAYS I corresponded with Jenny Erstein who refused to refund this bogus charge  Avoid doing business with this hotel  With so many other great places to stay in NYC  why deal with shady establishments 
P => Excellent Hotel I enjoyed every aspect of my stay at this hotel First location is excellent The hotel is located in a quaint district close tosubway and broadway never have to wait too long for a taxiresidential area between  parks surrounded by beautiful distinct elegant buildings Service is phenomenal for a non pretentious hotel like this Very professional very attentive Theres always somebody to open you the door to greet you and to wish you a niceevening in town The hotel is constantly almost assidously kept clean True the elevators are small and reaching your room in the floor plan maze can be a bit of a nuisance butsurely it hasnt been for me One more thingthe radiatorin the room being it of a very old kind can be a bit noisy The tip is to rotate the knob at its left until it gets quiet The room was exactly as described on the internetwith a lot of unexpected little extras that made itbeyond expectation You have an empty fridge tofill with your drinks no extrasI dockquotLCD TVA beautiful desk hrs room delivery at ent pricesand excellent complimentary Wi Fi Telephone Furniture is carefully chosenor is sober and elegant The view of the Hudsonriver from my window was spectacular Every time I reached my room it wasspotlessly clean and a note with the followingdays exp  temperature and  sweets wereto be found daily I will surely consider this option for my future trips to NY My congratulations to the hotel management  
P => Great hotel Fantastic hotel for the price  Great location a couple of stops from Times Square on the express subway  We got a basic room with shared bathroom   clean adequate no problems with needing it and finding someone else using it  Room was clean and quite a ent size  Diner over the road was ideal for breakfast   great value  Would happily stay here again  
P => Best of value for a Budget price We booked into the Belleclaire expecting a very simple hotel only really needing a place to sleep while in Manhattan  We went for a standard Queen room with shared bath to hang onto our pennies but were very pleasantly surprised by the standard of the accomodation  Small things like a clock radio in the room DO make a difference  We had been dreading a shoebox but the room was a really ent size room for us both to stretch out outside the beds without touching the walls   this is still Manhattan and space is at a premium  Everything was clean and in good condition with crisp linen  The staff were very helpful the concierge excellent found us a good restaurant for a reasonable price near the Phantom As for location the hotel is a fair bit uptown but close to both th Line and nd St  Metro stops  and it was never an issue to get around  Theres a great diner with good food across the crossroads a cheerful bakery a few doors up and two pubs within staggering distance if downtown is too far away for your taste  Even the Park is only  blocks away and a fantastic ket is nearby on Columbus and th we went on a Sunday Ill be strongly recommending this hotel to my brother when he travels next month and to anyone else heading to NY  
P => Really good for value and service My wife  month old dhter and I just returned from  days staying at the Belleclaire  To be honest we werent expecting much this was similarly priced to other hotels which didnt look great We were very pleasantly surprised  From the really nice reception area and exceptionally helpful staff to the room   clean nice floors furnishings newly orated   it was great  I cant exaggerate how good the staff were   each morning we needed to have our babys bottles sterilised in a microwave and each morning they did it with a smile The only letdown was some noise from a generator or cooling fan on a building outside the room but even then they offered to move us  The room itself was quiet and very well furnished and everything worked including iPod dock nice TV and free Wifi The area is also great a lot quieter nicer and more affordable including great restaurants one block over on Amsterdam Avenue than downtown but just  blocks from an express subway which brings you to Times Square in about  minutes  Its about all you could ask for  
P => perfect for my family of  We just spent  nights at the Belleclaire and it was perfect for our needs  It was much more reasonable than other hotels that could accomodate our family of   We had a  bedroom suite which was plenty spacious for us and the amount of time we were in the room  We had our own bath  Yes the elevators are small   who cares We took our luggage up half of the family at the time  When it was just us we all rode together  That was no big deal  We must have had a remodeled room as the bathroom was completely tiled walls and floors the rooms looked much like the rooms on the website  My only complaintsuggestion is that they need a fan in the bathroom as the steamy shower leaves everything moist but we just opened the window a little  no big deal  The front desk staff was friendly and smiled and spoke each time we went through the lobby  The rooms were clean  I am paranoid of bed bugs in hotels and there was no sign of them so I was pleased  The beds were as comfortable as most hotel beds we had what we needed and while not a great view I enjoyed looking down at the people and traffic  We were so close to the subway and all kinds of good and reasonable food  The coffee cart on the street was only a dollar the burgerpizza place around the corner Nicks I believe was reasonable  There is a diner across the street but we did not try that  There are lots of parentsnannies out in the am with young children  It was a nice area and so accessible to everything you need  It was fun to walk to Central Park   and everywhere else  This was the perfect place for us to stay during this wonderful little excursion to the city  
P => Great experience and great location We stayed at the Belleclaire for  nights in a family room with two double beds in adjoining rooms with private bathroom It is a great little hotel in fantastic location in Upper West side  Subway is  mins away with lots of coffee shops delis and restaurants    chinese japanese italian greek   Best place for breakfast and lunch is Zabar about  mins from hotel Central Park is about   mins walk Probably the best value hotel Ive stayed in New York so far even better than staying midtown  
P => Exactly What we Wanted Stayed at BelleClaire for  nights and I was pleased that I had paid out for   rather than going with the cheap and cheerful option We had a private queen room with its own bathroom  DONT EXPECT SPACE or VIEWS in NYC All rooms are small and view is usually of a brick wall Friends style but that is NYC for you  Anyway you shouldnt be staying in you should be walking  miles per day seeing all the sights Our room was spotless and very authentic with NYC radiator   which we could control and aircon too   the ladies cleaned every day and changed our towels   and they even rearranged the pictures of my kids which I had brought with me on the dresser every day  We put our passports etc in the hotel safe at reception and they have a luggage store also for early arrivals or late departures which is handy and foc All staff very helpful   top tip buy your NYC souvenirs in Soho as the hotel giftshop can be a bit pricey If you want NYFD merchandise check it is original as they contribute to the fire bobby fund and they do a FAB job so deserve all the funds they can get Also dont pre book transfers in the UK get a yellow cab from JFK std price  each way Enjoy 
P => Way overpriced even for NYC Could be a lot better at these prices  Overall not bad but I would expect much more even in NYC  Somehow this property thinks it is much better than it is to be charging in the mid s for a night  It is an ok room that is at least clean  The lobby is minimal  The elevator is so old  Some of the rooms have been redone  Make sure you get one of those or dont stay here  
P => Great Location Nice Rooms Good Frontdesk Good PQ Close to Central Park  meters from Broadway  Rooms OK  Beds ok could be longer  I am   m  Plumbing OK  Joe Some doubt if the Window   boxtype Airco will be sufficient during summer heat but for now     Deg Celcius it was ok  Excellent free WiFi  Make sure you book a room with your own private bathroom  Quiet  No restaurant but a nice Cosi on the other side of Broadway  Shops around the corner  Metro and busses within  meters  Price Quality OK  
P => Great for the price We stayed here for  nights  The room was pretty good size and clean  The location was EXCELLENT Great ket downstairs and a great deli and burgerpizza place right outside the door  Bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean Only complaints were the elevator didnt fit my double stroller unless I took out both kids and folded it up  The other was the crib  I had requested a crib and never received a reply back regarding that  When we arrived I was told the crib would be an extra  a night  A little heads up on that would have been nice  
P => Great Hotel for the price Stayed here for three nights  Rooms were clean  Had a two bedroom  bathroom suite  Beds were very comfortable  Location was great  Two blocks from subway easy to get around  Website prices were lower than when we booked and they wouldnt honour the website price  I would stay here again but book through the internet 
P => Good Location Good Price Good location upper west side   Central park was within walking distance as was the subway  In ust I averaged   for my two nights   a Friday and Saturday  A room with two twin beds sink and a t v  You do share a bathroom with another room  I knew this and it was fine  I never ran into the other people though  However the bathroom was rather run down old and not too clean  Hole in the wall sink barely ran bathrub had permanent black scruffy stuff on the edge etc    The room was pretty nice updated and roomy enough for two easily see photos Ive provided  The structure is an old apartment building thus the shared bathroom  Some street noise in the A M  sirens cabs and such  Not too far from local bars and night life actually a good area for that  We were able to walk there as well  
P => Great hotel great location great price  Don t be put off by the stairwell Hotel Belleclaire was a really pleasant surprise  We had a room for  girls and it was a great room for   for a week between   Really nicely orated room with  tvs and iPod radio docking stations  It is a good location as it s close to the subway and central park  It s also close to a really good diner Manhatten diner I was worried about the hotel as it was so cheap compared to others but was pleasantly surprised  Booked through the hotel website for best deal  Only complaint was whn we checked in the receptionist asked for the wrong amount but as I had confirmation of the price quoted they had to honor that Stairwell and views from windows are awful but you don t go to New York to sit in your roomAll in all a great little hotel  
P => Great place great location This was the perfect spot for us to see and do all we came to NYC for   Yankee Stadium Central Park Times Square you name it   its just a subway ride or walk away  A word of caution   DO NOT get swindled at the Beacon Garage like we did   check with the front desk as to the best parking garages  Friendly staff very helpful 
P => Great location This is a good hotel in a fantastic location in a real New York neighborhood with a nice variety of cultures shops and cafes  Its an easy walk to Central Park and museums  Its not a place to sit in your room and look out the window its a place from which to enjoy the city  Its clean and comfortable and staff is friendly and helpful  The price is right  
P => Great for NY We had a wonderful  night stay at the Hotel Belleclaire  We reserved a queen with a private bath but were upgraded to a king sized bed  The room was very large with a desk and closet that would be very useful for a long stay though the bathroom was small  The elevator is very tiny so be prepared if you have a lot of luggage  The location is an easy walk to wonderful food central park and the American Museum of Natural History  
P => Nice bargain in a great neighborhood As a family of four we needed a suite of two roomswith its own bath  When we got there they told us thesmaller one that we booked was not available and gaveus the larger suite with one king size bed in one roomand two doubles in the other room  They were going tomove us to the smaller suite the next day but thencalled in the morning to say we could keep the largerroom at the same price  This turned out to be a bonusso it would be hard for me to complain about anything However there are some things that just go withstaying in an old building in NYC  The elevator andhallways are very tight and the bathroom very cramped We were lucky to have a room facing away from thestreet looking in to the rear court betweenbuildings  If you dont care about the lack of a viewyoull realize that this is a big plus because youcant hear the noise on the streets which includesfire engine sirens at all hours of the night  For alight sleeper this is essential to getting a goodnights sleep  We did not hear any noise from theadjacent rooms  Another reviewer did complain about the fact that thesuite only had one trashcan which seems minor but iskind of an inconvenience  Our rooms were adequatelylarge but the bathroom did not have any space otherthan the window sill for storing toiletries  Stillthe rooms were clean and left me little else tocriticize The location is fantastic  Its two blocks from thesubway station and there is a great variety ofrestaurants and food establishments nearby includingone of NYs landks Zabars  You can go out andhead in any direction and find interesting shopsrestaurants and entertainment venues such as a movietheater or Lincoln Center  For the price of  per night it would be reallyhard to beat this place in NYC  Recognize that you arenot staying at a four star hotel and youll be veryhappy with the ision  
P => Frustrated and Conflicted This is definately a great hotel clean close to eats subway and the price a steal  We had issues checking in though and somehow our check in date got lost in translation and they didnt have a room for us  I had already prepaid and received email confirmation from the hotel weeks before  Can you imagine a party of  being out a room in ManhattanWe finally figured out that we indeed had a suite booked but they had no vacancies for our suite  The hotel didnt do much in recompensating us for their mistake  Suffice to say Expedia kindly fully refunded our first night stay after an hour fiasco sifting through emails phoning expedia being split into two arate rooms having to repack our luggage and move  
P => Absolutely loved it Hubby and I spent three week nights in early y at the Hotel Belleclaire and really could not have been happier The room was beautiful spacious well maintained and comfortable we had a fun view looking up and down Broadway and east toward Central Park and the staff was friendly and professional We loved being so close to the Subway stop which made it easy for us to travel all over the city without ever needing a cab and we also enjoyed feeling like we were in a quotreal neighborhoodquot  We felt instantly at home and liked having so many restaurants and gourmet delisgroceries close by Someday we  have enough money to stay at one of the elaborate glass tower hotels but unless something changes for the worse at the Hotel Belleclaire well always stay there  
P => great newly refurbished hotel Of the  budget or medium priced hotels I have stayed in in NYCthe Belleclaire has been the best so far Although this week there is scaffolding on some of the buildingand the entrancelobby is far from glamorousonce you get up to the room the apparent refurbishment becomes clear My room had a partial view of Broadway the cornersolid wood floorlovely minimalist ormodern looking bed linen and cushionsand all the expected mod consincluding a mini fridge The wide screen TV opposite the bed was greatthough the remote control needed to be held with an outstretched arm from the bed to work Hardly a big problem The bathroom was compactbut not too smallwith deep green traditional tilingand was very cleanwith excellent shower pressure and water temperature I arrived at   a m but although check in isnt officially til my room was ready This was a bit of luckI found the front desk staff friendly and efficientincluding when I asked to store my luggage til later in the day on checking out I would definitely stay there again I like the Miburn Hotel tooa block awaybut for solo travellers or couplesI would recommend the Belleclaire as having a bit more style  
P => Almost perfect experience We had a great experience at the Hotel Belleclaire  Our room  was quiet the neighborhood is lovely the staff is professional and capable  We had the deluxe queen with private bath and the room is NYC tiny but still very nice and well appointed  Ill probably be back and certainly recommend  
P => Cant Wait to Return I have been to NYC before but never stayed in the city overnight  I feel very fortunate that my first experience there was at the Belleclaire  This property is in a charming part of the city   I absolutely fell in love with the tree lined avenues the neighborhood merchants and the grace and vibrance all around  There is a velous and extremely cost effective diner across the street and an excellent grocer just around the corner on Broadway  There are wonderful bakeries nearby  Central Park is a couple of blocks to the east the Hudson River a couple of blocks to the west The hotel had a stellar staff  Check in was quick and pleasant  When I came practically stumbling out of the elevator with a heavy bag a bellboy almost ran to the elevator to help me with the awkward luggage  Another bellboy engaged us in conversation while we were waiting in the lobby  Over  days I did not encounter anyone at the Belleclaire that was anything less than courteous and professional For a major city the room was large  queen beds and clean  The bath and beauty products supplied by the hotel were more than sufficient and of good quality  The towels were soft and thick and smelled wonderful  Our room had hardwood floors and added to the feeling of cleanliness of the room  The only downside was that the air conditioner had a hard time keeping up with the intense y heat  I would guess this is not uncommon in hot humid locales  I brought a small fan and am so glad I did  One other minor detail is that the hallways are not terribly glamorous  Theyre old looking   I guess reflecting the true background of the building  They also are not air conditioned and I am a big fan of air conditioning during hot humid summers  Conversely if they cooled and spritzed up the the hallways the Belleclaire would probably not be able to offer the amazing price that we got air and hotel package deal thru Travelocity Sumy   the Belleclaire was great  
P => Incredible value I stayed at the Bellclaire for the second time in il this year I have to say I was not disappointed It has an EXCELLENT location Nice neighborhood that is not TOO touristy but is easly accesible to tourist attractions very close to subway walking distance to central park and strawberry fields close to the original Grays Papaya  blocks from an AMAZING bagel shop near hora with a really great grocery store literally about ten steps away  The hotel itself doesnt have a restaurant but there is a great diner right across the street called the Manhattan Diner that is very ently priced with delicious food that offers room service to the bellclaire you have a number and menu right in your room you just call them up and before you know it they are at the door of your room with your meal I really couldnt ask for more at such a great price  Most dont see the appeal in booking the economy room which is a small room that has a shared bathroom you only share it with two other rooms  Let me tell you I have booked the economy room twice and there has never been ONE time where i needed to use the restroom or take a shower and couldnt because it was occupied  I pretty much felt like it was my own private bathroom and though the other two rooms i shared the bathroom with were booked i never ran into the people from those rooms or heard any noise etc  The room is small but EVERYTHING in New York is small and if you ask me its actually a GOOD size for a room in ny ive seen new york apartments that small  In addition to that if youre going to new york for vacation you should only be in your room to sleep change clothes  and shower  you dont need a room any bigger than that because you should be out enjoying everything new york has to offer HOWEVER should you happen to require more space the upgraded rooms are considerably larger from what i saw walking by and from pictures they are a little more lavish  The workers there are very helpful and the housekeeper is also very friendly and helpful and very attentive to the rooms  All in all I cant imagine getting a better deal anywhere else  Im returning to returning to New York next year and this is definately where Im staying 
P => LOVED the Belleclaire Hotel My husband and I stayed at the wonderful Belleclaie Hotel for  days in early y  We absolutely loved it We booked our reservation way back in ch through Hotels com and prepaid it so we got an awesome deal at  night including tax amp surcharge  We were pleasantly surprised with everything we experienced at the Belleclaire from checking in early    a m  with the friendly Daniel to our check out  days later  This gem of a hotel is conveniently close  blocks east to Central Park and the Hudson River walkrunbikeway  blocks west for early morning workouts and it has its own fitness center which was surprisingly very nice for an older hotel  The express  amp  subways is a  minute walk and the West End ket literally a  second walk was perfect for stocking our fridge for the week another pleasant surprise was the fridge  Our deluxe queen room was comfortable clean modern and definitely large enough for the two of us  Their toiletries are very nice and when we ran out of something or requested more theyd bring it in just minutes Although the elevators can be slow and are small I enjoyed the staircases as they were elegant and had ble steps  The staff was extremely kind  holding and opening doors flagging taxis stocking quotThe Postquot and very approachable  We will definitely stay here again on a return trip to NYC and are referring our friends amp family to definitely check it out  We are smitten with this hotel 
P => Wierd dirty yuk This is one strange place  Dirty too  Dead bugs and other debris on the carpet  No bathroom in the room  A weird arrangement of tiny hallways cutting off of each other making you wonder who or what is lurking behind the next corner  The cool contemporary check in desk is the only thing nice about this ugly odd disconcerting place  I couldnt wait to get out and recommend you never get in  You would think that for all of the above disadvantages it would be cheap  But the fact is that for the same money there are plenty of ent places on the upper west side  Yuk  
P => Great hotel My boyfriend and I stayed here for  nights in y  We had a room with own bath the room was a good size clean and comfortable  The bathroom was small but clean The neighborhood is great with many restaurants cafes and a great stores like Urban Outfitters etc  It is also in walking distance to lovely Central Park Overall our experience was excellent 
P => Great Value Stayed here for  nights in e within a room facing an alley  By NYC standards this room is a fair size  The room was clean with a very comfortable bed  Nice flat screen TV on the wall  Bathroom was quite large but with a lot of dead space  There was not many places to hang your clothing and toiletries The location is very nice and in a safe neighborhood  Lots of grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance The checkin time was posted at pm we arrived early at around am and they let us go in early Overall very satisfied with this hotel  
P => Great hotel My family and I stayed at the Belleclaire Hotel for  nights in e  We were VERY happy with the hotel  I was quite skeptical since the price was so reasonable for Manhattan  We loved the funky or and the staff were very friendly and helpful  We actually fit  adults in a two room suite one person slept on a cot that was surprisingly comfortable  It was very clean and quiet we never heard anyone else the entire time  The air conditioning worked well as did the hot water in the bathroom  We loved the location quiet and residential but close enough to both Central Park and Times Square via subway  Nine members of our extended family also stayed at the Belleclaire for five days and they were also very pleased with their rooms and the hotel in general  The only complaint I have is that we bought ticket vouchers from the conceirge for a Circle Line cruise  They were  and he informed us that it would guarantee our seats on the cruise  We just needed to get off the subway and it was a short walk to the pier  The walk turned out to be a lot farther than we had anticipated  We arrived at the pier only to be told that the cruise was sold out  Neither the concierge nor Circle Line would refund the vouchers  It was very frustrating  But that was the only problem we ran into  We would recommend Big Nicks Pizza which is just around the corner and has the biggest slices of pizza wed ever seen  We would also recommend Europan which is just a little north of the hotel for bagels in the morning  Overall we had a great time at the Belleclaire and will definitely stay again  
P => Great Neighborhood We stayed here last summer and loved the neighborhood  The Belleclaire is conveniently located for reasonable meals subway transportation parks bars etc We had a daily problem however with a blowing fuse  A fuse blew every morning leaving almost the entire suite in darkness one lamp was on a different circuit I guess  No matter how we tried to mitigate the problem we still ended up with a blown fuse each morning  The staff was always quick to fix it and very apologetic about it but it nonetheless was still somewhat of a hassle  
P => great neighborhood We live on Long Island and came in to see South Pacific at Lincoln center ided to stay overnight  We didnt take the car used the train and subway  The hotel is between  stops of the and  trains so it is less than  minutes from Penn to nd or th streets  The lobby is clean the room also the bathroom was spotless The towels sheets duvet pillows are all in great condition seem almost new and I ll take the wood floor over carpet any time  In an older building like this one the rooms will be small and the hallways can be a bit maze like but thats what you get in NYC The room was fine for the two of us for this short stay  It had a fridge and a clock radioipod docking station and a flat screen TV  the only complaint was that my husband couldnt watch the Mets as that station was not available  That was actually a plus for meThe neighborhood is great residential on the streets and businesses on the avenues which makes it less crowded and much quieter than midtown  The subway is convenient and safe and this past weekend was pretty clean There are many small restaurants cafes and pubs nearby and Central Park is close too  The show was wonderful and the hotel too  We got a great rate   as I was unided about staying overnight until about  days before the stay   we could have just gone home after the show  I guess I got luckyI would absolutley stay here again  
P => We would chose it again I dont know what to say different than what has already been said  This is a great hotel in a great location with a great price  We stayed here in the Queen room with shared bath for  a night and had a very good experience  The hotel was staffed at  am when we arrived  The clerk was friendly and efficient  We never had to wait long for the elevator  The room was a good size clean and comfortable  We didnt mind the street noise  with the window closed from the th floor it was very minimal   it just reminded us of where we were  I enjoyed the view from the window looking out at the Manhattan Diner across the street  Sharing the bathroom did require some waiting and some negotiation with the other people in our quotpodquot  But it wasnt bad and everyone was polite  Kind of made me feel like we were in Europe especially since the others in our shared space were European It was a great location  So convenient to good places to eat  a quick walk to Zabars  Big Nicks around the corner The Boat Basin Cafe a five minute walk away  I loved grabbing a bowl from Groms at closing time  And though I worried about the walk from the subway I didnt need to there was never any concern  The streets were busy and the walk was short Hope you enjoy your visit to the UWS as much as we did  
P => Very happy with this hotel My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire for a week on our honeymoon in il  I was expecting something average as its not an expensive hotel but was blow away by what it was like  The room we stayed in was beautiful clean large screen TV and a lovely strong clean shower which was nice  The sheets were always spotless the people at the desk friendly and it was close to almost everything  we will stay there again for sure on our next visit to NYC 
P => Do not drive to this hotel   NO parking Best thing about this hotel is atmosphere and location   its on th  blocks from the north end of Central Park   its a rehab which is done well   star rating is appropriate   we had  room quotsuitequot  really just  rooms with a wall between  SMALL bathroom ala s   BUT clean  The closet space is actually humorous   I literally measured it   X   thats correct  feet wide  feet deep ONE closet for  rooms  BUT for NYC the rate is OK   and you are close to the red line  either th or nd   so its convenient  Out the door go right  feet to the corner and you have the West End ket   very convenient local grocery  they do not take ccs  also is Nicks cafe  indoor amp side walk local eatery   not fancy but good food amp great people watching Best thing  location and gives you the real heart of NYC friendly staff away from the steel amp glass of lower Manhatten Worst thing  NO parking   they say to use the Hertz lot   but it is always full  and then they recommend parking at the museum  a long walk  Plan on   day to park locally   the hotel needs a better arrangement than they have  
P => Nice Two Bedroom Suite for the Price Our recent experience at the HB room  was a pleasurable one  We enjoyed the space of the two bedroom suite allthough it was really one room divided by a wall  I think it would be a little cramped for six adults but it fit our family of four fine we booked on expedia at a rate of   per night  I enjoyed the ability to take the stairs to my room and to have a window that opened for fresh air  Loved the service neighborhood and our room was fairly quiet at night  
P => Parking nighte The hotel and staff are nice enough   the area is great but I would NEVER bring a car there again  The parking rate of  hours listed on the website is VERY misleading  First off the garage affiliated with the hotel was full our first night and was only open the second night if we were to slip the attendant cash  When we went to pick up the car we were charged   on top of the quottipquot  When we told the attendant that we were staying at the Hotel Belleclaire and were to get a discounted rate we were told this WAS the discounted rate The first night we parked on the street as all the garages in the area were full and had to move the car by AM to an expensive garage several blocks away to avoid being towed  We were only able to get into that garage after slipping the attendant money also Do youself a favor and stay at a hotel that has assured valet parking if you plan to stay in NYC and bring a car  What a nighte it was We tried to discuss this with the hotels front staff and they were not at all interested in helping us  They just referred us to another garage that was also full  
P => Great Experience My husband and I just got back from a week long trip to NYC  Upon arrival the hotel staff was friendly and check in was a breeze  We booked the economy queen room with a shared bath and I feel we got what we paid for  The economy room is not represented in any of the pictures from the hotels website so be realistic with your expectations  However the room and bathrooms were always clean  I was skeptical about the shared bath but never had any problems with vacancy or cleanliness  I would definitely recommend the shared bath option for travelers on a budget The room was small but sufficient  We were only in our room for sleep so the size did not bother me at all  Amenities were nice iron hairdryer shampoo soap etc  was all provided The neighborhood was great Good food and shopping near by  The local subway stop is two blocks away and the Express stop was only five  Central park was be a  minute walk from the hotel and all of the tourist attractions were only a subway ride awayOverall our experience was excellent  I will definitely stay at this hotel again and I would recommend it to anyone on a budget 
P => Good place A pretty nice hotel in an excellent neighborhood  Easy walk to Central Park  blocks from the Subway amp a block from the best bagel Ive ever had  Reasonably priced grocery store right next door  Dont go for the standard Queen sized room   we got one with a view of a brick wallalley amp the room was too small  The second night they put us in a double room on the th floor that was excellent though the bathrooms amp windows could be cleaner  Id definately stay here again because the neighborhood is perfect  
P => Loved It Highly reccommend Foudn this hotel through Expedia with a few nights at reduced rate  Myself and my girlfriend are students so our budget was tight and the Belleclaire was the best we could stretch it Overall the Hotel was amazing plesant staff a door porter always willin to help clean rooms and lcoated close to Midtown  Subway is only a few blocks away and suggest if staying for a lengthy period to buy one of the Metrocards for unlimited travel we definitely got good value for money We had the Queen room with shared bath being sceptical abotu the shared bath we bit the bullet and booked  The room was quiet and we were on the th floor but unfortunately the view out the window left a lot to be desired as do most views in NYC We had no intention of spending time in the hotel other than sleeping and brief periods inthe evening henec the small room did just fine  I wouldnt sugest this if you will be in your room all day perfect for the tourist All in all a great hotel and recommend to anyone who is toruign NY  Unfortunately never took any photos but the atached ones do it justice  Potentially suggest a better sealing on teh air conditioning units which were slightly noisy and more light in the bathrooms  BTW definitely visit the Manhattan Diner cheap and cheerful 
P => Can make it Quite expensive but so is NYC    Good room a great view of the opposite brick wall however    with a clean shared bathroom and clean towel  Professionnal welcome check in and out really fast and excellent location with lot of restaurant around I would recommend it  
P => Great NYC hotel but so noisy at night Wed agree with much of whats already been said about this hotel  However we found that the family suite we stayed in whilst located on the rd floor was directly above the street which was reasonably quiet during the day but really noisy late at night  This is partly because the hotel has single glazed leaky sash windows and the street seems to be used by numerous utility vehicles during the night  Yes its NYC and we expected some noise but even with earplugs the constant banging and crashing from the street meant we got very poor quality sleep  Several other guests were complaining about the late night noise disruption as we checked out   
P => Great location Our family just returned from a  night stay at Hotel Belleclaire  We had a room with two double beds on the th floor overlooking Broadway  I was a bit worried about the potential traffic noise but it was never an issue  Our room was spotless and the beds were very comfortable  Although there was not a dresser there was room in the closet to open a suitcase on a stand plenty of hangers and then a window seat where we could open our other suitcase  My son was very pleased with the IPOD docking station and the large TV  There was also a mini fridge that came in handy for snacks and drinks  The bathroom was very clean good water pressure in the shower and lots of travel sized things like shampoo conditioner lotion soap shower cap  The staff were VERY friendly and helpful  We were most happy with the location  It is within a couple blocks of a subway station near lots of restaurants grocery stores Zabars   they have a great take out cafe for breakfast and lunch and HampH bagel  It is just a few blocks walk to the American Musuem of Natural History Central Park and the DakotaStrawberry Field garden  Parking was easy and inexpensive   for NYC that is you get a discount with a nearby garage   our van cost day and I think a car would have been day with this discount  It was really nice at the end of a long day of sightseeing to return to a hotel in a slightly less congested part of Manhattan   more residential  They also have an I Love NYC gift shop connected to the lobby  The only potential negative was that there wasnt much of a lobby   just a small area near the elevator   but that ended up being all we needed and there were always available chairs to sit in  We would definitely return to this hotel when we visit NYC again 
P => Cheap and Cheerful The hotel is cheap and cheerful  Well located in easy walking distance of a subway station clean and comfortable  The Manhattan Diner across the street is also fantastic  
P => Paddys In New York We have just returned from our first ever trip to New York and had a fabulous time there  What can I say about this hotel that hasnt been said before Nothing really coz its all been said A wonderful hotel and great location staff very friendly esp the porter at the door  The cleaners were in every day with clean linen for the  days we were there  Like a few of the other reviews have said quotwhat a great little diner across the streetquot  We are planning our next trip over already and will be booking this hotel again for sure 
P => Good for Families We booked a family suite for  nights  The room was excellent divided into two halves with one large double and two very wide singles almost doubles  The room was warm and we turned off the heating but the air conditioning helped to keep the temperature right how effective this would be in the summer is hard to know  The room was clean and large and had two fridges two TVs and an ipod dock  The hotel is excellently located and in addition to the diner we tried the legendary Big Nicks burger and pizza place directly under the hotel  This is a slice of real NY if you are not too fussy about the or but like good value  I had the most delicious burger of my life and the variety is great  There is also a good deli next door  The metro is nearby there are lots of local restaurants and the area felt safe and nicely positioned near enough to quickly get to mid and downtown Manhattan whilst giving you the space to get away from the frenetic atmosphere when you want The hotel is clearly still being upgraded  The main room was very chic the bathroom perhaps still needed some work but was clean whilst the corridors were on the old fashioned side but you could see those sections of the hotel where these were being addressed and clearly this is something which is being attended to  
P => I liked it Seven of us just returned from a  night stay  I was nervous due to previous reviews regarding the noise level in the hotel  This was not a problem for any of us The room was small but its just a part of staying in NY  That is the way people live there so it s the only way to get the true feel of the city  The two other rooms in our group were double beds but the size difference of their two rooms varied significantly  Theirs a good bagel shop down the street I think its called HampH and another bakery just a bit closer to the hotel on the same street that had wonderful cheesecake and salads  The hotel is in a residential area which I liked  The staff was friendly and helpful   only two problems the desk told us how to get to Yankee stadium then another worker   the hotel stopped us to tell us another way because he lives in Brooklyn  He told us to take a particular subway that we later found out wasn t running on weekends We wasted  minutes waiting on that train Im sure it was an honest mistake  Also when we were leaving the hotel a black taxi was out front  He offered to give us a ride to the airport and the lady that works in the gift shop told me it would be safe and that she knew the guy  Well he didnt understand which airport and when I noticed him going the wrong way I tried to clarify and he just said hes going a diff way  After arriving in New Jersey I told him again that we needed LGA so he stopped turned around got lost upset other drivers got yelled at lots along the way back to Manhattan and we almost missed our flight  That man has no business driving people and he worked for Carmel so dont use them He couldnt understand English apparently  Honestly I really did like this Hotel and would love to go back  The location is wonderful and located nearby the subway station  I felt very safe there too  I didnt use the fitness center but I heard it was tiny as well  Last time in NY I stayed in East Village and this hotel on the Upper West Side is definitely my preference over the last place  The location was much better too  
P => Good sized Family Suite Just back from trip to New York  This hotel was excellent for us  Rooms were clean spacious and bright  Staff were friendly and helpful  Walking distance with  children to cental park Natural History Museum and even Times square on one occasion  Sub stop two minutes from the hotel  A lovely neighbourhood with small shops and diners  I will stay again when we are back  
P => Repeat customer This was my second stay at the Belleclaire and it has only improved  The reated rooms are beautiful and comfortable loved the ipod docking station and flat screen TV  I had a room facing out onto the street and was able to get free wifi from somewhere in the neighborhood  The staff are outstanding and always very helpful with directions and advice  The location is excellent only a short walk to the crosstown bus stop and to the subway and more great restaurants than one has time to sample  Consistently the best value on the Upper West Side  
P => Belleclaire   Amazing Great Hotel My boyfriend amp I have just returned from a  night stay at the Hotel Belleclaire  We initially booked a Queen Room with shared bath but ided to upgrade to a private bathroom a week or so before our departure  I emailed the hotel amp they got back to me straight away amp upgraded us for    a huge saving on the price shown when we were booking  When we arrived at the hotel I was a bit worried as from the outside it doesnt look like much However inside its lovely quite retro amp very well presented  On checking in the extremely helpful staff noted that we had opted to upgrade and then offered us a King room at no extra charge We ended up with one of the round king rooms situated towards the front on the hotel  The room overlooked Broadway and the receptionist advised us to let her know if the noise from the road bothered us and she would move us  We stayed in room  The room was fab MASSIVE bed and flatscreen TV Ipod docking station etc You can hear the traffic but its not a very busy road at night the odd truck or fire truck but nothing that caused any disturbed sleep The door guys are also very nice at the hotel very helpful and friendly  The hotel itself is about min walk from the Muesum of Natural History and Central Park  There are loads of great delis near by I recommend Sarabeths for the Papa Bear oatmeal in the morning Mmmm    It took us about mins to walk down Broadway to the start of th Ave and all the shops  On the last day of our stay we also asked for a late check out normal check out is  they offered   free of charge  As our flight wasnt until pm we opted for a check out of pm which would have cost  however we werent charged for this when we checked out Overall I cant fault this hotel at all  Highly recommended and I would stay there again without hesitation 
P => super location We stayed at Belleclaire from chth until ch st  It was excellent very clean and the staff were helpful and friendly  The neighbourhood is really lovely and safe  with lots of shops and restaurants Manhatten Diner across the street very good for breakfast sets you up for the day  Our beds were changed a couple of times over the few days and we had fresh towels every day  We had a blocked loo a couple of times but they were fixed in a matter of minutes Close to  subway stations with th street the closest We travelled with people who had been to New York before and had stayed in more central hotels but they loved this one  Do check out the neighbourhood it is lovely  
P => Great for those on a budget We stayed for  nights at the Belleclaire and overall our experience was pretty good  Without wanting to repeat previous reviews we got a great deal via expedia booking the flight and hotel together  at least half the price of advertised room rates if not less  There are lots of positives to this hotel  Our room  was quite spacious comfortable very clean no cockroaches it had everything we needed and our towels etc  were changed every day  The bed was a little smaller than we expected but this was remedied by getting a quotrollawayquot bed ask reception for  per night which was a single camp bed on wheels  We took it in turns to sleep on it its not as comfortable as a real bed and it did the job  It will depend on which room you have as to whether you can fit in the rollaway bed   our room was plenty big enough We shared a bathrom with  other rooms as we were on a strict budget and this got us the best price  The bathroom is the only thing which wasnt satisfactory  The tiles were pretty horrid and old but it was clean overall and we didnt have any problems with it being occupied when we needed it  My partner didnt like it at all and I had to force her to take a shower The shower was hit and miss and was difficult to get the temperature and flow to stay constant  One day it actually stopped whilst I was under it and I had to dip my head in the sink to rinse off my conditioner I have to mention that if you are in rooms   or  the shared bathroom window is right next to a large ventilation chute which serves one of the eatieries below  It pumped out awful smelling greasy cooking smoke and fumes most of the time which was pretty nasty so the bathroom window was kept closed for fear that we would exit the bathroom more smelly than we had enterered it I would assume that the bathrooms on the floors above and below would also be affected Basically if you insist on having a great bathroom the Belleclaire is not for you If your room is Broadway side you should definitely bring earplugs as the road is noisy  even with the window closed  As our room was hot we needed the window open  Our radiator made strange noises we likened it to Chinese water torture which woke us up most nights even with earplugs in but that was not a big deal for us The neighbourhood is fantastic and the hotel is located perfectly for getting around on the subway   the number  line is very convenient  We loved Manhattan Diner and ate there every day mainly for breakfast  Their burgers and salmon nicoise salad are excellent too  Highly recommended  Ruby Foos across the road is very nice but more pricey if you are from the UK dont order their peking duck because it isnt half as nice as what you will be used to  We tried lots of eateries in the area and all except one were lovely  The worst was Nicos which is on the corner a little way up from the hotel   the moussaka was awful For an amazing steak pricey though we recommend Michael Jordans restaurant in Grand Central Terminal on the st floor  It is fab to watch all the commuters bustling about below   a great experience  We also went to Gallaghers steakhouse West nd and Broadway which was recommended by reception and that was pricey too but not as nice as Jordans at Grand Central All in all for a budget hotel the Belleclaire was a super find  There were far more positives than negatives and we would definitely go back   we certainly got a lot for our money  
P => Great budget hotel in Upper West Side My husband teenage son and I jut spent  nights at the Belleclaire and will gladly go back there again  I was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews here but am glad I went with the majority on this choice  The or is as boutique as you get for under  for a triple in Manhattan   crisp white sheets and duvet covers hardwood floors flat screen tv iPod docking station and wireless access  for  days  It was a bit cramped with  of us and our luggage in a doubledouble but the bathroom was spacious and the room was very well lit   not dim and dingy like the more expensive Belvedere Hotel we stayed in  years ago on spring break  The room was hot as others have reported here but I managed to get the window open a couple of inches and it was just fine  Desk staff was very pleasant and elevators not particularly slow to arrive  We had a late dinner and breakfast a couple of times at the bustling Manhattan Diner across the street  Really enjoyed the Popover Cafe for lunch and had a delicious reasonably priced dinner at a very busy Italian place on Amsterdam named Celeste  One of the best things about this hotel is the location   I much prefer the Upper West Side to midtownTimes Square  You feel like you  actually be in the minority as a tourist here but you have a great choice of restaurants and its not far from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History  I recommend the space show and the subway is about  blocks away  
P => Repeat Satisfaction This was my second visit to this great property on the upper west side of NYC  Traveling on business is the purpose of most of my travel but I would take the Belliclaire for either business or pleasure  What a terrific property for those looking for a great hotel in a wonderful part of the city  I have had the deluxe room on both visits and found it more than satisfactory  Beds are comfortable and the room has always been very clean  If you expect to have a meeting in the bathroom Belliclaire might not work  The bath is plenty big to do all the functions intended  I also need to say that the staff has always been very friendly and willing to help with any questions or needs  With some best restaurants anywhere in the city including Big Nicks best burgers anywhere the subway a block away and plenty of shopping and services the Belliclaire gets my vote for repeat satisfaction  
P => Great location great price If anyone is looking for a moderately priced hotel in NYC this is it  There are a couple of great things about it  Its within   blocks of  subway stops where you can get a train to get almost anywhere in the city   Its in a quieter residential area on the upper west side so that when you get home for the night you can actually sleep  Experience more of the less touristy areas of Manhattan   You can get a great room with a king sized bed on the corner overlooking Broadway    You can save some money by getting a smaller room that shares a bathroom with  other rooms  We were a little worried trying this but since we had stayed in the hotel previously we knew it was a ent hotel  So we took a chance and it worked great  The rooms are clustered with a smaller quotfoyerquot that has a arate door so you arent walking down a hallway in your robe to get to the bathroom  Your room key opens the outer door and then the door to your room   Its a short walk to Central Park and the Museum of Natural History    The hotel still show some age since its an older building but rooms have been reated and are pretty nice My sister and I have become addicted to NY and go usually twice a year   once in spring and once in fall  We found Hotel Belleclaire the first time and have been back each time  Weve never been disappointed  Weve booked through Expedia and directly with the hotel  Seems as though you get better deals reserving directly through the hotel  
P => Nice Hotel Me and  buddies stayed at Belleclaire Hotel from   th to   rd  We had a  room suite with  double beds All we wanted was a place to rest at night cause all day we were sightseeing and shopping so we werent in the room during the day Pros of this hotel clean reated everyday we had new bath gels shampoo new towels etc a subway stop just  streets away the red one very convenient very close to Central Park and most of the museums very comfortable double beds rooms were really hot not even needed to turn on radiators or wear pajamas in bed friendly staff note that we didnt actually need any help from staff there were an iron and an iron board in the room there was a big tub in the bathroom there was a fridge in the roomCons room had a light smell probably from fresh paint note that after  minutes we were getting used to it it wasnt that annoying high phone call prices note that most hotels do this small rooms no hairdryer small closetIn general I recommend this hotel for your NY vacation it is really good for its price considering that most cheap hotels in Manhattan are really bad and they dont provide private bathroom  
P => Brilliant Hotel My sister and I went for a weeks shopping trip in New York and chose this hotel  Reading other reviews there were mixed messages but we had a great time Everything that was listed in the hotel features were in our room   flat screen TV iPod dock etc  The heating was a little noisy on the first night but by fiddling with the temperature controls we managed to quieten it and it didnt bother us again  There was also an air con unit in there that worked really well so that balanced it when we had the heat on The room was spotlessly clean we had one cockroach on the last day but we trapped it under a glass and house keeping dealt with it  The communal areas were all really well orated and clean too lifts are ok   you have to wait a minute or so for it but its no hassle  The staff were great very helpful   they gave us a subway map and NY city guide when we got there  They also keep an up to date Time Out in each room  There are free newspapers available in reception and a TV with CNN on all day too  The Manhattan Diner across the road is lovely all the staff are helpful and kind  The menu is vast and each mealtime is different   its quick and buzzy in the morning for breakfast and slower and more relaxed in the evening for dinner  The room service delivery is quick and accurate too   on top of being  hour The subway is a couple of blocks from the hotel and its on a very main line   amp  which follows the route of Broadway so it cuts right across town  Id definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone   its good for a relaxed break or with a family  
P => very happy I stayed one night in late uary  The room a queen see picture was quite large for what Ive experienced in NYC very very clean the bathroom large spotless and with new fixtures  The radiator in my room was quiet and equipped with a European style regulator   no noise problems heat easy to control  Best of all was that I got this room with bath despite having booked one of the no bath twin rooms   the person on the desk just asked if I would like a queen when I checked in  People with little patience beware   the lobby is small can get busy and the elevator is very tiny you often need to wait if it is busy  All in all I was very happy with the staff and the room at the Belleclaire  And the upper West Side right off Broadway and near enough to the Park is a brilliant place to stay in New York  
P => Peaceful Broadwey Anybody who would like to visit NYC but wants a relatively peaceful sleep   stay here  Its set at th Street just across from Central Park and two blocks from the th Street Metro  Its on Broadwey but it is at the upper most end but dont be discouraged by distance  The metro is  a ride or you can get a  unlimited access metro card for a week or  unlimited for a day  The choice is yours  The hotel is a traditional s build  The staff are very friendly and you have a concierge on the door who is very useful   got a question   just ask The lobby is small and tidy with two lifts that access the floors  There are stairs if you are feeling really fit I took the family and we stayed in a two room suite Queen bed and two double beds with private bathroom  The rooms have been refurbished and they have flat screen tvs with free channels to keep you and yours entertained along with iPod docking stations  There are built in closets to hang clothing and a drawercupboard combo as well as a small fridge in one room  There is adequate room but there is no living area but that really didnt matter as you will spend your day exploring the city and at night eating out shopping or catching a show  The maid comes every day and the sheets etc were fresh and clean and there are Australian bath products shower gel shampoo conditioner minis provided  However if taking family   take your own else you will run out in one go Other amenities are available internet massage etc but are available at a cost  Worried about eating out Dont  There is a fantastic diner opposite the hotel   Manhattan Diner  In our books   they do the best burger in town  Try the Manhattan burger   youll love it They have incredible cheesecakes and other patisseries all waiting to be tried  We pre booked Supershuttle service from airport to hotel return  Its pricey doing it from here  Would advise do it at the airport  Supershuttles desk is on your way out and they run all daynight  Oh   by the way   they drive fast and you  find yourself reaching for a non existent brake but they get you there and back Good location give it a go  
P => Belleclaire a Beauty This gem of a Hotel took our family of six in comfort and style in Manhattan  Travelling as a large family is tough at best and so we dont expect a Ritz like when we stay somewhere  We knew staying in Manhattan wouldnt be inexpensive so we found the Belleclaires great location and relatively reasonable rates a great surpise  The staff were all helpful and having access to the Net at the little shop at the front of the Hotel was a bonus The local area has many amenities such as superkets restaurants coffee shops etc  Any negatives Perhaps it is an American custom to overheat rooms as the rooms always seemed too hotwe were there in ember  Also the radiators rattled and made strange noises throughout the night  A small price to pay for a great stay in New York  
P => Genuinely Happy We stayed in room   The staff were accommodating from the concierge to the reception  No sooner had we pulled up in the shuttle bus than they were there with the trolley  Super The room was almost perfect  large double beds flat screen TV fridge stereo big closet with extra bedding iron and board generous bathroom with no external pipes  Only problem   you couldnt actually have a bath because the drain design didnt allow for a plug  Its right on the cnr of th and Broadway   th St is where youll find the Museum of Natural History  Across the intersection is the  Manhattan Diner   excellent little place with fast and friendly service worth tipping good cheap filling breakfasts and monstrous steaks  It is quite a competitive price for NY  I would certainly stay there again  
P => Needs Improvement My girlfriend and I book the room with the shared bath and upon arriving it was nothing like what was on the website  I was told that the rooms with the shared bath were going to be the last to be remodeled  The room that we were placed in consisted of a regular television a queen bed old carpet a refrigerator a sink and a heater like the ones you see in  I Love Lucy  that made A LOT of noise  The bathroom itself wasn t any better it had green tiles that were past its time At this point I had to go down to the lobby and upgrade my room because there was no way I was going to be miserable for the next  days in New York  When I asked for an upgrade they told me there was an extra charge of  dollars per night and without any hesitation I agreed The upgraded room was a lot nicer  It looked like the one in the pictures on their website  There was a plasma television hardwood flooring a refrigerator I pod docking station and a private bath  Unfortunately the heater made a lot of noise and the bathroom that was in my room wasn t remodeled  It had the same miserable tiles that I saw in the shared baths       which was a big disappointment Finally my last complaint which is a legitimate complaint in my opinion  The room that I was in had cockroaches  I killed  in the bathroom and  got away out in the bedroom  I am disclosing this because when you go buy food make sure you don t leave it out  Don t throw the wrapper in the trash can in the bathroom take it the lobby or throw it in the trash cans in front of the hotel  I can handle a lot of gross things in life but to see the cockroaches in my room was the last straw  With all the money I spent on the hotel I felt that I could have gotten a nicer one  So when you are considering this hotel take my review into account  If you do ide to stay here the location is great because it s in a safe neighborhood and the subway is extremely close and also the hotel staff was really friendly  
P => small rooms good location We were looking for a family suite since we have  kids and one was bringing a friend  We liked the price of this hotel and the location near the Museum of Natural History and central park The family suite consisted of a room be a little larger than a normal hotel room with a wall erected in the middle there is no door just an open space between rooms  There was no view to speak of and the beds were like a rock  I couldnt sleep and I am not that picky  Each side had a tv the two beds on one side were doubles  so even though they said it could sleep  people it was tight in there for  teenagers and a  yr old then there was a queen or king on our side hard to remember  The bathroom was very dark and there was no where to put anything  It looked like it hadnt had a good cleaning in a while When you called the concierge you were told she was in the gift shop and you would have to find her in there  There was usually a long line  Given the fees you pay for quotservicequot at NY hotels there was not much to speak of  Whenever you called downstairs no one answered or it took forever for them to get back to you This is a good location but spend the extra  a night for an extra room or a nice hotel  You are in NY what the heck 
P => Good hotel with great service My wife and I stayed at the Belleclaire at Xmas time for  nights and came away quite pleased with the experience  We had an economy room with a shared bathroom max  rooms sharing the room itself was comfortable with a big TV and a very comfortable Queen sized bed  The room was fairly small not suprising as we ARE in NY but everything was clean  There was also a sink in the room as well as in the shared bathroom  The room was always warm even though it was around  degrees celsius outside  Service from the reception staff was excellent and friendly  The hotel lifts are quite small but well maintained  Small amenities like soap shampoo showercap etc were also provided  The towels were also quite thick and soft The only negative was that while the shared bathroom was quite large including toilet it had poor lighting  The bathroom tiles were dark green as well reducing the light  The hotel is across from the excellent Manhattan Diner which has awsome breakfasts for a very reasonable price  We paid about  including tax and tips for two people  The food was great very large servings and free refills of coffee  If you are from Australia etc where people usually have milk with their coffee ask for a glass of milk as cream is the standard in the USA  Overall I would recommend this hotel as a good clean and comfortable alternative to the high end hotels  
P => Great location comfy bed and friendly staff Good hotel in a great location  Rooms quiet clean and the bed was very comfortable  Diner opposite good too  Not far from nd st station  Highly recommended  
P => Basic but clean We stayed at this hotel for five nights in ember  Our room was clean and a very good size but quite basic and we did not have a ipod docking station or flat screen TV as other reviews have mentioned  On arrival the TV and radiator would not work but after calling reception this was swiftly fixed  We shared a bathroom with two other rooms and this was always clean and only occupied on a couple of occasions  The hotel was in a good position with some nice restaurants bars and shops within walking distance  I would recommend the Manhatten Diner for choice value and convenience its across the road  The restaurants closeby are much nicer than any you will find in the major tourist areas  The subway is two minutes away and Central Park is only a short walk  I found the reception staff quite surly and when checking out they tried to charge us for a movie that we hadnt watched  However the bell boys and gift shop staff were very helpful This hotel wasnt the cheapest at   a night but as we were there at Christmas time it was good value compared to other hotels  
P => Great value   great location We booked this hotel well in advance and got a fantastic deal for a two bed suite room   Very clean and spacious room with two large LCD TVs and two iPod docking stations The heating did make some interesting noises but you soon got used to it Its fantastically located   only a few blocks from Central Park Natural History Museum entrance and within walking distance of nd and th subway stations  There are diners and delis of fantastic quality just around the corner Only downside was that the housekeeper threw out a bag that contained some gifts  Hotel was quick to refund though   guess itll teach us tokeep things tidier in future 
P => Reasonable value Because we were booking late during a popular time for New York City finding a reasonably priced hotel was challenging  This turned out to be a pretty good deal all things considered and it is a great location  Our room was small but clean and comfortable  I did read an earlier review about heating noise and that was a problem one night  The building is old so the pressure can build up   Suddenly there was a loud banging sound on the heating pipes  It lasted about  minutes and woke us up at  a m  The front desk said theres nothing they can do about it  Other than this problem we had no complaints about the place and would consider it again if the price were right  As noted in other reviews the location is terrific close to little diners a subway stop and overall nice ambiance  There was no free wi fi which I would have liked I think all hotels should supply free wi fi today  
P => Great Location Wonderful Surroundings I stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire in  and then returned in ember  during Thanksgiving  The hotel is situated in a beautiful part of the city and has easy access to the   amp  train to go up and downtown  We stayed in Room  which was small but comfortable  The bathroom was roomy and the shower was fantastic  The room had all latest technology flat screen TV on the wall and an iPod docking station  The beds were comfortable but a little small  Although the weather was in the s and s during our stay the hotel room did get warm and we used the AC  Everything you could possibly want is within a couple of blocks  I would recommend enjoying the atmosphere of Edgars Caf  at th Street  For breakfast lunch or dinner I also would recommend the Manhatten Diner which is directly across the street and they are opened  hours  Also Nicks Big Burger joint is to the right of the hotel and is awesome The Zabars ket which was used in the film quotYouve Got Mailquot is right up the street at around th amp Broadway  Its an expensive hotel and you are paying just for the area  
P => Safe hotel in a good location Stayed here with my best friend at the beginning of ember  Very nice hotel with pleasant helpful staff  Hotel is very secure with doormansecurity at all times the main door is locked at am  There is a little gift shop which has internet and printing access for a fee  It also sells bus tickets etc  If you have a laptop with you there is free wifi access across the street in a cafe  Elevators are opposite reception and are very tight  Will only fit two people and two suitcases at a time  We stayed for  nights and were very pleased with what we got for the price we paid  We had spent ages online looking for a good hotel for our budget  We ended up paying  Euro each for the week  Hotel is located two blocks form th St subway and is surrounded by shops and restaurants  We ate locally when we had been out all day and got good value  Hotel rooms are roomy to a point  Wardrobe is tiny and there is no safe in the rooms deposit boxes are available at reception  Rooms have excellent flat screen tvs as well as fridges and the or is neutral  The only thing I would fault with this hotel is the bathroom ours was quite small and dingy with green tiles that needed a good scrubing the shower head was filthy also however the water pressure and temperature were very good  I will stay here again and have recommended it to friends  
P => Nice Place My Partner and I stayed atthe Belleclaire for  nights in ember and found the hotel to be good value by New York Standards we had a room with a shared bathroom shared with  other rooms The room was nice and clean and everything pretty new and tidy the bathroom was also very tidy and to be honest we didnt have any problems sharing or waiting so it was fine he staff were nice and friendly and we found the hotel to be in a good spot only  mins walk from the metro and the streets were nice and quietThink this hotel is one of the better options especially if youre on a budget 
P => Great location Beautiful room I would definitely stay at the Belleclaire again  This is a beautiful early s building with tons of character  We had room    a large round room from which you could see Central Park  The room had pretty wood floors a flat screen TV with modern furniture and a soft bed with a warm down comforter  The bathroom was small with a noisy pipe but was always clean  I found the hotel staff to be very friendly and family oriented the owners  little girls were helping distribute hotel keys to guests  The location is perfect There are tons of grocery stores restaurants cafes and shopping in the area  It is bustling but much less touristy than Midtown  Everything you want to dosee is easily accessible with a subway stop only  blocks away  If you are looking for a generic Hampton Inn experience this is not the place for you  There are quirks   there is no true concierge no morning breakfast the paint is chipped here and there the elevator is small  But if youre looking to stay in the real New York for a ent price and charming accommodations you cant go wrong here  
P => Still great This is the second time I have stayed at Belleclaire and I was still more than happy with my visit  NYC is such an expensive place to stay so opting for the Upper West Side rather than midtown saves you many dollars  This hotel is a good budget friendly option and is in a lovely neighbourhood where everything is on the doorstep and still open  like the rest of the cityMy boyfriend and I opted for a queen bed room with shared bathroom which he was a bit dubious about as we generally would preferexpect en suite  However there was such a big price hike for en suite that we went for sharing  And let me tell you that even in a busy month in the city such as ember we didnt run into any problems sharing with the two other rooms at all  Not once in our  day stay did we have to wait to use the bathroom and it was always clean and fresh  The hotel has been re furbished recently and was clean and tidy all round  Fresh towels arrived daily and the reception staff were friendly and approachable throughout our stay  It  seem like a way out of the main tourist areassites but it is actually a nice break to come away from the bustle of midtown and chill out during the evenings in one of the many fantastic dinersbistros in the Upper West Side area  The Metro subway is two blocks away at th stBroadway and in ten minutes you are in the heart of the city   how easy is that I recommend this hotel  You cant go wrong  
P => A good value hotel We spent  nights at the Belleclaire in early ember  Our room th floor faced the Hudson River and was quite quiet though as others have said the heating system makes a lot of strange noises and on our last day ceased to work for a time they brought us a fan heater  On one side of the bed there was no table or light which made reading in bed impractical for one of us  The room and bathroom were clean though the cleaners missed us out one day However the eccentricities were balanced by the quiet situation  The location is good too not far from Central Park and theres an express subway stop a couple of blocks north  I would stay there again  
P => Great find for NYC When staying in NYC or so I hear you expect to pay high prices for mediocre accommodation  The Hotel Belleclaire is only rated as a   star hotel but it was fantastic  Great location in Upper West Side can easily walk places catch the subway or a short and cheap taxi ride into all the main attractions  Its a safe and vibrant neighborhood  I would really recommend staying there and would definitely go back when I hit NYC again sometime  Highly recommended  
P => What a FIND I travel to NYC at least  times a year on business always booking myself a room on the Upper West Side  This time I stopped for a few days while on vacation AKA   The Worlds Longest Road Trip And I cant even tell you how HAPPY I was to discover this little gem For MORE THAN TWICE THE PRICE I typically book at the Lucerne or the Excelsior both a few blocks from here  And while both of these hotels have GREAT LOBBIES the rooms are really frumpy dated and very disappointing  For what they charge one would think they would invest in some updated bedding at the very least So imagine my surprise when I discovered this place and got a TOTALLY MODERN ROOM and BATH along with the BEST service and BEST smiles I have ever experienced in any NYC hotel Personally I am surprised people have complained about the size of the rooms  They are no smaller than what you see in this area of the city in any other hotel  Perhaps they dont realize this is NYC and to find an incredibly spacious room on the Upper West Side would be nothing short of a miracle  The difference is   they are SO MUCH MORE LIVEABLE AND CLEAN than any of the others I have seen  Especially for the price  My Mom came with me   her first trip to NYC   and we BOTH thought the room was incredibly comfortable and very well sized for the two of us  We booked a room with two double beds  There was a closet big enough to fit both our suitcases and extras a dresser and a bath with tub and shower  YES   its a small bath  But not unusually small  Not like youre going to throw a party in there anyway  Its big enough to get done what you need to get done  FYI   I LOVED the beds So did my Mom  She has a bad back and thought they were the most comfortable of all the hotels mostly  Star we stayed at on our trip  And I personally loved the green tiles in the bathroom Very cool  Since I drove all the way from Minneapolis   dont ask   I needed to find parking  The hotel gave me a discounted rate to park in a rental car garage one block up  Cheap parking for NYC Literally lots of great food within walking distance of the hotel  And a mini fridge to keep things cold  I truly loved staying here and have made this my number one hotel choice for all my upcoming trips to NYC YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED 
P => European Style and comfort The hotel is currently undergoing some reations but I was not disturbed in the least  The rooms are small but very comfortable  Bath rooms are very nice and all the toiletries are included every day  Very Euro style  Id go bacvk and will  
P => loved the place What a great place to stay  Clean super quite and very well located  
P => A Week in New York The Hotel Belleclaire is on the Upper West Side of Manhattan which is good for Central Park and Museums but a subway ride to everything else  A bit more tedious than a Mid Town location  Neighbourhood offers plenty of dining options and there is a laundrette right next door  Was in a two bed suite for six   ideal for a family   not so much for two sharing couples as access to the bathroom was at the end of the first rooms bed However there is a door between the two bedrooms  Traffic noise from Broadway was a shocker but nothing that earplugs didnt fix Front office staff were polite enough upon check in but never once looked up to smile or greet us for the rest of the week and the door man actually went inside the gift shop when he saw anyone coming and was not in the least helpful Wouldnt bother with this one again Go mid town  
P => Hotel in the making literally Slightly dissapointed is my review of the Belleclaire especially now that Iam home  The room was just a bit too small even for New York the air con sounded like a car running we were put on the second floor and as there was revervation work being done it was imposible to relax in the day time due to the noise admittedly we spent most of our time in New York outside but still because of the heat outside we occasionally wanted to crash for an hour in the hotel room this was simply impossible  I would recomend anyone staying at this hotel to get a room above the th floor due to the renervation work being done also for a  room hotel to have only two very small lifts was a problem Now for the good New York was wonderful the hotel location is fanastic anything that you would want is right on the doorstep  The location really did save this stay  However I would stongly recomend that despite what the Hotel belleclaire says about the Manhatten diner accross from the hotel you should miss this restaurant  I found the staff incredibly rude and they made both myself and my partner feel very uncomfortable the one time that we did eat there  Avoid at all costsAll in all I had agreat time in New York but i had nothing to do with this hotel PS Also watch out for cockroaches we only had two you  get more 
P => Best value in NYC had a great stay  Highly recommended  My family stayed for  nights in a  bedroom suite  The accommodation was faultless with clean bedlinen and abundant fresh towels daily  Rooms are a good size with air conditioning and very comfortable beds  There was no noise at all and we had good views over the city roofscape towards the Hudson River  The hotel is situated in a safe and pleasant neighbourhood with a plethora of excellent restaurants bars fresh fruit kets bakeries bookshops movie theaters etc all close by  There is metered parking in the street or plenty of garages to choose from and subway is also nearby  The hotel is only  minutes by car from Yankee Stadium or Times Square and just a few minutes walk from Central Park and the major museums  Front desk staff are especially helpful  We have stayed in other hotels in NYC in the past but for location and top value we shall return to the Belleclaire on our next visit  
P => Belleclaire was quaint and wonderful My boyfriend and I had wanted a place just to get away for a night  We are both new york natives I from Queens he from the Bronx and we were feeling a bit stressed  Last minute we ided to book a room at the Hotel Belleclaire  I found out about it based on other reviews at tripadvisor and my boyfriend is particularly fond of the Manhattan Diner a  hour diner across the street from Belleclaire and when we found out it was right there that was it for usWe called around pm on a sunday and they had a queen sized room private not an economy room and the rate was only  for the night  after taxes  We checked in around pm very quickly and had a room on the second floor  The lobby had a very homey feel The room was great  Incredibly clean and very cozy and a great size for the two of us  Loved the orations and the funky green walls And the flat screen t v  was definitely a plus The bed was very comfy and the sheets very clean  The bathroom was just right as well though the tub was a little tiny  But the water pressure was fantastic Also we loved the soap and shampoos they had for use  Just as a side the elevators were VERY tiny For us it was no big deal as we each just had a backpack of stuff but for those with luggage make sure you get the bellhop to bring it upCheck out was  noon and we stayed til about   Ive had the experience at other hotels where even with the do not disturb sign on the door maids still come and knock on the door to push you out  Not here  They completely respected our privacy until we were ready to leave We checked out in about a grand total of  seconds and we were good to go The front desk staff were very sweet  Also the hotel is located in a great side street and was SO quiet  No traffic or anything at least not in the room we were in We will ABSOLUTELY stay here again the next time we need a little break and we are pretty sure well become regulars 
P => Good if you just need a place to sleep  I stayed here for  nights over new years    The price was great Couldnt get anything near that price  The location is good  I would have hated to be right on top of Times Square  There were so many people there that week being down there at all made me claustrophobic  The Belleclaire is just a two minute walk to a subway entrance  You can take that down to nd street station and catch a train to anywhere you want to go  A couple of late night eats were around the corner but they werent that great Anyway  the reason the price was so great is because you have to share a bathroom with two other rooms  There was one door that a key card would let you into that was just a hallway with  other doors three rooms and a bathroom  We never had too much of a problem getting to use the bathroom whenever we wanted to  It was a bit of an adventure because a young couple had the room next to us and they wouldnt stop fighting for  days  The walls are very thin so we could hear a lot of what they were saying  It really didnt bother us much though  We made a show of it because they kept fighting in the hall too  We looked out the peep hole for a couple good hours of lhs and entertainment  The rooms were very small moderately clean thought we did kill a cockroach in the room one night  There is no view just look out the window to a brick wall  The beds were comfortable and the linens appeared clean  Bottom line is if you are looking for a bed with a lock on the door and a low price and not much else this place is for you  If you want romance elegance  etc go somewhere else  This place is just a step or two above hostel  
P => Nice Stay We just returned from a two night stay at the Belleclaire  All in all the hotel is clean the rooms are clean  We had a two room suite on the th floor with bathroom attached  The bathroom is small and for the most part clean  It didnt seem like they wiped down the tiles in the bathroom at all not that it was gross or anything it was just quite noticeable  We went for the Yankee game and it was pretty easy to access the subway there and back even though we had to change trains  There are many nice restaurants nearby Manhattan Diner across the street had some great french toast as well as a variety in their menu  The Fairway ket is really nice for fresh fruit and veggies and is right around the corner  the fridges in the room came in handy It was a nice area and we felt safe walking around  It was a little culture shock for our  year old who has never seen the homeless sleeping on the streets as we live in a small town but nobody bothered us and people were actually quite friendly Also cabs were readily available right on Broadway even rush hour when we needed a cab to the airport If we ever ide to travel back to the city I would definetely look into stay at the Belleclaire again  
P => Wonderful Stay at the Belleclaire What a GREAT time we had at the Belleclaire We just return from a  night stay there  Honeymoom trip The hotel is very well located whitin easy walking distance from many many sights  Central Park subway Zabars    Everything was just perfect We were assigned a simple but nice double room on court  Room was clean fresh which I believe is very important  The bathroom was quite large  compared to Paris size Although the elevator was sometimes slow or packed it could have been much worst  We found the hotel very quiet at night As a fussy parisian tourist I must say I was impressed by the friendly and efficient staff at the front desk and especially Jake the bellboy When you feel like the staff enjoys working there I believe you in the right place   We felt like at home We highly recommend this property and will surely return there in the future 
P => NYC First Timer Lovely Hotel in a quite neighbourhood  Just what you need after the madness of manhattan  Family Room for  adults and  Teenagers  Very modern or spotlessly clean and spacious Only complaint could have had heavy curtains on windows as the roller blinds failed to block out the light  
P => Great hotel When we arrived the staff was very courteous and prompt  The room was very clean and had a great view  I was reluctant to share a bathroom and to my surprise the bathroom was always empty  It is very centrally located to the subway museums eateries and grocery stores  It felt like a residence hotel  I will stay there whenever I come to New York  Keep up the good work For the price it is a steal 
P => Super Hotel My boyfriend and I stayed for a week in the Belleclaire Hotel  We absolutely loved it The subway is only minutes away and there are some great trendy and not expensive  restaurants only a couple of blocks away including Isabellas Nice Matin and some great italian places  All with terraces very european very nice dining The room was spacious and clean  The bathroom also clean every day fresh towels  A big TV and great airco You do hear some constant zooming from the aircos outside of the many building but we did not have a problem to sleep through that  The hotel does not provide breakfast but does have vouchers for the manhatten diner for  dollar  A great experience  But we just went to the westside ket around the corner  They have everything and is just a minute from the hotel We would really recommend this to everybody who is looking for a great stay in NY in a quiet and pleasant environment 
P => Great find My husband and I stayed here for  nights and were upgraded to a suite upon check in  The rooms were smallish but very stylish clean and confy  The reception staff were very friendly and it is close to amenities  try the fantastic delicum superket next door which has some fantastic produce cheeses salads sandwiches  Belleclaire hotel was a great find and we would definitely go back  
P => Very impressed I was very pleasantly surprised by the Hotel Belleclaire  The staff was very helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable  Our room had a very nice flat screen LG television  The location is only  blocks from a subway stations  Right across Broadway is an inexpensive  hour diner called quotManhattan Dinerquot that is very clean and has some of the best cheesecake Ive ever had  I will definitely stay at the Hotel Belleclaire again  
P => great bargain for my family We are a family of   kids are  and  and recently stayed at the Bellaclaire  We requested and recieved a room with  beds  The room was simply orated   no pictures on the walls but was large by Manhatten standard including the bathroom  There is no central air conditioning but there was an air conditioner in the window which was a little noisy but kept the room cool  There was a closet but limited draw space for clothing  There was a small refrigerator and a large flat screen TV The hotel is situated about  blocks from Central Park and the Museum of Natural History and  block from a ent playground  The nieghborhood is great plenty of small family friendly restaurants delis and shops  The subway is about  blocks away and there are plenty of taxis around We paid about  a night  The nearest hotel called On the Avenue would have been about twice the price  All in all it was a vey good deal  
P => Great Place We were in NYC over the Fathers Day e th   e th weekend and were completely pleased with the Belleclaire  Its in the heart of the Upper West Side in a residential area of Manhattan with plenty of restaurants and shopping near the hotel  A great escape from hours of walking and touring the rest of Manhattan The room was very clean and larger than expected  The shared bathroom was not bad either  Clean and close by  A stretching experience for sure  The only time we had to wait to use it was towards the end of our trip  Other that that no major waiting to get in and out The hotel was quiet and the staff friendly  They responded to all of our requests with promptness I would definitely stay here again for the price and location  If I were to bring my kids I would opt for a private bath for convenience and time A great find 
P => Loved this place My  yr old granddhter and I recently took our first trip to NYC and stayed a week here mainly because of the price and reviews from this site  We both couldnt have been more pleased with our choice  The staff was friendly and helpful  The room while not plush was functional very clean and larger than I expected  We chose a room that shared a bath with two other rooms in order to save even more money and stay longer  The room included two very comfortable single beds sink compact fridge hair dryer ironing board and iron a single wooden desk chair and a new large screen TV  The window looked out on the back of other buildings but I didnt come to NY to look out my window  If youve come to NY to spend most of the day in your hotel room this probably shouldnt be your first choice  There was only one occasion during the whole week when one of us wanted to use the bathroom and it was occupied  Maid service came every day while we were out to change sheets and bring clean towels  One day someone forgot to leave washcloths  We contacted the front desk and within  minutes someone was at our door washcloths in hand  The hotel is in an excellent location on a shady street just a few steps from Broadway  This is a safe residential area a great place for strolling with many small stores and restaurants along Broadway and Amsterdam one block over  There are several reasonably priced restaurants and bakeries within a couple of blocks three food stores within   blocks a good use for the fridge a subway station and bus stop on th St  and a Barnes amp Noble and McDonalds within   blocks  From the th St  subway station we were able to go sometimes with a transfer from the northern tip of Manhattan The Cloisters to the southern tip Statue of Liberty ferry and from Brooklyn to Times Square to the East Village to see STOMP to SOHO and Greenwich Village  The MET is a short subway and crosstown bus ride  The American Museum of Natural History is within walking distance as is Central Park  However we found Riverside Park along the Hudson to be closer  For families with younger children there is a playground right at the th St  entrance to the park   two blocks from the hotel  After a day in the congestion and commotion of mid town we always enjoyed coming back to the relative calm of the hotels environs  My granddhter always wanted to go for an early evening walk on Broadway and I never felt any concern for our safety  The hotel has an international clientele and those slow elevators give you time to listen to the many languages spoken by its guests  During the ten second ride to the th floor you might even have the opportunity to strike up a conversation and ask someone were theyre from  Imagine  And the guests span all ages   a place where both young and older will feel equally at home I want to go back to NY   this afternoon if not earlier  And this is were I want to stay  Clean rooms great service friendly staff excellent location  This is one of the best bargains in NYC   a great base from which to explore the whole city  Go  Book a room  Share a bathroom  Save a bunch of money  Stay a week  Have fun  
P => Great Hotel in safe nice neighborhood  Stayed here for a family reunion   and found some of the negative reviews a bit misleading  Yes the  elevators are small and slower then normal but look quotlike newquot inside  The staff is very friendly and we loved the location  The Express Subway is  blocks south or better yet take the quotquot at th and switch at nd  The only problem with the  hour Manhattan Diner across the street GREAT food and PRICE was eating there too often as I came to NY to eat at a variety of places  gtShared a room with my mom senior with a shared bath and we were very concerned about doing so but there were no other rooms avialible  Throughout our  days there was only  other time someone else of the  other rooms who shared it was ever in it when I needed it  It was spotlessly clean  AND saved we  per night I would stay there again in a second  Cant wait to go back to the quotNew and Improvedquot New York city  
P => fantastic stayed at the belleclaire with a school party  Staff extremely friendlylocation idealrooms very clean and good size Elevator bit slow but always the staircase  Door staff  veryvery friendly and helpful Air Con excellent Diner across the way friendly even though food was mediocre food was ok Would stay here again with another school party or my family 
P => Our school group loved the Belleclaire Our school group thoroughly enjoyed our  night stay  Even though we checked in late with twenty nine  year olds the staff were very courteous and dealt with check in most efficiently  Any requests our group had were promptly dealt with during our stay  As other reviewers have stated the hotel is only a  minute walk away from the subway which even with  school students was not too busy or difficult to use  The rooms were clean and tidy with very few grumbles from the students  Those that shared a bath had two sets of doors to enter their rooms which was great for safety  The beds were also very comfortable  The diner across the street served great breakfasts with our students still commenting on the food served there  The only slight grumble that I have is that the lifts were small and very slow  However I would most certainly recommend the Belleclaire and hope to take another school party there next year  
P => Great value for the money I booked the Belleclaire for a motherdhter weekend  I booked it because it was the most affordable hotel that was still close enough to restaurants and stores  We did walk to TImes Square and the Gershwin from the hotel but it is a bit of a hike  Dont be afraid to use the subway though its fast and easy  Catch it on th or nd  The great thing about the Belleclaire is the bellmen  They were so friendly helpful and anticipated our needs we just loved them  The check inout was fast and problem free  The rooms are reated and have nice dark hardwood floors and flat screen TVquotS  Our view was non existent it was a concrete wall  The elevators could be slow but really that is a minor thing  We would go back  We liked that the hotel was a bit away from the tourist craziness  When you shop and eat around there it is like you are in a neighbourhood  We got fruit and juice from the ket next door and kept it in the room mini fridge  The Manhattan Diner on the corner has mediocre food but I loved the atmosphere  The New York atmosphere in there is something cool  
P => Classy little hotel in NYC We spent  nites at the Belleclaire for our dhters graduation festivities  It was such a pleasure to find this hotel  The staff was courteous   we arrived early and they checked us in anyhow  The room was clean the bed comfortable with a super cushiony feather bed type mattress pad and comforter  The air conditioning worked great  It had a desk and chair Ipod docking station with amfm radio LCD wall mounted flat screen tv queen bed  nite stands and a small refrigerator  We could have used a luggage rack or bench to put our luggage on instead of the floor  The bathroom was large with a pedestal sink nice clean shower with great hot water and water pressure  An extra hook behind the door or on the wall would have been nice  However   we werent there except to sleep and the price and location was right  Lots of shops  large kets many little restaurants for breakfast and close to everything including the subway Central Park Columbus Circle  We would stay there again in a heart beat  
P => Good Value Great location I was extremely pleased with the location cleanliness and staff at the Hotel Bellclaire  The room was a ent size for New Yorkand the large plasma TV and ipod docking station  clock radio were a bonus  The elevator was tiny and I was glad that I could take the stairs up and down from the third floor as you can have a bit of a wait for an elevator  The location was even better than I expected  It was a two block walk to the subway two kets just down the street had a great variety of grab and go meals and produce both open until  AM  There are also banks drug stores and most other services within two blocks  I felt completely safe walking from the subway back to the hotel after midnight  I also had no problem catching a cab on Broadway at  am to leave for the airport I recommend the Hotel Bellclaire over many of the other hotels in this price category  The price was good though next time Id get a quote directly from the hotel as I think the savings advertised by Expedia werent as dramatic as they led you to believe  
P => Not too bad for lower quality hotel We stayed in New York for a week over the New Years period so price was a big factor in iding where to stay  We chose the Belleclaire because we wanted to stay a little further away from the craziness of Times Square and the Upper West Side is great The room we first checked in to was much smaller than we had imagined but we thought that wed only be there to sleep so that didnt matter   except we didnt sleep at all  We were on the th floor room  and there was a constant high pitch hissing coming from the pipes in our bathroom all night  I put up with it for about  hours and couldnt stand it any longer  The guy at the front desk said that it didnt sound right so he sent up a maintenance man who came and looked at it  He walked into the bathroom and I told him what the problem was and he looked at me like I was an idiot  The pipe that was hissing was the pressure release valve for the heating units from every room below us and it was normal for it to do that and would continue to do so because everyone had their heaters on  If we had only been staying a couple of nights I  have put up with it but we were going to be there for a week so I complained about it again and later the following day we were moved to another bigger room with a much nicer bathroom and no release valve pipe The best part of the new room though was the view   we had two large windows that looked over the Hudson river which was just beautiful room   The location of the Belleclaire is great    blocks from the subway  blocks from Central Park and the room service restaurant is fantastic   the Manhattan Diner just across the road   great service and cheap meals The bathrooms are clean but a bit run down and the rooms are small but normal by New York standards  If youre thinking about staying at the Belleclaire Id recommend it but pay the extra for a room with a private bathroom  
P => Spacious Enough for Bachelorettes A group of girlfriends and I chose to stay at Hotel Belleclaire as part of a bachelorette party in the city  The hotel rate was superb and the amenities available were standard for a budget class hotel  We stayed in a suite with three double beds to accomodate all six of us  The room was spacious comfortable and clean which was just perfect for six ladies stumbling home from a night on the town  
P => great budget hotel we had a great  days in this hotel well located with good bars and diners all round the room was spotless with a great bedthe best hotel bed ive slept in for ages ent sized bathroom for newyork with a plasma tv and a nice hifi system and small fridge in fact all you need for a trip to the big apple  
P => Great for budget travel Recently spent  weeks in NYC moving to the Belleclaire for the last  days in order to stretch my vacation dollars Booked a queensize wshared bath thinking I could switch to a room w private bath if necessary  As it turned out sharing the bathroom with  other rooms was fine I didnt have a travel companion during my stay at the Belleclaire and felt very comfortable and safe at the hotel and in the neighborhood I would definitely stay here again to enjoy the low rates and explore the neighborhood more  
P => Fabulous and would stay again My boyfriend and I stayed Sun Wed at the Hotel Belleclaire  The weather was beautiful and the hotel couldnt have been better I was apprehensive about the sharing of a bathroom as I have never done that before  It worked out just fine it was very clean and not at all an issue with the two other rooms  The fact that sharing a bathroom took about  a night off the rate was even better  Considering we werent in our room except to sleep and shower I would do it again  The room was small which was fine and had a sink and two mirrors to get ready with  The fridge was of great use for bottled water and the goodies I got from the great grocery store Westside Superket close by I think thats the name  The Hotel Belleclaire is near two subway stations and lots of shopping plenty of stores nail salon and a Starbucks H amp M and Zabars coffee  The only thing missing was coffee in the lobby in the morning or makers in the room  But it was OK because we checked out some nearby establishments to get it instead  As other reviewers have stated the staff was friendly and someone responded to fix our clogged sink promptly I plan to return to NYC to see Xanadu on Broadway this summer and would stay at the Hotel Belleclaire in a heartbeat 
P => Great Deal on Corner of Broadway My boyfriend and I had gone to NYC without the intention of staying over  Around pm we opted to try to find a hotel instead of driving home and found that most hotels were booked or    dangerous  Very late my mother found Belleclaire on the internet so we drove up and got an economy room for about   Michelle at the desk was extremely helpful and even helped us find free parking along Broadway free at night before  am after the cheaper garages were sold out  As part of the economy room we had key access to a small hallway with three bedrooms and a bathroom and then key access to our individual room  it felt very private from the other rooms  i could only hear people in the other rooms when i was standing in the hallway  nice shampooconiditionerlotion supplied  hairdryer in closet  tv with very few channels but included cartoon net news etc  ac in room  a great deal  at corner of th and broadway  and a great little  diner right next door on b way  
P => Loved the Belleclaire   Again My girlfriend and I stayed at the belleclaire for a week in il  and we loved it our room was on the th floor and was a queen with ensuite bathroom  The room had nice but plain or newly done wooden flooring a flatscreen tv and mini fridge  The bathroom was very clean not too bad a shower  I am not sure if we had a corner room but the room was of a very ent size in nyc I had stayed at the belleclaire in  with friends and also had a ent sized suite room and I was told the belleclaire has redone all the rooms since then hence the flatscreen tvs and wooden flooring  All in all we had a lovely stay everyone down the front was lovely and helpful  Also the manhatten diner is in such perfect location for breakfast every morning you also have a few little pizza places and superkets around which are awesome  I wouldnt stay anywhere else in nyc such great value and a better nyc experiance Go for it 
P => Not a great start at the Hotel Belleclaire but ok in the end Rather annoying that on arrival at the hotel I was told that for my five day stay I had to change rooms the next day as they were reating the room they allocated  The room was fine but they had booked the work and I had no alternative Id booked it two months in advance and telephoned the week before to check all was okay and the last thing I really wanted after flying from England on a short trip was to waste some of my time changing rooms or hotels  Anyway the next day and a brief complaint to the management I was reassured the new room would be fine and I wouldnt be moved again  Got back from my day out and I was upgraded to a king size room with air con bigger bathroom  So despite the annoyance and worry of it all I did all right in the end  Overall I would stay there again on the assumption the room changing was a one off and unlucky  But Id double check everything before arriving Good points Rooms were clean Hotel quiet WiFi available for small charge in rooms Close to subwayManhattan Diner Bad points The room changingReations meant furniture and stuff left in the corridersOdd knocking noise from the pipes Card key entry didnt always work Double room have very small sinksNo safe in the rooms king or double  Top Tips  Manhattan Diner across the street is excellent    Big Nicks Burger joint good for one visit    Ruby Foos restaurant next door to diner is not great   nice fridge magnet though  Westside ket is good for fruit salads and snacks for the day   Subway  min walk to th local mins longer to nd express service  Picking up the  day Metro card was worth it even for our  day stay so convenient to pop in and out downtown    Becco Italian  Short hop down the subway to Times Sq and up to th st for Becco Italian restaurant excellent food price fixed pasta special and wine list 
P => Pleasantly surprised I stayed at the Belleclaire for  nights from th ch to th il   The hotel is on the upper west side of manhattan on th and Broadway  My boyfriend and I reserved rooms as part of a group of  we had  double rooms  When checking in one of the other couples were told that they had no reservation but they had the booking email so they were given a room after  mins  When my boyfriend and I went to our room on the th floor we were shocked by the state of the corridor there were pieces of furniture and large boxes all over and we could barely pass by with our luggage so we were fairly anxious about our room  however our room had two double beds really nicely orated and even had a flatscreen TV and a little fridge  The bathroom was spotless and our towels and bedlinen were changed every day  The room was a little warm couldnt turn off the heat for some reason but had air con also  It was really comfortable and clean which was all we wanted for our stay  The other  couples had only one bed in their rooms but paid the same rate so i suppose we were just lucky  Theres no restaurant at the hotel but the Manhattan Diner is across the street so we had breakfast there every morning and headed off on the Subway to go sightseeing for the day  The Diner also supplies room service to the hotel which we didnt use but its open  so its really handy  Theres also a gift shop at the entrance of the hotel and the staff there were really helpful they were able to arrange a bus for us back to the airport when we checked out and the hotel stored our luggage for the day as we were flying out late that evening so we could go get some more sights in  Didnt really have much dealings with the reception staff only checking in and out  Overall I thought the Belleclaire was perfect for our trip and I would definitely stay there again location is its only downfall for someone who wants to be within walking distance of enerything  
P => Belleclaires cool if you book the Diner special Hotel Belleclaire is in a fairly quiet for New York City neighborhood the Upper West Side so its not a partyer hotel but that was fine by us  Its still close enough to the touristy areas Lincoln Center Times Square etc  that it doesnt feel out of the way  The economy room is actually pretty spacious for NYC but the shared bathroom had a funky smell and the door didnt really close all the way The room also comes with a sink but our room didnt have a light near the sink so at night you couldnt see in the mirror to shave wash your face etc  However the room and bathroom are clean so overall our stay was comfortable  The restaurants in this neighborhood do tend to close on the early side by pm although there are a couple cheap hour options nearby  We did a great deal on the quotManhattan Dinerquot special where you get breakfast free at the diner across the street every morning  That was a big plus  The service was also really friendly and helpful although I didnt trust the advice from the concierge in the gift store  
P => A classic hotel in Manhatten I stayed here over Easter and because I had been following up on past Trip advisor members coments there were no suprises I had a clean  comfortable room with a shared bathroom I only saw  other person in the three days I was there The bathroom was spotless I paid    for the friday and then   for the satsunday which is great for Manhatten Yes I would stay there again because you are only in the room to sleep  If you are at the Manhatten Diner across the street for a nite cap before turning in after a long days sightseeing and the waiter is a Greek chap get the price of the drinks first because we had to pay   for three Brandys 
P => Great bargain in NYC Stayed in a shared bath room around xmas   The bathroom is shared with  other rooms so it was never much of an issue with waiting  Theres a sink and mirror in the room itself so you can wash your face and brush your teeth in your own room  The room is clean and ent size  The bed and pillows are comfortable  Closet is a bit small though  Nothing luxurious but for the price we paid about     it is such a great bargain for NYC  You are a couple of blocks from the subway Red Line  a few blocks from Zabars and Arties  Central Park is within walking distance also  I highly recommend this hotel Of course being uptown you are not close to the quotactionquot like you would be downtown but the area is quiet and very safe as a hotel base  You also have fewer subway lines to choose from well theres only  very close by but for me its not a problem When we arrived at JFK we called SuperShuttle to pick us up but they pretty much sucked   had to wait for a long time the driver took a looooong timeroute  When we left at the end of the trip we booked the shuttle via the hotel which picked us up from the hotel promptly and we arrived at JFK at reasonable time  I think its called Golden something  So I recommend booking the shuttle with the hotel  
P => Great hotel for the price We stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire in ember  We knew going there that the room was going to be small but I guess I didn t realize just how small they could possibly make a room  Thankfully we were never in the room much so it wasn t a problem  If you go to NY to stay in the room then this probably isn t the hotel for you  We only used the room to sleep and spent the majority of our time exploring the city  We stayed in a room with the shared bathroom which made me slightly nervous  I actually didn t tell my husband about it till we arrived cause I figured he d want to stay some place else but I couldn t justify spending an extra  per night just for a bathroom  But all was good and we never had any problems  We never ran into any when we wanted in the bathroom and it was never dirty or gross  We did wake up early each morning and were out of the hotel by AM though  The only thing that we didn t like about the hotel is that it was SUPER hot in the room  Even though it was the middle of ember we had to sleep with the window up and it was still hot  The elevator was pretty small too but we are young and healthy so we didn t mind walking the seven flights up to our room giving others a chance to ride on the elevator  The hotel is on the West Side and conveniently located near two subway stations  There is a  hour grocery store right around the corner along with some restaurants  We loved the pizza shop that was beside the subway station  Central Park is also only a couple of blocks away  Belleclaire is away from all the hustle and bustle of the city but it is close enough to jump on the subway and be there in mere minutes  If it is your first time to the city I would highly recommend trying out the Grayline bus tours  You can see a lot in a few days by hopping on and off the bus and any time  It is well worth the cost  We were able to do the holiday lights tour since it was around Christmas time on the bus and it was awesome  We were able to cram in so many different landk sites in just a few days by riding the bus  If you go to Central Park take a carriage ride  It is pretty amazing  Also purchase the metro card for the subway  you ll save  Overall I would recommend the Hotel Belleclaire  It is a great budget hotel  Don t spend extra  on your room when you can use it to buy and do more things while you are there  
P => Great room great price First time in New York  We heard some stories about cheaper hotels but based on reviews we took a chance on Hotel Belleclaire  Pleasantly surprised  Clean comfortable rooms great location at a great price  Very close to subway nice ket in front of hotel and a great diner right across the street Manhattan Diner 
P => great homebase Stayed in the family suite  Nothing fancy but room was clean and beds comfortable When we are visiting NYC we spend very little time in our rooms so it had everything we needed  Mini refridge as well Staff was very friendly helpful  Location is great  Many choices to eat within walking distance and subway very close Will stay there again 
P => Great deal and great location We stayed at the Belleclaire for  nights  The staff was helpful and friendly and the location cant be beat   blocks from a subway stop  blocks from Central Park on the Upper West Side  If youre looking for luxury this is not the place to stay  But for a couple of friends or a family looking for a place to sleep while sightseeing in the city its a great find  There are some great restaurants in the area  we loved the coffehouse down the block that offers smores  You make them right at your table  We stopped in two different nights to enjoy that sweet treatWe had a room w two twin beds and a shared bath  The room was clean great linens on the beds and large thick towels for the bathroom none of those skimpy ones you get at some hotels We were a bit apprehensive about the shared bath but it worked out well and save us a bit of   It was always clean and only ran into a few instances when it was occupied when we needed it the bath was shared by  other rooms  The only draw back to our visit is one night the boiler went out in the hotel and we woke up to a freezing hotel room the high that day was  We quickly got dressed and left for the day and by the time we returned at  the room was once again toasty warm  All in all a great stay with a minor glitch 
P => Excellent value in great location We stayed at the Belleview from ruary  to ch  and were really impressed at the general cleanliness and spaciousness of the hotel at such a reasonable price  Three blocks from the vellous Museum of Natural History free first class guided visits by really knowledgable experts every hour   enquire at desk and Central Park  minutes from the subway station and two blocks from the sunny walkway by the Hudson River which will eventually bring you all the way to Battery Park if you have the energy Terrific restaurants a stones throw away   particularly the Manhatten Diner across the street for excellent breakfasts and  hour delivery service too Nicos Greek restaurant on the corner is welcoming and serves wonderful reasonably priced food  And upstairs at the  hour Fairways fruit amp veg amp foodket is an excellent cafe with the best Danish pastires we have ever tasted  And for those who like bargain shopping Filenes Basement is on the next block uptown  If your baggage is light its totally possibly to arrive by subway from JFK just take the Airtrain to Howard Beach catch the A train to th StreetColumbus Circle and change to a   or  train uptown to nd   two blocks south of the hotel on Broadway  The best way to pay is by Metrocard issued at the Air Train terminal where there are really helpful staff to show newcomers the ropes as this can be topped up as required and covers both bus and subway throughout New York city   all rides just  regardless of distance or connections Have a great visit to NY 
P => Wonderful experience got a great deal on this hotel through expedia  i stayed with my two friends in the room  we had a flat screen tv and an oversized bathroom which was great  we had a lovely view of the hudson river and the beds were clean and roomy and comfortable  the hotel itself was attractive and the staff was accomodating  one downside was the tiny elevators which didnt hold too many people so if it was a busy time it  be a short wait  the neighborhood was wonderful and was walking distance to wonderful dining shopping and attractions including Lincoln Center Natural History Museum and Central Park  the subway was two blocks away and was helpful in getting you anywhere else you needed to go  this hotel made our stay that much better and i would recommend it to friends  
P => Location is Key    Our vacation was from       After reading the mix reviews I was pretty anxious to go there  We got the two bedroom family suite  Check in was a breeze and yes the elevators were slow  But to my surprise my whole party fit in the elevator with luggage  adults but the funny thing is our last member got in all right but had to throw down his luggage since the doors started to close and wouldnt open to fit his luggage in his hand would have been crushed if he didnt let go of his luggage The rooms are very small but its new york everything is compact  The bathroom is the smallest bathroom Ive ever seen it was the size of my closet  The tub wouldnt drain very well  The beds were clean and comfy the rooms were also cleaned everyday with frest towels  For the price youre paying its worth the stay Location is the best feature restaurants were close and a grocery store  For all the Starbucks fan theres one located two blocks down when you get of the hotel turn right onto Broadway The subway was only two blocks away which is about a   min walk  We never tried walking to Time Square but the subway takes you into Time Sq so no need to walk  Central Park was  blocks amp the lake is located near nd street  We also rented a car and luckily we went on the weekend we got to park our car for free along the curb in the neighborhoods  I would definitely stay here again we didnt get to try the Manhattan Diner which is my excuse to go back    
P => Delivered I signed up for two beds and a shared bath and that is exactly what I got  The room was clean and the bed comfortable  The sink in the room was very handy as was the refrigerator  There were some problems witht the faucet and the TV that were addressed but never fixed  Evidently they are upgrading the TVs and had not gotten to the floor I was on yet  I would not do a shared bath again for me personally it never seemed cleaned and was very cramped  I never did see anyone else using it but still couldnt bring myself to share a tubshower with strangers  After a long day in NYC walking you want a shower or to soak in a tub so the extra money for a private one would have been well worth it  A good value and great location as everyone agrees as long as their prices dont go up as they upgrade it is a very acceptable option and conveniently near the th Street Subway stop  
P => This is a real review I read many reviews and was very nervous about staying here  We had GREAT customer service  Being a young couple with not much money this being our first time going without one of our families going and paying for the trip we were very pleased  We stayed in a King Size Private bath  This was my th time going to the city and my th hotel and it was the largest bathroom i have ever seen  Yes the hotel was kinda noisey i took earplugs though and slept great after putting them in  EVERY HOTEL IN NEW YORK CITY IS NOISEY this was a great cheap place to stay  I would recommend it to anyone on a budget although i would NOT recommend staying in a shared bath if you stay in the shared baths you get what you pay for if you want a nice room then get a nice room 
P => Great Neighborhood Hotel There are many mixed reviews on this Hotel    But after five nights there in   I felt very happy with my choice of Hotel Its on  and Broadway  About  mins walk to the Metro station at  street  From there its easy to get around Manhatten for a fixed  fare  Or from the hotel you could walk to Times Square   street  in about  mins and to central park in about  mins  I could not fault the location  There are some great local diners and bars nearby and the neighborhood is freindly  busy and had a good vibe  We ate in Big Nicks Pizza and Burger joint and The manhatten diner and enjoyed them both  Coffee from Starbucks over the road and a super hr superket are all on the same block  We also had a great night at Yogis Bar over the road    It was an interesting place  good music  peanuts all over the floor  two very pretty bartenders female and cheap drinks The hotel its self is a large corner plot on a main road  Some of the rooms I guess are noiser than others  I requested a quiet room online before I left and got exactly that  I had room   it was a queen room with ensuite and was small but clean  The bedding and towles were changed every day and the room was spotless    It was also hot  real warm    I turned off the heating and its was just great  even though it was minus  outside The staff were freindly and very helpful   The liftswere small and slow but so what  I requested a late check out and got one for   pm  Also the car servive back to JFK was well organised and reasonable value at  inc toll and tip Its a great place  no spa  no pampering  no higrollers but after seeing the biger  and more expensive  hotels in and around  street I would reccommend tHe Belleclaire highly   For  dollars for a private room on Manhatten I would find it hard to beat   sunshinebob 
P => Very clean but noisy This was a very nice hotel in a great location and very reasonably priced for NYC  My only complaint was the noise level and the heat in the room  Although it was winter and very cold outside the room was so warm we had to sleep with the bathroom window open  The plus side was the cleanliness of the room and the nice thick towels in the bathroom and a large flat screen tv in the room  The staff was was very friendly  The hotel is undergoing reations and we stayed in one of the new rooms  If they would only put in some double paned windows  Manhattan Diner Cosis Ruby Foos and Nickos were all in the same block as the hotel  
P => The place to stay on a budget in the Big Apple For my twentieth birthday I ided the Ideal thing to do to celebrate would be to go back to New York City in ruary  I chose the Belleclaire for the second time after being so pleased after my first visit two years ago  The reviews I had read before the first trip on various websites were all pretty good apart from the odd one that complained about things such as the reation that was being undertaken at that point in time and the odd dingy bathroom  I went not expecting a fantastic hotel but a basic comfortable hotel and I was not let down in any way which is why I felt it was a good hotel to return toWe arrived at the hotel Belleclaire for our  night stay and were greeted by the doorman who pointed us to the reception in the lovely modern foyer  We were checked in quickly with no problems then directed to our rooms which was only a few floors up  We waited for one of the lifts there were two both were small but never busy and found our rooms with ease  We had booked a double room with a shared bathroom on a non smoking floor the room was offset into a corridor off a main corridor so it was nice and quiet  Our room shared a bathroom with two other rooms but there was never a point when either my partner or myself went to use the bathroom and it was already in use  I feel that choosing a shared bathroom is a fantastic way to save money when staying at the Belleclaire    Why spend money on having your own private bathroom when you can share one and have much more money to spend in those wonderful NYC shops Once we arrived in our room I was pleased to find that it was of a ent size was very clean and best of all    the beds are probably the comfiest Ive ever slept in perfect after a hard day of New York life In our room there was a TV games a fridge a sink a large storage cupboard air con radiators and your other basic bits and bobs that you would expect in a hotel room  The view wasnt fantastic unless you really like brick walls but there was a blind and curtains anyways so it wasnt like it was staring you in the face all day  Our rooms were cleaned and our beds made up daily which Ive heard is uncommon in other budget hotels  The hotel didnt offer its own restaurant but did offer delivery from the fantastic restaurantdiner over the road  I do belive the restuarant is called simply the Manhattan Diner and it is ideally situated for breakfast before a hard day shopping and sightseeing The food is delicious and the service is the fastest and most efficient Ive ever seen add that to the bargainous prices and we have a winner  The hotel is situalted in a lovely little neighbourhood in the upper west side of Manhattan  Its quite quiet but only a short Journey from the hustle and bustle of the city  By foot it is approximately  minutes to Central ParkMuseum of Natural History and only  minutes walk from Times square  There is easy access to nearby subway stations which make your jouneys all over NYC only a matter of minutes long    Id definately reccomend you use the subway in the afternoon when your feet start aching that little bit    they will thank you later on There are lots of nice local shops near the hotel and also a few small superkets to stock up on snacks and drinks for your hotel room  On our second stay in New York when we left the hotel to walk into the city on our last day we were greeted with knee deep snow which was quite a shock Little did we know we were about to be cht up in the biggest snowstorm NYC had seen in a long time  We called our pre booked shuttle bus service to check that our transportation to the airport was still okay and they confirmed that everything should be fine  We checked out of our room and left our bags at the hotel whilst we went for some breakfast  Upon returning to the hotel we found out our transport to the airport had been delayed by hours so the hotel staff allowed us to set up camp in the foyer Hours later we were eventually given the information that we would not be getting any transport via our pre booked shuttle bus and that we had to make our own way there as it was not safe for such vehicles on the roads  The hotel staff were very helpful at this point and found us an alternate route to the airport which involved walking catching subways and busses and took a few hours and gave us verbal and printed directions and timescales  If they hadnt been so helpful we would have probably still been there now OverviewHotel Belleclaire W  th StreetCorner of BroadwayNew YorkNY Basic cheap and comfortable accomodation Shared bathroom rooms are much better value Close to subways and Central Park  Friendly helpful staff Nice neighbourhood If youre on a budget yet still want comfort and cleanliness Id definately reccomend the Belleclaire 
P => great location nice hotel just returned from  nights at the belleclaire  first time in new york had a standard room with shared bath which was never a problem  it was always clean and the shower was great  staff always helpful and polite location was great  blocks from subway at th st very easy to get round manhattan once you got the hang of it manhattan diner across the street does great food and is open hours and big nicks downstairs does great pizza   plenty of food kets along broadway too times sq and th st within about  min walk  cut through central park at th street and cross it until you reach th avenue then just carry on down the street shops are wonderfulhad a great time will definatley be back 
P => Great Budget Hotel A brilliant hotel for the budget travellor  Stayed  nights and a great place to crash at the end of a busy day  Hotel was clean tidy and staff were always cheerful and polite  Had to share bathroom but this was fine  The bathroom was always free when I wanted it and it was also spotless  It appears that the staff went in there a few times during the day to clean it Would recommend hotel to anyone    
P => Good hotel We stayed at the Belleclaire after reading reviews from this site and we were pleased at our choice  The room was a stylish studio style room and a comfortable bed  We had some trouble controlling the heating but it was cold anyway  It isnt the Hilton but we found it to be clean and comfortable for  nights  The diner out the front is good also for a traditional american diner meal  The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was fully booked each night we were there  We would stay there again  
P => Loved it  great budget hotel Stayed in the hotel last week for  days and found it to be of very high standard for a budget hotel  we stayed in an economy room with a shared bathroom we found that there was no issue as regards waiting to use the facilities and the cleanliness  The rooms themselves were cleaned on a daily basis and fresh towels were also provided  The hotel staff were very helpful and as it was our first time to New York we had no idea where any of the places we wanted to visit were located so we had to ask for help on a regular basis  The hotel is well located just  blocks from the subway line and with a good diner just across the road I would definately use this hotel again 
P => Good choice Just returned from  nights in New York  Id been keeping an eye on the reviews of the Belleclaire so it already felt familiar to me when we arrived  The staff were friendly and helpful  The room was on the small side but was fine  We went for the shared bathroom accommodation and it was ok  Our room was one of three in its own lobby behind a swipe card operated door  The reason for this is to keep our allocated bathroom for use only by  rooms  One downside to this was that there were now  extra doors banging whenever any of the other guests in our little area came through or used the bathroom  Some people seem happy to let doors swing shut loudly as opposed to closing them gently  Oh well  Our room overlooked the corner of th Street and Broadway and although it was on the th floor it was a bit noisy  New Yorkers love to use the horns on their cars Also the local fire station was nearby which resulted in us being woken by loud sirens in the middle of the night a few times We breakfasted at the Manhattan Diner opposite the hotel where you can get a filling breakfast for     The local subway is about  minutes away so getting to other areas was easy  There is a cinema about  minutes walk away  Central Park is nearby and genarally the area feels safe  Barnes and Noble bookstore is also about  minutes walk   a very nice shop  And yes the lifts are a bit slow   so whatIf you want ent basic accommodation on a low budget Id recommend this hotel  
P => Hated It Nothing like the the hotels website Dont be fooled into thinking your room will look anything like those pictures First of all the room spelled like smoke and mildew  The shower had mildew on the walls the linens smelled like cigarettes there was no wall orations bare and I mean bare and the elevators are very small Then when we checked out we had to wait for multiple evevators to stop on our floor until one could fit us did I mention we were only two people with two rolling bags  Dont go 
P => Great value in a Euro style hotel We stayed at the Belleclaire for three nights     The hotel is mentioned and recommended in many reputable guidebooks such as the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide to New York  and the Time Out New York guide   Most of the TripAdvisor reviews have been favorable and it was mainly on the TripAdvisor recommendations that we ided to book a queen bed room with a shared bath for the rate of  per night    a real deal when compared with the going rate for other hotel rooms on the Upper West Side all of which were asking   a night for similar lodging We booked in y and received an e mail confirmation the next day  Two weeks ago prior to our arrival I e mailed the hotel and asked if they could give us a room away from the front of the hotel since many TripAdvisor reviews mentioned loud street noise at night    something we would find hard to put up with  When we arrived at the hotel we were given      our wish had been granted You use your key to enter a door which leads to a small vestibule where rooms   and  are located  The shared bath for these three rooms is located off the same vestibule  The room was small but perfectly clean with a small sink in one corner a closet with ironing board iron and extra blankets a nice quot Samsung flat screen TV and a utilitarian table and folding chair  A good supply of heavy cotton towels and a cotton bathmat were waiting on the table We thoroughly enjoyed our stay  The room was completely quiet at night the window opened onto an interior courtyard and there was no street noise whatsoever  The bed was one of the most comfortable Ive slept in with nice thick pillows and a warm comforter  New York was sunny and cool during our stay so we used the AC unit fan to bring in fresh air from the outside since the window did not open  The air was refreshing and even the low hum of the fan was a pleasant quotwhite noisequot which aided sleep The shared bath was SPOTLESSLY CLEAN at all times  Only once did we encounter other guests on their way in or out of it  We could only deduce that the hotel staff keeps a close eye on the shared baths and ensures that they remain clean  Water pressure from the shower was good hot water plentiful The hotel staff are cordial friendly and accommodating  A doorman greeted us and held the door nearly every time we entered or left the buliding  As many TripAdvisor members have mentioned the Manhattan Diner is on the NE corner of th and Broadway just steps away from the hotel entrance and you cant find a better place in the neighborhood for a hearty breakfast  We often selected the   breakfast two eggs any style a choice of bacon ham or sausage toast butter and jam a substantial glass of orange juice and unlimited cups of excellent coffee    all for    The menu is extensive and you could easily have all your meals here for a very low price Around the corner on Broadway just a few feet south of the hotel the Westside ket offers a full line of groceries as well as beer amp wine cheeses breads deli salads and even sandwiches for take away  Its a fabulous place to buy food and supplies  If you were on a tight budget you could put together a wonderful meal just from this ket and enjoy it right in your room Our room was small with not much space to move around the perimeter of the bed  But we used the room only to sleep and with a rate of only  per night we felt that we had made the perfect choice  We easily saved  to  a night and the savings were spent on theatre tickets museums and restaurants  Staying here is very much like staying in a tourist class hotel in Europe  It isnt the Hilton or even the Hampton Inn but its clean attractive safe and affordable  
P => Great place to stay My mom aunt and I stayed in a quot Bedroom Family Suitequot on ober    It was a large room basically divided by a wall with two queen beds and TV on one side and another queen bed and TV on the other side  We had our own bathroom    clean great water pressure in the shower and nice toiletries provided The hotel is very quaint with a historic feel  Do not stay here if you are looking for something with modern amenities  The front desk staff was helpful and courteous  The elevator was small but again remember that this building is about  years old We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend 
P => Loved the Bellclaire Hotel I just returned from a long weekend in New York and stayed at the Bellclaire on the upper West Side  A great find  The price is reasonable the hotel clean well kept and the room was roomy by New York Standards I stayed in a room with a shared bathroom was a bit nervous about that but it turned out really well  the bathroom was clean and not that far from our room I will definitely stay there again the next time I am in New York  Again a reasonable clean hotel in a great location 
P => loved it I was trying to plan a surprise birthday weekend for my boyfriend and was so happy to see the high ratings on this one  Ive stayed in other budget NYC hotels before Malibu   terrible and if youre looking for under  a night the best you can get is a tiny dirty smelly room with ratsmice all over the place pretty depressing when you read  reviews that all warn you to stay away from the place  So I booked the shared bathroom room at Belleclaire  and it SO exceeded my expectations    bathroom the shared bathroom is not at all like the usual shared bathroom situation   they are only shared by  rooms and are new spacious  clean  and the water pressure was awesome  Only the  rooms sharing the bathroom have key access to it and its only a few steps from your bedroom door   not bad at all Definitely worth saving around  a night to have your own bathroom    rooms very big for NYC standards the bed was comfortable everything was clean plus there was a fridge alarm clock ironing board TV with cable etc  Surprising The staff were also awesome from the receptionist to the maid to the bellhop everyone was friendly and helpful Location is GREAT red A C or E trains nd or th street stop you can get anywhere downtown quickly or walk down Broadway to Times Square in  minutes plus a ton of fun restaurants and shops around The only bad part we experienced was that the window was drafty so it was pretty cold in the room the heat wasnt on yet and that you could hear people slamming doors from the room but again even that was a lot better than many other hotels Ive stayed at in NYC  Seriously this place is a great find    if youre looking for cheap but ent skip the New Jersey   hour commute hotels or Queens or Brooklyn Belleclaire is your best bet 
P => A Great Find We needed a budget friendly hotel on the Upper West Side of New York and I searched the web until I found the Belleclaire  The staff were very helpful and friendly the room clean and adequate  The only gripe I would make is that it was very noisy outside the room and the room itself was not as well lit as it could be  For price and a fantastic location it would be hard to beat the neighbourhood was great and very handy for all transportattractionsrestaurants  We would definitely stay there again  
P => Excellent New York hotel for the middle budget The Hotel is easy to find has a brilliant location   and it was clean and neat and not even remotely run down  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Spartan Remember NY hotels are expensive and the rooms are small  We needed two beds for our one night stay and they were able to fit the bill at a reasonable by NY standards price  The hotel is undergoing renations and our room had already been fixed up so it was clean new tile in the bathroom and freshly painted  The two double beds were comfortable and the room had just enough space for a narrow desk and television  There was NOTHING on the walls not even a headboard on the beds  The room was strictly a place to sleep you wouldnt want to hang out there  The hotel location is very very noisy   if youre sensitive to street noise request a room away from the street or expect sirens beeps horns etc  all night  The other guests of the hotel are fine mainly tourists many from outside the US so the source of noise is not the other guests  The hotel staff are friendly and responsive but the lobby is small and well spartan  
P => We were so pleased with the Belleclaire We searched high and low on the internet for an affordable hotel in NYC that didnt have reviews of bedbugs andor rats and the Belleclaire seemed our best bet  We were suprised by how great our stay was there  the room was simple but clean the shared bathroom was clean and the staff went above and beyond for us on several occasions always with a smile  The location was wonderful a block or two from the subway and in a good neighborhood  We will definitely stay at the Belleclaire again 
P => Comfortable friendly and clean We were in NYC for the second time  now with the kids Belleclaire is a perfect choice for family   We booked the suite and it is ideal for a couple with  sons  Price is absolutely reasonable considering mean fares in Manhattan  Walk distance from Underground good restaurants nice shops Only rek  I miss the coffee heater in room  Why it wasnt thereAnyway  a must choice in NYC Maurizio Italy 
P => Amazing Location Amazing Hotel I just got back from a two night stay at the Belleclaire and overall I was extremely pleased  This was my very first time in NYC so I didnt really know what to expect  From what I had heard people in NYC were very stiff and unfriendly I discovered otherwise  The Belleclaire Staff was amazing  They provided me with all the information that I needed and then some plus they did it with a smile  I stayed in a room on the th floor with a shared bathroom  This would be my only dissapointment the th floor was under serious remodeling so I had to step over paint cans and endure the stinch of fresh paint  However the bathroom seemed to be clean and housekeeping came several times during my stay  Now on to the neighborhood  As I walked down the street towards Central Park I kept waiting for one of the Cosby kids to walk by  This Hotel is worth staying at just because of its location  Quentisential sp New York  The first day I was there I walked to Times Square granted it was about a two mile walk but really not that bad  Ok Ill wrap this review up with one last sentence I HIGHLY recommend the Hotel Belleclaire to anyone who wants to experience NYC and all it has to offer and do so on a budget 
P => Dirty Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire for the last couple nights and I would recommend visitors avoid the hotel The location is fine  Its within two blocks of the subway  The neighborhood is nice too But    the bathroom was a wreck  There were piles of dirt swept into the corners and just left the broom too  The towel rack had been snapped in the middle and left  Even the shower itself hadnt been fully cleaned They also failed to clean up the vomit hrs after it sat on the carpet on Fl  It was a busy weekend in NYC  Hotels were booked  And unfortunately hotels like Belleclaire just take advantage of the situation  I would recommend you find another hotel  
P => Great Place to Stay Just returned from a  Night Stay at the Belleclaire Hotel in NY and must say how happy we are that we found this cracking placeFor anyone on a budget and especially if you are looking for a family suite then I wouldnt look any further than the Belleclaire  The two bedroom family suite was clean reasonably sized accommodation that is ideal for a family or mixed group that offers one on suite bathroom bath ampshower a fridge air conheater Clock Radio Telephone and a TVGames ConsoleThe Hotel is ideally situated two blocks from th Street Subway mins to Time Sq  mins walk to Central Park and is surrounded by excellent restaurantsbars cafes etc  Special mention to The Manhattan Dinner opposite the Hotel for Breakfast hr Isabellas on Amsterdam Steaks and the Grocery Store round the corner for water juice fruit etc hr  PLEASE NOTE Avoid Nicks Place next to the grocery store  The Hotel staff were very friendly offered useful information on NY and can order taxis etc The only very minor complaints would be that the bathroom was fairly small FACT You can simultaneously sit on the pan wash youre feet in the bath and brush youre teeth in the sink  The air con units within the rooms are fairly noisy although you would rather have them than not at all and that one of the bedrooms lacks any storage space for clothes etc  When I return to NY in the future I will have no hesitation to stay at the Bellecalire Hotel once again  
P => Great Budget Hotel Under  This was the first time I had ever stayed in a hotel with a quotsharedquot bathroom  My teenaged dhter was not thrilled with the idea however afer spending  nights at the hotel both of us were pleased with our accomodations  The room was clean and the carpeting in our room appeared new  The twin beds were very comfortable and had down comforters  We never had any problems sharing the bathroom with the other two rooms  The bathroom was always clean  The only negatives were the following We had a street side room so you could hear the traffic and the air conditioner was noisy  However the hotel is only  blocks from the subway  There are two  hour restaurants as well as a fantastic ketdeli right around the corner  The staff was friendly and accomodating  I wouldnt have any problems recommending the hotel to anyone  
P => Wonderful place to stay So many hotels tout their quotgreat locationsquot but this one really delivers which subway stops Central Park great food bars and shopping all within a couple of blocks  The hotel itself is nicely priced and big enough to breath in  Four of us stayed for four nights in a two bedroom room and didnt feel cramped  The beds were comfortable the showers were warm and we never had to wait very long for the elevators  No doubt once they complete their reations this hotel will be one of the best bargains in the city  To top it all off the hotel staff practiced quality customer service  We couldnt have asked for more  We all agreed that the next time we are in NY we will stay at this hotel again  There is simply no reason not to  
P => th trip to New York It was fine My mother who is  and I go to New York to see shows and walk Central Park  Traditionally we have stayed at hotels closer to Times Square i e  Omni Berkshire and Warwick Hotel  If this were my first visit to New York and I wanted to enjoy the night life lights and action      I would choose hotels closer to the theater district  I would select for economical reasons perhaps Milford Plaza or Hotel Edison  Friends of mine have stayed there and enjoyed themselves  HOTEL BELLECLAIRE The hotel is small and currently being reated on some floors  My senior mother and I could have cared less about the elevators  We were on the third floor and used the stairwell  In my opinion this is not a place for children or teens  The hotel rooms are small the televisions barely work but that being said it was fine for us  Honestly I think it depends on what you are looking for  We did reject one of the bigger rooms on the th floor because the carpet was badly stained  The front desk is friendly and accomodating and changed our room immediately  My mothers room and mine were both clean  and   The view was nonexistent and the air conditioners rather loud  The bathrooms were spotless no problem with hot water and I think the tile was new  The bed was comfortable and I smelled no unpleasant odors  I have a nose for mold mildew and other unpleasantries     every thing was fine  I also have trouble sleeping at night but found no problem here  It is an older place however the paint is fresh a brownish yellow and the carpet looks somewhat newish  The halls are narrow if you are on the big side hmm     find a bigger place  I noticed that there were a lot of airline staff who stayed here as well  The location for me was excellent  I wanted to stay in a residental area to see more of the REAL New York and so I did  The subway is two blocks away and you can get to Times Square in five minutes if you have two dollars  Not a bad deal The area is safe too  Just around the corner is a grocery store with a huge selection of cheeses chocolates deli items and imported beers  There is a great quottrendyquot breakfast place on Amsterdam called Sara Beths  It is a local favorite and if you want a good Jewish breakfast somewhere on Broadway thats your street and hmmm       or  you can find incredibly fresh lox herring etc  If you ask once you get to that area people would know the name  You can walk to Times Square from the hotel  It takes about  minutes  
P => Straight Budget We stayed at the Belleclaire for eleven nights during our summer vacation  The hotel itself is nothing special but the room was at advertised quite spacey and even had a window type airconditioning unit which wasnt mentioned on Expedia  The room and the shared bathroom were kept clean and for the budget price there was nothing to complain about  All in all it was good value for the money considering that this was central Manhattan However as of ust  theres still construction work going on  After one week they started installing new floor panels in the neighbouring rooms  After complaining we were offered a room on a different floor the new room had the same standard as the old one but was smaller and had a window to the backyard  We were told that our original room was the only quotlarger economyquot room so we ided to stay there in spite of the noise  On the pro side theyll now have reated rooms with wooden floors instead of worn carpet  The location was very good central park is only two blocks away there are subway stations nearby and a bus is also going from the th street   which is much nicer than the subway if you have the time  There are superkts food places and plenty of city life if you like you can also get to many attractions by foot  The staff was generally friendly and helpful  By the way if you want to make international calls get a phone card from the newspaper shop around the corner as the receptionist suggested to me  Youll still pay  per call for the line but thats much better than   per minute   
P => Wonderful budget accomodation This was our first trip to NYC and when booking the hotel we took Central Park to be central enough and booked without checking on its precise location  It is a little bit out of the way but it only takes a    minute metro ride down to the ferry port  It is on the Upper West Side of Central Park the more affluent side of town and you feel safe at night The hotel itself was extremely basic  We arrived about  minutes before we were due to check in and our room was still being cleaned so they upgraded us to a HUGE room with a super king size bed It had a larger than average bathroom and a walk in wardrobe The communal areas were a bit shabby and had a funny stale smell about them but nothing unbearable but the whole landing area was being refurbished with apologies throughout  The room had great radiators that heated up the whole room was below zero most of the time and the shower was extremely powerful  The beds were made up every day and the room was relatively clean  We did find an old bottle of coke one day under the bed but the cleaner could have left that behind any day You get what you pay for and this hotel was everything you could expect  The staff were very friendly and there is a great diner opposite where they do the best NYC breakfasts 
P => Great location but      We arrived in New York on  e and stayed at the Belleclaire for  days  The location of the hotel is great   but the hotel is not We stayed in a  room suite  adults and  teenagers which had  queen size beds  Opened the door of the bathroom to find a cockroach scuttling around which was quickly despatched  Mould on the tiles of the shower not cleaned off in the  days we stayed and we had to resort to odour neutraliser on the shower curtain to counteract the mildew smell coming off it The problem with the room is that for  people there is  desk chair and upholstered stoolcushion  No other chairs so eating in the room is on the beds which became a little tiresome and unappealing after a while  The upside is   the location is unbeatable   loved where we were with the proximity of diners and restaurants subway and kets  Staff were very helpful but would probably stay in another hotel in this neighbourhood when we return  If youre not too fussy about the room it would be fine  And in New York you dont spend a lot of time there anyway       
P => Best Hotel Yet I have been to new york at least a coupel of dozen times stayed at many affordablebudget hotels and this is definitely the best  The price is right the rooms are clean and the staff is very friendly and accomodating  We had the shared bathroom but we never had to wait for it  I didnt even seehear another quotuserquot  The air conditioning worked fine we had a good view which means anything other than a brick wall and it was just two blocks from the subway station  Theres an excellent grocery store and good restaurants nearby along with a Barneys co op just up the street 
P => Unbeatable value for money After finding Hotel Belleclaire on the webI was a little apprehensive on how we would find itas it appeared to be a real budget place to stay a twin room for four nights with shared bathroom was around  euroa steal for my friend and I paying  quid each for  nights on the Upper West Side  No problem at all with the shared bathroom hardly even heard and never saw other users and it was always spotlessly clean as was the room which although basic was comfortable clean and had a balcony which you could step out ontoand even have a sneaky cigarette Great neighbourhood lovely to walk around and very easy to plan ways of getting places  Theres a bar across the street called the raccoon which although it  look scary as you approach it is a great place for a nightcap and has amazing friendly girls as staff who like to dance on the bar from time to time and  even ask you to join themFor two girls in NY to party shop and have a ball Belleclaire was ideal and I would certainly stay there again the main reason being its fantastic value for money and great location  
P => nice place great location We found the hotel on short notice the day before on the internet and through these reviiews ided to try it we were not disappointed It was a great place to stay with our  children we had the family suite and an extra roll away  the place was clean and perfect for us  Central park was only  blocks away and restaurants and stores were also on the same block or within   The in room fridge helped and so did the grocery store practically at our front door  The elevator was comically small  The gift store in the hotel was great for the kids to buy stuff  I would definitely reccomend it to a family on a budget or travelers who dont want to spend a lot of time in their hotel room and why would you  The hotel staff also seemed very nice and brought the roll away within  minutes of asking the second time  
P => Awesome After reading the conflicting reviews of the Belleclaire I had no idea what to expect  Turns out it was great  Our room faced the intersection of th and Broadway with a great view  The room was clean beds were comfortable and maid service was excellent  We had no problems with the shower or the AC as I have read earlier  The staff was very courteous and answered all of our questions joyfully  The location of the Belleclaire is excellent  The Upper West Side is a great place to lay your head away from the hustle and bustle   it has a very strong quotsuburbquot feel to it  For those who love the hustle and bustle it is only a short subway or taxi ride away  Overall I would highly recommend the Belleclaire  
P => Excellent budget hotel   great location  After much research myself and four friends ided to stay at the Belleclaire Hotel New York   mainly due to the budget price and the good reviews we had already read on Tripadvisor  We booked our holiday through Expedia phone up   you will get a better rate and reserved a transfer on Supershuttle from Newark to the hotel  The shuttle was easy to find and delivered us safely to the hotel all for   per person  A few days before departure we had emailed the hotel to request our three rooms be on the same floor and we were told that this would be ok  However when we checked in we were all given rooms on different floors not a major problem but slightly disappointing  The hotel was clean and accommodating  The rooms were not huge but had everything you would need iron fridge tv etc  And I have to say the bed was very comfortable too Location is everything in New York and this hotel did not disappoint  One block from the subway and a  min walk to Times Square  Taxis are so cheap there was no problem returning after a night out  Stuff near the hotel Manhattan Diner opposite serves a great breakfast hora a couple of blocks down sells cheap branded makeup NY Stand Up Comedy Club one block up th an absolute bargain find the promoters outside on the day and you can get tickets for   named comedians and also the fresh fruit and veg ket next door   it sells huge slices of pizza for the late night munchies  Overall a great break I would recommend the Belleclaire as a great budget hotel   spend your money on other things as you will not spend much time in your room 
P => A great hotel for the price I was a little unsure what to expect from the Belleclaire as the reviews on this site have been a bit mixed but we really enjoyed our stay there  Our room was at the back on the th floor so was quiet  It was a twin room with a shared bathroom and was very spacious  The room was clean and well orated and we had no problems at all with the shared bathroom which was also clean with a hot powerful shower  The fridge in the room was also very useful   we bought food at the local superkets and had breakfast in the room every day which saved us a bit of moneyThe location of the hotel is very good being slightly away from the busier places downtown  The subway is only  minutes away and we used it all the time to get to anywhere we wanted to go in Manhattan  There are lots of restaurants shops and bars close to the hotel which we also made good use of Its also a short walk to Central Park and the Museum of Natural History Overall I was pleased with the Belleclaire and would stay there again  For a budget hotel it was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed and definitely made our stay in NYC enjoyable  
P => Really Liked the Belleclaire in the Big Apple I had a great stay at the Belleclaire albeit it being one night  The room was recently reated with a small double   enough for one person  Nice new bed sheets  The air conditioner was a bit noisy but worked all the same  Big TV  And plenty of wardrobe space to hang clothes  amazing for a small room  The reception and concierge helpful  And best of all the room faced the back so very quiet for upper west side NY  Shared bath was ok  relatively clean  Close to midtown and shopping  My review  be based on the fact the hotel is recently reated so dont know how it will age  Would definately go back for the price and cleanliness  
P => Hated the Belleclaire It was appalling the picturesd look great very modern fabulous price for NYCity when you get there you realise why such a great price  heating is either on or off for entire hotel no personl preference Plumbing and radiator noises were extremely loud windows were held in place with gaffa tape to stop drafts coming through a truly unforgetable experience topped by being electricuted when turning on a light Staff unhelpful when queried over problems our  nights stay turned into just  when we fled in eth morinbg to seek refuge elsewhere in fact the holiday in which was a dream come true 
P => A very good Bargain  Our trip in New York was very good and the hotel was very good too  We was in a room with Shared bathroom and we was expected to be worried about that  But it was good  The shared bathroom is in a suite of  rooms so its one for   And the bathroom like the room was cleaned Everyday  The hotel people was very professional and the location was perfect  near subway restaurant amp Central park  The one near the hotel on bradway which called quotBig nickquot is good and open  H  Thank you Belleclaire for my great trip in NY  I will come back  
P => Great budget hotel I stayed at the Belleclaire Hotel after finding it on the internet on my th visit to NYC in ember   I was careful to book a twin share room with a private bathroom but upon arrival found the room was a double  Within minutes my cousin and I were checked into a great little twin room that had been recently refurbished  The beds were comfy the linen was crisp and fresh the quilts new and the pillows soft and fluffy The bathroom was clean and had been reated with a regular size bath and shower over Typical of New York hotels my view was of a brick wall but I wasnt in New York City to sit in my room to look at the view so that didnt bother me at all  The staff were really friendly and more than helpful with tourist info  The location is perfect for those not so keen on staying in the hustle and bustle of midtown and I found it to be really quiet  Its a good half hour walk down Broadway to Times Square be longer but a pleasant stroll after a meal or a show  Its also a great location to stay if youre interested in museums and exploring Central Park  The subway is a mere hop skip and jump away so easy to get anywhere in Manhattan Big bonus having a  hour superket next door and the  hour Manhattan Diner diagonally across the road that did a great brunch At least I think it was open  hours Oh and the pizza place next door looked like a dive but did awesome slices of pizza All in all a great little budget hotel for people who have be been to New York before and are looking for something a little quieter  Would I stay there again Yes  Enjoy New York And for those of you who thought the lift was too small     get out of the hotel and enjoy the fabulous energy of New York City instead of spending time in the lift 
P => Not bad for the price The Belleclaire is undergoing some reation at the minute so be prepared for some noise from am onwards but is a clean and basic hotel in a cheaper area of Manhattan  We stayed in a quot bedroom suitequot which was a bit awkward since the bathroom adjoined one of the bedrooms only  Great location only a  minute walk from the subway  Plenty of cheap restaurants for a quick bite of breakfast only a stones throw away  Rooms are quite basic but generally in good condition  There is no air conditioning but since the weather was quite cool it was fine for us  it could be a problem in the summer though  
P => Good location good value clean and quiet We didnt need flashy but we did want clean and quiet and not too far from the action  We had a twin room with shared bath which concerned me but it was fine   we were barely aware of the other two rooms sharing  The room was basic looking but spotless and provided hairdryer and towels soap shampoo etc which were changed daily  Internet point in the hotel shop am to pm  Staff on reception were helpful  I reported the toilet was blocked once and it was fixed in  literally  five minutesQuiet is valuable in Manhatten and this room  was very quiet   facing the back of the hotel so no street noise and  rooms in their own little private corridor so no other guests passing  You might need to make sure your room doesnt overlook the street  There was an aircon unit but on a cool week in  we didnt need it and two windows that opened several inches were enough for a good breeze Location was great just off Broadway on west side of Central Park  mins walk from Lincoln Centre Metropolian Opera House three mins walk from th St metro seven mins walk from nd St metro  Nice diner for breakfast diagonally opposite  Pleasant area with small shops superket drycleaners superb deli  We got it as part of a package deal but we felt it was great value and wed go back  
P => Excellent value for your dollar Date il I would highly recommend the Belleclaire Hotel to anyone travelling to NYC on a budget  My husband and I stayed six nights queen bed shared bath and were pleasantly surprised  The room was a good size   TV small writing desk closet two night tables sink small fridge and queen size bed  We were able to leave our two suitcases in the room and still get around the room without any problems  I was a little bit weary about sharing the bathroom but never had to wait or rush even in the mornings The hotel is only two blocks away from the subway station and three blocks away from Central Park and the Natural History Museum and a short walk through the park to the East Side and the Met Museum  There are many places to eat nearby and the ket around the corner is a real life saver   especially with the small fridge in our room  Everything also seems to be opened quite late If youre a light sleeper and require total silence bring earplugs  Apparently there is a firestation very close to the hotel and I was woken up a few times by the sirens and the street noise can be quite disturbing if youre used to a quiet suburban neighbourhood  I didnt think I was a light sleeper but after the first night I used my husbands spare earplugs and left the TV on very low to block out the street noise I was a little concerned about our trip to NYC after reading recent reports about bedbugs  Im glad to report that there wasnt a single bug in our room and my husband and I are both bite free  The weather was great while we were in New York and the temperature in the room was fine  I dont know what the rooms would be like in the middle of summer though   our last day in New York it was  degrees outside and I didnt notice any air conditioning equipment around the hotel or in our room The front desk staff were really friendly and helpful  It was a relief to be able to store our luggage until our late evening flight and the concierge was great in helping us arrange an airport shuttle  
P => Great deal for New York I just returned from a one night stay at the Hotel Belleclaire on a quick trip to New York  To stay anywhere in Manhattan for night is quite a bargain so I was worried about what I would find upon checking in  Though the facade of the building has seen better days I was quite pleased with the inside  The lobby area is small but adequate and the staff was friendly and helpful  The elevators are incredibly small but similar to what you would see in a European hotel The room itself was very pleasant  Though I was traveling alone I had a room with two double beds and an enormous bathroom  There was also a small desk and chair by the door  The room had clearly been modernized recently with a fresh coat of paint some stylish black amp white photos and a large television  Unfortunately the hotel is still being reated which can make maneuvering the corridors quite difficult The hotels location is also ideal  Situated on the upper west side it is away from much of the city noise but still within easy reach of many of the main attractions  It took about  minutes to walk to Rockefeller Center and a  minute cab ride to Herald Square Ive traveled all over the world staying in hotels of every class and would rank the Belleclaire solidly in the middle  It was clean and pleasant enough to recommend to others but certainly not among the most luxurious hotels Ive visited If price is a concern but youre not willing to lower your standards of cleanliness style and location the Belleclaire is definitely a good choice  
P => Very OK budget hotel The Belleclaire is a very OK budget hotel with an excellent location and helpful staff  Stayed in the family suite  No luxeries but it worked well for two adults and two teenagers I would avoid it during the summermonths becuase I saw no airconditioning 
P => Excellent Budget Hotel I used to live in Manhattan  Now I come back  times a year as a tourist  I generally try to stay at a different hotel each time I visit so I can explore the nearby neighborhoods  Ive been in twenty different NYC hotels My last few visits however Ive stayed at the Belleclair  I think that among budget hotels its the best  The rooms are not the greatest but they are not horrible either and much of the place is undergoing renevation  The staff was friendly and on their toes  OKthe elevator is tiny and slow but you get what you pay for  dollars got me a ent sized room with a mini fridge and a peephole sized TV  It was clean European modern and looked like it had just been done over  Another stay  bought a large suite with a private bath and a huge comfortable bed My last visit was  days over the Fourth of y  still  dollars It was hot and humid outside but the window AC kept the room cool  The shared bathroom overlooked a grungy air shaft but it was clean and somewhat modern and the view out the window was a slice of busy Broadway  I got up to the roof and was rewarded with a great view of The Hudson and the northern stretch of Broadway The best part of staying there is the neighborhood  The Upper West Side has become my favorite place to explorethanks to the Belleclaires great location  Food choices abound transportation is a snap and the shops are as varied as Midtown  There are bars comedy clubs museums parks and historical architecture right outside the door or a few minutes walk away Id stay there again Im already planning out a  visit and I suggest it to friends who are going to NY Well reccomended  
P => The Belleclaire was perfect for me I was on a budget because Im a student  I didnt want to spend a ton of money on a hotel that I would barely be in  But I also didnt want to be somewhere crappy and unsafe  The Belleclaire was perfect  I shared a bathroom and it was totally cool  Not gross or anything  You can tell that the hotel is old but I liked that about it  It has an old New York charm  The elevator is small but it serves its purpose  I didnt see any rats or bed bugs in the hotel My room had a great view of Broadway and was close by some good places to eat  Zabars is a few blocks away and so in Central Park  The area the Belleclaire is in is beautiful  I would stay there again any time  
P => Perfectly adequate for the price you pay We have just literally just come back from NY and this hotel is absolutely fine if you want a cheap clean and conveniently located hotel  We stayed in a shared bathroom room and this was fine as only  rooms share so was well worth the saving  All rooms were regulary cleaned and we did not find it dirty in the slightest  The lifts are a bit slow but if you are fit and healthy there is no reason why you shouldnt take the stairs  The staff were really friendly and helpful The subway is less than a minute walk away and there are lovely places to eat nearby  It is also nice to be near the locals and see them going about their day rather than just seeing tourists The rooms have good facilities although the room was on the small side  I dont think any of the rooms have good views but if you just plan to use the room to sleep you will be fineMy only compliant is that like most hotels you can hear doors banging and pipes creaking but this is a minor point and we would stay again  
P => OK The hotel is poor  The lifts were slow and too few for as many guests that stay in the hotel  The hotel charged us  PER NIGHT for making a crip and we were not told of this charge when booking the hotel  The only thing going for this hotel is its location  It was dirty and the worst hotel I have stayed in for a long time  
P => Fantastic Place My boyfriend and I stayed in the Belleclaire Hotel queen room with a shared bathroom from il th for two nights  Dont listen to any bad reviews about this hotel  Its in a fantastic location near nd train station which takes you everywhere around Manhattan  The area has some fantastic cafes and bars  We recommend Big Nics on the corner of the hotel ask the staff for details this was a true New York diner fantastic The room was modern clean and the sharen bathroom was a very good standard it was quiet and safe and for the price you cant get much better in the city  The rooms have iron clean towels tv and fridge  Def would go back and stay Sarah and k England  
P => Make sure to bring a printout of your reservation rates I made reservations for this hotel  months prior to arrival  Upon check in the hotel requires to hold the total balance of your stay on a card  This was fine however we had the unfortunate incident of being quoted a significantly large amount about over what I was originally quoted  times over the phone  I told the agent the amount we were quoted and he said that my amount was totally incorrect and in no way would anyone quote that  However when I whipped out a printout of an email sent to me by the quotReservations Managerquot with the original quote lets just say the upper hand had changed  He went to speak to this person and supposedly it was still an error  We still ended up paying only  over our original quote because it was still an error  BY A MANAGER  Honestly we were too jet lagged to argue any more Be advised that despite this issue which can be simply avoided by getting an emailed copy of your total rates including taxes we enjoyed our stay at the Belleclaire  All the bellmen we encoutered were very helpful and very polite  The rooms were clean and everytime we called the desk with requests they were answered immediately  yes the elevators are small to fit barely one person and their luggage however thats what the bellmen are for so just ask  They have a freight elevator to handle that issue  The room we stayed in contained a fridge iron cd alarm clock tiny dresser closet hair dryer and even liquid soaps lotions shampoos and conditioner The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is awesome  Safe quiet and far enough from the touristy Times Square area  There are also lots of shops and restaurants a few steps away from the hotel  The subway is a little more than a block away  I would suggest using it since cabs can get pricey if youre hanging out in the lower areas of manhattan like we did  If youre more than  in your party take advantage of the transportation options they offer at the little shop located at the entrance of the hotel  You could save some money going back to the airport  And yes I would stay at this hotel again  
P => Gem in New York We had to go to New York last minute   for the ART EXPO  Ended up staying at the Hotel Belleclaire  Room reminded me of being in Europe  Small   but very clean and comfortable  The staff friendly and helpful  We stayed in the quotshare a bathroomquot with  other rooms  Never had a problem if there is there is beautiful bathroom located in the lobby  No view   but when you are in the New York if you are not out and about taking in NY why are you there in the st placeRestaurants in the area AMAZING  stars Starbuck  blocks away and subway  block   minute to Time Square via subway  Its a win win situation  I wanted to move to the area  Not tourist ie at all   you are with the Newyorkers buying your food fridge in the room and wine in the locate stores  Prices great because of it 
P => YIKES I cant say enough about this   noisy smelly and terribly HOT in the middle of the winter I will never stay here again  
P => I really loved this little place    Accomodations were booked for us at this hotel when we came to NYC on business and I was a little wary  I have to admit that Im very picky   love  stars and higher  I read the reviews on this site and was okay with the idea of staying here but when we got here I was more than pleasantly surprised and I LOVED IT It is very quaint the location is awesome Central Park a couple blocks away great food abounds but of course its NYC after all but the staff They rock  Just the nicest people a quick and seamless check in ia at the front desk was great for helping us find Mexican food   The room was big   two bedrooms w three double beds a nicely done bathroom  All the necessary amenities  Only complaint would be that it was HOT in the room I dont know squat about radiator looking things but you could open the window and it evened it out perfectly  Will I go again   heck yeah In a heartbeat 
P => Perfect Myself and my best friend stayed in Hotel Belleclaire at the beggining of ember  After reading some of the reviews on this website we didnt really know what to expect  When we arrived we were very pleasantly surprised  The location is excellent  I have been to New York before and stayed much closer to all the main attractions Times sq  Empire state etc but found this to be a much more pleasant location as it is very residential and gives you a real taste of New York  Steps away fromt he subway really close to Central Park and lots of good restaurantsdiners nearby Manhattan Diner is excellent for breakfast and dont let the front of Ruby Foos fool you inside is really nice and the food is amazingThe room was pretty much the same as the ones that were shown on the website  We had a twin room with a shared bathroom  Everything was clean and beds were very comfortable  It was a little noisy at night but what else can you expect in New York City Staff were very friendly and you can buy post cards and stamps in the gift shop plus there is a mail box right beside the elavator Handy All in all I really have no complaints  Next time though I will probably get a room with an en suite just for comforts sake but I will definately be back 
P => Nice Little Hotel In side Road  Very Quaint Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire from ruary rd to ruary th   We found that the Hotel entrance was round the corner of a side road and that some scaffolding was constructed on one part of the building  One we had got into the lobby it was very pleasant and the reception area looked very nice  They had a gift shop on site that you could log on to the internet  it was  for  mins  They sold all kinds of New York gifts and merchandise  They also sold tickets to tours and can book the transfers to from JFK airport for you  Talkto the guy in the shop and he can give you Macys passes and can give you friendly advice about clubs bars pubs to go to etc   Aparently the rd floor had fire damage to it that is why the scaffolding is there  They are refurbishing the hotel  We checked in with ease and the staff were quite helpful  You have to sign an agreement and give over your credit or debit card to cover any events or charges that  occur phone extra nights etc    and it says you must check out by  pm otherwise you get charged for an extra nights stay  The Hotel had three lifts that you could use to go up to your floor  Sometimes the workmen would use them so we had to wait for another one or use one of the others  We stayed on the th floor the hotel had  floors  The room number was  and it was a double room with en suite bathroom  toilet bath shower  Quite small though and it took quite a while for the hot water to come through  Some of the tiles on the floor were a bit grubby but nothing to bad  It had a nice double bed and a TV with satelite  MTV Comedy Childrens etc    at no extra charge  The view was a bit constricted but the room itself was pleasant and spacious  It had a dressing table Wall mirror and a wardrobe with an iron and a hair dryer  Also the room had a fridge in it full sized  You could order room service if you wanted to  As for the location of the Hotel we found that it wasnt bad but was quite some trek from all the main attractions  Most of the time we walked but we got the yellow cabs sometimes  Central park is a short walk away down West th Street  The Restaurants we recommend in close proximity to the Hotel are the Manhatten Diner Directly opposite and the Cafe  which is just a short walk down from the Manhatten Diner  It was actually my st Birthday whilst we were in New York so we went to the Tavern on the Green which was at th street West Central park  Beautiful Restaurant Nice surroundings  And the food was delicious Some things not to miss whilst in New York are  A Horse and carridge ride around Central Park Try to find the Horse named Billie he was a saint And do a deluxe ride for about   Also you have to try Ice skating  We skated at the Wollman Rink and it cost about   A Helicopter tour we had one pre booked With Liberty Helicopters on th street  This was about   each for a  minute ride taking in the statue of liberty the bronx Central park the empire state building manhatten and the Stadiums Take a City Sites tour starting at Times Square its a hop on hop off bus tour that takes in everything It was Brilliant  The company we went with were City Sights  Jose was our guide and he was very funny And factual of New York  Of course there is the Staue of Liberty Times Square Empire State Building Bloomingdales Macys The Chrysler Building Grand Central Station The UN head quaters The Rockefeller Centre and Central Park to name but a few  Plus the thousands upon thousands of shops  In all a great trip Just make sure all your transfers are sorted before you leave They have a room to store luggage in that is quite secure  Time for last minute shopping PS  If you have time pop to Tribeca Bubbys pie company is a great Restaurant and also the Hotel has a safety deposit service at reception  
P => clean cheap comfortable Hotel rooms are like dorm rooms with comfy beds and small bathrooms  If you want a clean relatively quiet nowhere in New York is quiet and a cheap hotel this is for you  They dont offer extravagances but instead offer necessities to make your stay in New York pleasant  Within walking distance of Central Park and very close to the subway  Has grocery store and delicious pizzeria right below  I enjoyed it and I am pretty picky 
P => Dont stay here I found this hotel very disappointing  The price was good and the location was great the front desk staff were very nice  The problems with this hotel weretoo noisy long wait for the elevator and no heat and once no hot water for the shower  It has the feel of a rooming house not a hotel  
P => handy location Our family stayed at the belleclaire hotel   The suite we stayed in was fine not that big but we didnt expect it to be  Rooms were clean and the beds comfy Had a fridgehairdryerironing board and own bathroom   the location was excellent just a short walk to subway  Diner across the road is open  hrs and right next door is a superket and plenty of places to eat close by  Central park also close by Staff were very friendly and helpful  We would definately recommend this hotel  
P => great location clean friendly staff So myself and two friends stayed at the belleclaire for a week from the     nd  we had a great stay our room was suite which had two double beds a single and a en suite bathroom  The staff were always happy to help us with directions and tell us where places were to eat  There is also internet in the gift shop which is really handy  The location of this hotel is perfect it was a   dollar cab ride to times sq  If you want to walk its around a  minute walk but a lovely one  So if you are on a budget like we were being three  year old students then this hotel is spot on  I would also say it is perfect for people who would like a taste of real new york being a tad out of the cliche times sqdowntown area  Going back to the belleclaire in  this year 
P => average myself and mygirlfriend stayed in the belleclaire for new years and were rather disappointed the our room was on the eight floor with a shared bathroom it was run down very different to those shown on their web site  the bathroom was the same with tiles missing but on the bright side the staff were very friendly and accomadating  would go back just to be close to the manhattan diner whose food is fantastic 
P => You get what you pay for Stayed in Belleclaire for  nights over New Year  Had suite   Advertised as for  but for  really Have quoted the room number because the reviews suggest that experiences vary depending on the room and the floor There are a few things to mention that might discourage the very sensitive  But please remember that this hotel cost us   a night   on New Years Eve between  guests  For   pppn on the Upper West Side you are not going to reside in the Astoria The room was big enough clean changed every day  Newly painted and appointed  In fact they hadnt finished off the inside window frames on a couple of windows  Not an issue   you dont normally notice and at least they are obviously maintaining it Good shower bath more of a foot tray  Okay if youre under quot  Only one wardrobe  Storage space severely limited so no good if you have a trunk full of nice clothes  Big TV in each room of the suite fridge in one room Corner room so light enough  No view but one wouldnt expect that from the st floor in the middle of a big city Default radiator setting was sauna Gym free and well appointed  No pool  No bar or restaurant   use quotManhattan Dinerquot ft away  They will even deliver breakfast in bed Staff were perfectly pleasant and helpful  Tipping as soon as I could probably helped here Radiator sprang a leak on the first night   not good itor at room with toolkit  seconds after I called reception   good If you like to spend a lot of time in and around your hotel dont choose this one If you expect  star accommodation for  star prices dont choose this one If you want somewhere clean and straightforward in a pretty good location and dont have vast fiscal reserves then you you could do a lot worse  
P => Great Honeymoon Thanks Belleclaire We came here for a short honeymoon and had a blast The room was cute and just like the pictures online   it was two twins instead of the double but we pushed them together and were just fine   shared a bath much cheaper and not a problem at all  The elevator can be a bit slow  but its in the middle of everything and ZABARS right around the corner must go We loved it and we were there in the middle of the strike    blocks to Penn Station walking and we still enjoyed our stay I was going to book at the West side as its cheaper but then saw the photos    Think Ill come back here insteadThank you Belleclaire It was fabulous 
P => Location Location Location My boyfriend and I stayed at the Belleclaire for  nights in the end of ember   This hotel is perfect if youre on a budget and just want to use the room to sleep after a full day out doing touristy stuff  Rooms are clean staff is very nice and welcoming  But the best thing is its LOCATION  Its surrounded by very good dinners theres one just around the corner to the right which has delicious food its near the tube and its in a very quiet area  If you happen to arrive by car on a Tuesday after pm and find a parking space just in front of the hotel as we did youll be happy to know that its free and you only have to move the car by am on Thursday  
P => BelleClaire not the ritz but certainly a winner We stayed at the BelleClaire Hotel from  th th inclusive  On arrival we were greeted with friendly check in staff and a smile We booked a shared bathroom economy room  which I would recommended as this room was accessed only by a swipe card through a locked door and then our room door  Which gave us a sense of added security  Although the room it self is very small   it was cleaned daily and quite ok for a short time  The bed was comfortable and the fridge and basin in the room came in quite handy  We also got fresh towels  which were abit rough but hey at least they were clean  Also got fresh soap etc everyday  The location is perfect  As we found some great restaurants and a lovely homewares store across the road  if you like orating We found the diner to be nice   the desserts were great but there is a better place called COSI   just opposite the hotel who make a great pizza and salad We also liked the fact we could walk to central park  would recommend a horse ride  US for mins but worth it and make use of the th Street subway  They leave every few minutes and are safe way of getting around   We never really travelled at night on them though I would definately stay again in the shared room   as we never once had to wait for the bathroom The Shared bathroom was clean and there was never any mess after someone had used it which was nice  I would also suggest making use of the hotel safe in storing your valuables etc   just ask down at the front desk  Overall I found the service to be great and the staff attentive  You just have to think the Belle Claire is not that flash but it is neat and tidy and after all you are in NEW YORK and you want to get out and enjoy the city We had such a great time and found that it is quite easy to get around and the Belleclaire was definately a great base  I would stay again  
P => Does what it says on the tin  All good  Just back from the big apple where I spent a week at the Belleclaire which was assigned to us through a budget package deal  Like most I was a little worried about the shared bathroom but that turned out to be no problem at all there were others in there occasionally but it didnt affect our plans  The room was a very ent good sized double and was very clean the staff were really friendly but best of all was the location  Make sure and head to the Manhattan Diner across the street for excellent breakfasts and Big Nicks around the corner for amazing burgers  The location is fantastic being right next to the park and only about a  minute walk from Times Square  There are loads of cool bars and restaurants nearby see Columbus and Amsterdam avenues and there is good shopping nearby  Look out for Urban Outfitters and Barneys Coop just down broadway into town  The hotel did the job well for a good price but its the location that makes the Belleclaire for me  Recommended  
P => Good Bargain Great Location Spent eight nights at the Belleclaire had a room that shared a bathroom and that wasnt any problem at all very quiet room  Very much an old style European hotel no frills but a great price and thus I was able to stay a few more nights in New York  The best part is the location for those who prefer not to stay in midtownTimes Square this is a better alternative  Nothing fancy but good accomodations for the price  Will stay there again  Note some rooms are in better shape than others if you dont like your first choice ask to see others this was our case and the staff had no problem assigning friends to a different room  
P => Belleclaire bargain The Belleclaire is a gem and a great New York bargain  We stayed for four nights in a fifth floor family suite  Yes theyre not the largest and the heating is a trifle antiquated but the rooms are clean the linen freshand were well maintained  The staff are very friendly and helpful though the hotel was always busy they were never other than obliging  The situation is great Central and Riverside parks nearby yet only fifteen minutes to Times Square and the subway close by  Lots of shops and superkets nearby and I can only echo the reccomendations for the Manhattan Diner for breakfast and Nicks round the corner on Broadway for everything else   try the White Pizza You get whay you pay for   the Belleclaire is not   luxury but for a value place to stay in NY it measures up  
P => Nice hotel     I was a little wary of the hotel after reading the reviews on the site but I was pleasantly surprised  We had a room with a shared bathroom which caused no problems at all   only once was someone in there during the whole week we were there On the second night of our stay we were woken by metallic clanging noises   at   in the morning We mentioned it reception who explained that it was the heating system bit antiquated I think  They offered us another room which was bigger than the our original room and  floors lower We didnt hear the noise after that at all The staff are nice   we particularly found the staff in the gift shop extremely helpful very friendly too The location is excellent and the Manhattan Diner directly opposite does fantastic breakfasts at really reasonable prices All in all the Belleclaire is a budget hotel and it is clean and the beds are really comfortable  I think that it is essentially all anyone needs 
P => Loved it great hotel nice people and great service Very recomended Great managment nice people very clean hotel I will sure to come back great rooms 
P => Clean enough   Good location   Friendly staff Myself and My wife stayed for  nights in an economy room  The room was pretty small with no view but it was clean and the price was pretty reasonable compared to some nearby hotels The location of the Upper West Side is much nicer than some other areas in Manhattan and this hotel is pretty close to Central Park and the Natural History Museum  There are also lots of nearby bars and restaurants The staff were very helpful and we would definately go back  As with all things   you get what you pay for   nice for the price in this case 
P => Good budget choice in nice location We have just returned from  nights at the Belleclaire having got a great internet rate on a family suite  The hotel is situated in a nice part of town on the Upper West Side a few blocks from Central Park and the Natural History Museum and within walking distance of some great bars restaurants and good shops and close to lines  and  on the subway  The staff were generally helpful and friendly The hotel itself is basic but spotlessly clean with comfy beds and a nice bathroom  The rooms were cleaned everyday and we were given new bedding and towels each day  There was quite a bit of noise from the street below despite being on the th floor but I guess you get that anywhere in New York Our suite was supposed to be for  people which would have been a real squash but for  of us it was very roomy  I would definitely stay there again although next time I might be tempted to try somewhere further south in Manhattan as getting downtown was a bit of a trek though still less than  in a cab during rush hour so really not too bad at all i just like walking places  
P => Perfect for Travellers on a Budget No frills Upper West side hotel in New York city nabbed a real bargain on the internet and was a very pleasant stay LOCATIONOn th street fairly easy to find   just about on the corner but entrancefacade is low key  The reviewer who mentioned the website gave a wrong impression is certainly right Just a few minutes away from the Subway though with a great superket round the corner as well as loads of shops diners   dont miss Grays Papaya and HampH Bagels just  blocks away The area didnt seem very rough at all ROOMSRooms were spacious enough not too small or too big and with a fridge all the usual   ironing board hair dryer cable TV  Do not expect great views but the room was very clean and functional  Fridge was especially handy and there was an air conditioning machine which was handy for the humid nights  Shared bathroom was not a problem or noise but I guess my neighbours were courteous which  not be everybodys experience SERVICENo problems here   everything that Id asked about was efficiently answered and I even got a complimentary travel plugAMENITIESSmall gym located on the st floor which I didnt use but had a quick look round  Again functional for most peoples needs with a dumbell rack cardio and weights machines  No restaurant  Lift was out of order on one occasion had to use the stairs   to the th floor If the food I was eating on this trip didnt give me a heart attack walking up all those flights of stairs almost didWILL I STAY HERE AGAINYes I would   but only if I can get a good deal on the internet  Part of the reason why it is getting a good rating is because of the Value for Money aspect as this is very much a no frills hotel  
P => Fabulous location good value My husband and I just returned from a week at the Belleclaire and overall we were very pleased with the courtesy of the staff and the hotel conditions  People looking for a fancy place will not find it here but the no smoking room we had was clean and spacious enough for the two of us  We opted for the shared bathroom which wasnt a problem although at my age I think Id get a private one next time  Having a refrigerator in the room made it easy to make picnic lunches from the left over dinners we couldnt finish from the nearby restaurants The subway was only a few minutes away and we could easily walk to Riverside or Central Park in the early morning  The residential area of the Upper West Side was comfortable and homey with lots of grocery stores and shops plus a huge bookstore Would we stay there again YES This was part of a flighthotel package and we lucked out Finding a bargain in NYC isnt easy but the Belleclaire Hotel is one of them  
P => Cheap and cheerful Well I must re iterate what many of the other reviewers have said  My friends and I  of us in total stayed there in uary  and we definitely go what we paid for  The room was OK we had one section that had two double beds in and another section that was supposed to have twin beds but it had a three quarter bed in So we asked for an extra bed which they brought up straight away  Although they were supposed to charge us for it they never did  For  people the room was a bit cramped but we were hardly in there  When you are in NYC why would you want to spend time in your hotel room Despite other reviews complaining about the noise we didnt have any and we were grateful for it being constantly warm as it was minus  degrees outsideLocation wise I would say it was pretty good  We used the subway to get about as there was so many of us and the nearest subway station is about a  minute walk  The Natural History Museum is about a  minute walk as is Central Park  The Mamhattan Diner across the road was good for breakfast as it was so convenient  The food is good too  Another great place which doesnt look much is the pizza place just round the corner from the hotel infact it is underneath the hotel  Cant remember its name but you cant miss is  You have to walk right into the back and it opens up and there are loads of tables crammed in  The place is a bit rough and ready but the pizzas are fantastic  
P => Good for what it is Okay   I have to say that I was a bit disturbed when I first saw our room  It looked nothing like the pictures on the website  I dont think they put a picture of the economy room on the site  The size was about  ft by  feet with a window unit air conditioner one closet two night stands a green audomen which only in my opinion takes up space a nicely dressed bed that was pretty comfy a small refrigerator and sink  We shared a bathoom with two other rooms but I think that only one was occupied at the time  We NEVER saw our neighbors  I really think that they didnt bathe  It is exactly what it is   an economy room in NYC  Other than that I can not say anything bad about the hotel  The service was spectacular our room and the bathroom were kept clean the neighbors were not loud and the place had elevators which is hard to say for a lot of New York economy hotels  It also had internet access   mins friendly employees and doormen  The hotel has a wonderful location right off of Broadway on th   close to food kets great restauants Central Park and just two blocks from the   train that heads through mid city to down town  The area is also plentiful with cabs  We had a wonderful stay starting from and easy check in finishing with a quick check out  I have to say that if you are looking for that New York City luxury this is not the place for you  But if you want a convenient cute low priced place to stay with friendly people in a nice neighborhood   then definitely check this place out  
P => Worst hotel ever We booked a quotfamily suitequot described as two rooms with a bathroom  Technically this was accurate  However the rooms bathroom and closet yes only one closet combined were smaller in area than many single hotel rooms  Although the suite was supposed to be able to house up to  people it was cramped for our  adults and one child  If we hadnt pre paid for four days we would have walked out and taken our chances elsewhere The bathroom is accessible only through one of the rooms if someone in the other room needs to get up in the middle of the night he has to walk into the sleeping persons room  The closet is in the other room  The two rooms had a total of three small drawers ONE chair and NO box of tissues  There were none of the amenities one expects from just about any hotel these days    coffeemaker continental breakfast etc  There was a small refrigerator but no microwave and no sink except the one in the bathroom Lets talk about the bathroom  Among the  adults with us we had experienced literally hundreds of hotels on four continents over at least five ades  This bathroom easily won the prize for the smallest and least user friendly ever  The sink is so tiny that you cant help splashing water on the floor just by turning on the faucet  There is ONE towel bar to hold enough towels for up to  people and ONE hook behind the door no shelves even within the shower area to put ones shampoo and such  The fan was broken from the moment we arrived  We told the people at the front desk who said theyd send someone up to look at it  be they did while we were out but all they did was look it was never fixed in the time we were there  Generally speaking it was a dump    who gave this place  stars The window unit air conditioners were ky not only were they mismatched and unattractive but they made loud clanking and knocking noises all night  There was a hole in the wall of one room  I once stayed in a German hotel that was about this bad    I think there was a blood stain on the wall    but it cost only about one fifth what this place costThe clientele was the best part  We shared elevators with such a variety of characters There were the two young quotladiesquot who used profanity in front of our  year old and the father who took his child out of her stroller and then didnt have the courtesy to fold up the stroller to make room for another person and I believe several other reviews have mentioned how small the elevators are  After dark we had the pleasure of some different company altogether such as the old man who reeked of urine and the aging drag queen with orange skin Yes it is in a great location and that helped  Still well never stay here again  
P => Fair price nice hotel I was quite concerned by some of the negative reviews on here about the belleclaire but it is a fine place to stay  Location is good just off broadway with central park a few blocks away plenty of good diners and restaurants nearby The hotel rooms are clean with good beds and or  It is clear that the building itself has seen worse times and the paintwork in the rooms is quite out of date  But it looks like the hotel has put new beds mirrors and lights in the rooms so it looks quite up to date  Nice bathroom with powerful shower air conditioning unit in window worked OK but a bit noisy and TV was fine  Not much of a view and some traffic noise overnight but this is New York City and not Hicksville AZIf you can get thius for a reasonable price we paid  for  double beds in a good sized en suite room with AC and youre not expecting top class luxury then go for it  
P => Not like the website Either there is a dramatic difference in the type of room you can book at this hotel or the people who gave it a positive review are used to filthy smelly and cramped places Upon check in we took the worlds most claustrophopia inducing elevator up to the th floor  Finding our room was like navigating a labyrinth in the dark  the hallways are so narrow I had to turn my suitcase sideways for it to fit and I travel light  The hallways were very musty and devoid of oxygen We eventually found our room all  square feet of it at the back of the hotel and it was scary  A few quotfeaturesquot filthy carpets with black stains no dresser that fresh quoturinyquot smell stained acoustic panels above the bed a dented mini fridge and a tiny AC unit sticking out of the window that made more noise than a Kindergarten class at recess but failed to cool the sweltering room  I took a quick peak into the shared bathroom on the way out  it was small moldy and humid To their credit the hotel staff allowed us to check out immediately with no penalties  In fact the hotel staff was polite in every way and its not their fault The Belleclaire is eiving  the lobby is beautiful the website has great room photos and even the business cards are classy  Its all made to make you think the hotel is nicer than it is but please believe me the rooms are terrible  
P => Great Hotel  wonderful location We just spend a week at the Belleclaire and let me tell you we love it Big room with two double beds clean bathroom and refrigerator  The staff  really friendly look up a location for us on the internet and printed out directions within minutes  Very cute lobby and spacious well equipped gym  Location can t ask for a better one  th and Broadway  subway stops on th great local restaurants and only three blocks to Central Park I would definitely stay again  Jessica    
P => Much better than we had expected My boyfriend and I stayed at the Belleclaire for  nights this week and like many people on this board we werent sure what to expect from reading the other reviews  I must say that we were pleasantly surprised     The room was indeed simple but it was clean the bed was comfortable and we had a nice view of Broadway  The AC worked very well and the walls were practically sound proof always a plus in a hotel  The bathroom however could have used a brighter lightbulb or something but oh well  The location was ideal    its only a  block walk from the th street subway station and its within walking distance of Central Park and a ton of shops and restaurants  Id definitely recommend this place and wed most likely end up going back ourselves    all in all its a pretty good deal for New York 
P => Wonderful stay great people Our group of  stayed in  rooms at the Hotel Belleclaire and had a wonderful time  We arrived at am exhausted and with cranky children and the staff were great  The beds were the most comfortable ever the staff at the fromt desk were friendly and Peter the concierge was extremely helpful  He got us free reservations at a nearby comedy club that was fantastic and was able to recommend many other trips and tourist haunts  Yes the elevators are small  I didnt visit NYC to rate elevators  Weve already booked a return visit in ch  
P => Moneys worth I stayed at the Belleclaire in the end of e and was pleasantly surprised  I wasnt quite sure what Id be getting before I got there but it was more than I had hoped for  My room along with one other was closed off from the rest of the rooms on our floor by a door that we could open with our card key  Travelling alone I thought this was a nice security measure  I shared a bathroom with the people in the other room but I never found it to be occupied when I needed it which was nice  The ac was working and kept the room at a nice temperature theres a big walk in closet with ironing board other necessities and though it didnt have a mini bar theres a small fridge where you can put food and drinks you buy yourself  Theres no breakfast served at the hotel except through room service but the Manhattan Diner across the street had some wonderful food for a very good price  The staff was very friendly and helpful especially the people in the giftshop  They can get guests in to the Comedy Club on th and Broadway for free  Great place  Also if youre going to a concert at the Beacon theatre thats only a couple of blocks north from the hotel  Lots of little shops in the neighborhood Filenes Basement is down by the subway station on th and Broadway and that subway can take you directly to Times Square Empire State Building and docks for Statue of Liberty and and bay cruise  
P => Loved the ironing board The Belleclaire is in an excellent Upper West Side locationnear subways Zabars and a five minute walk to Central Park  Try to arrive in the daytime when the staff is least pressed  True you wont get help lugging your bag to your room but the elevator is not far from the front desk and goes up and down at an average pace  When I registered I checked a packet with half my prescription medication in it plus my passport and some cash  I avoiced problems paying for my telephone calls by credit card by paying a deposit of night which was returned for me minus the  for the calls Even local calls are charged for  By the third day I found telephone books in an obscure corner of the closet  I was given a quotqueen sized roomquot without asking perhaps because of the way I booked  And knowing I would have an ironing board available meant I could arrive with a lighter suitcase  After after asking for a chair twice I got a folding chair which was adequate  Yes the carpet was shabby but the bed was excellent and the room and bathroom were clean    The woman who cleaned my room told me she had worked for the Belleclaire for  years  Several days after leaving I thought I had left something important either at the Belleclaire or one other place  I went back to the Belleclaire first and they were very professional about checking even called the maid on their own  Given the scary level of NYC hotel prices the Belleclaire worked out well for me a third age single traveler  
P => Pseudo chic or fails to mask rotting insides You cant make a silk purse out of sows ear or a eurochic hotel out of what should be a condemned building   have had nothing but good experiences with Upper West Side hotels Milburne one block south on W th and On the Ave across Broadway and both excellent so assumed wrongly that the trend would continue with Belleclaire  Staff was very friendly yes and eager to help but that did not make up for the horrible room my family was stuck with   for a quotfamily suitequot that was nothing more than a cramped former studio in an obvious SRO building that is falling down underneath the cosmetic fix ups to make it look quotmodern minimalist chicquot   there was NO air in the front part of the quotsuitequot and the windows were filthy and painted shut   I ended up leaving my spouse and going to sleep in the double bed with my dhter in the space with the air conditioning  The bath was TINY and had no venting system and smelled of mold   the worst part of the room was that the carpets had been shampooed that day and were drenched and stank   finally the room was at the end of an incredibly narrow and long hallway and it felt that we were in danger were a fire to break out    also the elevator was smaller than anything Id ever been in before absolutely ridiculousand had broken down just the night before stranding a customer for an hour   Take our advice from former New Yorkers and a former upper west side resident stay at the Milburne if you have a family   its cheaper and much much better even has kitchenettes even if it doesnt have euro down comforters on the beds   I feel I got lured by fancy internet photos of a hotel that didnt come close to delivering on its promise    
P => Pleasantly Surprised I was surprised at the quality of the hotel for the price  We paid  for one night in shared bathroom room  We didnt have a problem sharing the bathroom but if I was staying for more than one night i would probably pay the extra money for a private bathroom  The front desk staff was nice the room was nicely air conditioned and the bed was comfortable  I recommend the hotel for any traveler on a budget who needs to stay on the upper west side  The hotel is just  short blocks from the subway so its easy and quick to go anywhere  
P => Excellent Hotel Excellent Price Excellent Location We recently visited NYC and stayed at the wonderful Hotel BelleClaire The pictures on the website are not exaggerated and are exactly how the lobby and rooms look  We arrived at the hotel way before check in and they told us if they didnt have a room ready they would be more than happy to store our bags in a locked luggage storage until they did  The rooms were clean and orated in a quotchic modernquot manner  We had a private bath room with doubles beds which had down comforters  The room also had air conditioner WITH temperature controls  The staff was very friendly and we never had any problems with anyone  I have read other reviews on this hotel concerning the small elevators  While this is true what they didnt know is that there is a much larger elevator down the hall that can be used for hauling luggage The location of the hotel was excellent also  It was a short one block walk to the red line th St  subway station which has stops at columbus circle times square even to the south ferry station to see the Statue of Liberty  The neighborhood was safe and is a high end residential area  We like staying in the Upper West Side because it is away from the more touristy areas of nyc and the area is filled with great local shops and restaurants  Overall we are VERY satisfied with our stay at the BelleClaire and very happy to have found it  Now when travelling to NYC we dont have to worry about where to stay  We know we always have a home away from home at the BelleClaire  
P => Just Fine for the price   take your shower shoes This NYC budget hotel is plenty fine  I stayed in an economy room for  nights which shared a bath w  other rooms  My room was clean and well appointed for a budget room  The bathroom was just fine as long as I wore my shower shoes   not once was the bathroom occupied when I needed it  The hotel was full but not once was I bothered by noise from the other guests  The staff is extrememly friendly and accomodating  True the place is a bit rough around the edges and does not look quite as fresh as the pictures on the website but it was nothing that was off putting  My bed was very comfy and the sheets were nice enough  The towels were a tad rough but what I would expect  The location is great   walk to the park Columbus Circle and the subway is very close  I was very pleased w my visit to the Hotel Belleclaire and felt that my room rate was exactly right  This is a place I would book again   its not for my picky friends who want luxury amp perks but if you book knowing that it is what it is youll be satisfied  
P => tight quarters We recently stayed here on a trip to NYC with our toddler dhter  First of all the location is great and you feel that you are in a part of town where people really live eat and drink  There are amazing restaurants Rain was a great Thai restaurant and it was reasonable by NYC standards  that are close by  There is a great diner across the street and fun little grocey stores close for getting odds and ends  There is also a refrigerator in the room which is great for snacks  The beds are comfortable with clean white sheets and a duvet  The water pressure of the shower was also good  They also provided a safe in your room As for the bathtub ours did not have a working stopper which made it difficult to give our toddler her bath efficiently They were very stingy iwth soap shampoo etc  They only gave us  set over the  nights even though our products were running low  The elevators rarely were both working and when they were they were slow and very very small  The desk staff could not provide us with a copy of the bill when we left as we purchased our room through expedia which made it difficult with submitting the hotel bill for my husband for his work  The room felt cramped  The heating system was ancient and you could not shut it off even when it was hot so we had to run the ac with the heater on  The windows were very old and not very clean  Our view was off the main street so our room was quiet Overall the price was very reasonable for NYC and we were fairly prepared for this class and style of room  When we moved to the NYC Hilton on th if was like night and day but the prices were considerably higher at the Hilton  If I did it again I would probably take my chances to get a nicer room somewhere else as I was going a little stir crazy by day  even though we spent limitied time in our room  
P => Great location when travelling with children We stayed in a family room with private bathroom for  nights last autumn and would definitely stay at this hotel again  The price was low compared to other options and the location on the Upper West Side couldnt have suited us better when travelling with children  It was quiet only a few blocks away from Central Park and with a variety of ent family friendly restaurants and diners close by  Several attractions were within walking distance and the nearest metro station wasnt far away either  True enough the room didnt offer a view it would have been nice with a door to arate the two bedrooms in the suite and perhaps a bar or restaurant at the hotel  Still we found the standard satisfying  The room was clean and the diner across the street was open  hours  
P => Friendly but watch out Watch out for the cleaning staff  As with many hotels we learned that you dont want to leave your prescription medications in your luggage  Rooms very small bathrooms even smaller  Shower head was the most comfortable Ive had in a hotel  I was upgraded to a suite but was quite dissapointed when I opened the door to the small size  Beds were very comfortable  For the price of hotels in N Y  I guess I shouldnt have complaints  or needed some serious work very dull and plain  One of the two rooms I rented had a window which you could open no lock or screen and easily walk on a ledge to other rooms  Makes you a bit nervious for your safety at night  I could see right into three other rooms through the window in the suite  Peter in the hotel gift shop was the saving grace for this hotel  He helped me in many ways and made the stay do able  Thanks Peter 
P => The savings are not worth the poor experience This hotels is rated  stars by Travelocity  Id give it one  The st room we got faced Broadway  make sure youre on the other side  the noise is never ending  The windows on the two rms  we stayed in were filthy  hadnt been cleaned for years Id say  Many items were in disrepair or barely working  air conditioner sounds like a B  taking off  clock radios are old cheap and usually didnt work properly  No coffee makers in room in a  star hotel  Dead light bulbs  no batteries in remote control  Little things but collectively send the msg  that no one is minding the store and there is no attention to detail  Beds were comfortable bathroom was recently remodeled and nice  Location upper west side is excellent  lots of restaurants and grocers nearby  This hotel stays full because of price amp location I seriously doubt if there are repeat clients  Front desk staff was friendly but didnt do much to remedy problems  Overall I wouldnt return  
P => Clean tiny dark We have stayed at the Belleclaire twice in the last few weeks  Each time we booked a room with shared bath  The second time our room was so small that we had to walk sideways to get around the bed However we very much liked the freshly laundered duvet covers on the down comforters  so much better than the usual hotel quilts or bedspreads that dont get cleaned on a regular basis  The shared bath was newly tiled and extremely clean I was concerned when we got out of the elevator during the second visit that all of the rugs were covered with brown paper and there were ladders and construction equipment in evidence  However we heard no construction noise during our stay  I think they were just repainting so this will be a temporary thing I dont know what kind of climate control there is during the summer months  Perhaps they put air conditioners in the windows but there were none in evidence when we stayed there nor was there any central air conditioning or a fan  A large heavy floor to ceiling drape hangs over the window and doesnt open  If you book during warm weather I would definitely ask about this All in all if your priorities are low prices cleanliness and great Upper West Side location this is an excellent choice for you  If on the other hand you want something spacious or fancy pay more and go elsewhere TIP At the time we booked the rates being offered directly by the hotel were lower than hotels or expedia which also include a service fee in addition to local taxes  
P => Pleased overall Although there was an issue with the window in our room which made it freezing cold at first we were give  space heaters and moved to a bigger and much warmer room the second night  The staff was very helpful and curtious  The hotel was in the progress of finishing up their sprinkler system so the lobby was pretty messy most of the time  The area around the hotel was safe and not too touristy  Theres a great diner across the street and the subway is very nearby  Overall I was pleased and would recommend the hotel to anyone on a budget but want access to a lot of good things  
P => Think twice     If you can find another place go for it    Belle Claire was very disappointing Semi cleanfilthy windows that didnt work    Room Staff is friendly and helpful but I wouldnt stay here again  
P => Good value and great location We were very happy with our stay at the Belle Claire  Neighbourhood was good   safe and not too touristy Excellent location with subways closeby on Broadway at nd and th Sts  We stayed  nights in an economy room with shared bath first   room was very small and a bit stuffy never had any problems with shared bath room   clean and no one else used it when we needed it Overall pretty good value  We upgraded the next  nights to a Queen room with private bath  This room was excellent very roomy good sized bathroom and clean  Very comfortable   we even got a view towards the Hudson river  Staff were helpful  The Manhattan Diner across the street was also very good  If we visit NYC again we will definately stay at the Belle Claire again  
P => Comfy Beds My sister and I visited NY on a budget and found a great deal at the Belleclaire  We had a very small room but had very comfy beds which made up for that  We had a shared bath which was VERY clean and we never had to wait for it once We arrived at the hotel at noon and asked if we could check our bags until we could check in at  but they let us check in early Great service everyone was VERY nice from the front desk to the doorman the concierge  Would highly recommend if on a budget  Great hotel 
P => Good place to rest your head  Not a disappointment Excellent Deal We visited the Belleclaire for an all girls trip to NY all over yrs of age with little patience for bad service etc  We were pleasantly surprised While the rooms were sparse the washroom was newly reated the beds were clean and comfortable and the carpet was clean  We booked a quotfamily suitequot and found it spacious and bright  No luxury items here but would certainly book at the belleclarie again  Excellent safe location  We were pleased with the service and accommodation for the money  Would highly recommend  
P => Nice hotel on Upper West Side We stayed there one Saturday night it was the cheapest place we could find or least expensive on the Upper West Side  Its superbly located the staff were very nice  Our room on the th floor had its own bathroom and was very clean  The or is minimalist and of good taste   none of the flowery bed covers and curtains of the chain hotels  And you can open the windows if youd like toThe only problem was that we had some noisy neighbors who came home really late and kept talking loudly and banging their doors All in all it was very nice and I would definitely stay there again  Just make sure your room has a private bathroom as I read other reviews of people who had to share theirs  
P => cosy and warm I was panicking a bit after reading other reviews that the hotel was going to be a roach infested brothel But the hotel was warm cosy and very comfy  The staff were helpful and the whole place was clean Our radiator leaked a bit and when the lift doors opened onto our floor to reveal a tatty underlay with no carpet I did have my worries But for the price we paid it was a total bargain  It felt very safe and the bed was lovely You can walk down into the centre if you can be bothered but cabs are cheap or be brave and go on the subway which is just two streets away and only two dollars The diner over the road is fabulous and the breakfasts are outstanding Its obviously not the Four Seasons but more like youre favourite teddy bear   a bit worn and tatty but safe and secure  
P => Perfect affordable hotel clean comfortable great location After booking my ruary  stay at New Yorks Hotel Belleclaire their website looked great I learned about tripadvisor and ided to learn more about the hotel prior to my visit  I must say I was leary because the reviews seemed to be either highly praiseworthy or critical which had me confused  In the end I had a great stay My th floor room no   had a queen size bed and shared bath  The sink in my room had instant hot water with great water pressure  Although three rooms shared the bathroom I never had to wait for it  The shower had ample hot water and good pressure Despite warnings that the heating system was noisy and the hallways smelly I had no such experiences  I could control the heat in the room to my liking and the room was exceptionally quiet even though it overlooked upper Broadway I had two windows one looking northeast over Broadway the other west over the rooftop so there was lots of natural light and good cross ventilation in the summer I would imagine  The room was clean bright and the bed VERY comfortable especially nice after hoofing it around New York each day  The colour television was nice but rarely used    I was in New York after all so had little desire to sit in front of a t v  when the world beckoned at my doorstep The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and added to an enjoyable stay The neighbourhood was great very safe and quite quiet at night    two short blocks to the subway   and   lines lots of shops and eateries Zabars gourmet food emporium  blocks north the art o Manhattan Diner across the street offering hearty and inexpensive breakfasts and public art in the form of playful bronze statues running up the centre median of Broadway at periodic intervals  Very close to Central Park just  blocks to the east which made getting to Christo and Jeanne Claudes quotThe Gatesquot installation a breeze I heartily recommend the Hotel Belleclaire for those on a budget who want a clean comfortable room away from the chaos of Times Square which if you must indulge is readily at hand just  subway stops down the line Enjoy your stay as much as I did 
P => Mixed Feelings     I returned yesterday from my five night stay at this hotel  The staff were very friendly and helpful however I agree with the prev messages if you need a good nights sleep I do not recommend this hotel  The radiators banged all night long whenever our neighbours turned on the taps in their room it sounded like our room was flooding we must have got around   hours sleep each night  However the location is excellant with many wonderful shops surrounding inc the Manhatten Diner which is open  hours 
P => If you can look elsewhere  We have just returned from a stay at the Belleclaire hotel  I wish we could say that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel but this was not the case The reception area and lobby are clean and tidy the lifts work well infact most public areas are acceptable  However although the building has undegone some form of reation recently this stopped short of replacing the windows or the heating system within the bedrooms  Being located adjacent to Broadway is convienient however being unable to sleep due to the wind and traffic noise slightly outways any benifit  In addition the heating system is like something out of the arc powered by steam which comes on when it wants to especially during the night and sounds more like a steam whistle on a train If you can look elsewhere  
P => If all you want is somewhere to sleep then its ok       If youre planning on spending a lot of time in your hotel room dont stay here though I dont know why you would if youre in New York It is cheap clean amp the staff are friendly  But the room felt miserable probably because its so bare amp minimal and the views   well ours was of an alley The location is great and the neighborhood felt much safer amp cosier than other parts of the city at night My one big problem was the noise from the hotel itself   I am not sure if it was the heating or the elevators   we were told different things by the staff  But it did keep us all awake every night it was so loud   and thats not what you need when you have a day of sightseeing ahead  
P => Bad News at the BelleClaire Hotel You might think that the Belleclaire is cheap but it is certainly not cheerful Banging radiators that keep you up all night and cannot be regulated so that you are either too hot or too cold tepid showers mouldy bathroom tiles pokey bathroom dirty floors towels with holes in the list goes on The only thing in favour of this hotel is its location on the Upper West Side just a few blocks from Central Park  The hotel is in bad need of overhaul particularly the hot water system which creaks and bangs all night resembling a night spent in the sinking titanic with morse code being tapped out with a spanner on the pipes  When I asked to be moved I was informed that the whole hotel was the same and that all the residents were complaining so there was no point moving rooms  When I eventually checked out after three dreadful nights my prebooked and pre paid taxi failed to arrive just to top it all off  My advice is to pay the extra couple of hundred bucks and go to the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square which has excellent reviews  You wont regret NOT staying at the Belleclaire with its weary staff and tired old building     
P => Surrounded by New York We were there with our dhter during the half term holidays  The Hotel was just as I had imagined and we were saturated in clean towels bed linen and bathroom accessories for the whole week  It was well placed for a lovely diner across the road Great Breakfasts and the local busesunderground trains Yours e Miller 
P => Good location We were a little apprehensive about this hotel   the other reveiws on the site were a bit mixed  But we definitely made the right ision  This hotel is not the Ritz but it was good cheap ish accomodation in a central location  It was only  in a cab to Times Square  The staff are very helpful and friendly  The neighbourhood is lovely and you get room service from the Manhattan Diner across the street  Dont expect a five star hotel and you wont be disappointed  
P => great value Stayed here with my parents over half term   three of us in a room  A little cramped but who needs space when youre out all day visiting the sights  Room was spotless and towels were coming out of our ears Thoroughly recommended great location for one of the main subway lines too that goes straight down to times square  the manhattan diner over the road serves excellent cheap breakfasts too  
P => Perfect for our Bite out of the Big Apple I booked the Belleclaire after reading the reviews on this site  We were looking for a cheap non scary place for our  day whirlwind trip to NYC  This place was perfect for us  We paid  a night in ober for a fine room with a shared bath  It was a very busy hotel I booked it  months in advance for    high season  We found the room perfectly fine  No Ritz but we spent next to no time in our room anyway  There was a sink in our room and a mini fridge  Our room overlooked a brick wall but was very quiet  There was even a CD player in the alarm clock  They were pretty speedy with service and nice  It was a wonderful location    block off of a Subway line north and right on Broadway  The Belleclaire is across from the awesome Manhattan Diner   which we only ate at for breakfast once much to my disappointment  The price was good and the food was awesome  The Belleclaire was well cleaned the bed was fine and I liked the duvet cover  I would definitely stay there again for a great budget room  
P => Great location Great location to experience the New Yorkers way of life  The hotel is situated in Upper West Manhatten away from the hustle amp bustle of mid Manhatten  The hotel is situated  blocks from the underground station served by the  amp  lines Our family room was basic but large The room was divided into two by a partition wall which allowed for privacy from the children Beds very comfortable with fresh bed linen and towels each day  Two televisions in the room   one pay per view of films and console games and the other a standard tv  The fridge was very useful My only grumble would be the lack of air conditioning in the room which Im sure would be a neccessity in the summer The Manhatten Diner which serves typical American fare at a good price is only a minutes walk from the hotel  There is also a hr superket around the corner Overall a good value family room in a great location in a great city  
P => Great place on a budget Stayed for  nights in a  person family suite although there were only  of us on the rd floor late tember to early ober  Beds were incredibly comfortable bathroom clean great powerful shower and towels changed everyday  There was a walk in wardrobe but only  hangers and only one small chest of drawers   this made it a bit sparse for storing clothes but suitcases came in handy  Room nicely but simply orated as portrayed in the hotel website pictures  Good TVs fridge iron etc  Quiet at night Everything we needed in a very pleasant neighbourhood  Great restaurants shops and bars nearby We would certainly go back there  
P => Pretty Good Value If Youre On A Budget We stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire in New York for  nights in early y  The Hotel or in the lobby is attractive the elevators are quite small and cramped especially if you have a lot of luggage The hotel was undergoing reations and there was scaffolding on the exterior walls of the building when we were there We booked a two room suite with our own bathroom which was okay  The or in the room was in need of updating  The beds were clean and comfortable  The hotel is well positioned on W th Street and close to the subway  The neighbourhood itself is safe There isnt a restaurant in the hotel but the Manhattan Diner is located across the street corner from the hotel and is very good We would definetely stay here again as the hotel is pretty good value if youre on a budget  
P => Good Value in NYC We stayed at the Hotel Belleclaire in New York for  nights in early ust  The Hotel or in the lobby is extremely attractive and our room was small hey its New York after all quite plain but clean tidy and comfortable  The air conditioner however sounded like a Boeing  taking off when turned on We stayed in a room with a shared bathroom with about  other rooms which we were quite uneasy about initially but were relieved with the cleanliness of the dated but functional bathroom The hotel is excellently positioned on W th Street and if you feel energetic and its hard not to in this town its a good walk down to Times Square It is only a  block walk to the Museum of Natural History and the Gray Line NYC sight seeing tour pick up point  An excellent diner The Manhattan Diner is located across the street corner from the hotel Internet is available in the concierge room for a pricey   per  minutes  A better bet is a little copy shop next to the Manhattan Diner which charges   per  mins Due to competitive pricing for NYC and good position in a safe neighbourhood we would definetely stay here again although preferably spend a few extra  and get a room with out own bathroom  
P => A sweet well located place to stay in New York My husband and I stayed very happily at the Hotel Belleclaire for one night in ust   We knew the room would be small and it was    after all it is in New York and modestly priced  Still the room was orated with simple good taste and featured lovely bath amenities an incredibly comfortable bed and comforter and    a stroke of luck    a beautiful view of the river  The friendly staff readily accomodated my request for a room change the first one we were assigned was directly opposite a stairwell  Very highly recommended for its value and incredible Upper West Side location  
P => Ok for the money nice location  We upgraded to this hotel after reading the awful reviews about our original booking at the Carter Hotel  of Ebookers favourites it seems We had a  bedroomed suite on the positive side the beds were big comfortable and clean  The shower was a blaster and always hot water  And thats it for positive the rest of the room was quite shabby and had not seen a wet wipe for a while  The TV and AirCon worked and we had one coat hanger for the four of us Location was good we felt really at ease in this neighbourhood Didnt really have much interaction with the staff however young bellboy Sare was really friendly and helpful  All in all you could do a lot worse for the money  
P => Great location good clean rooms reasonable price I was very happy with my stay at the Belleclaire  The location is great close to subway and Central Park and safe We booked a room with shared bathroom and the first room shown to us on the top floor had a broken TV no air conditioning and no fridge  We were given a different room that had fridge TV and air conditioning  We only waitied once for the shared bathroom and the room was very quiet dark at night and the bed was good  Both the room and shared bathroom were kept very clean For the price of  incl tax booked through Expedia beforehand I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Good location clean rooms nice bathroom what else do you need i would definately reccommend this hotel  It is a fantastic location     blocks from central park and in the middle of a gorgeous upperwest neighborhood which isnt completely populated with other tourists  Nice coffee shops resteraunts shops and a generally friendly area  minutes from lincoln centre and within walking distance if your fit to all the touristy things   times square empire state etc  If you want a room which is adequate with tv phone bath fridge nice comfy big bed then this is a good choice  If you are used to a star hotel as one reviewer felt the need to brag about then BOOK ONE you will not get the opulent room furniture and other fancy details that you get for paying   per room in upket hotel but what you will get is good value for money  We also found the staff helpfull to all our enquiries  stayed   
P => A Very Good Deal I stayed at the Belleclaire Hotel from ust th th with another friend  We stayed in the shared bathroom queen bedroom  The room was clean the bed was comfortable the refrigerator was convenient and useful and the location was quiet and relaxing  The hotel staff cleaned the room everyday and we were never bothered by the shared bathroom  In the three mornings we only had to wait min once for the shower  For the price at totalnight the price was perfect  Last year I stayed at the Algonquin hotel a four star hotel that averaged  night and though a little more comfy I would rather stay at the Belleclaire anyday  This hotel is also great for college students looking to avoid the hostels or the other infamous one star dumps in NY  A great find and very good deal  
P => Impressed I was looking for a hotel in New York for myself my wife and  boys  and found this thro Expedia  The reason I chose it because it had  room family suites in it  It was very good in that it was reasonbly central and only  streets from the subway  The rooms were very good and most importantly clean  The only downside in common with a lot of NY hotels was that there was no bar or any other facilities  That being said the night porter was a nice man called Peter who even arranged a taxi for us to JFK when we were leaving  I certainly did not recognise this hotel from some of the negative reviews I read  I would certainly stay again and recommend it highly  
P => Have Stayed at Better Hotels I booked a room in the Hotel Belleclaire this past ember for two reasons it fit my limited budget and it was not overly far from Radio City Music Hall where I was going to see a show  However I would recommend that anyone coming to New York City even for an overnight stay look elsewhere when searching for a hotel  There are far better hotels in NYC and I was extremely disappointed with the Hotel Belleclaire I booked through hotels and the pictures that the hotel posted and the fabulous reviews that it received were a far cry from what I experienced when I was there  The lobby is about the only thing in the entire hotel that actually looks the way it does in the online photos  The outside of the hotel is covered in scaffolding   they are reating the facade   and the lobby while ent is definitely not on par with other lovely old hotels in the city  Ive actually seen apartment vestibules that are better than this lobby  The elevators are unbelievably tiny   two people and a good sized piece of luggage are about all that is going to fit on those things  The hotel itself retains very little of its old charm   the ble stairs and the ornate iron handrails are lovely but the yellowed walls with their randomly placed black and white photos of NYC the glaring ceiling lights and the thin ugly carpeting leaves much to be desired  The entire hotel has the feel of some sort of run down boarding house and succeeded in giving me a slight case of the creeps  The rooms are a story in and of themselves If you must stay at the Hotel Belleclaire make sure that you book a room with a private bath  Unlike many hotels Belleclaire offers rooms with a shared bath  These rooms arated from the others by their own key carded door feature three private bedrooms and one bath that you must share with other people  Do not do this The room I stayed in was mediocre at best and the bath was an ugly green tiled room that had minimal lighting and provided no fan so steam from the shower built up and clung to everything  Plus whenever one of my quotneighborsquot went in to take a shower I heard the plumbing creaking and shrieking until they were finished  My room featured the same yellowed walls as the rest of the hotel an ancient radiator stained carpeting and a slightly musty smell  I dont know who took those pictures that are featured on the hotels website but with the exception of the lamps my room did not resemble those rooms at all  There was a sink in my room and two cheap mirrors one of which had a fruit sticker plastered onto it   so much for maid service and the window had no curtains  It did however have a shade which promptly fell down onto the floor when my boyfriend went to pull it up in the morning  The quotincrediblequot view you were hoping for Non existent unless staring at brick walls air conditioning units and the barred up window of the room across the way really gets you going My room featured a ent television a CD player that was about the size of a stamp and toiletries that included a limited quantity of thin towels and some plastic drinking cups  The bed had nice comfortable clean linens which was the only really good thing about the room although the bed itself was rather lumpy and had the exact same low quality mattress that I slept on in my college dorm  The neighborhood surrounding the Hotel Belleclaire isnt bad   it is typical in its West side grittiness but is still nothing to complain about   and if you really need to escape from the Hotel Belleclaire there is plenty to do in the area  However I would recommend anyone in need of a hotel on the West side to look elsewhere   the Hotel Belleclaire is distinctly lacking in good up to date amenities and its old fashioned charm has been ruined by poorly designed and ill maintained rooms and or  You will get far better service at almost any other hotel  Bottom line book elsewhere  
P => good enough Fair enough for the money  Great neighborhood and good sized room with AC  Not spotless and you might not want to wait     and wait    for the elevator  But Ive paid more money for a lot less room in NYC  
P => Would definatley stay here again  Stayed here mid y for  week and was very happy with the hotel  The location was tremendous only  blocks from the subway We stayed in the  bedroom suitetakes  adultsand the only problem we had was everyone trying to shower in the morning The rooms were quite spacious and clean with our own fridgehairdryer etc The beds were comfortable and clean and the maid was in every other day The hour diner across the road was fab If we go back to New York we would definatley stay here again  
P => Location Location Location               We stayed here in tember last year and opted for a room with a shared bathroom  The first room we were offered was quite big however it smelt a bit damp and was quite far away from the bathroom  Therefore the staff moved us to another room at our request and although the room was smaller it was situated next door to a bathroom and did not have the damp aroma This room and the shared bathroom were clean and although we did not have a fridge or in room movies as per what is advertised this did not matter to us The staff ranged from very friendly to passive but were always on hand if required Best of all though was the location of the hotel in the Upper West Side which is a beautiful neighborhood with some good bars restaurants and shops and everywhere else in Manhattan that was not within walking distance was easily reached via the Subway  All in all the rooms at the Belleclaire are perfectly fine and provide everything you need if you are going to be out and about the whole time and I would definitely stay here again given the location and the ent room rates  
P => Very good for the price Before we left for New York City we read the reviews on this web site  There were so many complaints that we were concerned about our accomadations  But our concerns were unfounded because this hotel was a pleasant surprise  The building is old and the rooms are small but it is clean quiet and is in a great location  The bed was very comfortable and there is air conditioning  The neighborhood is extremely safe and friendly and it is not too far from Times Square  The staff was helpful and there are plenty of things to do in the immediate area  I would stay at this hotel again  However if you are looking for luxury and atmosphere this is the wrong hotel  
P => Lovely Stay I stayed at the hotel last ember for the Macys parade and I was traveling by myslef  Went I first got to the hotel I was greeted by th Bell Man James who helped me bring my things up to my room  The room was average size and was very clean  There was a small sink and cable TV in the room  My room was a quotShared Bathroomquot room   which was very scary at first   however it was not bad at all  The bath room is shared between you and two other guest rooms  During my five night stay there was not one time when I had to wait for the restroom   which was very clean and even had a bathtub   not just a stand up shower  There is a diner across the street   The Manhatten Diner   and a grocery store in the same block that stays open  hours  The hotel is located on the  and the  line   which take you pretty much anywhere  Bottom line   the staff is very nice and helpful   the rooms are great and the location could not be better   I would advise anyone to stay here 
P => lovely location  comfy bed This hotel is situated in a nice part of town in an old style building  away from hustle of midtown  right on corner of broadway  I have stayed in a shared bathroom room on two occasions  the second time in quotquot which has its own bathroom the beds are really comfy ideal if all you want is a great sleep after sightseeing all day  subway is only short walk nd r th street nd is express stop  Great dinner across street for fantastic breakfast  central park only short walk away Hotel is ideal for travellers who are looking for a quiet location and place to rest after long daynight out  found staff to be very helpfull  quotbudget roomsquot good value for money i would stay here again  loved the neighbourhood  
P => Awesome for the price It was a great quaint hotel  Room was very clean  Refrigerator was a nice feature  Bed was comfy and down comforter was nice  There wasnt much noise Great neighborhood We were four blocks from an express subway station and  blocks from regular subway station  Will definitely be back 
P => Dirty   and thank god I had my own bathroom  pretty dissapointed       the room was dirty hallways small   great location  
P => Quirky little hotel Stayed at the hotel  days last week  The hotel did not look like the pictures on the internet  Small bathroom for  people staying in the family quotsuitequot  We had to request kleenex extra towels hangars etc  The beds were the best part of the room  At first I was very disappointed  But I paid  a night split between  people  Most hotels will only allow  people in a room  So the price was right  We spent little time in the hotel anyway  It was  blocks from the subway on th street and  blocks from the  bus line which were our source of transportation  The restaurants close by were very good  You must check out Big Nicks burger and pizza joint for the burgers and breakfast      Great greasy food joint  
P => Its a Long Way From Paris If you dropped the Belleclaire on a sidestreet near the Left Bank or the Eiffel Tower it would blend right in with the Parisian streetscape Unfortunatelyhalf the facade is sheathed in construction webbingso the overall delight in its Beau Epoch design is flawedbut its still a great slice of Paris on Broadway The   rooms are sort of Europeanin a small way I stayed for  nightsthe first two in the cheap room You share a bath with  other roomersand the view out is of a wall or a scaffold An OK rooma comfy bedbut really small I upgraded to a single with bathand for   more got a really nicespaciousmodern room Still couldnt see out the windowbut it was a nicer environment The staff is superband very International Theyre eager to help and go out of their way to assist you Five stars therefor sure And the neighborhood around the hotel must make it the best part of Manhattan for people who like to walkshopeatdrink or ponder the architecture Everything is thereminus the madding crowds of Times Square or the Penn Station area The Manhattan Dinerjust across Broadwayis THE bargain food spot in the area The portions are hugethe service is spot onthe prices are amazingly cheap Example  a HUGE portion of Beef Burgandyserved over noodlesheaped with peascarrots and pearl onionswith a selection of breads and  Becks   bucksand I couldnt eat it allI liked the Belleclaire Id stay there again I just wish they hurry up with the restoration and take down that ugly shroud    
P => Quirky imperfect but appealing I stayed  weeknights at the BelleClaire after finding in on the net  Frankly we chose it mostly for the price but were pleasantly surprised  The rooms are not huge  hey its New York City people  but being a refurbished turn of the century apartment building it has great high ceilings and our private bathroom was plenty spacious with a powerful shower offering limitless hot water  I liked the white cotton linens though I found the bed a little soft and with earplugs in I didnt hear a thing all night What the BelleClaire lacks in in house amenities it makes up for in location  instead of room service you can get restaurant delivery in under  minutes so whats not to like Only a couple of blocks to walk to the subway which runs all night and a brisk stroll across the Park to the Metropolitan Museum of Art I found the desk staff friendly and helpful and we were met by a doorman at the curb who eagerly helped with luggage and gave comprehensive directions to the garage but have to agree about the quotconciergequot  hes quite the entrepreneur  That said theres plenty of material provided to help you make your own arrangements and cabs non stop up and down Broadway Id happily stay again  
P => Cheap but overpriced Arrived and was impressed by the Foyer and Friendliness of the staff  Disappointed by the size appearance and location of the room  Had to keep the curtains closed our whole trip as the building was being held up by scaffolding and there was no air con which made it very uncomfortable to sleep even in il I thought the americans invented air conditioning   Booked it over the net and got a good deal i thoughtat   a night shared bathroom but have had better hotels on a room only basis for less at home  Good location friendly staff but on the whole i would paid more next time for an affordable hotel   
P => A Most Excellent Hotel Experience A most excellent hotel experience The staff was exceptional    very friendly and extremely helpful to the out of town visitor  The hotel itself was a vellous place to come quothomequot to at the end of the day    warm and welcoming  And the rooms Blond wood and scandi o design quality linens and down comforters and the most comfortable bed I have ever had in a lodging place  Plus    everything including the shared bathroom was kept obsessively clean and tidy by wonderful housekeepers  Though the room was smaller it still had all the ammenities of luxury    TV refrigerator clock radio alarm and real hangers in the closet Nighttimes were very quiet and restful something appreciated after a day travelling round the city  I would especially like to thank Susan at the front desk for her happy manner whenever we came in    she is a joy and represents well the warm spirit of the Belleclaire  If you want to really enjoy your stay in New York City but still have some coin left to enjoy the sights I recommend that you stay at the Hotel Belleclaire 
P => Cool  week vacation The Belleclaire isnt the Hilton  So if youre expecting liveried doormen obsequious deskstaff and penthouse apartments as some reviewers seemed to expect forget it and thank god for that  The BC is a mid price hotel perfectly positioned on the upper west side surrounded by great restaurants delis etc  esp if youre veggievegan  The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean with basic amenities phone tv fridge closet and the fantastic shower must be powered by its own nuclear reactor  I cant say much more than that I had a perfect vacation period  
P => great for price The room was clean and comfortable  I felt strange sharing a bathroom with three other roomsstrangers but it wasnt that bad at all  And to be in upper west side Manhattan for less than  a night it was WELL worth it  The staff was very friendly and let us check in early  They also gave us bandaids for blisters always a smile  Great hotel for budget  Not luxurious but comfortable and clean  
P => Ill be back After much research on the internet I chose the Belleclaire for my first visit to NYC and was VERY pleased with my choice  Friendlyhelpful staff great location comfy beds great price I find some of the complaints here a little odd   so the lift was small and not the fastest ever  but really   its not a big deal is it Other complaints I disagree with   our shower was great and there were no food smells in the corridor on my visit All in all   great value for money anda real find  And the beds are incredibly comfy after a hard days pounding the streets 
P => Would stay again at the Belleclaire The Hotel Belleclaire is a quirky and admittedly aging place with elevators that cant hold more than four at a time fewer if youre carrying luggage  Our group of six stayed in the family suite three beds sleeping two each for far far less than we could have stayed anywhere else  The soft fluffy beds were extremely comfortable and the room was clean and bright  The bathroom was a little dingy and could have used some attention from a heavy duty grout cleaner but overall this stylish and comfortable room was a very pleasant surprise One of this hotels major advantages is its very excellent location in a lovely but lively neighborhood close to public transportation Zabars and right next door to Big Nicks where youll have one of your best and cheapest meals in town if you can ever ide on something in the many paged menu which includes a mashed potato pizza  The hotel staff is also extremely friendly and attentive The Belleclaire is no Waldrof and Ive stayed there too but it doesnt pretend to be  If you are looking for an affordable place to stay in NYC that is also clean interesting and in a great location this is it  I swear  This is it  A hotels best endorsement is for a patron to say they would stay there again  And we will  
P => Shabby I had a small room that did grow on me  The bathroom was very nice but the shower head sprayed like a mist  The water stung me  Comfy bed  Alarm clock was broken and I had a lovely view of scaffolding from my window  All in all I was dissappointed  Oh it smelled funny too  Someone was cooking some Puerto Rican food or something  In that aspect it kind of reminded me of home  haha Bottom line   this hotel is just okay  Im staying somewhere else next time  
P => Loved the Price    BUT      I was shocked at NYC hotel prices  Refusing to pay   a night or more we settled on the Belleclaire at   per night Pros Good location where you can walk to several nearby spots for dining and we were able to street park right on nd within a few steps of the front door  Good Bed Mattress and linens were excellent  Friendly and accomodating staff Cons Worlds smallest and slowest elevators Very old rooms have zero ambiance and reminded me of a college dorm   just paint nothing else  Furnishings were Salvation Army at best  Pipes bang and radiator heat was a bit touchy  They could give you TWO mini bars of soap instead of just one  Fair amount of street noise all night long Overall If you just need a place to sleep and a comfy bed it will do fine  If youre looking for any kind of a room to relax in and enjoy seek elsewhere  
P => Loved the duvet We stayed at the Belleclaire in late tember  and found the hotel reasonable enough  We did have to change rooms three times to get what we believed was shown on the web  Overall the hotel is adequate but I think if you were thinking of staying in this part of New York and who wouldnt with the community atmosphere the restaurants and the corner stores you should pay the extra and go up ket  But for the price it is not too bad and the bed and duvet are the most comfortable we slept on in all the time in the United States  This place is not the Ritz but the hotel and its situation in the upper West side is not a bad place to start your New York stay  
P => A pretty good deal Overall I was pretty impressed with the Belleclaire  Obviously in New York youre going to be stuck paying a lot for a small room  Thats just the way it is But the Belleclaire is reasonably priced extremely clean and very comfortable  We got an economy room with a shared bathroom but only once did I try to use it and find it occupied  The bathroom was also very clean and well maintained The staff was very friendly and allowed us to check in early on the day of our arrival and they held our bags for several hours while we did some extra sightseeing on the day of our departure The location is great close to Central Park and a variety of restaurants and bars I really had no complaints whatsoever  Especially if youre traveling on a tight budget and dont want to blow a ton of money on a hotel that you wont even spend a lot of time in Id definitely recommend the Belleclaire  
P => ch    Slightly Over Priced   and flippin cold We found the Belleclaire on the net  It was our first trip to NYC and we were unsure of what to expect   we werent dissapointed but did feel that the pictures on the website were misleading  The website made it seem a lot plusher that it actually was We had a delux room with ensuite  The room was sparce but clean  The fridge was handy for drinks etc  We had no view at all   it looked out over the back of the building which was dingy to say the least  The bathroom was small but had a shower over bath  We were woken on the first night by the heating system having an airblock    it was like someone hammering on the wall I called the night porter who was friendly and apologised but it went on for an hour The location was great for us with the manhatten Diner across the road for breakfast each morning and just a wander away from the Metro station I think that we were expecting a little much for the money we paid    I guess this place is ideal if you are fully aware that its cheap city accommodation If you dont have high expectations you wont be dissapointed I wont say that we would NEVER reccommend it but we would warn people of what to expect FYI We paid   for  nights in ch  
P => nice for the price This hotel cant be beat for the price  Clean comfortable beds more room than most upper west side hotels  Friendly and very accomodating staff  We did share a bathroom and it wasnt as bad as I was expecting

P => great stay in heart of manhattan lovely hotel good view of th street bridge particularly in the top floor bar   minutes walk into central park and not much further into times square  Some great bars and restuarants in the local area  Amazingly large rooms for central new york  two double beds in out room with space around the edges we cant wait to go back 
P => Quite good     but We were staying at this hotel for  days in ember quite good design friendly reception but there were some problems   room wasnt clean when next day the stuff was cleaning it they didnt pick up the trash for all  days the soap shampoo and other bath thing werent renew or changed  We didnt complain because I dont like to ruin holidays because of small problems  Still  per night and no shampoo is looks like a joke  The room was quite big enough new flat screen tv good furniture free coffee on first floor but as always   some butts    US dollar per day for internet  Guys you are in NY   thats lh  This amount people paying for month  Way out of expensive If you dont need any internet and looking for nice place this could be for you but check the cleaning when you arrive  
P => Great hotel for the price Considering the usually high price of hotels in New York this one was great and was very affordable  I only stayed for  night but was very happy with the location staff and general cleanliness  
P => Would recommend except for location I stayed here for  nights in ember  Positives  Clean comfortable and nicely furnished hotel room   Bathrooms were ently sized for NYC bathroom   Nice bath amenities   Staff were all very pleasant and friendly really great   Smaller hotel with boutique like feeling   Very reasonably priced hotel Negatives  Location is very far east so if youre in NYC to sightsee and you dont need to be on the upper east side then do not stay here  You have to take a taxi to get anywhere yes there is a bus across there street but the buses in NYC are extremely slow due to traffic and the subway stop is too far to comfortably walk tofrom  I would advise staying midtown or more central area near subway  Also the restaurants near the hotel are mediocre at best  There just isnt much to do around here   Noisy windows  Ive stayed at a number of NYC hotels over the years and most hotels are pretty quiet considering youre in NYC  For some reason both hotel rooms here were very noicsy  I could hear the noise of cars traveling on the th st  bridge and the honking from the cars on the street below  Much much too noisy I thought   NYC was experiencing some very mild weather for ember and it was sunny and gorgeous  Unfortunately the heat was on in the hotel and it was stifling and completely uncomfortable  They gave me a fan but that just blew around the hot air so it was not a relief at all  And Im the type of person that prefers hot weather  So if that happens ask for a north facing room so the sun doesnt beat down on the windows  We switched rooms and it helped  This is probably an occasional problem but when it does happen it is pretty annoying   No ice bucket or ice on the floors although you could call and ask for ice and they will send it to you  No coffee maker etc    Mini bar in room is not cold so even if you want to spend  on a coke if you open the door nothing in there is cold That was kinda annoying when youre thirsty and need something to drink  There is a gas station right next to the hotel where we picked up some cold drinks the next night I did not go to the gym or the restaurant so I cannot comment on those So overall if you need to be on the upper east side and need a basic hotel that is clean no frills hotel then I would recommend this hotel  Otherwise I would recommend that you pay a little extra and stay elsewhere more convenient to everything that NYC has to offer  
P => Fine hotel would definitely return  The Bentley is an excellent hotel and we enjoyed our stay  When we checked in the desk told us she was upgrading us to a deluxe room  We were treated to a two room quotsuite with two flat screen TVs comfortable seating and bed excellent bathroom and a great view of the skyline  The location worked for us as we were visiting a mile uptown on the east side  We were pleased overall and would stay again  Oh the walls are very thin  
P => serious problems  this hotels virtues This was my second stay in six months  While the hotel still impressed me with its friendly desk and itorial staff cleanliness spaciousness reasonable prices and views that are as nice as ever there were serious problems this time  There was no heating in the rooms in mid ober It was cold outside and the long walls of windows in my room affording the view leaked out any residual warmth  When I complained the staff gave me one of the space heaters that theyd bought for the rooms  That made my stay bearable but what kind of way is this for the ownersmanagers to run a hotelAlso the wifi service which one has to pay for and is provided by an outside vendor was slow and buggy  Sometimes it worked on the third try once it didnt work at all and required a call to their TA line and once I just gave up  This is unacceptable in the st century If these problems arent ironed out Im not sure Id return for a third time  
P => Very Pleasantly Surprised I was with my husband who traveled to NYC for business and his company put him up in the Bentley Hotel  I was really bummed at first because it was only rated as a two star hotel and in an out of the way area  Ive stayed at three star hotels in NYC that were not that nice so I was scared of what the Bentley would be like but I was very pleasantly surprised  The lobby our room and bathroom were all very modern and clean  The room had a flat screen tv and had a view of the East River amp Queensboro bridge which was quite nice  It was a much nicer view than Ive had right in midtown in pretty nice hotels  The bathroom was average size for NYC small but modern and still had plenty of room  It had glass enclosed shower which I prefer over bathtub combo with shower curtain anyway  Bed was very comfortable with nice sheets amp down or down alternative pillows  The only downside to this hotel is the location  Its in a nice quiet residential neighborhood but as a tourist I like being in the middle of everything and youre not really near anything  The closest subway was a good   block hike with only one or two lines going up that way  We just took cabs instead to avoid the hastle  If you dont mind staying out of the way the Bentley hotel was a great deal  It was one of the least expensive hotels I saw for that time period and a great deal for the price  
P => Great value for your money A little noisy since near the bridge but great room Deluxe suite 
P => Second time stil fabolous My husband and I organised a long weekend trip to NYC for ourselves and friends from the UK  I recommended the The Bentley Hotel on upper east side as I had stayed there before and loved it  I was happy to say we all loved the experience  Yes it is not in the middle of the city but you can get anywhere fairly quick  Our stay worth the money because of the friendly helpful staff AWESOME bed and comfy warm welcoming back from the front desk  I like the Bentley it feels more like a small hotel event that hotel has about  rooms  I will stay there again I start saving already for the next trip to NY  
P => Faux chic   in need of improvements After a five hour red eye from Los Angeles we were relieved to unwind in the hotel lobby  At first glance the hotel comes across chic but it soon loses its luster  For starters our deluxe upgrade was falsely advertised and featured a pull out bed in place of two double beds  The hotel was nice enough to upgrade us to a larger room however they delayed in delivering our luggage  After five hours and several phone calls to the front desk we were asked to come back down to the lobby and identify our bags At best the rooms are pleasant and comfortable but the hotel definitely lacked amenities  No ice buckets or vending machines  Coffee is limited and apparently runs out quick but the front desk insists that the coffee at the nearby gas station is just as good No free WIFI and slow connection speeds are available but overly priced  The AC was loud but necessary for our stuffy room  It broke down and had to be replaced  When that failed to cool off our room we were offered a circulating unit  The bathrooms are small and cramp but the most bizarre feature has to be the half glassed in closure that creates a mess of water all over the floor The front desk staff seems inexperienced and the concierge was non existent apparently on break both times we asked for help  Overall the location is great although the walk to shops and transportation could be inconvenient to most  
P => Great service clean rooms great price To all NY shoppersI have been staying at the Bentley Hotel NY several times but last time I finally made up my mind why I would not stay anywhere else but at the Bentley  I had a small situation where maid misplaced small shopping bag from hora  Management and folks and the desk including General Manager went above and beyond to take care of the issue  I am grateful for this  There are many good Hotels probably  stars or so and i stayed there too  But at the Bentley you feel special they care for your needs upgrade if they have better rooms available manager calls you throughout a stay and check if you satisfied  This is great Hotel i would definitely recommend to all my friends and colleagues and will always stay at the Bentley when in NY  
P => Very nice but not so close to     It was a lovely hotel very clean and modern  Staff very nice  There is an ice machine but no ice buckets in your room   you have to either call front desk for one to be brought to your room or you can get a bag only from front desk  That is the only odd thing I can say about the hotel and I felt a bit demanding asking for an ice bucket being brought to my room so I went the other option lol The location is lovely right on the river and we had fantstic views but it was not close that close to  touristy things but it is still all walkable Another tip   if you are parking pay at the hotel when chcking out   it is a lot cheaper then paying the car park company  
P => Nice surprise  Would definitely stay again Booked this place use credit card points so were expecting a bit of a dive   but was a great hotel  Nice rooms and would definitely consider staying here again  Was also relatively quiet expecially considering its location at the bridge entryexit Stayed with an infant and plenty of room for our travel cot etc Slight downside is the the staff seemed a little slow   deep queue to check out and   minute wait for someon to come and collect our bags  
P => Fantastic Bedrooms I stayed in the Bentley for  nights the staff and the rooms were great  The rooms were a great size the beds really comfortable incredibly clean  very good nights sleep  The staff were all really helpful  Great location  A couple of good bars and sushi restaurants less than a  minute walk away  The only negative do not bother with the rooftop bar dreary atmosphere and the worst cocktails in New York dont let this put you off the hotel  
P => Excellent value We live three blocks from the Bentley which is why we chose it while our apt  underwwent repairs  We were pleasantly suprised when upon a late check in we were told that we had been upgraded to a jr  suite  It was wonderful  modern spacious and with a superb East River view  It had a plasma tv a radio with IPod dock bathrobes slippers iron and board umbrella and an extremely confortable bed all in a modern  tasful or  Even in a very hot   spell the AC was fine  Some might find the location a bit too far East it is after all in a residential neighborhood but a bus right outside on York Avenue takes you across town on th St one of the citys major arteries and a a convenient connection for other buses or subways The restaurant was very convenient for breakfast and if not there is a Starbucks a block away as well as several restaurants  The restaurant would be my only complaint as it was dated  However it closed for two days during our stay for reations  Ive been meaning to take a walk there to see how it turned out  I am curious becaue it could be an incredible place with its beautiful views all around a great place for a glass of wine Minor minor complaint is the lighting in the trendy hallways is a bit too low  
P => Good option in Upper East Side I was pleasantly surprised at this hotel especially after reading some of the reviews on this site  The room was nicely orated and overall a great stay  The satellite TV worked in my room and Im glad for it because I woke up with a cold one morning and had to stay in for awhile  Some things that kinda bugged me the AC is loud theres almost no way to keep the bathroom floor dry when you take a shower because of the shower wall setup and the elevators are indeed SLOW  But the neighborhood is quiet on the lower end of the upper east side and is a nice walk to the subway station I prefer to walktake the train in NYC you see so many interesting things  You can tell that this was an older building that was remodeled but that didnt bother me too much  Plus I got a killer nightly rate because it was on the exact opposite side of Manhattan from the th of y fireworks  If youre looking to stay in the upper east side area I would recommend this hotel  
P => Very nice hotel for good price My  year old granddhter and I just returned from a  night stay at the Bentley Hotel and we were so pleasantly surprised  I booked this reservation on the computer and got a very inexpensive rate for the night  Id already booked the room and was into the Cancellation Period when I read som of the reviews and was concerned  On check in Jennifer greeted us at the desk and she was incredibly nice and helpful  I asked about an Upgrade and was immediately given one to a lovely corner ior Suite on the th floor  The room was clean nicely furnished and had lovely views  The air conditioning was rather noisybut it did drown out some of the street noises  Others have mentioned about the shower having an unmovable glass door that only extends half way and this is a problem as the floor does get wet  That evening we went upstairs to the restaurant on the top floor and had a delicious snack with nice views  As we didnt expect to stay in the hotel for  nightswe checked out in the morning  Later in the day I learned that we would need to stay in NYC another night and I called the hotel to see if they could acccommodate us for another night  They connected me to a quotreservation linequot and I was informed that the price of the room was substantially higher  I explained that I was there due to a family member being in Hospital for Special Surgery and they then offered a   discount  It was still substantially higher than the right beforebut when we returned to check in again we were Upgraded to a quotDeluxe Suitequot with  rooms which was very nice  The hotel was quiet very clean and well maintained with comfortable beds  The employees were very polite and friendly and offered us information on sightseeing   For us the location was excellent and I would recommend the hotel in the future if I needed to be in that area  
P => Wonderful I loved the hotel  the location is great  the staff very friendly and helpful  the price not too high for Manhattan  I will repeat next time I go to NYC 
P => Money well spent This is a fantastic hotel  Its in a really good area  The staff are really friendly and helpful  When i arrived they upgraded me which was so lovely of them  I had the best view from my room  The room was very clean and comfortable  Value for your money  
P => Very Pleasant Surprise We had booked this hotel as part of a package and didnt look at the reviews until after booking we almost changed hotels  We didnt and are very glad we took our chances  The staff was extremely friendy and obliging  Only possible negative comment it is a long walk to get to the major shopping areas but the neighbourhoods are well worth it  No coffee maker in the room but the bed was so comfortable and the room was big in comparison to the last hotel I stayed at in NYC  Great little diner just a short walk away for early morning breakfast My advise stay there it is well worth it 
P => Lovely hotel but desk staff not friendly i thought this hotrl was great very clean and affordable okay location as it is in walking distance of goof food and drink and bloomingdales  only a couple of blocks away from th avenune but its a nice walk there  
P => Great Hotel at a Bargain price My boyfriend and I spent a week at the Bentley Hotel at the start of e and managed to get a bargain at   per night On the Southern Tip of the Upper East Side The Bentley is located in a very safe and lovely neighbourhood and its  position right on the river made for fantastic views  The nearest subway station was a  minute walk away and there is a bus stop that takes you across town right outside the hotel We requested a room on a high floor for a more peaceful nights sleep in advance and when we arrived not only did we get our high floor but we were upgraded to a suite The suite was spotless and had everything we needed with the exception of a few extra hangars in the wardrobeThe staff couldnt do enough for us and everyone from the front desk to the maintenance guys were very friendly All in all The Bentley has everything you need for a perfect trip to NYC  
P => Wonderful Hotel I stayed in NYC for the BEA expo at the Javits and I must say I loved the hotel very much  I would stay again  
P => Loved the Hotel  This was my second stay and it was even better than the first  The room was clean and available early for me to check in  The room service was great very reasonable priced for New York  The front desk was very helpful and friendly  I will definally be staying here again  
P => Fantastic  highly recommended Simple elegant very clean fantastic value  Excellent service comfortable bed lovely linens beautiful view of Queensboro Bridge  
P => Good option for NYC   I would stay again Pros beautiful room great views comfortable bed the double fit two friends comfortably good access clean everything convenient to restaurants try Luscious Thai  block up on st ave   amazing starbucks and a short walk to subway shopping and the Roosevelt Island Tram with a GREAT evening view of Manhattan  Cabs were convenient because its right beside a cab refuelling station Cons inexperienced front desk staff not many servicesamenities from the hotel side ie the bar fridge wasnt an actual fridge there were no vending machines or ice and the walk from the hotel to shopping and subway would be long in bad weather  Walking distance to UN subway Central Park th avenue shops Roosevelt Island Tram  Columbia Presbyterian hospital Museum Mile Our stay was a bit atypical because we got the wheelchair accessible room for me   which was HUGE After some paranoia on the part of my traveling companion we were very worried about what our hotel would be like but we were pleased to find a beautiful clean fashionable room with a standard FullDouble bed no special quotNYC sizingquot here and standard hotel room amenities  I found the front desk staff to be cheery and friendly but a bit inexperienced  We had our keys cancelled one evening late at night and couldnt get into our room   simply because they had swiped my credit card wrong and needed to do it again  This seemed a bit of an overreaction to me  This hotel has been reated recently so TA readers should understand that many of the older reviews  pertain to the hotel pre reno and pre rebranding  It now has a very mod boutique look and bright white sheets which gave us the feeling that it was clean and comfortable and it was  Reviewers who complain about location and noise obviously never lived in a city   subway shopping food and sights are within a  block walk small blocks  Noise   well I think youd have trouble finding anything quiet in NYC We feared noise from the FDR expressway next door but the noise was actually from the cabs at the intersection instead  My friend used earplugs to sleep I didnt and both of us were comfortable  
P => Suprisingly Wonderful I had read the reviews about the noise and the highway and all the complaints and we found nothing to complain about  We stayed in the ADA room and found that there was only one minor issue of the closet bar being too high traditional height  As to the noise   there are two things to consider   one it is a busy city   and the noises are all related to that   so yes there are going to be taxis honking sirens and the such like so if thats an issue to you then bring earplugs   as to the FDR the noise doesnt come from there   you dont even hear that standing outside the hotel  Location   its within walking distance to the subway and major bus routes and we walked just about everywhere   to the UN Central Park Metropolitan Museum took the Rosevelt Island Tram and so on   the location while not perfectly convenient in the sense that you dont leave the hotel door and find yourself on th Ave or in the middle of traffic from Grand Central was wonderful for us  We enjoyed the restaurants on that side of town at the end of the day out and then would walk back to the hotel  There is a wonderful Thai restaurant about  blocks from the hotel that we would have eaten at each night  As to the room itself it was clean well kept daily and as a whole while there wasnt a huge channel selection on the TV thats not why youre in NYC is itThe service was adequate they recommended a pizza place for us to order in one night and as a whole were friendly and helpful Only suggestions would be wireless access and a more affordable option for procuring an additional fridge   we would have appreciated being able to store some less available dietary options for emergency purposes  
P => Scoring  B   for Bentley Needed upper east side location close to Hunter College for a graduation    also had rendezvousing out of towners wandering in from Brooklyn so the Bentley got the nod over the Fitzpatrick Lombardy Kimberly or Affinia  We were told the property is actually a converted office tower but with WORLD HOTELS branding and a sweet spot view of the East River and Roosevelt Island at about  per nite Most of the TA comments and the   ranking are spot on     you can do somewhat better in room sizes subway access and overall refinements but you will likely have trade offs in the choices  For example we drove up with our car so off street parking at less than a small ransome was a priority       per nite was the tarriff and albeit there is no valet and the garage is actually a private operation at the opposite end of the block you will do no better anywhere in NYC  The rooftop bar restaurant was more bohemian than minimalist and lacking in the usual trendy accoutrements    but six cocktails and two beers were only  again a more than reasonable tarriff for the take  Our northeast corner room had great floor to ceiling windows but irregular soffets and wall offsets are prevalent and narrow the walking space to somba swivel clearances around the furniture and bed  Check in was uneventful and quick enough but we arrived relatively late on a Wednesday nite and through the two day stay there appeared to be no shortage of lines and problems at the desk  NOTE to Management one clerk for  rooms is obviously NOT a best practice We score the quotB quot for Bentley priily based on the above tainted by a substandard bathroom and notable annoyances  The  square foot bathroom is a disaster on every front there is no ventilation whatsoever to the point that the wooden door has swelled and cant be closed     and even with it open the room mists up like a sauna the pedestal sink is so tiny the small soap dish constantly falls in the basin the half curtain glass in the shower does indeed keep HALF the water IN and HALF the water OUT on the floor and the toilet bowl protrudes in front of the doorway which is always a pleasant site entering the room  NOTE to Management install an exhast fan in the shower before the drywall ceiling comes down change the swing on the bathroom door so you can hide the view and buy a shower curtain The rest of the annoyances are correctible but include horrible tv reception ridiculously slow elevators problematic room keycards   the sole maintenance guy was running all over the hotel letting people in their rooms which left us waiting forever to get in ours and last but not least noisey and unrefined guests yelling in the hallways and making prank calls  Yes this is NYC and folks tend let it all hang out here but we expected better manners after midnite on a Thursday for upper east side visitors Bottom line if you dont have to park a car and are not targeting a specific spot on the upper east side there are better choices for comparable dollars especially if you are coming in with luggage   the Lexington Ave subway is a  block walk    TIP use st St as there are some really cool household furnishings stores  Otherwise for more than a couple nights consider the Affina or Kimberly     or for extended stays there are many vacation rental properties in the area that are a better value  
P => a mixed experience Contrary to previous reviews the staff was very friendly and helpful  The room was clean and there was little noise from outside  The bed was comfortable  On the down side the Hotel is out of the way  I had to go crosstown a lot and the crosstown bus was slower than walking  The other negative was the air conditioner which was extremely loud however when I turned it off the room became unbearably stuffy  The internet at  was outrageously priced No fitness center but they have a deal where you can go to a nearby club for   The Hotel is practically in the East River but there are still restaurants and stores within a few blocks  
P => The concierge location is lacking     Nice clean hotel but the location is lacking  Too close to the hwy and too far removed from everything  David the concierge is rude and not helpful  I called him to get suggestions for dinner and he barked at me and said he was very busy  Sorry for bothering you  If you dont like your job you should go work somewhere else  
P => Nice Place Great Value I was in NYC for one night to see Van Morrison at MSG  I didnt feel like like breaking the bank on a hotel and the Bentley was an inexpensive choice  The room was very clean and pretty stylish in a sort of faux modern Asian way and the bed was incredibly comfy  The hotel is just slightly out of the way but certainly still reasonably close enough to many attractions  My only complaint would be that the tv did not seem to work properly but who wants to watch tv when youre in New York anyway 
P => Clean pleasant quality hotel  This is a good hotel Very clean room pleasant and helpful staff comfortable room great bed  Shower had terrific water pressure  Two cross town buses stop right by the hotel  I would stay there again  
P => Great Spot Any complaints posted obviously have not stayed in NYC before My hubby and I stayed at the Bentley for three nights  We did not get upgraded to a suite but did get a room on the top floor below the restaurant  The room was very clean and so was the bathroom although they could use a good dusting in the corners  The bathroom was stocked with shampoo lotion etc and also a good working hair dryer was supplied  There was lots of hot water but the water pressure was a bit poor we were very high up though  The tv is a plasmalcd but some of the channels were not great for reception no big deal for us  We ordered a movie one night for  bucks  The restaurant has a wonderful view but the menu didnt appeal to us so we didnt eat there  Front desk crew were great to us including calling us right after check in to make sure we were happy with our room  Parking was  bucks a night and rekable to have parking onsite in NYC  We were thrilled  No issues  The hotel is in a very safe part of NYC and we walked at night with little worry  The hotel is about five blocks from the closest subway th and Lexington so a bit of a walk but that is what you do in NYC  We walked to Rockerfeller Center and it took less than  minutes  One restaurant that we HAVE to mention is Espressos Caffe at  st Avenue www expressoscaffe com  You MUST go there  It is only one block from the hotel and Francesca and her staff will serve you the most amazing pasta and bread  The prices are so amazing and portion sizes are overwhelming  We ate there two nights and brought it back to the hotel which they packed with plates cutlery parm cheese etc  They spoiled us rotten and they will be our first visit in our future trips to NYC  Francesca if you read this keep up the fight with cancer we plan on seeing you NEXT year Make sure you get the garlic bread   a full loaf of the most amazing crusty italian bread with moist middle  Yummy All in all the Bentley is wonderful and we would stay again  We paid  CDN a night and lucked out for sure  I have stayed at other hotels in Manhattan and we paid more and got much less  
P => Good hotel but keep an eye on the front desk clerks Just got back from NY   went to a game at the new Yankee Stadium and stayed overnight at the Bentley on nd Street  Really this is a pretty ok hotel not four star but relatively clean and comfortable and reasonably priced for a NYC hotel  It has that European feel to it   moderately dingy in an old school charming sort of way  Location is ok   a little off the beaten path  ent neighborhood Upper East Side is nice what else can you say but the hotel is a fair walk away from the nearest subway  The only complaint I have is that the clerks at the desk were all young and a little condescending and not in a good way  At one point I got on the elevator in the lobby and there was a yellow cone in front of the elevator door that said quotwet floor quot I got on and pushed the button for my floor and waited and stood and waited and nothing happened  After awhile I gave up and stepped back out in the lobby and the terrifically professional clerks behind the front desk were lhing and one of them called out to us that we were on the service elevator  Ha ha lh it up Chuckles  Could have told me no Oh that would have required a hint of customer service  To top it off I got a notification this morning that my credit card   the one I used at the hotel which was the only time I used it in NY was being cancelled and replaced because it had been quotcompromisedquot by quotfraudulent activity quot Gee I wonder how that happened Anyway I would recommend the hotel to you just keep an eye on the children behind the desk  And whatever you do unless you just happen to be into humiliation dont get on the service elevator  
P => Nice Place I have stayed at the Bentley a handful of times for business but I also combine it with a few days of leisure here and there  I really like the location for business meetings  I love walking one block and having several great places to eat all in a row  The bar upstairs has beautiful views and is a great place to hang out  The rooms are boutique like and modern  When I visit NY to see Broadway shows I recomend Times Square but this is a great location in the Upper East Side  People have give the Bentley mixed reviews but I have only had positive experiences and would recommend it  
P => Good Hotel   Good Location Just stayed at the Bentley  Good clean hotel  Rooms are nice but the walls are thin Nice neighbourhood  Superket shops within a short walking distance  Bus stop accros the road  Street noise levels at night not as bad as on the West Side  Ill be back  
P => Great Place IT was Great  My Husband and I Stayed there for  days the room was not too big but great for us  The only thing was that we coundnt order any movies  they were having problems with that  On the top floor there is a great restaurant and THE VIEW is wonderful  The service was great they were friendly and helpful  Would stay again   
P => Surprisingly good boutique hotel  Upper East Side We stayed at The Bentley E  nd and York last weekend  This is a little undiscovered gem and very reasonable rates  be its the location but it was perfect for us  Nice room linens view  Very serene environment simple modern look pleasant desk and door staff  Our only complaint was that they charge extra for internet     otherwise a great place to stay for either work or pleasure  
P => Great value   small issues We stayed at the Bentley this past weekend for  nights  Overall it was great value  per night plus taxes and fees    which made up for most of the small issues we had to deal with  First although wed booked three weeks in advance and asked for a room on the upper floors with a view we were put in a room on the second floor with a view on the charming building across the street  The staff mumbled something about damage done to a number rooms as an excuse for it  For the second night we were then promised a room on the upper floors the hotel has some  floors as well as an upgrade  Well when we came back the next evening we discovered that we were in an identical room on the th floor  No upgrade whatsoever but the room had some problems with its heaters  It wasnt a big deal but somewhat annoying  I guess you can expect only so much for a hundred bucks   On the positive side the rooms were spacious and clean  The bed was very comfortable the bathroom clean and large enough with a great hot shower  Also we had a glass of wine at the bar on the st floor in the evening great view for   not bad at all for NYC  Some people complained about the location and that it was too far out from what  Well I guess that depends on what you call far and what your preferred mode of transportation is  We enjoyed the  min walk through the city from Times Square as well as the  to  min from the hot spots on Fifth Ave  The south entrance of Central Park is also within  min and we took a great walk in the sun over there on Saturday morning  
P => Clean comfy mod  with good parking We stayed at the Bentley over Valentines day weekend expecting it to be a madhouse  Not only was it quiet but the hotel was basically ours We had basically no wait for elevators breakfast etc  The hotel is all the way on the east side of the city so getting places is a little tricky if youre time crunched or dont know the city well but there was always a cab at the cab stand and access to the FDR makes getting down  and uptown easy The or is modern not Hudson Hotel modern but nice and comfy  Lovely views  Fun weekend away for a couple not looking for anything overly fancy  Totally walkable to Central Park and some good brunch spots  A solid find for a great price check Expedia  
P => nice trip to a great city we love the hotel great bedverry clean and nice staff 
P => Dreary good deal I brought my  and  yo girls and my wife in for the week end to see a show  The deal we got on Hotels com was very good for NYC and the rooms were spacious  I continue to have problems with the orating style that seems to be favored when I go to NY dark minimalist cold  The desk staff was somber or is that just NY coolaloof enough without the black outfits and matching black walls with silver accents but entering the whole gestalt felt more like a mortuary than a fun hotel  But I digress  After some confusion about the validity of our reservation we were upgraded and treated well by the staff  They were helpful all the way along getting us info about Central Park carriage rides best place for breakfast not recommended by them but by us Alices Teacup on th and Lex  As I mentioned the rooms were big by NY standards and there were chairs and views  The rooms need some work though  Our couchs arms were worn through almost to the stuffing and there were rips in the cushions  The cushions on the girls couch had big stains of the type that made you not want to sit there  We all found the beds very hard  The barrestaurant has a good view and the drinks are reasonable  bucks for a Sam Adams as compared to  bucks in the mini bar Id recommend The Ritz Diner on nd and First Ave  for morning coffee or a basic breakfast good portions and ent prices  Across the street from the Ritz is a restaurant called Merchants  We had amazingly cheap dessert there   per person which was terrific and would have gone back for a dinner had we stayed another night as the prices were incredibly reasonable  A big plus is the cheap parking only  day Unheard of in Manhattan  And the hotel is located in a great place for driving in and out right on the ramp to FDR Northsouth  While the blocks adjacent to the Bentley are not very pretty within a few blocks there are nice stretches to walk and enjoy the neighborhood  
P => Great Deal on Nice NYC Hotel My husband and I went to NYC for a quick weekend in ruary   We booked the Bentley for one night with Expedia at  per night for a standard room  We checked in an Saturday and were upgraded to a suite without even asking  The room was modern and spacious with two flat screen TVs and lots of seating  We had a corner room on the th floor with large windows to let in lots of sun  The bedroom had french doors leading to it and a very comfy bed  The bathroom was a little small with almost no counter space but it was clean and we didnt need much room  On Sunday morning the hairdryer broke as I was finishing my hair  We called the desk and they had a new one brought up and installed within ten minutes  The staff was very nice and I would definitely stay here again  Only drawback is the location  It is a walk to the subway and far from most tourist sights  But if you dont mind walking we dont you should be pleased with your stay  Finally if you go be sure to have lunch at the Serendipity Cafe just a few blocks from the hotel on th bw nd and rd  Get the Frozen Cot Chocolate YUM 
P => Great stay I stayed at the Bentley for  days with my girlfriend at room  in mid uary and I was so delighted with our stay  After reading some bad reviews here I was a bit sceptical so I called the hotel some weeks ahead and asked for a good room with view of the brigde and hudson and we got itAlready at check in we felt very welcome by both the doorman and the front desk  They followed us to a great room with a fantastic view as promised  The room was more then big enough for us the bed was okey and a plus for the flat screen  The only drawback was the bathroom with a toilet who didnt flush all the time and refilled water and a problem with the hot water in the shower but you sort it out by just letting it stay on for a while  And be aware of the mini  bar remember their second rule by removing items  We didnt discover before after a couple of days that the previous guest had actually eaten up the whole pringles without removing it St guy But we didnt have to pay for it thanks to the kind front desk girl   The corridors is a bit dark but thats really not a problem  A small drewback was also that the tv could offer any pay tv sports channel for watching NFL or NHL Yes the hotel is a bit quotfar awayquot if you could say that about new york but its only a dollar candrive from empire state and the area felt really safe  We walked everyday to to around Time square and started our day from there  Its a nice min walk  Nearby you also got a some avenues with great shopping  We had some problem the first days by finding a place to buy some fruit candy and so on but theres a small shop on  av m from Bentley and theres a big superket under the brigde on the same avenue as the hotel  You also find a small and expensive internet cafe on rd ave  But MOST important on th ave youll find RITZ prob the best diner on manhatten Its a classic american diner open hours serving gigantic portions of food The service is above everything the food is lovely and its so cheap  dollars for  persons Talking about food if your in CHINATOWN find Big Wong  It prob got the best soup in the world but watch out this place gets really crowdy Forget it in the weekends  If you want cheap hockey tickets go to the official page for the club and buy them on quotticket exchangequot but if your going to an islandrs match be prepared for a long and expensive journey  The train from Pen station takes  hour till your stop and from there its an min taxitrip  get a real taxi not one of the pirates outside the train station we paid dollars and remember if you buy return for the train get to the right station we took another taxi to the wrong station because he said it was the right one  When your leaving the match its impossible to find a taxi walk to the hotel nearby they will get you a taxiBut I really recommend Bentley we will come back in the summerPS new york in uary is extremly cold we had down to   degrees it kinda set a big drawback for everything 
P => Best NYC experience What a stay   They accommodatedmy girlfriend and I on a Saturday evening and treated us like royalty from start to finish  Joking with her on the way in that I upgraded the room sure enough when I stepped up to the polite conceirge they beat me to it    giving me a complimentary suite  We walked into the zebra printed room and it had quotBoutiquequot written all over it    it made our stay there that much more special  If you want to impress without damaging your wallet the Bentley Hotel will make you feel like your driving one    and dont worry you wont even need to open your own door  
P => Nice Alternative Bentley is out of the way on the Upper East Side  It is a   block walk to main avenues but the neighborhood is very nice  The st room I got reaked of smoke It was labeled non smoking The desk clerk immediatley apologised and upgraded me to a suite  Beautiful views of the east river th St bridge the Roosevelt Island cable car and the island itself  Didnt eat there but had drinks on the rooftop bar  Very impressive and not all at expensive  We always stay downtown but could not get a room for the whole trip  The Bentley was a fine alternative  Spend the extra  for the suite or ask for an upgrade  Bigger room great views The staff were all helpful and friendly  There is traffic noise but hey youre in The Big Apple    Fuggetaboutit 
P => What a stylish hotel it was me and my husbands anniversary and I always pre plan my vacation and I try to make sure i get the best rate available  When i called the hotel to make a reservation they informed me that if we did it through there official website we would be upgraded to one of their suites  So i did just that skeptical that it wouldnt be available and sure enough i got the suite  It was a very beautiful room i was amazed by the size and the hospitality that everyone had  The front desk was amazing they treated me and my husband with respect  The room service was quick and great  The housekeepers did a great job cleaning our room every day  i would absolutely recommend booking rooms through the hotels website       
P => Loved the hotel My husband and I checked into the hotel uary th for a weekend away  What a great place The rooms were clean the staff friendly and the restaurant served a great meal  The rooms are cheap for New York City also  
P => Bad aftertaste from the Bentley On the th ember my family and I checked into the Bentley Hotel part of the Amsterdam Hospitality Group of Hotels  East nd Street NYC  My family consists of a  year old Computer Consultant my wife a  year old School Teacher my dhter a  Year Old Sabbatical University President and my son a  year old schoolchild  We had flown from our home in the United Kingdom for a short break in New York  It s not the first time that we have been in New York nor the first time that we have been in the United States in fact we have travelled extensively for both business and pleasure to the United Sates and many other locations around the World  It was a memorable stay for many good and one really bad reason  The really bad reason was because we chose yes chose to stay at the Bentley When we checked in we were given two rooms one which was suitable for my wife and me and one which was not suitable for my son and dhter because it only contained one bed  Reception advised us that we could convert the sofa in our room to a bed and that they would move my children the very next morning  Reception were as good as their word the next morning they moved my children to a twin bedded room  Unfortunately it smelt of tobacco smoke  I went down to reception and advised them of the smell because I did not want to be charged the advertised penalty of  for having the room cleaned following our departure  Although the room smelt I told them that it was not a major issue and there was no need to move again for which the Receptionist thanked me for my understanding We had a wonderful time in New York  we engaged in some sightseeing some retail therapy and ate and drank well we even Ice Skated in central park which was truly magical  As usual the people were warm friendly and very helpful in fact everything that we have come to expect and have experienced on all of our other trips to the United States We returned to the United Kingdom on th ember after having settled our hotel bill On the th uary I received my ember Mastercard statement which contained a charge from the Bentley Hotel for   Once my wife had scraped me down from the ceiling me having assumed that the charge was for cleaning the room that my children had occupied and that somehow Reception had forgotten the discussion that I d had with regarding the smell of tobacco smoke I ided to pursue the matter  Incidentally at this stage I should point out that neither my wife nor my dhter nor my son have ever smoked and whilst I was once a social leper I renounced tobacco some  years ago and have not smoked since I immediately phoned my credit card issuer and after a discussion initiated a dispute procedure that is being pursued up by their Fraud Department as the transaction was conducted without either my approval knowledge or presence  I then phoned the Bentley at premium day time international rates and attempted to have a conversation regarding the charge  First I spoke to the receptionist who put me on hold for     minutes whilst she attempted to get hold of the Front Desk Manager  Eventually she took my number and promised that she would get the Front Desk Manager to call me  No one called so I sent a detailed e mail however just like the call no one replied to my e mail  So the following morning I sent a detailed fax incorporating the content of the previous days e mail After many hours the Font Desk Manager eventually phoned unfortunately I was out at the time so my wife took the call  Apparently the charge had nothing to do with room cleaning it was for the disappearance of a Radio Alarm Clock complete with iDOCK from the room that my children had occupied  The fact that the item was missing had been reported by Hotel Housekeeping incidentally the same Hotel Housekeeping that had allowed a room that smelled strongly of tobacco smoke to be occupied by non smoking guests A first discussion with the Front Desk Manager and a subsequent conversation with the Hotel Manager revealed an implicit accusation of theft of the Radio Alarm by me or one of my party  In fact the Hotel Manager vigorously defended her action in charging my card because I had supposedly signed a waiver that allowed her to charge me should anything be found to be missing from the rooms occupied by my party  So by default we were guilty of theft  When I pointed out to her that it was highly unlikely that I or any member of my party would have stolen a  piece of tat that was unlikely to function in the UK because of different power supply and plug standards or run the risk of arrest at the airport she said that the matter had been resolved as they had refunded the  dollars  I made it quite clear that whilst they  have made a refund the unfounded accusations of theft were very far from resolved  In the same conversation there was no contrition nor any mention of any recompense for the wrongful accusation the trouble the trauma the cost of international call and fax all that I received form the Hotel Manager by way of apology or recompense was  I m sorry that you are so bitter about this incident but we have refunded the charge  Have a nice day I m sure that it won t come as a surprise to most sane people but here in the UK people are assumed to be innocent until proven to be guilty  If I was guilty as charged then the Hotel probably did have the right to charge my card  However as there is no guilt on my part or my family s they acted unlawfully in charging my card without any authority whatsoever  They didn t even have the ency to try and contact me before they took my money Am I mad You bet I m mad  Am I going to try and do something about it You bet I am  Firstly I tried to have an e mail dialogue with the Managing Director of the Amsterdam Hospitality Chain one Nejib Ayed but although he has opened  read my e mails he has not afforded me the courtesy of a reply  I m also discussing the matter with my legal advisor as we speak so depending on when you read this things  have moved on  Now what advice would I give anyone who is contemplating staying in the Bentley At least ensure that you make a detailed inventory of the room contents before you sign anything and get Housekeeping Services and Reception to countersign it  Scrutinise the detail of anything that you do sign before you sign it just in case you unwittingly give licence to the Hotel make charges against your credit card  And bye the bye the walls are paper thin so you hear everything from neighbouring rooms and eat out because the food in the restaurant is not good value when contrasted with the quality and value for money offered in all manner of local restaurants   Based on my experience of the Bentley how likely do you think I would stay in or recommend one of the Amsterdam Hospitality Group HotelsWill we travel in the United States again Of course we will because excluding the above episode time spent in the US is full of really great family memories  PS Although I was promised a full refund their repayment has left me even further out of pocket which I will add to the bill for compensation for the false accusation the hurt the cost of calls and faxes and the inconvenience  
P => The Bentley is good   with few improvements needed The Bentleys location on York ave  is more convenient than I had thought    minute walk from Lex subway station  The hotel is very pleasantly designed and the room we were given was essentially a small suite   beautifully orated  Staff was pleasant and helpful bed was ultra comfortable and overall it was a great stay The minuses  several things didnt work properly   room keys had to be coded  times with the aid of a technician to finally work one morning there was no hot water the elevators are horribly slow and badly programmed one goes up while the two others are doing nothing while youre waiting at the lobby for  minutes for it to come down  Air conditionerheater in the room is very noisy  The windows albeit beautiful are not enough to suppress the noise from the street   and thats especially problematic on the lower floors we were on the th  
P => all elevators broken and no hot water checked in and discovered all elevators broken for  hours also lack of hot water for over  hours  The hotel would not give us a discount beautiful hotel but basic service unavailable 
P => Hummm Just returned from a weekend stay at the Berkley  This hotel has a lot to recommend   our third floor rooms were larger than I expected very clean sleek and modern without being sterile with comfortable beds and large flat screen tvs  The location is about a  cab ride to either the theater district or the Metropolitan Museum or a very pleasant walk if time weather and your comfort permit  HOWEVER this hotel has MAJOR maintenace problems  Forget about using the elevators   pray for a lower level room cause youll be using the stairs  At one point all of the elevators were non functioning for an entire day  Then there was the day okayentire morning when the hotel had no hot water so no one could shower  Our room was cosily warm when we checked in but the heater ac unit never worked again after I turned it off when it became too warm  The television in one of our two rooms didnt work  All of the guests that we met were either lhing about the lack of maintenance or considering law suits  Rooms dont have but could really use coffee machines since the restaurant is on the st floor quite a hike up those stairs and the nearest coffee source is  blocks away  I really hope that management can get the major bugs worked out because the hotel is very pleasant but could have been extremely uncomfortable on a longer stay or if we had been on a higher floor  
P => absolutely loved theBentley Hotel Definetly go back again I stayed at the hotel in y  and found it excellent i travelled with  other girls and initially when checking in had some mix up re bookings although was sorted quite efficiently and got an excellent room with an amazing view of Brooklyn bridge to compensate usRooms are VERY clean with very comfortable beds and extra clean bathrooms The breakfast is not much to write home about although there are many diners around we recommend the Ritz diner which is one block away from the hotel  The only down side was the location of the hotel you have to walk around  blocks to get to the nearest subway station  Which was a mission in the blazing sun as we went when it was extremely hot The staff are all great and very helpful and genuine over all a great place to stay in NY  I would definetly go back there 
P => Bentley More like a Ford Stayed for three days in the Bentley over the Halloween weekend  definately advise anyone to go at this time the parade was something else a million or so girls dressed up like tarts  Its a  ride from JFK fixed price for anywhere in Manhatten and takes  minutes or so The hotel is right next to the only petrol station on the Island or so it seems which is handy for fags phonecards snacks The hotel itself has a very modern styled lobby with concierge lovely doorstaff  Sam is the Man who take your bags to the room remember the dollar bills for tips  Our room was  which was a twin double  It was small by US standards but normal for us Europeans  It had a new plasma telly nice and wonderful power shower and orated in the now ubiquitous quotboutiquequot style i e  no substanceWent up to the rooftop terrace bar during the day a complete waste of time as it didnt open till pm  The views were amazing but the room was scruffy and dirty better off at nighttime as the place is lit with candles and you cant really see the faded fixtures   dollars for  tinis thoughDidnt eat in the hotel went instead to the Ritz diner one block up When will Americans learn that the bullet hard greasy bacon strips they have are really foul Have the Irish breakfast instead it was good but refuse the potatoes like a re fried sunday dinnerI have been to the States on a few occasions now and I have to say that they have a cheek berating British food the only ent things they do are burgers try Wendys for the Baconator  calories but dont ask for a large coke unless you can drink half a gallon in one sitting  Went to one Italian on th and nd a real sopranos kinda place asked for the steak sinatra rare  Got a fridge  cold blue steak  When I asked for it to be warmed through at least you would have thought Id just taken a dump on ground zero The only ent meal we had was in the Olive garden on Times Square Opposite the Ritz diner and one block up was the baker street bar one of the best we went into in Manhatten it shows the premiership on the telly  One problem throughout the island was the poor quality of beer  Without a doubt I had perhaps the  worst pints of my life here  Every bar has Stella on drht but all the bars serve it completely flat with no head or bubbles  At  a pint it wasnt cheap either  When we said that it should be fizzy like champagne it was like wiping my bum on the stars and stripes the looks it garnered  Irish barmen of New York i e  all of them  you wouldnt drink this     at home dont serve it hereWent on the helicopter tour which was brilliant but pricey and the Empire State building tour  pay the extra for the map and audio tour In short Manhatten would be great if it wasnt so bloody expensive and full of bloody Yanks  Full of fit chicks though who all go out with the oddest looking men ever must be loaded  There are many better cities in Europe even grotty old London beats it hands down and Barcelona destroys it and even in the US Chicago is cooler  P s  dont fly with Delta no free booze aged trolley dollies average age  horrid food tiny seats made from cast iron and they overbooked the return flight they offered a free night at the hotel at JFK business class seat and  dollars in flight vouchers for those who would miss the flight  I would have but the vouchers could only be used on Delta so no thanks 
P => Hotel is four star out of five  service is two The hotel itself is very nice with an excellent location and chic lobby  My room was clean nicely appointed comfy bed with a gorgeous view of the city and river  The doormen were very professional and friendly  They did a great job     stars for them However I found the rough around the edges front desk staff cold and unwelcoming  They all seemed very unhappy frowning   no smiles   and not as polished as the staff of hotels I have stayed at in my travels throughout the world including many times to NYC  Just yesterday while we were checking out I witnessed a man who asked the concierge about getting a cab to the airport   the young man at the desk concentrating on his ipod barley looked up and snapped quotask a doormanquot   end of conversation back to the ipod he went  I too experienced Motel  behavior from the front desk staff  one word answersresponses minimal eye contact tension amongst the crew etc  There is hope for the Bentley   it has a lot going for it the front desk staff just needs to reflect the quality of the rest of the hotel  
P => The worst stay of my life Booked a quotdeluxequot room for a three night business trip  On being given the wrong room the first night they said they would move me next day which i begrudginglu accepted  Next day came and they refused to move me   the most unhelpful and rude staff i have ever encountered and i travel a lot including to many other NY hotels  They were just not interested in what the customer said and would do nothing to help me  The room was very poor value for money aside from it being the wrong one the reception staff still leave me seething now and overall did their best to ruin my trip  There are hundreds of other great hotels in Manhattan avoid this one at all costs  
P => Odd set up I had to go to NYC for a short trip and all midtown hotels were unavailable or overpriced so I stayed here  Its all the way east right near the river but the neighborhood is safe and its not too far from the subway  The lobby and the staff looked Euro chic so I was excited about what the room might look like  But it was strange   oddly shaped and it looked like they couldnt quite figure out how to accommodate the furniture  The king size bed was very nice but the old fashioned microwave and mini refrigerator were relics of some small town motel  I had a view of the th Street but I couldnt get the blinds to open all the way  And I didnt like that the shower was open  There was glass but it wasnt a door and it didnt slide and no matter how carefully I tried to shower the water did splash out of the tub and wet the floor  Not very practical  
P => Its a fine choice for YOU Stayed here    Was upgraded to a ior suite which started our trip out nicely  The room was nice and clean and the water pressure in the shower great  My only real complaint with this hotel was that there was NO hot water to shower in at  A M  on Saturday  That and there are no fart fans in the bathrooms  I hate that The rooftop bar free hand pours stiffies  The view is awesome from the outdoor lanai in all directions  degrees  The area is totally safe at all hours  No its not a five star hotel  But come on if you want that you are going to PAY And why This place will suit you just fine  My wife and I are upper class people and Im telling you this place is a good deal  The staff were all super nice and helpful  The hotel contracts with a company that provides a black Lincoln town car limo which took us back to JFK for a flat rate of   You cant beat that with a big stick Next time I will try to arrange for them to pick us up when we arrive  And yes I will be looking to the Bentley for my accomodations We went to Carnegie deli split a sandwich Central Park took a nice nap with my wife on the grass to the Top of the Rock do this Rockefeller plaza St  Patricks cathedral and then the Comic Strip Comedy Club which truly had me in stiches but the drinks and food are extremely overpriced     Coronas  Crown  Nachos The next day we went to the SouthStreet Seaport to the TKTS booth  The line was somewhat long but it goes pretty fast  Had lunch at J P  Mustards which was good  Walked to Wall StreetNY Stock Exchange Trinity Episcopal Church WTC ground zero very moving and almost got into a fight with some piece of      selling blown up newspaper articles espousing that our own government blew up the world trade center buildings  Thank god my wife was with me or wed have thrown down  I was hot Walked through Battery park quotFake Rolexville and then took the Staten Island Ferry there and back to get up close to the Statue of Liberty you do   And its FREE  That night we went to see Hairspray and let me tell you it was really good   at TKTS day of  We ate at Gallaghers two doors down  They were good at getting us to the show on time Prime Rib was already cooked so no waiting  Then on to Time Square which was PACKED It was totally cool  Get this through your head Nothing is cheap in NYC  We did find however that most meals can be split my  prime rib was so big neither of us could finish our HALF  A side of mushrooms had like  shrooms in it etc All in all I loved it  The Bentley is plenty fine  I am recommending it to you  
P => No problems with The Bentley Hotel  We booked this hotel on line and then noticed mixed reviews regarding this hotel so I was a little worried that it might not be any good  No need to worry this hotel is very pleasant When we arrived we were offered a room on the th floor I asked if we could be moved to a higher floor we hadnt seen the room yet but were advised by a review on here to get a higher floor because of possible traffic noise which you will find anywhere in NY the receptionist kindly gave us the last room available which was unfortunately a twin and not a double and said that if we wanted to change our room the next evening we could but I have to say that there was no need as the room was fine  The room was on the th floor and was not too noisy and the view was a typical NY view of tower blocks which is what you expect in NY and besides who wants to sit in their hotel room all day and night in the city that never sleepsThe room was a good sized clean room with a minibar  fridge plasma television an ipod docking station  alarm clock iron ironing board and a safety deposit box  It also had two chairs and the two beds which were large and comfy especially after spending all day walkingThe bathroom was adequate and had a bath  shower  the usual amenities We were given plenty of towels and each bed had  pillows We ided not to eat at the hotel but instead to go to the Ritz Diner which is on the corner of East th and st street two blocks up from the hotel and is highly recommended for breakfast  Also try the Porto Fino bar and grill which is on  rd street between st and nd ave and serves excellent italian food Although we didnt eat at the hotel it is an essential that you check out the rooftop bar which also serves food at specific times for the amazing view of The Hudson River Queensborough bridge and the surrounding area Another plus for this hotel is the helpfullness of the staff they are all very helpful polite and friendly Ask the concierge for assistance and he will be more than happy to help you with any questions you  have including theatre tickets directions checking in for on line for flights and many other things  All in all this hotel is a very good hotel  I guess the only slight critisism I could say was that it is quite far from the centre but that wouldnt stop me from staying here again as there are plenty of cabs to use to get to where you need to go  Its also in a safe area with lots of nice restaurants nearby I recommend this hotel  
P => Extremely good New York hotel Extremely good New York hotel  Ive stayed at many different New York hotels and the Bentley has one of the best views ever I stayed on the th floor and have incredible windows that overlooked the street river and Queensboro Bridge So many N Y  hotels look out onto a brick wall but not the Bentley  The room was also large by NY standards The bar had incredible views of the city along with nice bartenders and good drinks while the front dest staff were nice and extremely helpful  They pointed us to a fantastic sushi restaurant a short walk from the hotel The only drawback was that the air conditioning unit was rather loud and you were either cold or hot but nothing in the middle  For the price location room size views and staff I would absolutely stay here again 
P => Great Stay at the Bentley My Husband and I stayed at the Bentley Hotel in ust  We arrived around pm and our room was not available so the very kind and helpful reception staff locked our suitcases in a store and gave us directions to various places to get a bite to eat  Once we got our room it had two double beds which wasnt exactly what we had asked for but it was very clean and suited us fine  The conceirge and the hotel staff were all very nice honest and helpful people and they were able to send us in the right direction for anything we were looking for  This hotel is right next to the river psat st Avenue so it not ideal for those seeking to be in the centre of the hustle and bustle of the city but if you dont mind walking a few blocks to the tourist things and you want to experience the real upper east side of New York City then this is the place for you  
P => Lovely Clean Modern Hotel Just returned from a  night stay at this hotel which was fantastic The staff were very helpful it was our honeymoon and they upgraded us to a suite for no extra charge  Very clean modern hotel about a  min walk from th Avenue and Bloomingdales  there was some building work going on opposite the hotel could be there for some time by the look of it but we never heard any noise  We never ate at the hotel restaurant so cant comment  There is teacoffee making facilities in reception  hours  Best bits Clean Modern or very helpful staffWorst Bits None 
P => both good and bad I could rant and rave   but actually it would be unfair First night we were woken by our air conditioning system going BANG CLANG and then smoke started coming out and filling the room  Also  days in a row the TV was not working and the mini bars fridge in both rooms were not working BUT BUT BUT BUT   When the air con almost exploded the Fire alarm sounded and the Staff were there within minutes they moved us straight away without any fuss  I dont believe for one second we were in any danger    and there was NO fire    yeah I know the sayingTV not working was annoying we got in late and would have been nice to relax in front of it   Again saying that you dont go to New York to watch TV which is a load of crap anyway  So it wasnt a problem Mini bars in both rooms didnt work     which was a shame but given we were rarely drinking in rooms it wasnt an issue The rooms were clean nice touch with the safe and iron and table the staff friendly location wasnt bad really  Given walking out the hotel and walking straight takes you directly to Central park AND times square is walkable equally on the same street although a long walk is the UN  Getting cabs are cheap they take Credit cards and the bus to take you the full length of the island stops just outside  Its surrounded by good places to eat The roof terrace was a nice touch and looks spectacular at night  I will definitely stay there again  
P => Location Location Location Located in York and nd st this hotel has a very good location in the very nice Upper East Side  Lots of cafes pubs places to eat etc near by  Nearest train station is lexington and th st but it is a nice walk Hotel is nice coffee and continental breakfast is complementary  Rooms are nice and have an awesome view  Elevators tend to be slow but when you do make it to the top floor there is this very nice bar with great view  Its a must to have a drink up there   If you dont want to be bothered be sure to have your quotdo not disturb signquot since the last day i had  people knock on my door just before check out time which was pretty anoying  Also they gave me a room at first that was occupied with other people so I had to wait for my room a couple of hours Staff is very nice though  I would stay there again if there is a good price  
P => Very friendly hotel We satyed in this hotel for four nights while visiting New York and had a pleasant stay  The staff were very nice and helpful  The hotel had coffee facilities in the reception area and it was very clean and modern  As for the room again it was very clean and modern small but thats what you expect in New York  It had a great bar on the top floor with a lovely view and friendly bar staff  The only fault we could find with the hotel is that it was not very close to the main sight seeing places but they were only a small cab ride away  We would recomend this hotel  
P => Exceeded expectations Stayed here with my girlfriend in e for  nights  Got a great deal through a hotel booking website  The hotel is nice and modern very clean and has polite and helpful staff The hotel is also in a great location  Its about a  minute walk to th Avenue and a couple of blocks from the nearest subway Lexington Avenue During our stay there we used a taxi only once this was to get to the docks for a boat trip We could walk to all the major attractions although some were be an hours walk Empire State Building The concierge David was very helpful and I recommend you speak to the concierge at the start of your stay to help make the most of your time and get everything you want to do done Our room was very nice we were upgraded to a suite upon arrival  Great panoramic views of the local area including the cable car opposite One other thing we liked is that we were slightly away from the city centre where its all go  it was nice to get a good nights sleep after a long day on our feet Overall i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Nice Convenient Place With A Few Minor Issues My best friend and I stayed at the Bentley during our birthday vacation  We stayed for a week  The hotel is very unassuming from the outside  If you take a cab or shuttle from an airport to the hotel your first thought when the vehicle pulls up is probably quotHuh Were herequot The Bentley is located next to a gas station and an animal medical center  Neither of these establishments are a detriment to the atmosphere of the hotel though   Once inside the lobby is bright clean and hip looking  Off to one side of the lobby is a cappuccino bar  Online the bar is featured as a  hour cappuccino bar but when we went down for coffee in the middle of the afternoon it was unattended and no coffee was available  The bar is by no means a fancy cafe rather it isnt much more than an espresso machine   The staff is generally helpful with any bags you might have  Housekeeping is hit or miss  They do tidy the room every time in addition to changing the sheets but several times they removed our dirty towels and didnt leave us with an entire set of clean ones  There were two of us and at one point we had no wash cloth and only one bath towel  One morning we had maintenance knock on our door at least three times asking to come in and change the mirror switched out for an identical mirror    and the last time when we didnt answer quickly enough the guy barged in and quickly apologized when he saw that we were still occupying the room  The rooms are nice and air conditioned  The beds are very comfortable with ample pillows  The bathroom does not have a fan and I believe that this led to the mildew or mold in our shower  The water did not drain from the tub quickly so showers were taken in ankle deep standing water  The water gets warm enough for a shower but never truly hot   The view from our th floor room was very nice overlooking the river and other high rise buildings that give the place a quotbig cityquot feeling   On our last day the doorman offered to have a driver take us to the airport which wasnt free but it did save us a good amount of money versus taking a cab or shuttle   In all the Bentley is just fine if youre spending time exploring the city and even if you want to lounge around the room a bit  We spent a good amount of time in the room and it was enjoyable and comfortable  I might discover hotels in other parts of the city but I wouldnt mind staying at the Bentley again  
P => Adequate For NYC Stayed st to th y at the Bentley  If its a plush room you are after this is not the place for you  If you want a comfortable bed at a reasonable price for Manhattan then it isFor me the reason for going to NYC was to see the sights not the inside of a hotel room  At the end of a tiring day I wanted a good nights sleep in a clean and comfortable environment  That I got I still indulge in that filthy habit called smoking and had a room for this on th floor smoking floor  My brother one floor up in the land of clean air on th  Both rooms had incedilbe views of the Queensboro Bridge the Roosevelt Island Cable Car remember Spiderman and beyond all along the East River to the Brooklyn Bridge in the distance  Great The hotel is showing its age and the rooms do need a refit  However the bed was really comfortable and spotlessly clean as was the entire hotel  No bed bugs to contend withThe room itself was basic to good though aging as mentioned but all you need is in it fromminibar hairdryer and iron to a keypad safe The major complaint was the AC in the room as others have mentioned  Nowhere near efficient for NYC summer temps and humidity The Lobby was the coldest place in the entire hotelGreat rooftop bar didnt try the restaurant after reading other reviews but went instead to the local diners which were great value for money for breakfast  Preferred to eat lunch out while sightseeing and evening meals in Little Italy or Chinatown   All part of the experience Staff were great from doorman Samuel to Francisco on the front desk who is more than willing to play jokes on you  All part of the experience and found the place to be very friendly Neighbourhood is quiet regardless of what other folk here say but I guess you need a high up room to avoid the traffic sound  th and th floors were high enough  However NYC wouldnt be NYC without its constant buzzIm going to stick my neck out here for  stars as I enjoyed the stay at the price I paid  It suited me and if I had paid more I would have expected more  Didnt so didnt Must add I usually  star or GT it when I go to hotels but found the Bentley to be fine for what I wanted on this trip     to be close enough to get to the sights and not pay out   or  bucks a night in the process  
P => Budget but brilliant We have stayed at this hotel a number of times now and its perfect for exploring one of the worlds greatest cities on a modest price tag  Its clean the staff are very friendly we always seem to get upgraded so long as we ask and the views are great  Its clean modern and stylish if someone else was paying yes id choose the Hyatt Regency but as its my money this hotel suits us just fine It amuses me when people complain about amenities facilities and a lack things to do in a hotel in New York City   For anyone who has been fortunate enough to go there its usually for barely a few nights and time is of the essence so a hotel is merely somewhere to finally grab some sleep shower change and leave all those shopping bags at the end of a long long day and night before hitting the sights early next morning Great hotel great location great views great prices    
P => Had a great time We booked this Hotel over y th  We had a great time The showers were the best I have ever had in a hotel  The front desk was very helpful and our room was upgraded which was greatThe subways are a little bit of a walk from the hotel  Plently of restaurants and a movie theatre in the area  Right on top of the East River which was beautilful  Our room had a water view There is a roof top bar and restaurant also  We enjoyed ourselves and would go back again  Also got a good  rate on the Hotel  
P => Good value and good service I booked this hotel on the back of some very good reviews and the fact that the price was about   less than the equivalent hotels in midtown  Between booking the hotel and making the trip a number of poor reviews turned up on this site and it was therefore with some trepidation that I rode from Newark to NYC I need not have worried   we were greeted   in the middle of a thunderstorm and torrential rain   by friendly and efficient staff who gave us a complimentary upgrade to a ior suite on the th  floor   I had requested a room with a good view and it was exactly that  Plenty of space clean and comortable beds everything worked in the bathroom We knew in advance about the off centre location but after a day of being busy tourists in New York it was actually rather relaxing to walk   minutes downhill back to the hotel from the subway taxi can be used as a very reasonable alternative for two or more people and I felt it was preferable to the noisy and very expensive midtown options I had considered The location of the gas station by the hotel was so minor a feature that it took  hours to realise it was there  Slight niggles would be the fact that there was  some  traffic noise but hey this is Manhattan   what do you expect closet space was a little limited the lifts could be slow in arriving at busy times and the air conditioning was rather noisy and not in the first flush of youth  Didnt use the restaurant so cant comment but the Ritz Diner on stnd is great for breakfast and there are plenty of good places for dinner on st  and nd  Avenue North of rd  Also try Alices Teacup th Lexington for a very Lewis Carroll experience All in all the Bentley did exactly what it said on the tin and represented excellent value for money  I would certainly stay again  
P => Cheap for New York We were booked here for a conference and I am thankful that I only had to stay for one night  The property is pretty worn like a motel  that theyve tried to make look like a W hotel with shoddy results  My th floor room looked over the Queensoboro bridge through filthy windows  The room was large and clean but worn with some sort of s style refrigerator stove contraption smack in the space  The bathroom sink would not drain and there was no water pressure in the shower  Staff were not friendly nor helpful with directions  I would not stay here again  
P => Nice but needs TLC The rooms are large for new York I found it very noisy and there was a few things in my room which did not work despite my reporting them  
P => The Bentley exceeded our expectations   all around Its hard to tell what kind of experience you will have in New York City when the hotel has a mediocre website  I was not sure what to expect and was really nervous because my boss and another colleague were also booked here  Great news We all loved it We fell in love with the roof top bar staff and the food Byron and Steven the bartenders make everyone feel special and right at home  While there is a limited menu everything is fresh and cooked to order  The view is breathtaking also  The guest rooms are very comfortable and there was no street noise from the th floor  Bathrooms were larger than expected with excellent lighting and amenities  The mini bar was stocked well and reasonably price  I especially liked the espresso machine in the lobby  The General Manager introduced himself and was a pleasure  Everyone smiles at this hotel 
P => Good value We had to get a last minute room in New York for  days and consider ourselves fortunate to have ended up at The Bentley  Even though it was last minute the room rate we received was very competitive for this class hotel  Staff members were all very pleasant and the service we received was consistently above and beyond what we expected  Our th floor room was very clean and quiet and we had a fabulous view of the bridge and Roosevelt tram  A problem with a plugged drain was taken care of immediately and an iron with a short was replaced quickly with a functional one  On the down side there is one ice machine between the st and nd floor for all the guests of the hotel  There are many quotdesign on a dimequot type orating touches  some more successful than others  Some of the carpeting and furnishings throughout are a little worn frayed andor stained  The upper east side location is convenient to the bus and subway and there are several good restaurants within walking distance  We had one of our best meals at Angels pasta which is located next to the nearby  hour Ritz Diner  Overall we consider our stay at the Bentley to be a very positive experience  
P => Quirky but great value This was a one night business trip  The entire city was booked or rediculously expensive as NYC is these days Booked the Bently because it was one of the only hotels available  It is a little out of the way by the river on the east side technically midtown but not by much The hotel lobby is quite chic and stylish  The service at the front desk was friendy and excellent  The hotel is older so the room was not big but it was well appointed which brings me to the strange part of my feedback  The hotel is actually quite nice including very well appointed beds and linens flat screen TV etc   But then the two tables in the room were beat on and scratched like they were leftovers from the pre redesigned or  Then the tiny bathroom is older fixtures but had no plug for the drain  Just strange disconnects with the rest of the experience which was quite nice If you consider the price and dont mind the location the hotel was a fantastic value  
P => Worth a look but read on The hotel was good in most respects staff were efficient and friendly our room was good but the state of the or was beginning to show its age   battered paintwork gapped tiling in the bathroom etc airconheating was unreliable too  The restaurant area was a big let down the space amp its location in the building could be turned into something quite special instead of a random collection of chairs and tables it lacked atmosphere amp character hence it was deserted most meal times the cost of the self service buffet breakfast probably puts people off   a real shameLifts were so slow to arrive The hotel location is fair our room suffered badly with traffic noise from the FDRsurface roadsRoosevelt bridge its smack in the middle of the onoff ramps for the FDR  lane highway   there was a constant drone  A fuel station is attached to the building this didnt cause a problem as such but it did create extra traffic with obligatory horn honking for no good reason Subway is a brisk  minutes walk away st Lexington is the best option taking any train ked R or W will get you to the centre of it all the main activities There are a fair number of places to eat locally breakfast at Ritz diner served us well  for scrambled eggs bacon smashed potatoes amp endless coffee was value for money with good service Overall the hotel was good with a few problems with hindsight Id probably have tried harder to get closer to central park amp further south walking can take it out of you especially if you have to wait at every crossing Also buy a MetroCard we bought  day unlimited cards for    great value amp can be used on the buses too  The auto vend machines dont like UK credit cards cash or debit cards are fine Be wary of the Gray Line hop on hop off tours  each the buses are infrequent amp the hop on points not obvious  
P => Very impressed with the Bentley We my wife and I booked the Bentley for seven nights for a businessshoppingsiteseeing trip to New York  It was recommended to us by a previous visitor and also seemed to be the lowest cost hotel in NYC that got consistently good reviews on Tripadvisor We flew into Newark and got thoroughly ripped off by the Airport taxis  bucks plus quottollsquot where the tolls come to nearly one hundred dollars  The hotel arranged us a car to go back at less than half the cost so its worth giving them a call to see if they can pick you upThe hotel is located on the Upper East Side right by the Queensborough Bridge  Its not a bad area but the hotel is right by a busy road   its well worth asking for the highest room you can get to avoid the traffic noise  We where on the th floor and it was fine  One the last day they moved us to a suite on the th floor and it was much noisier  Everywhere in NY is busy so this is likely to apply to any hotel  The room was excellent  Very clean comfy bed big chairs LCD TV and nice bathroom  Great to come back to after a busy day  The suite we got on the last day although bigger did not really offer any extra so I would keep your money   the standard rooms are fine  The reception was efficient and the staff friendly and polite   no complaints  We only had one problem the hairdryer broke and they came and fixed it within  minutes of calling  We didnt eat there at all so cant comment  Like everybody else we went to the Ritz Diner for breakfast which is really good  Its located one block up End street on the corner of st   it seems to have a more expensive menu at the weekends for some reason  Theres also a great pizza parlour just around the corner next to Dangerfields and a quot quot round the other corner  The nearest subway is either on st and Lexington next to Bloomingdales for the track down towards the Brooklyn Bridge and Central Station or rd and Lexington for Midtown  Both are about  minutes away  My advise would be to get a subway map ask at any subway and a ticket to last you your stay  You can walk until you drop in New York and getting familiar with the subway will make the difference 
P => Liked the Bentley I stayed in the Bentley in ruary for  nights and had a good experience Reception Cold and Efficient  We arrived pretty late the reception staff were not particularly friendly but highly efficient Room We stayed on the st Floor  We had amazing views over NY and the room itself was comfortable and spotless Location The hotel is approximately  minutes walk away from the nearest subway stop  A Taxi to Times Square costs approximately  dollars which is not bad if you are there for a short break and dont want to waste time traveling  From a cost perspective the hotel is excellent value considering its location  Parking There is underground parking beside the hotel make sure to get your ticket validated by reception before leaving Overall I would stay there again if visiting New York  It is an ideal place to see Central Park Museums etc  and is reasonably close to nd streets and lower  
P => Not all that First off our room was very dirty   the furniture was all chipped damaged and looked very old and nasty  The rugs were dirty and the furniture was sticky with some kind of substance  And we were in a suite When I informed the front desk clerk he informed the front desk manager who brought the entire hotel management staff like  people to my room along with the housekeeping manager to confront her about the situation   in front of us  I thought that was VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND TACKY  The hotel GM had no class for doing thatMany of the staff were rude   vocally very unhappy with changes in upper management and new ownership  No one seemed to know what was going on And the best part   the rate for us to stay another  nights was   night They have got to be jokingAlso there was no quotcappuccino barquot as stated in ad and they charge a small fortune for the breakfast buffet which was cereal and fruitSo people   in a town of  hotels there are better choicesAnd did I mention it is attached and above a Mobil gas station 
P => Far from centre but quiet The hotel is rather far from the centre in a very quiet residential area  Very nice restaurants not too far but a  to  min  walk to Fifth Avenue and a  cab ride to the theatre district  Closest subway is  minutes brisk walk It was fine for a  star hotel the bed was comfortable with a nice duvet  The bathroom modern and very efficient  We had a microwave in the room   heaven knows why   The major drawback is that there is no climate control the ac unit does not allow for air exchange from outside and you cannot turn off the heat Our room was facing east so it got stiffling hot during the day and very stuffy during the night  Do not go there before the ac is turned on for the summerBreakfast very nice fresh fruit fresh pastries good choice of natural cereal and excellent coffee Staff very nice but cannot fix the  elevators out of  that dont work or the climate control    
P => Good NY base We arrived for a girly shopping sightseeing break at the Bentley in New York and we were very happy with the accomodation The rooms were spacious clean with great views   the rooftop restaurant and bar was lovely   with spectacular  degree views of Manhattan and beyondThe reception was friendly   the only thing that i did not like was the lighting in the corridors as it was very dark   but who cares you dont spend your time in the corridorsAlthough the hotel i quite away from the main attraction areas   a  min walk and your at central park was lovely in the sunshine   it is new york everything is far away from each other Walking getting the subway and hailing a taxi is all part of enjoying the experience and being a true new yorker  remember not to smile   haha Although if your looking for nightlife   there did not seem to be anything around the hotel We were out from am   pm shopping and seeing the sights so we were too tired to party   so the hotel was perfectThough we did see a broadway show   which is a must 
P => Wonderful hotel I wanted a quiet hotel in New York City and didnt want to pay a fortune   not easy to find in NYC  I investigated all of the hotels downtown and looked at the reviews  They seemed overpriced for what you were getting  Most of them seemed run down and charged a high rate just for the convenience of being downtown  I ided on the Bentley because it looked luxurious and comfortable and wasnt that far from downtown  We were very happy with the Bentley  The rooms were very comfortable and quiet and the service was great  Whenever I needed anything the front desk were extremely courteous and cooperative and sent someone up right away  If we wanted to go downtown it was only a ten minute cab ride  The doorman even fetched the taxi for you There is also a lovely restaurant on the top floor  If I was to return to NYC I would not hesitate to stay at the Bentley again  If you have any questions my e mail is beanzie rogers com  
P => What happened to the Capuccino I loved the hotel it was very nice for the price and comfortable  Location was great Ritz diner was a perfect place for breakfast  Everything on the review was true including the capuccino machine out of order which was unfortunate  People nice in genereal the concierge could have been a little bit more helpful    but I would definitely stay there again when I go to NYC and I recommend it to anyone  The shower works great and the only problem is there is no shower curtain and it can get messy but you dont get cold  
P => Not as it seems The Hotel was very trendy    a few years ago  Too far from the metro and with a lot of traffic all around  
P => The Bentley was pretty good My boyfriend and I stayed at The Bentley after a fantastic  night stay in Manhattan  Overall The Bentley was great  The staff were helpful and friendly without being intrusive and we honestly didnt have any problems  The bed was massive and we had a a great big plasma TV to relax in front of at the end of a tiring day sightseeing Tip Ask for a bridgeriver view and make sure youre on  the th floor or above so youre away from the traffic noise We had breakfast every morning at the Food Emporium along the road under Queensboro bridge which was perfect   fruit muffins and coffee what more could you need Really cheap too if youre paying in English poundsThe wardrobe in the room was so small theres no way we could have put our clothes away   this was fine for  nights but any more and I think you would need somewhere to store your clothes or youd just get a bit fed up  The only other thing was that it was a little bit out of town but we like walking so it didnt worry us too much Great trip 
P => Great New York Find This hotel is such a bargain for New York We stayed here last ch and had a fab time  We booked on the hotels website and were upgraded to a suite It was by far the largest hotel room that I have ever had   an adorable living area dining area and a completely arate bedroom The orations were cute and modern and I enjoyed the views of the bridges from our large windows  My one complaint is that the room wasnt as warm as it could have been   we didnt try to rectify this   its possible they would have fixed it but we were so in love with our room that we were afraid our complaint would move us to a new room and we didnt want that to happenThe hotel is close shopping Yay Its probably only a  minute walk or so to shopping row  It is also close to the subway so its just a few minutes to get anywhere else There is a fantastic diner just up the street from the hotel   Ritz Diner  We had almost every meal there  They serve a ton of food   a big breakfast there will last you nearly the rest of the day  
P => Great Little Hotel The hotel was everything I could have asked for  I was trying to find a room for under  a night in Manhattan and that is tough to do in ember  Luckily I was able to find a room at the Bentley  The Good The rooms are in pristine condition  Clean and very modern  It even had a huge flat panel TV  Great views and floor to ceiling windows  Ditto with the lobby and the staff was very friendly  As far as the other amenities at the hotel restaurant pool gym etc I do not really know as I did not have time to look for it  About the only complaint I had about the room was that it was small but I think that is to be expected in a Manhattan hotel room  It was very comfortable for two people but I wouldnt recommend it for more than two  The location was a tiny bit out of the way as it is on nd and all the way on the East Side at York  Although it is not a bad neighborhood its a bit of a walk to MidtownCentral ParkTimes Square  It was about a   minute walk to Times Square but then again walking thru the city is a pleasant experience in itself  Overall I think The Bentley is an excellent choice for visitors in to NYC who do not want to pay the  for hotel near Times Square and a much better option than staying in NJ or in one of the outer boroughs  The room made me feel very comfortable and I will go back the next time I need a room in NYC  
P => Great Room for Great Price I stayed here for my Wifes th Birthday  The room was perfect very spacious for Manhatten  The location looks shady from the outside but the inside is nice and the views are wonderfull  The staff was very firendly and helpfull  The rooftop bar is pretty cool  It is a few blocks away from the subway but only a  cab ride from LGA  I will definatley stay there again  
P => Wonderful night Spent a Saturday night here to celebrate our honeymoon  The location is terrific for driving in as it is right next to the on ramp for the FDR and parking is only  at the garage underneath the building  The staff was very friendly and upgraded us to a ior suite for no extra charge  We were on the th floor in a corner room with fantastic views of the East River the Queensboro Bridge the Roosevelt Island Tram and many skyscrapers  Looked great in the daytime and even nicer when lit up at night  The room was spacious with a very comfortanble queen size bed that was not small at all Im   Delicious coffee espresso capaccino maker in the lobby is free  We walked over to Rockefeller Center and saw the tree and did some shopping at American Girl for our dhters took about twenty minutes to walk to that area  We also saw a great comedy show at Dangerfields which is only a block from the hotel  Great sushi place accross teh street on First Avenue Sushi Saki  Cons of the hotel were carpeting in hallway had some bumps and some of the hallway lights were a little dim but overall a terrific place for the price  at Christmas time  p s  take the tram over to Roosevelt Island and have breakast on a Sunday morning  Its so peaceful youll forget your in NYC  
P => Dont let the location dissuade you      Hotel looks mediocre on the outside and is located above a gas station and right next to the entrance of FDR drive   Not a very attractive location  The location right on the East River makes for great views though  We booked a ior suite and got a large room on the th floor with an amazing view of the th Street bridge and Manhattan  Room was modern and comfortable with a nice hard king sized bed flat screen TV and a nice chaise lounge for reading  Bathroom was modern with ble shower sink and floor Staff were friendly and the free cappucino machine in the lobby was a nice touch The only downside is that the hotel is a bit far from the subway   about  blocks  of which are long blocks  Another downside is that the FDR Drive can be noisy if you are on a lower floor  Ask for an upper floor to reduce the noise  
P => Great Hotel I stayed here as part of a large group and was very impressed with every aspect of my stay  The rooms were big by UK standards never mind New York ones and the beds were gorgeously comfy if a little short  Im around  and my feet hung over the end  Theyre not shy with the pillows either  great big fluffy clouds to sink into The hotel is in a great location for Bloomingdales and Central Park a bit of a stroll to th Avenue especially with shopping bags Id reccommend a few dollars for a cab  The views from the bar on the st floor take some beating the Queensboro bridge on one side and skyscrapers on the other  Absolutely gorgeous day or night rain or shine  I would definately stay here again thanks to all the staff for putting up with our demands and a reception FULL of people and luggage on our departure  
P => Would stay again We spent the night at the Bently hotel during our trip to visit family on Long Island  The hotel is very easy to find there is parking underneath the hotel for day tax however when we picked up our car it had a foul odor in it   it took about  hour to get rid of the smell with the windows down  Our room was on the th floor with a view of the th st  bridge and the apartment building across the street  The room was nice and bigger then expected in NYC  It has a flat screen tv and a bed that was ent  There was internet access at an addtional charge of  day  The bathroom was nice however the set up of the shower was strange with a  glass partition  The water pressure was very strong which was great  The hallways did have a strong odor of air freshner but it didnt get into the room  We went upstairs to the lounge for drinks and it was very nice  We were the only ones there for awhile  the outside k was great and the couches in the lounge were nice as well  We stayed until closing and the staff was very nice didnt make us feel like we were holding them up even though we were the only customers  The location of the hotel is a bit out of the way so be prepared to walk a bit to get public transportation  We walked back to the hotel from Rockefeller Center and it was a nice walk and the area around the hotel seemed safe to us  We would stay here again even with the lack of close public transporation  
P => Rooms spacious and sleek a few minor complaints I booked a standard queen room here for one night while interviewing for a job nearby  The lobby is spare and clean in keeping with much of the or  My room was on a high floor and was essentially a small suite  with a small sitting room with sofa table and flat screen TV  There was a arate bedroom with a large queen bed small flat screen TV and an ipod capable alarm clock  The or was modern freshly reated and attractive  The bed was very comfortable  Few minor complaints Elevators were very slow  I waited nearly  minutes before one came I was on the th floor and it was clear on the way down that others were waiting too  I dont know if any were out of order  Bathroom was nice but the water pressure was pretty weak and hot water slow in coming All in all pretty minor complaints and given the reasonable price for Manhattan   Id stay here again  
P => Large rooms massive windows    but a bit out of the way  couples stayed in  arate rooms for  night  Wed all been to the city before so the location didnt bother us  We used the hotel as a way of breaking up a very long trip  We headed off to LGA the next day so the location of this hotel was very convenient in that respect  Pros we were both upgraded upon arrival Rooms were fantastic  Extremely large massive windows comfy bed in a arate bedroom  Tv in the bedroom and sitting area  Gorgeous views from the rooftop bar  Have stayed at this hotel in the summer time and found the rooftop bar to have a fantastic atmosphere  The views from here are fantastic   especially at night  Depending on the purpose of your visit I think the location of this hotel has advantages  Its quieter and a bit more residential  Cons bathroom amenities slightly lackingno teacoffee in the room had to go to the main lobby for it  The rooftop barwhich was nearly empty when we were thereclosed very early at midnight  I didnt notice a refrigerator or mini bar in the room  Breakfast wasnt included in our rate and we found paying  for  continental breakfasts basically tea and bagels to be a bit over the top  
P => Good room average hotel I travelled with my best friend for a girlie holiday  Arrived too early to check in before pm but we were able to check in our luggage  We wanted a hotel out of the hustle and bustle of mid town close to the park and bloomingdales and it was ideal for this  Lobby is pleasant as are the staff but nothing special  Corriders are dark and over fragranced with reeze The room we had was superior but it wasnt worth the upgrade we were on the th floor river facing with a nice view great lighting from massive windows and no windows looking in on us  The room was very large comfortable and very well kept the bathroom also good extremely powerful shower and eptively small but powerful hair dryerBar was a shade shabby but panaramic rooftopbridge views made up for this and the cocktails were reasonably priced  The Bar man is loud but great for tips on nightlife  We didnt eat at the hotel at all plenty of choices downstown and near by   particularly on st ave the Ritz Diner cheap and cheerful with excellent service and get take out from the excellent Roys sushi   blue lit up bar on first   excellent for the evening recovering from last nights cocktails Use the concierge by all means they are very nice but dont expect to get better tableticket etc than if you booked yourself Other tips   Nearby Orchid Spa for manicurepedicure Ess a bagel on rd Ave for breakfast en route downtown  
P => Fantastic for sightseeing and shopping We have just returned from a  day break at this hotel in New York  I travelled with my wife and  year old dhter on a sightseeing shopping trip There were no problems at all with this hotel apart from the fact that it is a bit of a trudge from the nearest subway lexingtonth street at the end of a long day with lots of shopping bags In hindsight we should have taken more cabs  these are unbelievably plentiful and easy to hailbut you always forget how tired you were the day before  If you are fairly fit and enjoy walking then this hotel is for you  It is about  minutes to the subway and Lexington Avenue where there are lots of shops and another  minutes or so to Central Park so you are not that far away from the action The Ritz diner was where we had breakfast every morning on the way to the subway and we found it terrific value with a fantastic breakfast menu Our fair sized room was on the th floor and although the air conditioning was a bit loud we were so tired that it did not affect our sleeping  We had two comfortable double beds and a nice TV  The bathroom was perhaps a little small but it was clean enough and sufficent for our needs The corridors and lifts are pretty dark  In fact in the lift you can hardly see the floor numbers Also I am always suspicious when there is a really strong smell of perfumed air or air freshener in the corridors  You keep wondering what they have to hide I have to say my suspicions proved to be unfounded and the surroundings were very pleasant We had few dealings with the hotel staff but when we did they were helpful efficient and courteous e g  storing our luggage for us on the final day and ordering a taxi for the airport Our favourite things to do a take the subway to High Street Brooklyn and then walk back to Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge  Great views of the Manhattan skyline and it is freeb Go to the Top of the Rock observatory at the Rockefeller centre for fantastic  degree views  This costs about  but is worth the money and by all accounts better than the Empire State Building which incidentally you can see very clearly  c Explore the area around Washington Square the arch where Harry gets dropped off by Sally after she gives him a lift and he says quotHave a nice lifequot preferably south and west of that landk where there are some quirky shops great bars and restaurants  
P => Give this place a try Stayed in the Bentley for a few nights on business  The rooms were clean and comfortable and the bar with the open balcony on the st floor was a great spot for pre dinner drinks even our New York hosts thought it was a great spot for a drink with a view  It is a little out of the way but definitely walkable in flats and youd still save money if you got cabs everywhere  Didnt do the breakfast but there is a lovely diner up the road and a starbucks around the corner  If this place was a few blocks down and across it would be five times the price so if you want to see the city and not your hotel room go for the Bentley  
P => Super Hotel I stayed at this hotel in the summer with two of my friends  We took it on the advise in this site  We werent disappointed  This hotel suited everything we needed  The location was a bit off putting but since we were there for two weeks it was fine  Its only a  min stroll to the subway that will bring you to Times Sq  There is a petrol station beside the hotel which is open  hrs  This proved to be a life saver as late nites of drinking led to dry mouths and a shop at your doorstep is brilliant  The teacoffee machine was great also as you need it to wake you up in the morning  The restaurant on the top floor offers amazing views of the city and if you dont want to go too far for a drink there is a bar at night  It also has a man at reception that can set you up with anything from day trips to philly to tickets for a ball game  all those advantages outweigh the negatives by so much  There is nothing in this world that is perfect and where The Bentley falls short is  its location its fine if your there for at least a weeks stay but if you have limited time your better off going nearer to Times Sq  and  the breakfast buffet they have  From an Irish point of view it could be better and could be better value  But other than that its perfect  The Air Con was a life saver and there is also an ice machine and vending machines  It really is perfect for all ages as long as you dont mind walking  But your in NY everywhere you go is amazing  A hotel couldnt be ran better  Oh and if you want a good place to eat and drink there is an Irish bar one block up called Baker St  its brilliant  Lastly the maids are superb there  Three male  y o  unsupervised arent exactly thinking about being too tidy but every time we came back to the room it was spotless  
P => Brilliant would definately recommend Just returned from a  night stay at The Bentley NY and it was brilliant the rooms were spotless and very comfy the maids came in everyday to make the beds and tidy the room clean the bathroom etc  the reception staff were very friendly and the concierge couldnt do enough for you Breakfast at the hotel is  it consists of a hot breakfast fruit muffins anything really and you can have as much as you want its situated on the st floor and has a fantastic view at night time  There is a little Diner up the street called The Ritz which does a gorgeous breakfast you really have to try it We were about a  minute walk from Central Park and th Ave which was great the area was nice and quiet apart from all the taxicab men constantly honking their horns they do it everywhere so it was nothing new a taxi into Time Square will cost you about  inc tips which isnt expensive as it takes about   minutesIf your looking to take the city bus trip dont bother booking it at the hotel its  more expensive and you have to take your receipt to the ticket guys anyway to exchange it for a ticket so its pointless the hotel obviously makes  for every one booked The hotel offer a cab service back to JFK airport for  which is great value just arrange it with the concierge when you arrive just make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get thereOverall I really enjoyed my stay at The Bentley and would stay there again if I were to go back to NY I can be contacted if anyone has anything they would like to ask me 
P => basic hotel We stayed at the Bentley Hotel as the final part of our honeymoon spending three nights here  The location was great walkable to the city  mins approx the concierge were fantastically helpful but the down side was the accommodationFirstly the place is obviously run down   the rooms were relatively clean sheets were damp the air con didnt work  The candid pictures i have seen on here which made me book certainly did not meet with the real thing If you want somewhere to lay your head at night and dont mind noise or dampness stay here   its cheap and cheerful and has great views from the breakfast rooms  one last tip dont use the phone in the room   we made two short calls home and got a hefty   charge for it  
P => A little dark       A bit trendy       Good value       The Bentley is a three star hotel in my opinion and nothing more and perhaps less  This hotel falls into the value category for me  After doing my research on trip advisor I paid  plus tax on the hotels website for a week night which is pretty good for NYC in tember  I would not pay more than  for this hotel on weekday business travel and  for weekend leisure travel in the spring summer and fall  You will find better value in the winter elsewhere as weekend prices tend to drop at  star hotels in Manhatten The hotel location on the east side of Manhatten is not too bad for a NYC vacation or business trip if you dont mind being a bit off of the beaten path  The rooms have flat screen TVs and a modern feel but nothing extrordinary  The bathrooms are clean but a bit cramped like the room  The rooftop bar is bit smelly like a cruise ship on the th night but the view is great friendly bar staff and it is a great place to have a drink  The free cofee and cappuccino is a plus If you have incredibly high standards or dont understand the concept of quotyou get what you pay forquot this is not the place for you  But if you are looking for a great deal and are willing to accept the downsides to a three star hotel you might find incredible value here if you can book this hotel at a nice price  
P => Polished Terd A word to the traveling masses The Bentley is a quotpolished terd quot No matter how one shines this bad boy its still a stinker  Top five levels of stinkiness  The tub is fitted with half a pane of glass so the other half of the tub is free to let the water wash all over the floor   The breakfast was ridiculously bad  The staff scortched my husbands french toast black on one side and remedied it by bringing another order of french toast  this time made with wonder bread instead of original challah bread  The oatmeal was runny and the coffee was burnt Sanka    The place looks like an s nightclub flashback thats never been scrubed clean   The staffs disdane for customers is tremendously high  It was built up by years of apologising for its incompetence and crumbling facilities   The carpet in the room had an erie stickiness that only a blue light in CSI could ode Sincerely disapointed  
P => Hopeless Reception Staff We stayed at the Bentey hotel for two nights in ust   The hotel itself is not bad although the dim lighting is disasterous  What was most annoying were the charmless rude unhelpful reception staff  The doormenbellboys were extremely pleasant but the reception staff let down the whole establishment It is also too far out of town I would not recommend it  
P => Great Hotel   a little far out We had a long weekend at The Bentley Hotel at the end of ember  and had a really good time  After the nighte of JFK Immigration the check in staff were all friendly and welcoming  They were also very apologetic for the am fire alarm My girlfriend enjoyed watching the burly firemen for the hour we stood outside It also afforded us a stark reminder of  with the memorial on the fire truck On arrival we were upgraded to a ior suite and had a corner room   unfortunately overlooking the gas station next door  The room was only let down by three things   the air con heating was mediocre thankfully we had unseasonably warm weather the bathroom was tired and small and the closet space was non existent   we ended up living out of our bags on the floor  Mind you how long do you stay in your room when youve the whole of NY to exploreThe best aspect of the hotel is without a doubt the bar amp restaurant on the top floor overlooking the East River and The Queensboro Bridge   a truly fantastic view of night time Manhattan can be seen from the bar The hotel is ideal for exploring the Upper East Side neighbourhood and Central Park isn t that far away  Be prepared to walk   the places arent too close dont be put off by a  Block walk its not that far really A word of note if you only staying for a couple of days and its your first time in New York Id suggest a hotel closer to midtown as its not too central   but if you are an old hand at visiting NYC then thats part of the attraction for the Bentley as it gives another aspect to the city and there are some good restaurants near by  The Ritz Diner a block away was spot on for starting the day   great value big portions and window booths to watch the world go by  And at the Italian just round the corner the Barman makes possibly the best Bombay Sapphire Gin amp Tonic we have ever hadSome reviews have mentioned surly staff we didn t experience that  The concierge arranged a limo to pick us up for the return to the airport at am and when we checked out the Night Porter dealt with us like it was the middle of the day rather than the middle of the night If we were to go back we d ask for a room on a higher floor and with more closet space with views of the river rather than the street  
P => Loved NYC We stayed in the Bentley in ember last year and were there for New Year We had a fantastic time the city is AMAZINGThe Bentley was great very clean and the staff were v  friendly When we checked in we were upgraded to a suit which was lovely Id recomend a meal on the rooftop restaurant as the food is good and the views over Manhattan at night are fantastic  
P => Pleasantly surprised I did a lot of research before I booked a room over night in NYC  It was either go for the cheapest the Hotel PA at  and be closer to the attractions or spend a little more to be closer to a friend that we were going to meet up with  I chose the Bentley at  a night  It is a little out of the way  We were able to walk to Central park and Times Square  But I found it hard to find a good place to eat in the area  We had our  year old with us and the outdoor cafes near Park Ave were not the place for us  There was a nice park with a sprinklerfountain for the kids about a block or two from the hotel as well as a few pavilions on the water  I read a few reviews that said the hotel is noisy  We were on the South side of the building on the th floor no view of the bridge for us It was so quiet and relaxing  be you have to sacrifice tranquility for a view The cappuccino bar was awesome  We ordered room service for breakfast and the three of us eat for less than    That made up for eating at TGIF in Times Square and spending   for a turkey burger  The hotel did have dark elevators and halls but I didn t mind  It was clean and the room was very comfortable especially the bed  They do have very nice linens  The shower did need a good spray of bleach to kill the mold and the water is very hard  I recommend this hotel  I d stay there again if the location was a little more downtown  But if you want to stay on the upper west side near the hospitalmuseumsCentral Park give it a try  
P => Great Value I will return I was pleased with the Bentley  The front desk staff was very courteous all three days that I was there  The room was clean modern great flat screen TV most comfortable bed weve ever slept in  We were on the th floor and it was very quiet  Bar on top floor was a little disappointing I guess I was hoping for a little bit nicer view but it was still a nice view of the river  Bathroom was not luxurious a little small but fine  We ate at the Ritz Diner one block up towards Central Park based on other reviewers recommendations and agree its a great place for breakfast  While the location is not in the thick of things we still walked up to Central Park and down th Avenue one day from the hotel  I find that no matter where we stay we end up taking a lot of cabs  And this hotel is right off the FDR so some taxi drivers took the FDR to get into SOHO and that saved time  I would recommend this hotel assuming the price stays reasonable  
P => Bentley More like a robin reliant Arrived at the hotel which is out of the way and next to the motorway  The description said it was  min walk to central park but it was rather  mins walk The staff are quite unhelpfull on the desk and the concierge was ironically the most unhelpful and rather rudeGot to the room and it was tiny a tiny cubbard which didnt fit the suitcase and contained  coat hangers and no shelves  this was all the storage space  The room was tiny although the view was quite nice if you didnt look downThe roof top restaurant had an amazing view but the restaurant itself wasnt very glamourous The best thing about the hotel was the main porter who was incredibly nice and helpful for all our shopping needs And there is also a nice diner up the road where we got breakfastI do not recomend this hotel 
P => Run   Dont Walk My two day stay at the Bentley was full of frustration and extreme disappointment  A non functioning key card system apparently a recurring problem based on other reviews provided apprehension about hotel security and a rude desk staff compounded the dissatisfaction  I arrived at the Bentley Sunday morning and as expected there were no rooms yet ready  I went out for the day and when I returned around  pm I was told that there was a technical problem with the room key card system and I would have to wait for a bellman to let me into the room  In a few minutes I was shown to my room but the bellman just let me in   I was given keys but they didnt work  I went out for a bite to eat and when I returned the fellow at the front desk clearly under stress since others couldnt get into their rooms told me that my lock had been fixed just moments after I left the hotel and I was given another set of key cards  I went up to the room and the cards didnt work  I returned to the lobby was sent back up to the room with a bellman who couldnt open the door  Back to the lobby  With considerable attitude the desk clerk escorted me to my room with the master control box and told me that he was reprogramming the lock  I got into the room and was given two keys  I went out to see friend later in the evening and when lI returned at midmight that key card didnt work  This time it took three trips to the room with hotel staff and twenty minutes later I was finally in my room   with no working keys The next morning a very kind hotel manager apologized promised to have the keys working and told me that the Sunday staff should have notified her of the problem over the weekend but didnt  Fact of the matter was when I returned later in the day the keys I was given still didnt work  Finally the manager herself came to the room and get the system to work When I returned later that evening from dinner my hallway had five kids sitting on the floor with their suitcases  When I asked what was going on they told me they couldnt get into their rooms this was at  pm So these issues coupled with a dreary location a TV remote that needed new batteries I had to ask twicefurniture that needed to be refreshed and a very sour and unhelpful weekend and hight staff leads me to suggest that you look elsewhere for accommodations in the Big Apple  
P => Excellent Stayed here just after New Year and for the price this was excellent  Reasonable size of room for New York friendly staff Its well away from the main tourist areas but not too far from the subway so everywheres easy to get to  
P => Best location ever I loved the Bentley hotel from the moment I came in   Its beautifull the staff is ok  they could have been nicer  The interior is perfect the cleaning too and the location couldnt be better 
P => not perfect but pretty darn good The Bentley on the Upper East Side E  nd at York is a bit out of the mainstream for most NYC tourists but there is a bus that runs practically to the door which will get you to the major subway lines in a matter of minutes     and the hustle and bustle of First Avenue is a short walk away  Plenty of ent restaurants beautiful buildings and a safe neighborhood to walk in  Most importantly you get a lot of hotel for your money we splurged for a ior suite only a few dollars more and highly recommended a great view of the East River and the City skyline and a peace and quiet when you need it  There were a few less than perfect moments like when the room keys were reprogrammed and we couldnt get into the room after returning from a late night out or the broken coffee machine one morning but the staff was very accomodating and friendly and took care of problems quickly  It was our first trip to NYC and we were not disappointed  We will definitely stay there again  
P => an HOnest Review We  couple   spent a week in NYC il  to   Girlfriend first time in NYC We booked this hotel because it was a travel agent recommendation   US  night average  We were a bit worry due some reviews Here we go Bentley was a very good surprise  Hotel is in th   York avenue so It is NOT in the centre of things but the east side is a very nice neighborhood with many options to eat and walk  We got a nice room  finished in  in the th floor with a nice view of the east river a Window ceil to floor allowed us to see the Queensboro bridge at front and the river  I asked for a higher floor and they promised me in three days but actually we stayed in the th floor  Rooms were very clean with bed amp linens Ok changed everyday  ble bathrooms nice shower  Flat screen TV small closets  Acces to WiFi through a provider costs  the week was reliable daily or hourly acces is too priced   We actually use internet to plan each day due the fact we got bad weather  rainy and cold below C first four days and very good one the last four days    sunny and above C  Noise early in the moorning but not too noisy  There is a small fridge     Do Not Touch it if you get a bottle from the fridge just to see what it is you will be charged Complimentary self capuccino  or tea  is available at the small reading room besides the Lobby where daily newspapers and magazines are available  We use the machine for capuccino expresso or tea every day leaving the hotel and returning       check in amp check out was fast  no problems at all  Service was very good the concierge helped us with the few questions we asked  they were always attentive Roof top Restaurant is a simple place to take a drink to see the river   night we did not eat there  breakfast and dinner was offered it is nothing too special but it worth a night visit to drink a cosmo if you are going to stay YES Bentley iss a little bit off nearest Subway station is  blocks away   lexington with st  six lines or lexington with st   F line   Getting to Central Park is  blocks away  but the walk is in a nice neighborhood  I believe that is the only reason this hotel is still at  night  Taxi Cab from Midtown  Downtont to Bentley were  average at night  I do believe that these extra  each day are much less that the extra  day that costs a good hotel in theater District that compares with Bentley Few hints if you stay in Bentley   walk to River View Terrace to amazing views of Queensboro bridge amp river    blocks from Bentley    Madison Avenue amp the museum Mile are quotnearquot the hotel for a good walk day  We found a gem in the museum mile neue gallery museum  German amp Austrian ExpresSionist  Right now quotVan Gogh amp the expressionismquot is in display  amazing   lots of good coffes to take breakfast  The Nearest the Ritz Dinner  If you want somethingh very hip EAT Caffe   Park avenue with   Best breakfast we had in town  fresh pastry and bakery everything good   tram to Roosevelt Island is  blocks away nothing spectacular as it is a  minute raid but if you stay in Bentley with Queensboro bridge at your side and you see the tram every day almost right   your window you have to ride on it        United Nations Building is few minutes walking down by st avenue    we took dinner near Bentley just one night  It was a small amp friendly italian  tuscany region  restaurant very good   st  or nd avenue with th or th  try it  It is besides east river caffe almost hidden quotCuccina Tuscanaquot or something like that in sumy Bentley is a good hotel NOT in the middle of things but for NYC it is reasonably priced in a stylish orwith nice amp clean rooms  Rooms with views to the river amp queensboro are something different that add this quotadditional touchquot to the stay in the HOtel  Friendly staff nothing to complain  YES for a long stay i will return  For a very short stay in NYC be you could prefer a more quotMiddle of the actionquot hotel with tons of people subway stations neon lights surrounding    It is up to you hopes this help   
P => Lovely clean hotel but noisey surrounding When my friend and I arrived the room we were allocated to was on the fourth floor although the room was spacious and clean the noise level was horrendous  We complained to reception and they said they would put us in another room the following day and true to their word we were put on the th floor which was a lot less noiser My friend and I had a double bed each which had duvets and sheets   very comfortable bed  The only down side to our room was that the bathroom was a little small but adequate  The only thing that was missing was a extractor fan because everytime you used the shower the room steamed up so you need to keep the bathroom door open  One advice is to have a showerbath in the a m  because in the evening there is no hot waterThere is a mini bar in the room and on top of the mini bar are crisps chocolates etc  If you pick them up more than  seconds you will be billed  My advice is before you leave the hotel to return home check that you have not been billed   the same goes for the mini bar   dont open the door more than  seconds You get cleaners coming everyday to replace your towels and generally tidy your room We had a good panaramic view of the Queensborough Bridge and you can see the river obviously depending where your room is There is a cocktail bar on the st floor with a great view of the river and bridge  The waiters are very friendly Also every a m  you can have breakfast on the st floor   which is buffet style   personally I didnt think it was worth the money you better off going to a american dinner which you will get a lot more for your money Downstairs in the lobby you can help yourself to coffee different types and tea anytime you like On the nd floor there is a ice machine  
P => great place We two adults and two children stayed at the Bentley for  nights  Good location very helpful and friendly staff  We liked the or the restaurant the television in the room flat screen the bathroom  If anything we would have liked bigger beds and more storage space  The beds felt quite short considering that we are not even  foot  There was only one small cupboard to hang our clothes  We will probably stay again and ask for a bigger room  
P => Great Place to Stay We recently stayed at the Bentley  This was our first time staying in the city and it was because we needed to visit the hospital there  The hotel was very good clean and pretty spacious  We stayed in a suite so my son had his own room and TV  restaurant was good  Breakfast was good too but mostly convenient  Only thing is parking is very tight in underground garage so dont bring a huge SUV or car as the ceilings are tight and so is the entrance  Other than that we will stay again  
P => Great value in NYC What started bad ended fantastic  When we were shown to our original room it was not cleaned yet  Our bellman was extremely apologetic and we were upgraded to a corner room  I would recommend asking for a corner room they are floor to ceiling windows that give you spectacular views of the East river and the Upper East side as well as Roosevelt Island  The Roosevelt Island tram floating by every so often is a nice touch as well  The furnishings and or are very modern and stylish and the front desk is very helpful they arranged a limousine service for us to get back to Newark Airport that was quite reasonable  Have a drink at the rooftop bar for amazing views  I really enjoyed the Upper East Side location  It was kind of nice to be away from all the glam glitz and fast pace of Midtown  Explore the Upper East Side neighborhoods there are very quaint and full of great bars and restaurants  For the money you cant beat this hotel  
P => Bentleys the Best Having read some of the reviews on this site I have to admit I was a little worried but after  great nights in the Bentley I should have not worried The staff were very friendly and helpfull the room was very clean and comfortablenot on the large size but with ampull room for  people The hotel is situated in a good area although not central it is only a short walk to the subwayCentral Park and th Avenue and you can soon be in the centre of the action within a couple of minutes As somebody else has said there is a great diner just a block away that is open  hours that we used most of the  days we were there although I cannot remember the name sorry We ventured up to the resturant and bar on the top floor and although we did not have a meal we did have a drink and the view of the bridge at night was great To round our stay off as we were checking out the porter recommened we use there limo back to the airport as it was only a couple of bucks more than the yellow taxis charge and it was a nice way to finish our st visit to the Big Apple So to sum up    great hotel   great price   no smells in the lift    no smells from the petrol station round the corner    great staff  
P => great place to stay we went to new york on uary  this year and stayed at the bentley hotel  this was our first time to the states and we didnt really know what to expect  we were delighted with the hotel when we arrived  the reception staff were very friendly and helpful  sam the doorman was great and when asked for advice on anything he was always very obliging  the hotel has a  hour cappucino bar in the lobby we would get a pastry from starbucks or one of the many bakeries and go back to the hotel for a late nite cuppa  there is a bar at the top of the hotel with a walk around veranda which gives amazing views  the hotel is orated in neutralnatural colours throughout  they will arrange transport to the airport in one of their sedans which are more comfortable and cheaper than a yellow cab tolls are included in the price but you still have to tip the driver  although a walk is needed to get to the main attractions we didnnt mind   lets face it youre never going to be close to everything you want to see  great little bar on nd and first ave called beckys   great food friendly staff  tram ways diner on th and second great for breakfast  would go to this hotel again  
P => Nice comfortable stay Id basically like to echo much of what was said below by grimnod   pretty much exactly how we judged the place too Our room was very comfortable with a great view over the East River and the Queensborough Bridge   be sure to ask for a room on the upper floors facing the river to make sure you get this We didnt really see a problem with the lighting in the hallway and lifts pardon the pun   if you cant find your way to the door and the key slot then get your eyes checkedThe only other slight gripe would be that the walls were a little thin with conversation and TV noise from next door being a little irritating  But if youre tired from your day of sightseeing then it shouldnt be enough to stop you from nodding offAll in all it was a good value good quality hotel for us and wed definitely consider staying there again on our next visit to the city  
P => Great Place to Stay My partner and I have stayed in this hotel twice and had a very good experience both times  The staff were very friendly the rooms were clean and the restaurant was good excellent views  It is basically very good value We will be travelling to NYC in il and will be staying at the Bentley  
P => Would Stay again The Bentley appears from the outside to have been an office block at one time and is situated over a petrol station  Dont let this description put you off though The room we had was of a ent size with a great view over the East river and the th street bridgecable car  It was clean and had air con with a reasonable bathroom  The room was warm and comfortable even though it was freezing outside The hotel is in a safe neighbourhood which is mainly residential  That being said it is only a minutes walk to st Avenue where you will find restaurants and diners for something to eat I recommend Ritz Diner for breakfast and Angels Italian restaurant for a nice evening meal I dont know if there are many no go areas anymore but we didnt feel intimidated at all when walking around  just use common sense The previous reviews were correct the lift lights are very dim and you have to peer at the buttons to find your floor number Not all rooms have safes and even if you request one it isnt guaranteed The only down side is that the hotel is quite a walk to everything central park is about  blocks Times Square is about  blocks in total etc so we found it best to walk to our destination and taxi back  i suppose that is why it is so reasonably priced  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again  
P => Not the best I stayed at that hotel for  days and was a bit scared of people comments about it  Well I was disappointed intead  The corridor come out of an horror movie  It is so dark that I had trouble to insert the key in the door  It was kind of funny  The area is not nice at all and I had a bad experience outside the hotel  Not to recommend for a woman on her own  I had a view on the garbage next to the animal hospital  Otherwise people were friendly and really helpful  A bad experience is always an experience but I wont go back to that hotel  I much prefer staying at the Central Park hotel  
P => Okay but have stayed at better  We stayed here from   uary  The public areas of the hotel are nice as were the staff  The rooms were small but fine for their purpose however there is very little storage   only a very small wardrobe and one draw   no bedside draws etc so not much room to unpack for two people  The mini bar and snack tray is oversized when you consider the size of the room and instantly charge your room if you remove an item for longer than  seconds  So nowhere to keep drinks cold   Cleaning service etc was good however the shower always ran cold icy in the evenings which was not great as it was very cold outside  On reporting this we were told they had not heard of this problem before but Ive read this on previous reviews   The rooftop restaurant and bar were good but extremely overpriced    for a salad pasta dish and  soft drinks   we could get the same for  in Times Square  The hotel is just lacking a certain something   but is fine if you intend to be out most of the time and dont mind cold showers  
P => Great Hotel It was my first visit to NYC and I couldnt have picked a better hotel to stay in  The staff were very friendly and helfpul and the rooms were immaculate  The hotel itself is very stylish and the rooftop restraunt has amazing views of the city  I would definatly stay here again and would most certainly recommend this hotel  
P => good basic accommodation The room was fine  Small but clean and in good condition  Everything worked  The hotel is in a bad location on a busy corner  It is dark and the service is nothing special  Still it is a clean basic accommodation  
P => Too out of the way and way too dark Was a bit disappointed with this hotel its in a pretty unappealing location right at the foundations of the th Street Bridge  For a shorty like me it was a good  mins to the nearest subway   which is fine during the day but meant we were using taxis all the time at night  We were on the th floor and as most people have said the corridors are really dark  I guess Im just not a fan the modern look as everything looked like quotoffice furniturequot to me  The bed was comfortable and everything was clean enough  Was very surprised on the first morning when I was told I had to run the hot water for about  mins before hot water came out The coffee in the lobby was welcome and I can definitely recommend The Ritz Diner nearby  Next time Ill go for a more central hotel but I guess if you like quiet modern hotels then this would be ok  
P => Still ok for the money Great location  Nonchalant Staff Stayed at this hotel for two nights last week  Hotel is not as great as it was in the years past when we stayed in NYC  The staff has changed more nonchalant than I remember  Front desk slow to respond to couple having heated argument about a cell phone at  a m  on our floor which kept everyone on the th floor awake for hours  Staff was not very friendly or helpful with directions to Newark Airport either  We booked for night   standard room thru Orbitz  Good price for the locationroom but the quality of the hotel has definitely changed since our visits a few years ago  Bathroom could use a little tarnish remover and a good scrubbing around the tilescaulking of tub  Toilet ran continuously during our stay  TVs are a bit outdated but they get all the cable stations that you  want to seealbeit who goes to NYC to watch tv  Parking is limited in the underground parking lot lot around corner from hotel on next one way street that is run by a private parking company  a pop   no valet Not a bad walk over to th AvePark Ave  Good view of the skylift to Roosevelt Island  I would consider another stay if I could get the same type of rates  
P => fab hotel best bargain in NY At first I was horrified that the hotel was right next to a gas station but walking into the lobby I was suprised by how classy the hotel was  The views from the rooftop restaurant are amazing and the  hour cappucino bar is definitely a plus  The rooms were spacious for NY clean and the view was great  I would definitley recommend this place the only issues were that the water in the shower was lukewarm at best and the room service was way overpriced  go to a nearby restaurant instead  
P => Trying a bit too hard to be hip I liked this hotel but it has some shortcomings it ought to address  While my corner room was fresh spacious and nicely orated in a contemporary style and had a comfortable bed the three roman blinds covering the enormous glass windowed walls did not extend all the way down  They stopped  inches short of the window sills along two walls creating a broad opening half way around the room negating a sense of privacy  With apartment buildings across the way this is an issue  The long wide opening also made the room very bright in the early morning and sleeping beyond dawn difficult  One blind was broken and stayed permanently lowered so that I could not lift it at all  The other two went up easily giving me a beautiful view up and down First Avenue and with it a feeling of real delight in being back in New York Whoever designed the elevators was trying too hard to be hip and lost sight of common sense  The cars are painted black inside and are ridiculously poorly lit  They have tiny low watt recessed lights one in each corner of the ceiling making them very dark   especially at night   and making it hard to see the buttons to operate them  Hallways tend to be too dark as well and the vases hung on the walls seem to loom out of nowhere which is an odd feeling  If the halls were better lit it would be easier to appreciate the smaller vases hung on each door with a single flower in them  Hip and dark at night clubs are one thing but dark elevators and halls are not suitable for a hotel when travelers are often tired or jet lagged  Although The Bentley offers dinner room service it does not offer breakfast nor does it have coffee makers in the room  Fortunately the Ritz Diner is jast a block away for a very New York eating experience  Its fun almost like being in a TV or movie set The hotel seems to be popular with Europeans and is a comfortable walking distance to excellent shopping restaurants and major hospitals  
P => Great hotel I stayed for three nights at The Bentley and had a great trouble free stay  The hotel staff were curtious and were very helpful with anything I asked  I didnt get the view of the bridge but I guess that is just the luck of the draw and also attributed to the fact that I didnt request itThe room itself was spacious and clean  The bathroom was in very good condition and also very clean  Good water pressure and alway warm water  Spotless clean   The location of the hotel is close to the East river  It took me about  minutes to walk to Central Park  The neighborhood is safe and there was very little noise from the streets  I would recommend this to others and would stay here again myself  
P => Great Hotel I had booked my stay for the cel Hotel but since they were having a plumbing problem weve been moved to the Bentley  Its not so central as the cel but still in a walking distance to the central park or fifht avenue and in a much quiter zone  There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and a subway station two three quarter away  The room was great large and fashion  Everything was always clean and the room service worked always perfectly  The bathroom was not very small and not to old  Only the shower was not so good  The staff was always pleasant and in the lobby there is a free capuccino and expresso machine  I really recomend this hotel  
P => Disappointing The room was a ent size with a spectacular view of the Queensboro bridge however there were a few problems  The only time there was hot water was first thing in the morning   at other times during the day and evening the water was at best lukewarm hallways were very dark I had requested a smoking room but was unable to get an ashtray as my stay went on the supply of towels dwindled until I only had one bath towel left in the room no hand towels or facecloths  The towels and sheets also smelled kind of funny   they were clean but didnt really smell clean  I had booked two deluxe rooms for a colleague and myself and my colleagues room was much smaller and didnt have a fridge and microwave  I know some of this stuff is picky but for a  per night hotel even in New York the Bentley was disappointing  Would I stay here again Only if I was desperate and couldnt find another hotel in Manhattan  
P => GREAT HOTEL For our first time in NYC we couldnt have picked a better hotel for the price  The location was good not very central but if you dont mind walking a short distance through the beautiful streets of east side to the Subway then it s perfect  The Bar on the st floor was great the staff wonderful and the views from the outside k brilliant All the staff were helpful friendly and   accommodating I would return to the Bentley in a shot 
P => It is definitely a  Star but nice and clean We stayed at the Bentley Hotel for  nights  We had read all the reviews so requested rooms as high as we could get but we didnt arrive till pm so there wasnt much going  The male receptionist who was initially a little frosty but soon warmed up gave us some rooms on the th floor then moved us to the th floor Our room was right across from the lifts but actually I never heard the lifts at all or people in the corridor  The only unfortunate thing was we had an adjoining locked door to the next room and some mad scottish woman was in there who not only spoke loudly but smoked as well so we had the smell coming through the adjoining door When we had first arrived in the room it smelled very strongly of cleaning fluids then as that wore off I realised we were in a smoking room but it wasnt too bad as we didnt spend too much time in our room really The bathrooms were clean plenty of clean towels left and the beds made every day  Our room overlooked the corner of East nd and st Ave and it seemed to be the thoroughfare for the bridge  The noise of the traffic itself is like a background hum which you soon get used to but the worse thing is the honking  I was awoken at am our first morning due to this and the worst of it goes on till about am  Rush Hour I guess as at the weekend it was quieterNearest tube Metro station was only  diagonal blocks taxies were easy to get right outside the hotel Central Park was walking distance  Taxi Fare to Time Square was approx  Metro Fare  for all day travel  Be aware when travelling by taxi that you need to give yourself plenty of time due to traffic hold ups  We nearly missed the start of our Broadway Show There are some ent restaurants and bars quite close to the Hotel we discovered OFlanaghans quite by accident and had an absolutely magnificent steak cooked to perfection then a band came on at pm and we ended up staying till am brilliant night  The lead singer of the band used to sing with FatBack Band terrific music  The hallways are moody the free coffee and tea in reception was very welcome and the staff were helpful  The room we had was small but looking at some of the pictures on this site there are bigger better rooms  I think it is just luck of the draw unless you have actually paid more for a deluxe room Would I stay there again Mmmmm I think I might pay the extra and go for a  or  star hotel but for backpackers and travellers on a budget this is just perfect  
P => good deal for new york Overall my experience was good  My boyfriend and I got a great last minute deal through expedia for   a night and we booked the week before  I shoudl note that in New York hotel prices arent fixed so you could pay this much for one week and  a night another week  Bizarre  Anyway the hotel is in a great location  nd and York right by the th Street Bridge  Though the area does not appear residential when you arrive it is if you walk one block to st street where there are tons of restaurants and stores lots of pizza places to the south of the bridge  We loved walking most places  The nearest subway stop is a bit of a walk  minutes at rd and th its actually the Lexington and th street stop but there is an entrance on third and from there you can go just about anywhere  I like staying in this area because you get a real feel for new york  The hotel itself is modern looking and the staff are friendly  upon arrival our bags were taken immediately and we could check in right away at  pm  we were upgraded to a king sized bed from a queen  The room was a ent size with teeny tiny but nice bathroom  I was surprised by the lack of a safe  especially since there was a space for one but when we asked the front desk they told us that only about  rooms had safes  that bothered me being in new york at what was designed to look like a fancy boutique hotel  We had to ask twice for towels when the shower sprayed outside teh curtain and soaked one but otherwise the room was clean and comfortable and nice to stay in though with a dimly lit bathroom  Also the elevators and hallways were dimly lit  dark would almost be a better descrtiption  with a weird flower motif but thats them trying to be trendy and it was more entertaining than anything else  Overall i was very please staying in the area so inexpensively this is the second time ive stayed and i would definitely stay again  Good for people who want to see what its like living in manhattan rather than staying downtown  also coffee and tea in lobby is great and if you take a cab from laguardia make sure to tell them to take the th street bridge 
P => Absolutely loved the Bentley The Bentley Hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood about ten minutes walk from the th street subway Bloomingdales and about twenty minutes to central park  The rooms are really big  we had two double beds and we hadnt asked for a superior room The view was absolutely spectacular  over the Queensboro bridge  we had room   The staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel was of a very high standard and was unbelieveable value  I cant recommend this place enough  we got a good deal on expedia   nights for just over    The roof bar has the most amazing view over Manhattan  We would not stay anywhere else if we visit New York again    
P => Good price for New York  Hi just recently stayed at The Bentley t th th The hotel downstairs was very clean and airy and free coffee in lobby nice touch Bedrooms  we stayed on the th floor and the views were excellent but the room could do with a refurb in my opinion  Not enough hanging space also Staff very nice and friendly and the location in my opinion was very good a  minute walk to Central Park and Fifth Avenue away from all the hustle and bustle Did not hear a thing from the gas station or animal hospital air conditioning was noisy just take ear plugs  
P => Fantastic hotel   dont believe the negative comments My friend and I stayed at the hotel for  nights from tember st  We loved the Bentley   we stayed in room  with fantatstic views of the uptown part of the city  The room was spacious and extremely clean  double beds which were so comfortable  We had no problems with the petrol station or the animal hospitalambulance despatch like some people have listed   you have to remember it is New York after all you cannot expect to have the place totally quiet  The staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to help with any questions getting taxis etc  The rooftop bar is fantastic and was a great way to start the evening off The tea and coffee in the lobby was a nice touch also  The only TINY thing I could fault was the hanging space not so much of it  All in all we had a fantastic stay here and we would definitely stay at the Bentley again  
P => Once we got the right room it was great This being our first trip to new york or the US for that matter I did a lot of internet research to find the best hotel in our pricerange and I finally chose the Bentley  TROUBLEWhen we got to the hotel the staff asked us if we wanted a smokers or a non smokers room although we had already booked a non smoking room  Turns out that the non smoking rooms were all booked and we were offered to stay one night in a smokers room and then have a non smoking room the next night  Actually we told them that we would check the room out and then ide The room smelled a lot like cleaning products but not so much of smoke so we agreed to stay there for one night  Although I wonder what would have happened if we had refused   In the morning however when the smell of cleaning products had disappeared we could definately smell the smoke to the point that our clothes smelled of it  We notified the staff and they gave us another room when we were out that day  It worked out OK for us but for someone sensitive to smoke this is unacceptable   ROOMSWe had the chance to try out two rooms during our stay  The first one was on the ninth floor facing the queensborough bridge the other one was on the th floor straight above the first room but with an additional window towards the East River  My guess is that this window is there from floor  and above We booked a deluxe room since it was actually cheaper than the standard room at the time but the first room we stayed in was probably a STANDARDroom  It had a microwave oven a combined CD player and alarm clock a quot TV a closet an ironing board and possibly an flatiron  I guess the second room we got was a DELUXE room not a suite because in addition to the standard room it had a flatiron a fridge a sink with faucet a safe great and a complimentary glossy magazine Oh and both rooms have air conditioning with onoff switch hot or cold air  Its a bit noisy but it does the job Otherwise both rooms are clean the furniture is stylish and comfortable the bathroom is clean too and from what I understand above NY standard   SERVICEThere are always staff in the Lobby and theyre alwas helpful and nice  The rooms were cleaned every day  The library in the stylish lobby offers free newspapers and tourist information and there is a self service coffee bar where you can get regular tea or coffee espresso cappucino different varieties of af and so on from a machine with fresh coffee beans and fresh milk  Its nice to have a cup when you come home from an exhausting day of sightseeing  We visited the rooftop bar only during daytime but the view was stunning   LOCATIONIf youre used to walking like we are walking to central park is easy even if its hot out and takes about  mins if you walk slowly  The hotel is close to bloomingdales and other shopping on Lexington ave where theres also a subway station  The blocks around th street  st ave have a lot of good restaurants and a couple of cool shops inluding Terence Conran  The neighbouhood is otherwise pretty quiet and an extra bonus is sitting in your hotel room watching boats pass by 
P => absolutely brilliant we stayed here for  nights in ust  and it was great the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful  we arrived at  pm and although you cant officially book in till pm they said our room was ready sadly when we went up it wasnt but after a quick phone call to reception we were immediately upgraded to a king size room with a fantastic view of the queensborough bridge  the rooms were very very clean and comfortable and always made up when we got back from sightseeing  the hotel is situated in an area away from most of the hustle and bustle of new york but it really is a short walk into the centre  we walked everywhere without any problems apart from the incessant rain we wouldnt have seen half the sights we saw if we had stayed in say times square walking down madison avenue on a sunday afternoon with it all closed off for a street ket was fantastic the diners in the area were great for breakfast try ritz diner or the baker street bar cocktail with tom cruise was filmed here when it was tgi fridays angels italian restaurant was also great value and fantastic food wine is a bit pricey in new york generally but not by much  all in all it was just a fab holiday and new york is a fab place we would definitely stay here again 
P => Misleading websites We stayed at the Bentley for  nights  We had requested a high floor which we knew couldnt be guarenteed but after reading several websites that commented on how wonderful the views were we thought theyd be better higher up The room we were given was on the th floor and looked out at the building across the road  not the wonderful city or river view we expected  We spoke to the reception desk who passed us straight to the manager who was great  They empathised and said although they couldnt change us that night it would be possible the next day  All we had to do was leave our packed luggage in the room and it would be taken to our new room which would be ready for us on our return from our day out  The new room was on the th floor and overlooked the Queensboro bridge with views down the river  that night we sat and watched the thunderstorm over Queens it was so much better The new room was also one of the bigger rooms although the size of the other was nothing to complain about  The larger rooms have king size beds compared to queendouble in the others  The larger rooms also have an in room safe which the others didnt have  There was a sign on the reception desk that said if you booked with one certain website they upgraded you automatically and just to have the inroom safe would make it worth it The only thing we would comment on is there isnt much wardrobe space in the rooms but we coped fineThe views from the bar at the top of the hotel are wonderful and you can take your drinks outside to get a better view  very romanticIn response to some of the other reviews  the halls arent dark they have mood lighting  The ice machine is down steps between floors  and  which isnt ideal but isnt a problem at all  The free coffee is in a room off the lobby and is a machine which if you need coffee in a morning on your way out or something on your way in after a long day is great The staff were all very friendly and helped us with all our questions and queries about the area The hotel is out of town but absolutely fine if you dont mind walking  we walked everywhere There is a bus stop around the corner and the subway is about  blocks away Yes the hotel is next to a petrol station and the animal hospital but we were never bothered by either of them There is a great diner just a couple of blocks from the hotel that stays open hours and has cheap lunchtime meals  highly recommended We would definately go back and stay at the Bentley again  a great comfortable hotel which saved us a whole load of money just by us being willing to walk into the centre of the city instead of staying thereWe would certainly recommend it  just dont expect the promised views 
P => Very happy with our stay We arrived at the Bentley Hotel before pm and as expected our room was not ready yet but the pleasant staff was happy to hold our bags for us as we headed on out for a lunch and a brief tour of the area Upon our return we received the keys to our room and scooted on up to the th floor  As many people have mentioned in their reviews the hallways are dark  This is the ambiance that the hotel is going for but even we a creative couple in our late s found it too dark to even read our room number  Alas we found our room and were pleased  Super clean modern and a nice view of the Queensboro Bridge  Great room size and the air conditioning worked well to cool us off in the F heat  The shower temperature and pressure were great When we returned from exploring the city every night our room was always nicely cleaned up for us  New hand and body towels new soap and shampoo    however our face cloth was never replaced after the first day not that we really caredThe other minor inconvenience we had was that our key cards suddenly stopped working on the th day  No idea why but we went down to the front desk and they apologized but fixed the problem All in all the front desk staff were always pleasant and the valetfront door men were always happy and smiling Many of you say that the location is too far from everything however you can hop on the M bus and it will take you into the hub of things  New York is best seen on foot I think anyway  Tons of great restaurants and a comedy club are easily within walking distance  We found the Ritz Diner to be very convenient and open  hours with an ATM as well The rooftop terrace and restaurant were quite nice  Good cocktails and the service was prompt  We had dinner one night and the food was quite good try the steak at a reasonable price The rooftop terrace had great views but be careful walking on the planks    they were very rickety  We also found that a lot of the furniture in the lobby and the rooms side tables chairs couches in the lobby were a bit worn and could use an upgrade but were still in presentable shape We found the hotel very quiet at night in our rooms no noise from other rooms  The snack and drink machines were always sparse when we had late night munchies but the Mobil station just on the corner proved a better replacement anyway  Unlike some other reviews we did not find the ambluance dispatch center to be a nuisance at all All in all this hotel suited our needs perfectly and we had a great stay  Would recommend it and consider staying here again for sure  
P => Budget hotel that didn t look like a budget hotel We had a pleasant stay in a clean spacious room with large window  The hotel is located in a quiet upscale residential neighborhood  Bus   stops right by the hotel  The metro station is a bit far  long blocks with slight uphill bus   doesn t go that direction but you ll have to go to that area to find food  Tiring walk in heatraincold or after a whole day of excursion Our room was on rd floor facing a busy street and theres an ambulance dispatch center next door so it got quite noisy with honking and sirens sometimes  I was too tired to be bothered by it but light sleepers will probably suffer I d recommend you go have a drink one night on the roof top bar  Its quiet and the view of the city and Queensboro Bridge is beautiful This is a budget hotel in NY standard that looked upscale  Would I stay there again be  I will look for one in a more convenient location first  
P => We enjoyed our stay My boyfriend and I chose The Bentley because we were on a budget for this vacation  I was very happy with our choice  The lobby was welcoming to me and I loved the contemporary feel of the hotel  Our room was very clean and had everything we needed  We did have a problem dialing out of our hotel room one night but the hotel staff were very polite friendly and helpful  They solved the problem immediately  We loved having evening drinks at the rooftop lounge with a beautiful view of the Queensboro bridge  The parking was on location and was only  a day  Which is good for NYC The hotel is in a quieter section of NYC about  blocks from Central Park  I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling on a budget we were very happy and would go there again  
P => Great Hotel This is the nd time Ive stayed at the Bentley and again it was brilliant  Stayed in room  Yes the air conditioning is a bit noisy but works well  the room was a great size and house keeping was tooa great standard The hotel is on east nd street so isnt right in the middel of things but the neighbourhood is gorgeous with plenty of resturants and shops  Bloomingdales is only a couple of blocks away  And a tax ride to the otherside of Manhattan was only  I stayed in the hotel for  days and dont have a bad word to say about it and for the rates this hotel is a gem 
P => Bentley is best We stayed at the Bentley for  nights in uary and it was fantastic  The room  was huge with  televisions one in the lounge area and one in the bedroom  Staff were friendly and helpful and our room was spotless and cleaned daily with fresh towels  The bed was really comfy and there was plenty of room for storing all of our shopping The only downside was that the restaurant was closed during our stay but there are so many lovely places to eat nearby that we didnt really notice  Try Serendipity  on East th street   only  minutes walk away  The Ritz diner just up the road was also brilliant for breakfast  Bloomingdales is only minutes away and Central Parkth Avenue within  mins walk  All in all a brilliant hotel in a great location and I cant wait to go back  
P => Great Hotel Just got back at the weekend from a four night stay at the Bentley e   Our twin bedded room was number  in the centre of the building  It was a good size with large windows and an excellent view from the th Floor facing York Avenue  Both the bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean and cleaned every day with fresh towels  Staff were friendly and there when you needed them but otherwise left you alone  Check in and check out was very quick and hassle free  Sometimes the lobby is full of schooltravel groups but they were not there for long  The lifts were very slow to arrive on the ground floor especially if the third one was being reserved for staff only which made things very difficult on occasion Yes lighting is dim in the hallway and lifts but so what The airconditioning in our room was very noisy possibly left over from the buildings days as an office block  We turned it off at night  Could sometimes hear noise from other rooms especially where we had an interconnecting door but it didnt go on late and we could only hear it near the window Bring a face cloth with you as only one provided for the room  We brought a travel kettle as coffee available from the lobby which is fine when you are returning from a day out but not good for first thing in the morning The walk of  blocks to Central Park is a nice one and not too far  Cabs are cheap to anywhere touristy and it is nice to stay in a hotel in a quieter residential area  We had breakfast every morning at the Ritz Dinner which is on st Avenue one block up nd street directly from the Hotel  Very convenient  Go after am when the rush is over  Lots of places to eat on st and nd Avenues  We didnt eat or drink at the restaurant but the view was amazing and it seemed a very relaxing place to spend an evening I would definately stay at the Bentley again  I loved it and wish I was there still  
P => Great Hotel  silence is golden I am in NYC minimum once a month and this is one of the better hotels I have experienced I am fed up with huge bland busy and noisy places downtown or in the horrible madness that is midtown so this place was a nice change King sized bed  large room for NYC  Beautifully presented  nice linens not some ghastly floral print bedsheets from the s like in some places and the ble bathroom was nice too HUGE windows  with in my case a partial view due to it being a lower floor of the east river and the th st bridge Aircon was good hot weekend   and anyone who cant work out that the aircon controls are under a little flap on the unit shouldnt be allowed out in public unsupervisedThe lighting in the elevators halls and rooms is fantastic  Makes a very refreshing change to have some easy on the eye soft lights instead of some stupidly bright strip lights blaring down on you The absolute best thing about this hotel is it is QUIET Its not in midtown  so its not noisy  Low traffic noise thick windows and it seemed to attract a quieter class of customer  I slept like a log and was not woken once  which   if youve never stayed in manhattan before you will have to trust me on this  is a luxury Its a quiet more residential area  but a cab to tourist things is not much Its exactly  blocks crosstown to Central park for your early morning run which is nothing   be  mins walk if you are slow   crosstown blocks to bloomingdales and to the F train Its an excellent location I find the upper east side is classier and quieter See my pictures  taken from the th floor room   the view is better from the higher floors and make sure you visit the bar or restaurant on the st floor  The terrace on the bar is great  as are the views of the bridge and river Cheaper quieter and classier than the majority of hotels in manhattan  I will be staying here again for sure  
P => Almost Perfect I had arrived at the bentley around  p m  really worried that i was going to get a bad room but was quite suprised to find a spacious clean spotless modern simple and elegent room  I booked a delux room  The huge mirror infront of the bed was a bonus   The view of the bridge was amazing  They gave me plenty of towels more than i needed  I would say the best thing in the room was my king size bed my body melted right into it that i found it hard to get up in the mornings  The spotless white linens were so comfy  The ble bathroom was a perfect size for NY  The ceiling was really high  I personally loved it because it was on the upper east side and was in a quite area  If youre looking to be around the times square area and do the tourist thing then youre looking to spend a little more cab money  The only disadvantage i would say is that the walls are pretty thin i could hear my neighbours blabbing the night away  I could hear the elevators and the people in the hallway too  But it is NY and i thought it was a minor set back  Oh and some people complained that the elevator and hallway was pitch dark but i thought it was sexy it goes with the whole vibe of the place  All in all i was very pleased the staff was friendly and the room was just right  
P => Almost a boutique hotel but not quite I would actually prefer to be able to give a   but since that isnt an option I will round up  For the price point I feel that The Bentley is an exceptional value and offers a good choice for travelers however it misses the k in the quest to be a boutique hotel on a number of levels  Stayed there il    as part of a group tour so I had no control over the booking or honestly I wouldnt have picked the hotel due to the terrible location for tourists  There is no easy way to get anywhere from The Bentley other than a taxi  the good news is that taxy rides to anywhere that a tourist wants to go are fairly cheap  We came home from the Empire State Building for example for about  and Times Square for less than that  The nearest subway stations are about   minute walks uphill  Not for the faint of heart or for those without some good walking shoes Enough about that though  The hotel itself  The lobby is lovely  Very spacious and welcoming with plenty of seating and a nice alcove off to the left  The staff was very gracious and freindly at all times and more than happy to help when we needed cabs or help with luggage etc  No complaints there  The espresso bar is a nice touch but it doesnt open until  a m which is ridiculous since they dont have any type of coffee service available in the rooms either and there is no ket or cafe close by  First strike against The Bentley The elevators are incredibly dark to the point one has to squint to see the buttons  I dont think this is a particularly safe choice when you think about being crowded in there with a bunch of strangers but I was willing to overlook this  However I wasnt so willing to overlook the baffling choice to use one of the elevators as a service elevator first thing in the morning which put it totally out of commission for the guests  This left the guests with only two elevators  That might have sufficed under normal conditions however one of those was not working so the guests were left with one elevator during the busiest time of the day  Inexcusable  This was remedied by the evening and not a problem during the rest of our stay The halls on some floors were very dark  the second one especially but most of the upper floors that I visited were better lit although none were glaring  The rooms were exceptionally clean and well appointed for the price point  My room was   It had two double bed a small console with drawers for the television and two very comfortable chairs arated by a small table with the ice bucket and glasses beside the large window  The windows had Roman shades that were easy to operate  I had a view of the river and bridge and was high enough to hear only the most strident of horns and street traffic  The highway noise was not a problem nor was the construction going on next door  The lighting was inadequate in my room over the chairs but other rooms had a hanging fixture in that area  There was a small closet with wooden hangers and an iron and ironing board  The ironing board was literally wedged in and it took me several minutes to remove it from above the clothes bar  It was missing one of the rubber foot protectors and I was lucky not to gash my hand  A simple ironing board hanger on the back of the closet would have done wonders  There was no place to store a large suitcase at all  The closet was too small and no valet of any sort was provided  Strike two  I had to leave my case in a pile in the floor for the stay  Had there been more than one in the room this would have been very cumbersome  The drawer space was inadequate to unpack for a four day stay  There was no safe and none available at the front desk  Only rooms from the th floor and up have safes  Strike three The bathroom was ble and had an assortment of Gilchrist and Soames toiletries and such  There was a hairdryer as well  What was missing though was more telling  There was only ONE washcloth  For a double room that could concievably sleep four people  I thought that was odd but little did I know it was also a fluke  For the rest of my stay there were NO washclothes delivered  None  Zero  I washed my face using one of the two hand towels provided  There were only three bath towels  Again supposed four people were there and some in our group did have four in a room  Strike four The linens on the bed were lovely and the beds were comfortable  The CD player and clock were handy to have bedside but the table was very small and space was limited  I had to move the phone in order to put my things on the nightstand  The consolebureau was not positioned in front of the mirror so if there was more than one person trying to get ready in the morning there would have been a problem  The plugs were in odd places too  You have to look for them  In some rooms they are non existant The maid service was good to a point  my robe was folded each day but my wet towels were left hanging on the bathroom door It was like they didnt quite have the script down pat  Strike five The Penthouse restaurant is gorgeous and I suggest that you go up and spend time there  The views are magnificent  The food service is slow but the food was ent  Rooms on the ends of the hotel are larger than those in the middle  if you get a room ending in  expect it to be more narrow and lacking a quotrealquot closet  Those have wardrobes instead  Rooms ending in  or  are good sized Any calls using the phone even with a calling card are   which is not atypical in NYC but not mentioned on their phone anyhere either  I would stay at the Bentley again despite the strikes  they were minor in the overall scheme and for the price you cant beat it  If they fixed the small things then the hotel would be an outstanding value in New York   well if they moved a subway station down to York or st Ave  too  
P => Loved the Bentley I stayed at the Bentley Hotel and found the lobby very inviting  The room was spacious and when I booked on their website I received an upgrade which was an excellent perk  
P => Terrible experience If you stay in this hotel you will need to take several items along A flashlight since there is very little lighting  In the elevator it is so dark you cant see the buttons to push  Take a can of sterno to heat the water since there seems to be a lack of hot water  Take washcloths since you will only be issued one per day for a family of   Be prepared to beg daily for them  It is right on F D R  Drive which is a major construction zone  hours a day  Dont worry about the noise if you use the air conditioning which sounds like a hippo with a stomach ailment  The or is very depressing so be sure and take your antidepressant medicine  The only thing good about this place is the doorman  They are very nice  I guess they felt sorry for us being there  
P => great deal Much better Hotel than I expected I was given a very large king room at no extra charge  Very modern or and very very clean  Check the restaurant too with awesome views of the whole city  Ask for room  for the views  
P => Awesome hotel awesome price We stayed one night at the Bentley I wasnt sure what to expect given some reviews Id read  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly they upgraded us free of charge to a room with a view of the river they held our bags till midnight  they let us check in early and check out late without charge  On top of that parking was convenient and fairly inexpensive for NY  for the whole stay Sunday noon thru Monday midnight The rooms were super clean the beds super comfy the bathrooms were spotless lovely and large with nice toiletries to boot The room itself was pretty big and the blinds kept all the light out so we were in utter darkness in the middle of the city  I didnt notice any excessive noise from inside or outside the hotel  The shower water was hot and the pressure was great  The halls were a bit dark   obviously for atmosphere  with neat light fixtures  One recommendation would be that the hotel consider putting accent lights under the room numbers it was hard to see It was a bit of a chilly walk to some big sites but near to lots of nice restaurants we loved The Cabana Cuban food at st and rd  I used to travel for my job and still attend many conferences so Ive seen lots of hotels in lots of places but for the money this is near the top of my list  It certainly beats the last place I stayed which was the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San DiegoOverall excellent inexpensive friendly convenient It was our first trip to NYC and we will certainly be back and staying at the Bentley 
P => Much better than I expected from reading the reviews  Like some other guests I was a little worried about the Bentley having read some of the reviews  The hotel itself is actually nicely orated and with comfortable and spacious common areas like the lobby with coffee available  Our room was very clean and maintained daily with comfortable beds  The area is fine in fact there is a nice neoghbourhood just up the road with good diners and restaurants  The only down side is the distance from downtown but so long as you are aware and happy with this theres no problem  
P => Thumbs up for The Bentley New York City The Bentley Hotel  Date ch th Reviewer Trip advisor member Scotland UKWe have just returned from a  day shopping trip to NYC and a stay at the Bentley amp stayed in  amp   I have to say that after reading some of the reviews I was a wee bit concerned but we had a lovely stay  The animal hospital was there yes but it didnt infringe on the hotel or our stay AT ALL amp the gas station was on the other side but again NO negative impact  in fact quite handy for late night snacks to go along with the free tea amp coffee that was always available from the libraryThe rooms are immaculate amp ALL of the staff are so friendly amp willing to help you get the most from your stay  Ask Sam or Adda at the door for help they were fab The complimentary body lotion is lovely you should try some  Plenty of fresh towels every dayThe location was nice we felt safe walking at night amp on exploring did get a taste of some real New York living  However I would say that it is quite a way into the centre of the action  Times Square etc and if you are not fully fit amp able for a good  minute walk each way then you need to use the cabs  about  including the tip as even the nearest subway was about   minutes walk  My only negative would be the sound proofing of the rooms This could be improved a little as we could sometimes hear TV amp things from next door but we could have had a deaf neighbour amp this was not through the night or anything Also shame that the roof top restaurant was still closed but you MUST try the Ritz diner just up the hill for breakfast Most importantly would we return to the Bentley Yes 
P => Very Disappointed Im hoping the Bentley is a work in process  The descriptions and pictures on the web are very misleading  The elevators amp hallways are so dark it would be advisable to bring a flashlight  The quotair conditioningquot is actually a heater  be I should have known this but growing up in the south ac means the air coming out of the vent is cooler than the air in the room  The windows dont even open which could have greatly improved the comfort level in the room  There is no roomservice or inhouse restaurant which means no late night or early morning snacks without leaving the hotel  The lobby consists of a couple of couches and a coffee pot  We were disappointed to the point of checking out and losing  days prepaid hotel fees  
P => No free breakfast or wi fi coffee bar serves lowfat milk onsite gas station There hasnt been a quotfreequot breakfast for two years   according to the front desk staff when asked the restaurant was closed for reations  No quotfreequot wi fi internet access  No exercise facility onsite there is a gas station right next to the hotel with coffee water etc  The  hour coffee did not include quotcreamquot only lowfat milk  The quotexpressoquot machine didnt work very well  The hallways and elevator interiors were very dark like a quotnightclubquot not a hotel My room without the advertised view of the bridge or river was located next to the housekeeping which was visited throughout the evening and wee hours with doors slamming etc  The radio was broken and had to be replaced which was done promptly  Windows do not open for fresh air  If you like nice bathrooms and can overlook the rest this is the place for you  The ble bathroom with brand new sinktubglass shower commode was superior  
P => Good hotel After reading some of the reviews for this hotel I was a little worried  I shouldnt have been  The hotel was good staff friendly and rooms were modern and clean  the beds were very comfortable tooYes   there are no breakfast facilitiesYes   the location isnt dead central but not too farbut walking around new york is part of the experience as is sampling all the scrummy breakfasts in the dinersBrooklyn Diner near Carnegie Hall is my favourite We also went on the sex and the city tour   highly recommended  
P => Good Hotel The reviews on NYC hotels vary  Therefore I was not suprised that the Bentley was a ent  star hotel  As always I got a great price from hotels even though it was valentines week which I though would be sky highThe rooms are clean and spacious  The free coffee is excellent and warms you up after spending the day downtown  The bathroom was clean and the shower was hot The hotel is situated near some petrol pumps but cars have to fill up somewhere it is Manhattan A good three star hotel  Great as a base for exploring New York city 
P => Needs To be Reviewed First of all stayed at Bentley Hotel as a Travel Agent for  nights from th  till th   I booked this hotel with one of our suppliers for the price yes and for the fact that on the st floor it showed a beautiful restuarant overlooking the Queensborough Bridge The famous restuarant was still not open for business till now ch even though I rang the hotel in uary and was assured it would be open for Valentines Week After reading all the reports on Trip advisor I have to say I was worried sick on what was going to greet me when i arrived at The Bentley Hotel Yes it is right next to the Animal rescue centre and Yes there is a Gas station right up against the windows of reception  I did a bit of tective work and it seems that the building used to be offices which is why it still looks that way from the outside Inside it is airy in recept and our room  on the th Floor was large but even that high up with only single glazing the traffic noise is terrible The bathroom was beautifully laid out and the piping hot water was nice too but with the lack of any extractor fan in the bathroom as soonas you opened the door the whole bedroom would fill with steam and hence huge amounts of condensation filled the room  Now normally you would think thats ok I will open the window but not here there was no wsmall window at all just  huge single glazed windows The heating worked on a mind of its own staying there for the worst cold spell this year it wasnt even luke warm and on the days it reached f outside we came into the room with the heating on full Most descriptions give teh Bentley stating mini bars yes you get the cupboard where it should be but no bar and as no restuarant there was little else to do but eat out all the time The free coffee machine in reception hardley ever worked and the bar for recption is a ble slab with a man sitting behind it with a few infact  bottles of spirits and a bucket withabout  bottles of beer in it I was not amused as were many of the americans staying at the hotel also Aside from all this the cleaning of our room was perfect and the bed was fanstatic to sleep in   But as for giving the hotel     I would find that very hard t do be    but no more than that I travel the globe with my job and it certainly didnt come up to the standards that I was held to believe it had in both its offical description and its star rating Depending on how many red lights you were held up with the Lexington subway was   mins walk Diners Burger HeavenTramway Dinner Try Michael Jordans restuarant at Grand central but be prepared very  Another good place th amp XX restuarant If it was a choice of The Bentley or another hotel I am afraid it would have to be another simply because the standards are not up to scratch Liam                   We will be adding a proper photograpgh of the outside of the hotel shortly  
P => nice value  Besides the staff being wonderful and offering me an upgrade because space was available this hotel has a lot going for it  Easy access to FDR drive with a gas station out front  Clean bathroom  Nice sheets Changing temperature in room no problem  Suites twicesize of most in NY  Walk  blocks west to nd Ave take   bus downtown  Furniture is old but Ive seen far worse  
P => Fantastic Hotel Me and a friend stayed at the Bentley Hotel in ember and we thought it was excellent the staff were very friendly and helpful  The room was clean and tidy and the view was amazing  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking somewhere to stay in New York  
P => Sophisticated little boutique hotel We booked this hotel with what I thought was a low price online but rebooked an even lower rate the next day depite having to pay a cancellation fee I hadnt read that fine print carefully enough  I have to admit we were worried that the price was so incredibly low  Sat  and  Sun  pre taxes that we thought it would be a dump but the location was just around the corner from where we had business on this trip and the photos and reviews were appealing so we took a chance  The outside appearance on arrival did nothing to dispel that impression but suprisingly the rooms were clean and sophisticated and the linens were lovely  I wont sleep anywhere without a covering over the bedding and I also appreciated the fresh sheeting that protected the headboard  Blessedly the showerhead had more power than any Ive ever had in New York in four star luxury hotels  It is true their hallways are very dark  but not in a gloomy sense    it has more to do with the sophisticated lighting effect that the hotel designer wanted  My only complaint was that the small hotel lobby and outside its doors were populated by youthful travelers  a lot of them smoking  not a very upscale lot of people   you would not want to have a business meeting in the lobby  But if you only need a clean comfortable esthetically pleasing room and dont necessarily need the ammenities of a four star hotel this little boutique hotel fits the bill  In size ammenity and or the Bentley reminded me a lot of four star family run hotels in Europe  Our view wasnt terrific they do have rooms with better views but we had selected our room based on the strongest internet connection  daily which worked perfectly  Had we not paid we still would have had a choice of dozens of unprotected but slow wifis to pick from  One caveat the restaurant is currently closed for reations but it is due to reopen in ch  That wasnt a problem for us   First Ave  is only a block away with tons of fabulous restaurants  our faves  Portofino Foccaccio and Manhattan Grill  Would we stay there again Yes if we had business nearby  This hotel is part of a chain of boutique hotels across the city  wed even consider trying their other hotels depending on the purpose of our trip  
P => Great Find IN NYC As my Husband and I live out in the far reaches of Brooklyn we thought it might be fun to rent a hotel for the weekend whilst we had friends from overseas in town  Having read all the reviews on the Tripadvisor site I ided to give the Bentley a try although to be honest in the back of my mind I was somewhat skeptical about any hotel in Manhattan that was only  a night on Hotels  What a pleasant suprise The rooms were large airy and most importantly CLEAN This place is truly a bargain  Probably NOT the best choice for true tourists as it is a little bit out of the way and the nearest subway is somewhat of a hike BUT bang for the buck it is a great option for people on a budget  
P => Holiday of a lifetime New York City  The City that never Sleeps and thats exactly what it is  Its Amazing an experience of a lifetime My partner took me for my th Birthday in il  and i loved every single minute of it The weather was gorgeous and so was the atmosphere and everyday life in New York There are so many places to see and shop  But beware you need at least  k spending money for ppl for  week We are currently saving this year to visit again in ember for his st Birthday The Bentley hotel is an excellent location as it is about  mins walk to Times square etc and is away from most of the noise  The hotel is very clean cosmopolitan and has everything you need The staff are very helpful and polite  When we go back we will defonately return to The Bentley If you are going im sure youll have as much fun as we did         Happy Holidays 
P => A nice niche hotel I have read some of the other reviews and totally disagree  My wife and I stayed for two nights the weekend before Christmas at the Bentley and were pleasantly surpised  Rooms were clean had a nice closet and bathroom was just fine  I found it comical that someone complained that the halls were dark  We had no problem  What do they want a light show perhaps Hotel was in exellent location  Only about  to  blocks to subway and near tons of restaurants  The free Cappacino machine in the lobby was a plus  If someone wants luxury they can pay  to  per night somewhere else  If they want a nice and clean hotel in a good location for a good price we recommend the Bentley  
P => La dolce vita What a wonderful stay and excellent staff  I truly wanted a East River view and even called the day of our arrival but they couldnt guarantee one  When we arrived I just requested a peak of the water since we would be having nightcaps at the restarant and bar on the top floor after going to a holiday gathering in the city  I explained how we didnt travel in   major trips in  Provence Italia and Nevis and wanted to start the New Year with a water view and the sweet girl upgraded us to a ior suite since the restaurantbar was closed for remodeling  Wow I felt like a queen viewing the th Street bridge    my boyfriend said he could sit in the chaise and enjoy the view forever  So glad I brought goodies we didnt want to leave for the party let alone check out    The Bentley reminded of a hotel we stayed in Amsterdam a few years ago and the cuppacino machine made me right at hope    a mini European vacation  miles from home  la dolce vita  Request room  I would definitley spend the extra lire to relax after an exhausting day as a tourist in NYC and Sutton Place is a wonderful neighborhood  
P => Bring a flashlight and a fan to the Bentley Okay heres the deal with the Bentley  Its not all that  The rooms are very clean especially the bathrooms the beds are comfy well until the mattress starts to sag after a few hours    and the staff is polite they held our bags for us while we toured the city  But on the other hand the hallways are very dark hence the bring a flashlight title the hotel boasts that they have quotBelgian linensquot which is just a thick sheet  But then the rooms are SO absurdly hot that you dont need a blanket to sleep  And the air conditioning I think the button is just there for looks because it doesnt work  I also have to mention that there is NO fan in the bathroom  So if youre easily emabarrassed about other people smelling your number s then dont stay here or bring a fan  And last but definetely not least the location    its quiet and safe but a LONG walk to the subway  I went to NY with my husband and four other friends  We had two connecting rooms one with a king and the other with a double for  total  The price was dirt cheap for NYC  So although I will never stay at this hotel again  I guess it could have been worse  
P => very pleased My wife and I stayed at the Bentley for one night to take in the theater and dinner in Manhatten  We booked online and later called for a room with a view of the river and th st bridge given with no problem  The king sized bed was clean and comfortable  The heat was good  The bathroom was clean and enough size  The shower water pressure was the best feature nice and strong  TV Reception and channels were good  The rooftop restaurant was closed due to reations so we didnt get a chance to check it out  The thing I like was that although it was still Manhatten and the hotel being on the upper east side it was away from the hustle and bustle of midtown  We only stayed one night so we didnt really interact with the staff but when we did they were nice and pleasant  I feel for the price and the view and the area it was worth it will be going back in the summer of   
P => Well worth the money We stayed at the Bentley for  weeks over Christmas and the New Year and we loved this hotel  Like many others we read the reviews and were concerned  We didnt get a room with the bridge view like we hoped but I blamed this on our tour operator who never mentioned that there was  different prices we could pay  I found this out myself on this site afterwards  A standard room is just that a clean if not small room because it only sleeps two people  With a nice bathroom and not nessasarily with a view of the river  We had only paid for a standard room because our tour operator didnt advise us otherwise  However when we signed in I asked the receptionist if she could give us a big bed because me and my husband are both big and we were going to be in that bed for some time  She smiled as if she understood and then looked at our room number on the computer  She said she would change the room to another one higher up with a bigger bed  The room was lovely  It was spotlessly clean towels changed everyday and bed sheets changed regularly  A free safe which is unusual since they normally charge  Hairdryer in the bathroom  which by the way was spotless  iron and ironing board A C D  player by the bed along with the telephone  An ice bucket with two glasses  Television with at least  channels  How can people dislike this hotel The corridors are clean and the lifts are st modern and big and there are  of them  The only downside to this hotel is its location and thats not there fault We highly recommend it and we have stayed in   and  star hotels in the past At the moment they are refurbishing the restaurant which to be honest we thought they should have done at a different time other then Christmas but once that has been finished this hotel will definetly deserve a  star rating  
P => Lovely stay i stayed at the Bentley on the upper east side of nyc for one night in   It was a last minute arrangement as the other place I was due to stay at with a friend was unavailable for the sat nite  It is a contemporary hotel nice or very fresh and clean I had a king size roomit was a ent sizeand the bathroom was very clean and a a good size  tv and coffee making facilities  The extra special feature which i loved is the roof top terrace and bar which is lovely there is a beautiful view of the th bridge it was very magical especially at xmas time  the only drawback with this hotel is that it is a few blocks from a subway and is in a residental area  nonetheless everything is walkable in NYC  the is a good selection of resturants nearby  Try Fusha  a japanese placegood food and valuable for money Hotel staff were also polite not at all what i had expected in nyc I would recommend this hotel  
P => Wonderful hotel   definitely recommended I visited New York last weekend as an th birthday present for my dhter   a girls weekend of shopping eating and sightseeing  The Bentley was a fantastic hotel   we got a complementary upgrade to a ior Suite  The room was very large and comfortable small but well equipped bathroom fantastic views of the th St Bridge and the Roosvelt Island cable car  We packed so much into each day that we were exhausted by the end of the day and it was wonderful to sink into the lovely comfy bed  The capuccino and latte from the lobby machine was perfect the staff were incredibly friendly and I would definitely stay here again  I loved the location   not far to Bloomingdales th Avenue and Central Park but lots of little areas to explore that I wouldnt normally have seen  I always felt very safe round there  I can recommend the Tramway Diner and Burger Heaven for breakfasts and the Silver Star Diner for huge portions at good prices   the cheesecake really shouldnt be missed If you are in Chinatown go to Mandarin Court at Mott Street for dim sum   sublime and incredibly cheap  Also go to the Top of the Rock the newly opened Rockerfeller Centre roof for fantastic views less crowded than the Empire State and cheaper  
P => fantastic hotel The hotel was everything I wanted and more It  be a few blocks walk to get to the shops and the sights but walking down some of the roads gave you the real feel of the area Took about mins to walk to Central Park  We were on the th floor and the views out were fantastic Especially the Sunrise over the river  The bed was comfortable and the room was clean  Ok  so you dont have the tea and coffee machine in your room but there is one in the lounge are downstairs  Never ate in the restuarant but it all looked nice Staff were always helpful and nice  Would definalty stay again 
P => Great Hotel If you want a comfortable room for an affordable price with excellent service and an unbelievable view you cant beat The BentleyNYC hotel rooms with a nice view are hard to come by let alone one for this price  The only draw back is that the hotel is about  pretty long blocks from the nearest subway station at th and rd  If you stay here bring comfortable shoes or be prepaired to take a cab 
P => Great Value   hidden treasure I had to book some lodging in NYC for a quick last minute trip  I was trying not to break the bank but still say someplace comfortable  Through research I thought Id give The Bentley a whirl I had to fly into Newark due to full flights so I grabbed a cab in from Penn Station  The Bentley is a bit off the beaten path as its on the Upper east side  I was prepared for this though and chose the location due to the close proximity to La Guardia where I was flying out the following morning  I arrived before check in time and the staff was kind and put me in an available room  The staff was helpful and friendly  The or reminded me a bit of some boutique hotels Ive booked in L A  and Miami  I stayed on the th floor right off the elevator lobby area  The room was a nice size for NYC and offered a desk a chair a closet  The linens were clean and comfy  The bath was large and had wonderful lighting  It was quite roomy I didnt mind the walk bc I had acknowledged when i booked I ate in the restaurant that evening and enjoyed the Vodka Penne Chicken dish  Pricing seemed reasonable The view and ambiance of the restaurant was stunning  I could have relaxed there all evening  My room also had a nice view of the bridge and river with some view of downtown The bellman was helpful with the arrangement of a car to the airport the next morning at am Overall I give this hotel a thumbs up and would stay there again when I dont have to be so centrally located to midtown andor financial district  
P => Nice stay at the Bentley My finace and I stayed at the Bentley from the  nd ust   It was my first time in New York and we wanted a good base for exploring  The Bentley was great for this as its location is brilliant   not too noisy as it is a little out of things but not too far away   we could walk to Central Park in about  mins We arrived quite late at the hotel as our flight was delayed and were told that there were not many rooms left  We were put in a manky dirty still things from previous guests in bathroom basement room right next to a noisy boiler   not a good start However we went back to reception and were moved to a room on the th floor  It was a smoking room   we are non smokers but we were told we could move in the morning to a higher floor non smoking room  We settled for this as we were tired and there wasnt really anything else we could do The next day we were moved to a river view room on the th floor   much better The room was spacious and clean and had a great view of the Queensborough bridge  We stayed the rest of the time in this room and had no other problems The bar on the roof is a great place to visit after a tiring day as the view over New York is fantastic  The drinks are quite pricey but so are all the other bars in New York too We didnt eat in the hotel so cant comment on that but another couple told us it was nice Good places to eat are The Ritz diner for breakfast   just up the road on the corner  There is a little bistro just by the bottom of the bridge that is good  If you venture up one block and turn right there is a fantastic little mexican which is really cheap and very tasty  Also there is an Irish bar near there which had a happy hour every day with cheap frozen cocktails and beers for about  Overall the Bentley was good  It is a little rough around the edges as it has a boutique feel but was obviously done a little cheaply  It is in a great location and most places are walkable from there  If you want a little more peace and quiet then the hustle and bustle of the city and you are on a fairly tight budget   as we were then I would recommend it  If you want pure luxury and pampering then it is not for you  
P => Fantastic Would recommend We stayed here for  nights and were very impressed  There are some nice bars Baker st  and restaurants around there and a great deli for breakfast just one block away Its about a  minute walk from the subway but we knew that before we booked it and it wasnt a problem for us  The staff were friendly professional and helpful  The hotel rooms were clean spacious and well equipped  We had a fabulous view from our room   overlooking the east river and Roosevelt island Would stay there again  
P => Very nice stay Business Travel For night for  nights I was upgraded to a suite  It was very spacious  The or is modern  The air conditioning units in the room was loud but otherwise this was an amazing price within walking distance of midtown appointments and Bloomingdales  Nice staff too and wireless Internet Belgian linens  I am used to paying at least x that for a weekday hotel in Midtown so I think this is pretty rekable  
P => Good value Enjoyed our stay at The Bentley  I booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews on this website and I am glad to say I wasnt dissapointed The hotel or is stylist although slightly tired however this didnt detract from a good experience Its quite a big hotel which is quite impersonal but thats fine for our purpose of a weekend in the city As for location well its a little off the beaten track but I didnt mind a walk  Its only  mins up to central park The view from the rooftop bar is quite impressive although the bar was lacking in atmosphere In sumy   great value for money  For the money you cant go far wrong with staying at the Bentley  
P => Good Hotel Clean Romms friendly Staff We family with two kids stay at Bentley Hotel for tree days  When we arrived they were overbooked and had no room for us  The staff were very friendly and offered a taxi to another Hotel where they had booked us for one nigth  Next day we returned and the give us a update to a suite  We had a beautiful view over Manhatten All in all a nice and clean Hotel with friendly staff for a good price located about  m from the next Metro Station and  m from Central Park If we visit New York again we surely will check in again at Bentley Hotel  
P => excellent evening the hotel is extremely comfortable the location is good access to many restaurants on the east side convient to central park and the museumsthe continetal breakfast in the glass enclosed resraurant on the roof over looking the east river and manhattan is wonderful way to start the day 
P => Where am I The Bentley is located so far East that you  feel you are in the Orient While the neighborhood is safe and there are many delis grocery stores and shops around the Bentley has an address that is far from anything you  want to see  The rooms are large modern and comfortable with expansive windows exhibiting the urban scene  The staff is warm and helpful  If you dont mind walking or are using a car service this can be an excellent choice at the right price  
P => great room at great price nice view at night Well definitely consider staying there again  We didnt mind the Animal Hospital nor the Gas Station since the room was a great value with a large clean bathroom and a great view at night   all for about  a night  Go directly to the hotels website for the best deal  Thats what we did  
P => I had a great stay at the Bentley Hotel NYC Very very clean room for a great price  I asked for a river side view and I stayed  nights in room  which had a great view over the east river and the Queensboro BridgeThe bathroom looked very very nice and cleanThe hotel is located in the eastern part of midtown Manhattan but you got everything you need within a couple of blocks Walking to the subway is  minutes  The neighbourhood is very safe also later in the evening The bus stop for the M is just across the street when you buy a metro card you can also use it in every bus in Manhattan I had not trouble with the fuel station that was right beneath my room I couldnt hear anything from itThe next time I will go to NYC I will stay in the Bentley Hotel again 
P => Pretty good hotel all in all I booked this room online and got a nice package deal  The hotel room was about   This hotel is located on the far end of East nd Street  The metro station is not exactly close but it is definitely walkable    about  minutes  To get to Times Square take the   or  train downtown to Grand Central  Then take the S train to Times Square A large movie theater Clearview Cinemas is located just a few blocks from the hotel  Dangerfields is around the corner from the theater  There are plenty of places to eat and our favorite Japanese Art store is located at th and Lexington  Oh and Bloomingdales is located around the corner from the metro station About the hotel itself    it is located in a quieter section of Manhattan  But nowhere in NYC is absolutely quiet  In fact every hotel I have stayed at has been noisy to some extent so I always bring earplugs  Though I was concerned about the noise level after reading some reviews I was glad to not share some others experiences  I slept like a baby That said the hotel room had some minor defects  First my bathroom sink had three large cracks though they were already repaired    it wasnt a pretty sight  Second the TV plug was slightly bent and sparked when I plugged it into a different outlet  Third the irons dial heat setting was gone    so it worked on my cotton based clothes but I had never encountered that experience before The hotel front desk was always well staffed and friendly  The hotel has over  floors and  elevators  The hotel or was ok  The hotel room or was ok    although the window blind was very wrinkled looked cheap and shabby was a dab brown color and did not cover the whole window  There is no business office  But NYC tourist fact    there is free Internet Access at the Times Square Information Center next to the Loews Theater    several computers that feature Yahoo Mail  But there is some wait   There is also a restaurant but it does not serve breakfast    it opens at  PM All in all it was a solid hotel with a few minor defects  But it is ok esp  if you are on a budget andor if you can skimp on a few conveniences in order to spend your dollar in more meaningful and useful ways elsewhere  
P => Bentley    more like a Volvo  reliable and safe The entrance to the hotel was not to be desired for with a petrol station hung at the side of it and bags of rubbish all hung up the back wall though entering the entrance it was more presentable Quick easy check in through Lastminute    our standard double room was clean and presentable though very small with a small bathroom  The bed was very comfertable and the corridors were clean The top floor barrestaurant looked very shabby and in need of modernising so we never had breakfast there  There is no gym or pool Location wise your about   in a taxi away from any NY attractions  If anything it is worth paying that bit extra and getting a closer hotel to the main parts of newyork We found a good diner for breakfast up the street called roxys diner it got you off to a good start  This is good for budget traveler or a single person  
P => Wonderful hotel at a great price We would stay at The Bentley again  It was a wonderful room for the money  We stayed in the deluxe suite which had a arate bedroom with a king size bed a wonderful view on the th floor a table and chairs area and a queen size pull out sofa  The bed was awsome with a down comfortor  The room was very clean and housekeeping was wonderful and adhered to our requests  
P => good for the price i payed Well after reading the reviews i was a little dubious about my stay there The hotel wasnt the ritz but i went to see new york and not too stay in my hotel room the entire time  I liked the free breakfast of unlimited bagels it wasnt much but hey it was free my only complaint there was the toasters with no handles to lift the trays out some woman put a knife in to dislodge her food the staff smiled at her   this worried me a little The rooms were a very good size and somewhat of an unusal shape but they were a nice size to relax and unwind in the bathroom was again quite nice it wasnt the ritz but as the hotel never claimed to be it had me impressed as i didnt go there with any expectations The only main gripe i had was about the waiting staff when i ordered a meal he was more concerned with chatting at the bar and practically threw the menu at me not very friendly but i only dined there once so dont know if this was standard behaviour The views in the morning were worth the price of the hotel a nice breeze and breathing in the fresh air on the riverside made for a nice way to wake up and appreicate the city be warned for the mobil station it is not very well signposted what is pavement and what is forecourt so be wary of getting run over Location is quite good for the park and as i went in summer it is a pleasant walk to the subway for downtown just be carefull of getting cht up shopping in time square till am then getting a subway and walking the couple of blocks back in the dark Favourite part was the food emporium over the road very nice and holiday esq feel to it All in all i would not say this hotel was anything spectacular but it was a hotel with character it gave me some tales to tell when i came home to my friends and there is nothing about it that i would say ruined my holiday it was very well priced and i would definatly stay again  
P => Very nice stay at the Bentley Just returned from a  night stay at The Bentley in New York  This hotel was very clean and the doormen were great  Even though they were very full still asked and received a room with a view of the river on the th floor  We were on the opposite side from the bridge view but still it was very nice to come in at night and look out at the river on one side and Upper East Side on the other  The bathroom was very clean and small but not tiny  The air conditioner settings cannot be changed but we were comfortable after receiving a blanket for the cold blooded person  Only complaint was the lack of wash clothes  Call me crazy but to me a wash cloth is a basic part of taking a shower  The first night we found only one even though two people were listed on the reservation and we had two beds  The next morning I left a note with the tip asking for  wash clothes each night through Sunday  The next two nights were fine but Saturday night we returned wet from an unexpected rain shower only to find no zero wash clothes  After putting my wet clothes and shoes back on and going back down stairs the front desk sent some right up  The hotel is off the main strip but the quiet made up for it  After  days of walking up the hill the  or so blocks to the nearest subway station I figured out the   bus stops right in front of the hotel and runs across th from the east to the west side  This made it easy to transfer to a subway stop along th I would definetely recommend this hotel and stay there again  
P => Take notice of the good things     After reading countless reviews on this site regarding this hotel I must admit we was ehensive about the trip  We needed not be  The hotel is st modern clean and above all else friendly  We always found the staff helpful and couldnt do enough for us  We can see the reviewers points on the views  Room  for us was excellent  as you could be looking at the gas station if you are unlucky  If you areask to be moved  A couple we were with did and were moved straight away  The rooms are clean and bathrooms spotless and towels changed daily  The location is good although away from the hurly burly of the city  Central park is  minutes walk and busestrams readily available to other destinations  We would definately return to the Bentley on our next trip and would recommend it to anyone  
P => Noise   A good thing Looking at the photos my guess was that this hotel was something extra when it comes to design  It is  in places  It seems the energy ran out  quotoh so we are out of the cool tables    ah well any table will have to do in this room then    quot Whats most important though is the beds and our bed was excellent  The bathroom was pretty new and clean as well  My feelings for this hotel could have been better if we would have lived in one of the upper floors  The hotel has  floors I think and we lived on the nd   and there was a gas station right under our window  We couldnt hear any traffic noise though as the air conditioning system made a loud noise ALL the time  There is no way turning it of and sometimes the room was really cold too  Overall its a perfectly average hotel that is a bit off  The neighbourhood is really nice though with a lot of restaurants and shopping  We didnt feel like the typical times square tourists in this area  Not sure if we would choose this hotel for our next time in NY though  Ok  Not more  One more thing   Be sure to visit the top floor restaurant We missed out and just got a quick look at it before we left   shame as it looked spectacular  
P => a very nice hotel this hotel is very clean the rooms are ent sizes with tvs and a microwave in the room the bathroom was spotlessly clean as was the roomi got a room on the th floor overlooking the city there are other rooms with better views but to be honest i didnt really look out of the window much anyway so the view didnt bother methe bar which is on the st floor was very nice the barstaff were very friendly and there is an amazing view of the queensbridge and the city you can even go outside on the balcony to take really good photosthe lobby was impressive and there was a teacoffee machine were you could get hot drinks hours a day just off the lobby there was an ice machine were you could get iceall the members of staff here when i stayed were very polite and helpful  people have said this hotel is off the beaten track but i didnt find it to far out in fact i thought the location was brilliant as we were away from all the hustle and bustlecabs to time square is under  which i thought was very reasonablethe subway is about   minute walk away but it didnt feel long and once at the station you can travel to numerous destinationscentral park is not to far as so are all the designer shops on th avenuetakeaway food is very cheap here a shop on the corner did lovely sandwhiches and take away food very cheap a ny diner was on the opposite corner and we ate breakfast here large portions very cheap eg  adult sixe breafasts  egg and chips with mushrooms and tomatoes with  toast and coffee along with ham  eggs and home fries with  toast and tea for only thats just about   for look at my photos if you want a cheap clean place to stay this is the place to be we had an absolutely wonderful time and will definately be booking this hotel again very soon to take our children i have recommended this hotel to all my family and friends it not the sort of hotel were people will bend over backwards for you but it is very down to earth i didnt have to pay high prices it is a very laid back very cool hotel definately for people who are not over pretentiousthe staff are very flexible and when we checked out early on our last day they allowed us to store our luggage for the whole daywe didnt try the room service but the menu didnt seem to be that priceyif you chose this hotel i hope you have a good a time as we did it really made my first visit to new york one to remember with fond and happy memories 
P => Value for Money We stayed in the Bentley for  nights  And compared to our last stay in another hotel in midtown during our last visit Gershwin Hotel for the same price the Bentley is excellent  The service is  for a mid class hotel  above average when we arrived they only had one room left and they recommended to change the hotel because the room would be too noisy  Although after the long flight this wasn t too funny we appreciated the offer and changed for one night to The cel isn t as far as good as the Bentley by the way  But for the circumstance they gave us an upgrade for a ior suite  So when we came back the next day we had this incredible view overlooking the skyline East River and Queensboro Bridge  The bed was huge the room was around  square meters and we had a fantastic time  The bus stop  as others here already mentioned  is right in front of the hotel and takes you to Bloomie s and Barneys in  min  Under the Bridge there is a very nice new restaurant Guastavinos plus a conran shop plus the Superket Food Emporium min walk from the hotel  So if you re tired from walking   this is the place to be I cannot imagine getting the same quality of hotel for a price like in the Bentley  You get more than you pay for  
P => Great Place to Stay I recently went on a trip to NYC and stayed at the Bently  I have been to New York several times and this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at  The hotel is beautiful the rooms are very nice clean and spacious  The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful and the view from the hotel restaurant is gorgeous  I would recommend staying there  
P => The Bentley   a Welcomed Rest I recently stayed at the Bentley while my husband was being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering  I was a little jittery about some of the reviews but my experience was very nice After being at the hospital all day dealing with my husbands requirements trying to ipher dors babble and hospital politics I needed some peace and quiet at night  My room was so quiet I wasnt sure anyone else was on the floor with me  The bed was very comfortable the bathroom nice and clean  I also enjoyed going to the lounge on the st floor to see the sights at night  It was very restful  
P => location location location having just returned from a  night stay in new york we stayed in the bentley and loved it very clean and very friendly  its views from the restaurant are breath taking  the location of the hotel is perfect across the street and one block st avenue with plenty of bars and restaurants keep walking block after block each street is different  Bloomingdales the best department store in New York only minutes away  along with Madison avenue and th avenue with central park dividing east and west  i was concerned this hotel was a little far away when i booked it How wrong i was  enjoy the complimentry tea and coffee hrs  
P => Ill be back for more I recently returned from a week spent at the bentley It was my first trip to new york and i loved every minute of it   in fact ive already booked my next trip in ust and cant wait It was important to me that i enjoyed my stay at the hotel as well as the holiday and the bently delivered although i was initially dissapointed i didnt have a room on a high floor and i had the dreaded garage view i still thoroughly enjoyed my stay rooms were clean and stylish but unpretentious the staff were very friendly and helpful and personally i thought the location was great lovely neighbourhood with great bars and restaurants  Why would you want the biggest tourists spots on your door step some of my most memorable experiences were had just walking random streets and soaking up the atmosphere  Personally i would reccomend the hotel to anyone especially if like me you were travelling on your own and it was your fiirst visit i have since looked at other hotels but i liked the area and the hotel so much im coming back for more have a great holiday  
P => What should have been better  Back from  days new york and  nights in the bentley hotel it was great there couldn t imagine more for that very good price we had a room on the  th floor with a nice view very clean very quiet   what moreok you have to walk  minutes to the next subway station but we didn t care about that because it is amazing to see the different streets arount with the restaurants etc next time same place 
P => Loved the Bentley Just got back from four wonderful days in New York  The Bentley was just great got upgraded to a corner suite on the th floor  Spectacular views of the th street bridge east river and midtown Its quite simple if you wanna get out into the city see and feel New York then the Bentley is for you    If you want gilt edge service and stuffy staff go elsewhere   The Bentley is a wonderful little hotel  I was nervous after reading some posts on here now I know that New York was wasted on those kinds of folks    
P => Keep looking Very loud  Right near th St  bridge  A lot of traffic and construction noise  Surly service people  Bathroom not clean  Strange accoustics  Voices and sounds from other rooms come in through vents  No exhaust fan in bath so shower steams up whole room  Far from subways  There are numerous better choices   
P => great stay We had a great time at the Bentley     we got lucky and gota corner room  To the left was the th street bridge    to the rightthe beautiful east side  Best views Ive ever had in a hotel room Didnt mind the walk to the subway  It wasnt as bad as i thoughtit would be  In fact the hotel is so close to everything that I ended upwalking instead of taking public transportation The staff was great and the rooms very very clean My only complaint is that the hotel has some plumbing issuesto address  Our toilet backed up but they changed our room without a problem Overall     book your reservation    youll have a great time liz 
P => Great Hotel for NY Even though the location is a bit off the beaten path closest subway stop is a  minute walk this hotel is great  Modern clean lined or tastefully orated rooms nice bar on the top floor with great views  Coffee is offered in the lobby during the morning and there are several restaurants that deliver free of charge around the corner  My only complaint was a window shade that was permanentley stuck in the up position  A call to the front desk finally brought someone who was able to lower the shade but it remained broken and inoperable during the rest of my stay  
P => Excellent apart from the air con Stayed here in ember  and were surprised by the similarity of the place to the pictures we had seen online and in brochures Very pleasant staff amp nicely orated rooms  A bit off the beaten track in terms of tourist attractions although Central Park is only around  minutes away on foot  Our one concern was the hopeless air conditioning  Bearing in mind we were there in ember and it was COLD outside the room was reminiscent of a furnace during the night 
P => Wow I wasnt expecting much because of the price and was pleasantly surprised  Very nicely orated rooms fairly quiet good view excellent food and amazing breakfast bar view  Staff was friendly and helpful  The only thing is that there is no valet parking which was only a slight inconvenience  
P => Fairly Good My Wife   yearold Son and I stayed at The Bentley from       I have to admit that having read some reviews about the hotel I was very worried  However we didnt have much choice as so many other hotels were booked on   so took the plunge and crossed my fingers   LocationUpper East Side  Quite a nice part of town with a lot less bustle that Midtown  Ritz Diner  block away an excellent deli across the road a pizzeria  blocks Superket  blocks plus a few bars and resuarants  A  min walk to underground th amp Lexington Although youre never too far from anything in NYC we would have preferred to be more central  It rained almost every day which meant that by the time wed walked  blocks to Midtown we were wet and cold  We spent a fair bit on yellow cabs to take us from midtown to the hotel to avoid the rain and it would have been easier for us to have been more central  But I suppose it depends what youre looking to do in NYCVery close to a hospital which turned out to be handy as my Son fell off the bed and cracked his head on the corner of the bed base  He was okay but it was reassuring to be able to get him checked out quickly and efficiently within minutes or  StylingFirst impressions were that the place seemed dull and the fittings in the room were in need of upgrading chipped veneer on edges of surfaces door to bathroom had a bash in it varnish needed re done however I have to say that the place grew on me within a couple of days I think the problem with The Bentley and possibly the reason why a lot of people seem to not warm to it is the style of the or and the lighting  Its a mix of stainless steel dark wood and dim lighting  This  be cool and modern however if you are used to brightly lit hotel lobbies lifts and corridors with light warm colours and brass fittings then it can be a culture shock walking into The Bentley  I think its very much a taste thing  I initially thought the whole place looked like it was stuck in the s  However my Wife thought it was really very nice very now and quite cool The RoomsI thought the size of the rooms was very acceptable  The room was far from oppulent but it was overall quite nice with a beautiful view of the th St  bridge and the East river  Room was cleaned daily and linen also changed daily  Air conditioner  heater in room Good powerful showerGenerally okay although the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything   and I mean everything I wouldnt spend your honeymoon hereThe StaffSeemed very friendly to me and were helpful whenever we asked them for any information etc SumyGood hotel   Not great and no way is it  stars but you will have a comfortable trouble free stay here  If you are used to being pampered and want the classic hotel ambiance that you might expect from a Hilton or riott then this is the wrong hotel for you  The Bentley is a good enough hotel which seems to attract a mix of business and tourist guests  Its very unpretencious and quite friendly   despite the creepy dim lighting If you want more then go to a proper  star hotel and pay more  But did you really come to NYC to stay in your hotel roomHot tipIf you want a river view ASK YOUR BOOKING AGENT TO REQUEST THIS FOR YOU  Much negative talk about the gas station view but I suspect the people who ended up with this view didnt ask for a river view  If you dont ask you  not get and if you get the right view it is spectacular  
P => Great Hotel and near one of the only smoking bars in the city My fiance and I stayed for four nights Mid ember and a couple of our friends joined us for the weekend  We all found the hotel very comfortable and the staff were more than accomodating especially Willy the concierge  Excellently situated and only a few blocks away from Merchants   one of the only bars in which you can still smoke 
P => Bentley was Great We thought the Bentley was great  We were traveling with our two school age dhters and it was perfect for a one night stay  The room was spotless the beds were comfortable and the staff was friendly and polite  The bellman directed us to Ritzs Diner for a great lunch and it was an easy walk up to th Avenue and Central Park  Taxis were easy to come by for other jaunts  
P => one of the better  Star hotels although definately not a  Outwardly very modern and stylish  if you like minimal and dark wood staff generally quite helpful and pleasant  We found the location quite handy and there is an excellent American diner a block away for when you are all bageled out from the Bentley breakfasts A shame though the breakfastrestaurant area is so badly in need of re furb as it lets the rest of the hotel down Also watch out if staying during the winter months   there is no air conditioning and yet our room was insufferably hot  Sixteen floors up there are no windows to open either Second round of reks to front desk brought out a technican but nothing could be done  On the whole one of the better  star hotels although it should never get   
P => Great Hotel in the Wrong Location The hotel interiors and exterior were properly maintained  The hotel was done in a modern earthy with metal accent theme  The staffs were very friendly and accommodating  The lobby has an alcove with a huge wall of magazines and a coffee machine that makes cappuccino espresso and latte both in regular and af  The machine also has a steamer if you want to steam your milk first  And it is FREE o The problem is the location  You have to walk  long uphill blocks to the nearest subway station  There was nothing to do around the hotel  I personally prefer to stay at the Upper West Side  It offers a lot more culture and life  Transportation is very convenient  
P => Clean comfortable affordable hotel in great location I recently stayed at the Bentley Hotel for one night on a business trip  I was somewhat warry about staying at this hotel due to some of the negative reviews I had read  However it was in a good location and in my price range so I ided to give it a try  What I encountered exceeded my expectations  The staff was courteous and timely upon checking in  I found my room to be very clean and while small I had plenty of room for my luggage and to move around comfortably  The beds were somewhat soft but contained nice linens and a light down comforter  The room temperature was comfortable and I was able to adjust it as needed  The bathroom was very clean with soft towels toiletry samples and great water pressure in the shower  Several reviews I read of the hotel contained complaints about the noise  I did not experience any problems with loud neighbors and I heard only the faint rumble of traffic from the street which I believe is to be expected in busy NYC  The hotel was in a great location only a few blocks from restaurants shops and other sites  The continental breakfast consisted of juice coffee and bagels  The bagels were from a local bagel shop and were tasty genuine NYC bagels  Upon my checkout the staff was again prompt and courteous  While there are likely nicer hotels in NYC this hotel was an excellent bargain and provided great service  
P => Excellent Location Utterly Amazing Views and an Overall Good Hotel I read reviews that people have posted about this hotel and I simply think did they stay at the same hotel that I did This hotel is in New York City emphasis on the word City  Which means that there are a lot of people crammed into a small area and things are very expensive  Hench why this hotel has small rooms and is expensive  But even then the rooms are comparable in size to those at even the most prestigious New York hotels and those prestigious hotels that New York is known for are far more expensive than the Bentley  Yes the lobby is kinda creepy but it is strangly beautiful in its own right  I loved the little coffee nook off the lobby though the coffee was a bit on the tempid side  When I first walked into my rooom I said to my self small  Then I said nice design  But when I opened my window I was in utter amazement  I had views of the Queensboro Bridge the Tump World Tower the UN Tower prestigious Sutton Place and the East River  The view alone is what makes the hotel amazing  The bed was very comfortable and the linens were excellent  The bathroom had faboulous soaps and shampoos and its style was very nice  The best thing about this hotel besides the view is its location  You can walk to Madison Ave Fifth Ave Bloomingdales Central Park etc  etc  And for this price there is no other hotel that can deliver this  Plus I am pretty sure that this is the only hotel or one of the only hotels in the Upper Eastside of New York that has a Riverfront Location  If you want down to earth accomadations a unpretentious enviroment utter amazing and jaw dropping views and a perfect location then stay at the Bentely Hotel  I have stayed at numerous pretigious New York hotels and besides the service that you get at those hotels plus a lot of the creature comforts there is no major difference between them and the Bentely Hotel that is why I recommend it to you  
P => Noisy Rooms We visited New York for the first time on   and stopped at the Bentley  We arrived at pm USA time and were shown to our room on st floor  We noticed straight away that the rooms walls were paper thin from the inside of the hotel to the outside constant noise from the traffic it was either taxis horns beeping or sirens  We also heard the next door couple talking very strange   The bed was broken on one side the bed side was touching the floor the other side was normalso uncomfortable didnt dare lift the mattressThe view from the bar and breakfast area is fantastic can see for miles also able to walk around the balcony  The breakfast was enjoyable bagels with different toppings and good start to the day  Seemingly alot of hotels dont have complimentary breakfast As for the staff they were friendly and helpful apart from on departure day the receiptionist never passed a message on to the bell boy for a trolley but never mind  When on walk about take note of the address of the hotel as we got lost one day and even after asking a policeman they never had knowledge of the hotel or even in the hotel guide luckily the hotel room card had the telephone number on  Would stop there again  Sarah David and Charlotte 
P => good hotel I booked this hotel at the begining of the year through a British tour operater and was pleased at the look of it from its web site then I found this web site  weeks before we were due to travel  After reading some of the reviews to my horror I ide to try and swap hotels to one with a better rating but due to the republican convention being in town that weekend there was no more  star hotels left so I iced to risk it  We arrived in New york on time from the uk about  pm and arived at the hotel at pm and was met at the shuttle bus by a porter who before you knew it had the bags in side  We then checked in and was taken up to our room which when we entered found it was occupied luckly no one was in there at that time to save our embaresment  This was rectiffed by the desk and we got a room on the th floor looking out at the bridge     oh yes and the dreaded petrol station  The room was quite very clean ok the furnature wasnt of the standard of the ritz and the bed was comftable  The petrol station did not bother us at all we did hear it and at the end of the day if i wanted a view of scenery i wouldnt have come to the capital of skyscrappers  The hotel I would class as a  star back in britain and the staff arnt quite up to the happy souls down in Disney Florida but after seeing times square and how busy that was how does any one sleep in those hotels at night  ok the bently isnt a  min walk to the attractions but they are easy got to a cab far cost be  from times sq  if you turn left out of the bently and cross York street the Ritz cafe is on the corner and it is cheap clean and the food was good great for any Brits who have travelled over and are hungry and tired if you cary on up nd u will cross st and nd Av eventually coming to rd Av turn left and Bloomingdales is down there about a min walk  If you id to walk as we did  to times sq for the tour bus it trakes about  hour and several blisters  I would stay at the bently again as it was safe quite clean and cheap the baggels in the morning was a good idea but as a revier said the resturant could be stunning and they would be right the view is stunning but it reminds me more of a school dinner hall  
P => Weird and Creepy If all you need is a place to sleep The Bentley is o k  the views are great but the furniture is tattered and dirty and the bathroom is very odd  I do not recommend eating here for any meal the food tasted stale and sorta like Chef Boy R Dee  The staff leers at you creepily and you feel like youre in some weird foreign film version of quotEyes Wide Shutquot  The location is convenient for the price but this hotel looks like its badly in need of some reations and deep cleaning  P S  the walls are paper thin you hear everything  
P => Pleased with the Bentley We just returned from  nights at the Bentley Hotel and we were pleasantly surprised  The price was right the location was good a good walk or a short cab ride to Park Ave  and Times Square   either way enjoyable We would definately return as the rooms were clean and nicely done and for a hotel around the  price range well worth the expenditure 
P => Just Lovely I would stay there again  Hotel lobby and rooms are nice  Everybody that woked there were extremely helpful and kind  The lounge on the st floor could use some work but you could see the New York skyline from up there its beautiful at night  The location is ok if you dont mind walking a few blocks  The closest subway is on th and Lexington   the hotel is on  and York  Overall   a nice experience I LOVE NY 
P => Bentley Isnt Bad For less than  a night the Bentley is a good choice  If youre paying more than  you can probably do better  We stayed at the Bentley from y    Heres what we found   POSITIVES  When we checked in the staff was friendly  We had a few questions and they answered them all   The room and bathroom were very clean and good sized  I had heard some New York City hotels had very cramped spaces but this room was like many other hotels Id stayed throughout the United States  The ble bathroom was nice    The continental breakfast on the top floor is only bagles with milk or juice  No its not fancy  But its a nice start to the day if youre not interested in a big breakfast NEGATIVES  Location  Its about a   minute walk from the nearest subway station  And its not a walk you want to make at night  Although the area appears to be fairly safe there are very few walkers at night  If its after dark plan on taking a cab about  fare from Midtown  The bus is an option with a stop nearby  But standing around waiting for a bus gets kind of old   The restaurant  The service for dinner was poor  They cant keep a drink refilled  And when we asked about something for which we were overcharged their response was quotThis is a New York City restaurant quot Dont waste your time or money on the restaurant  The only reason we ate there was because a rainy night forced us to stay in  If rain keeps you in order from a restaurant that delivers to your room WORTH NOTINGWhen making reservations ask for a room up high with a view of the East River  Its a nice view and significantly beats the alternatives  A room down low appears to have the potential for noise and an unattractive view of the Mobil gas station located right out front  
P => Ill be back I and a friend visited The Bentley in ruary   It was my first visit to NYC so did not know what to expect  I was pleasantly surprised at the hotel I loved the or the free coffee machine in the lobby and the service was very welcoming The hotel is out of the way but this is something I wanted   having seen some of the hotels on Broadway and near other bustling places like Times Square I was glad to get away from the noise at the end of the day  The hotel offers complimentary breakfast   bagels teacoffee and juice  This is a great way to start the day  Like someone else mentioned why on earth would you want to eat in your hotel when in NYC I dont get it The rooms were lovely  We had a view of the apartment building opposite but so what I was in NYC If I wanted permanent great views I would have camped out on the top of Empire State Building for the duration of my stay  The nearest subway was about  blocks away but that was perfect   it gave us the opportunity to have a good look at our surroundings  I found the concierges helpful and courteous  They looked after our bags on our last day to enable us to squeeze every last miniute out of our trip  I do have two main gripes however  First of all the air conditioning was horrible  We couldnt get the temperature right which resulted in me returning home with a nasty cold  Secondly I had arranged to meet up with a friend who lives in the city  I told him where to contact me but the message was not passed on  I was furious  What if that had been a member of my family trying to contact me in the case of an emergency Having said that Im planning a return trip in a few months  Those of you that like noise  I suggest you find somewhere on Broadway  Those of you that like the idea of staying somewhere less touristy try The Bentley  
P => Rude and uncaring Made a reservation directly with the hotel had a confirmation number and was turned away when I arrived due to overbooking  There were no other rooms available in the city  The staff did nothing to help my situation and were quite rude  
P => Bentley fair value for money I stayed in the Bentley for a week with my  year old dhter   it was her first trip to New York  There were quite a few mother and dhter couples there for the shopping theatre and so on  I found the room acceptable with two large beds and a good bathroom  The free breakfast of coffee bagels and juice was useful when we did not want a heavy meal  I agree the restaurant area is disappointing and could potentially be spectacular  I found the location unthreatening if slightly unglamorous I am from London  The hotel was slightly off the beaten tourist track though convenient for movie theatres and Bloomingdalesbut taxis were not a problem and there were several convenient buses outside the door  I did not want any other services from my hotel so at the price I was perfectly satisfied and would certainly go there again   
P => Plenty of room for improvement we go back for the price  My husband and I have stayed at The Bentley three erate times now for business  Its not that we enjoy the hotel so much as its a good price for NY  I would not pay more than   to stay there payed   the last time  Our rooms have been completely different all three times always quite spacious  Have had a great view of the bridge also have had a room with a not so great view but instead was given a suite so there was even more room two t vs sofaetc  I wouldnt be too pleased if I ended up with the gas station view  We like to cab around NY or walk for blocks and blocks so the location doesnt bother us but it would be out of the way for some  The elevators always seem to have a problem make some scary noises  I enjoy the interior design modern chocolate and white in the lobby but the furnishings are getting trashed very quickly  The rooms are holding up a bit better  I always find them cleaned well and the neutral warm colours are pleasing  ble bathrooms are nice in good condition  I agree with other reviewers the concierge is not really friendly or helpful  This is not a place where the service will blow you away  I actually dont expect anything from them so I dont get disapointed  Although there are a few nice people the service is very basic  Check out the rooftop for the view but dont expect much from your bagel and juice  They could really fix it up and have a beautiful spot up there  That goes for the entire hotel I guess  If they did though we wouldnt get it for such a cheap price   
P => Great hotel   We were very pleased My father and I had never been to New York before so when I booked a hotel I had no idea what area I wanted or what to expect  I chose the Bentley because of the great price they were offering in tember  I prayed the pictures they displayed on their website would be equal to the actual hotel  Once we arrived at the Bentely I have to admit we were more than pleased  A beautiful hotel very large room with  double beds and an amazing view of the gondala lifts to Rosevelt Island as well as the Queensboro Bridge  The beds were pure heaven and the comforters were like feathers  The hotels view from its roof are spectacular  Not only do they have a nice walking area that encircled the hotel roof but many chairs where you could sit at night and enjoy a smoke and take in the view  And what a view it was from all sides you have an incredible view of the city from every angle and I confess I spent much time gazing off that roof  The hotel also has an excellent restraraunt on the top floor where we enjoyed breakfast and dinner  The food was very good and reasonably priced  The staff was extremlly friendly and out rooms were always spotless when we returned home from a day of sight seeing  The front desk even watched our bags all day on the morning we checked out so that we could spend a few more hours in the city before our flight without worrying about our luggae  The only minor problem the Bentley has is the actual location  It is only  blocks to the subway and during the day this is a wonderful walk full of intresting sights and sounds  But at night it is NOT a place you want to be strolling around  Its pretty deserted at night and not near any bars or food places that are  hours  If you want to go out at night you also need to call a taxi since it is not a high traffic area and taxis do not pass by there all the time  But if you like hotels that are quiet and off the beaten path this is the place to go and the view is worth it My father and I are returning to New York this summer and since I wanted to experience the night life we ided to stay at another hotel that is owned by the same company the Ameritania right on Broadway  It will be noisy loud and busy but this time that is what we are looking for  I only pray that it is as nice as the Bentley and we both plan on returning to The Bentley on our visist next year because we love the hotel so much  I highly recommend this hotel we loved it and I know you will too 
P => A real dissapointment You need to make sure you have your tennis shoes The Bentley is way out of the way  You have to be careful when you step out of the building or you could be run over by a vehicle going to the Mobil station that is right on top of the hotel  We had a quad room non smoking reserved and paid for but did not receive it  Ask for a wakeup call and had friends calling and our phone never rang the whole stay  Our neighbors complained about our t v  being to loud we had no way to adjust the volume  I could go on and on about the little things  My advise is to stay somewhere else  This hotel in my opinion is a  star  
P => One word to describe it   A Magic Hotel  Our stay at the Bentley Hotel was re arranged at the last minute because the Empire Hotel shut down the week before  What a bargain  The rooms were spacious the staff pleasant and the complimentary breakfast a bonus  The hotel is a bit out of the way but the bus stop across the road will get you into times square in  minutes  Dont get me wrong it isnt the ritz which is where all those people who are negative about the bentley should go and stay  They would soon complain then about the prices  We went in ch and the temperature in the room was fine  Go on book it but dont forget your trainers if you dont like public transport  
P => top dollar stayed at the bentley hotel in ch  excelent hotel very friendly very helpful hotel room very clean beds changed daily great location to the subway about  mins walk away all in all great value hotel and would definetly stay there again  
P => Cosy spot once you get there This is the third and our least favourite location of the Amsterdam Hospitality Group of hotels we have tried since ust   It is situated at the end of a quiet and dark street adjacent to a Mobil gas station  If you come arrive in daylight  The staff are very courteous knowlegeable and professional our hotel room amazingly spacious and the almost panoramic view from the st floor breakfast room breathtaking  The hotel is  blocks from the Roosevelt Island cable car station costs the same as a regular subway ride and down the block from a cluster of hospitals  It is a perfect location for visiting family or friends in one of these hospitals but a bit out of the way for travellers who like to be in the middle of the action  If you stay here get a metrocard so that you can hop on the M bus that passes right by the hotel  
P => great hotel my husband and i visited nyc and stayed at the bentley hotel last  we found the hotel very modern the room had fantastic views and was very clean  the free coffee and breakfast was much appreciated the only downside was that public transport to other attractions was quite a long walk from the hotel but we found that the cabs were quite cheap to use  i would recommend this hotel without hesitation  
P => beware the bentley hotel We had booked  triple rooms at the Bentley through a reputible travel agent  On arrival at the hotel midnight on   the reception staff stated that we had no reservation there  We now know this to be false  We ended up staying at a hospital residency  blocks away The Bentley is over booking people so beware the same  happen to you too  You too  be abandoned on the streets as we were  
P => Great Deal if you are paying for the hotel yourself or trying to save your business some money   this is a great place to stay to get a good deal  My room was great with a view of the skyline and was spacious and clean  Loved the st floor breakfast room   what an incredible view I drove to NYC for the weekend and the parking garage is pretty well priced for manhattan day  Overall the location is out of the way but it suited my needs for a nice clean place that was very well priced  under nt  
P => Press the yellow button There is only one way to describe this hotel and the word is quotstrangequot  The location is not bad if you walk  block the neighbourhood is quiet but with enough restaurants etc  A good place for people who dont fancy the turmoil of Broadway  The suites have reasonably dimensions for a New York Hotel and we could even lh about the depressed artist who chooses the colours for the interior design and those awful flower statues  But the problem is   The staff   Try to get room service and they tell you on Monday    no sorry not after  am     On Tuesday   sorry not before  am and on Thursday   a simple answer to the question do you have room service     a simple NO and the NO room service person hangs up the phone  We ided that it was a lottery    one could win room service if one called at the right moment  Then we wanted to watch a movie on the movie channel  quotPress the yellow button a womans voice said huskily on the channel    but    we looked and looked but no yellow button on the remote    The desk clerk could not help but after some pressure ided that the ultimate solution would be a change of rooms instead of a change of TVs there was a yellow button on the remote in the other room  But of course it did not work  Maintenance was called and could not offer a solution but after some persuasive phrases spoken to him in his own language was all of a sudden capable of fixing the problem  The chambermaid was so discrete she didnt even empty the trashcans or cleaned the room  Only linen and towels where changed  On the famous topside restaurant turned out to be a cafeteria that tried to look like a truckers roadside restaurant not the place for a romantic evening overlooking the skyline   We had a good time in the Bentley cause we were in a good mood and could lh at these things  End yes its not the end of the world all this minor mishaps  But on the other hand If the Bentley pretends to be a  star hotel and let people pay  dollars a night for a suite    then give the service that comes with those pretensions  People would like a cup of coffee delivered at their room would like clear answers and a little bit of service then it could be a real hotel instead of an imitation of an old English TV series quotfalwty towersquot about a crazy hotel owner and his even more crazy staff who hated their guests  
P => Annonimouse This hotel is brilliant i loved every minute of it  I couldnt find one fault with this hotel at all  The sign said ouside come as guests leave as friends  And it was very clean to say the least  Peter Kay would be very proud

P => Hip Hotel   Excellent location I stayed here for a week with work and thought the hotel was excellent  The rooms are small in comparison to European standard  I had a deluxe room though which was fine for just one person The staff were very polite friendly and helpful  The bar was buzzing and always seemed to be full to the rim   although I never made a stop there as there were so many other wonderful places to party  The bar seemed like a hip place to hang out The shower was fantastic  Yes the Bamble and Bamble products are lovely  The bathroom didnt have shower gel tooth brush etc that you would find in other hotels  A nice touch in the evening was the Lindt chocolates     great if you have munchies after a mad night out All in all a great place  Clean stylish rooms good lighting cool bar and restaurant and very helpful staff  It is a small hotel too so there is no chance theyll forget you are staying there I would stay here again   definetly recommended  
P => Nice boutique hotel Great hotel if you like something outside the box of typical chain hotels  We loved the industrial organic or although the lighting in the rooms was a bit insufficient  Great shower though including the bumble and bumble products  The hotel has a wonderful doorway and lobby and Town restaurant is a great place to meet business associates for a drink or dinner  All in all we were very pleased and would recommend this hotel  
P => Pricey chic in a great location The main thing I will take away from this hotel is that it had the largest shower head in the world Made for great showers but flooded the bathroom  I arrived and  men in puffa jackets removed my luggage from the taxi thought I was being robbed It is very modern and the o is great we wondered though if it was minimalist chic on purpose or if they had really just not bothered to do anything more than whitewash the rooms  Very very cool NY style  Fantastic really fantastic location off th Av across the road from Tiffanys and  steps from Central Park  Luxurious and comfortable aswell as modern and chic  Just VERY expensive  I was on a work trip and then stayed for the weekend but I would not pay for this myself probably even if I could have afforded it as I reckon for  a night for a smallish room its overpriced and there are even more luxurious places to stay for that money  Go if youre not paying and you wont be at all disappointed  For the location alone its worth it  
P => Midtown hip luxury Loved having windows that opened wide to the street below instead of being encased in a hermetically sealed cookie cutter hotel room experienced legendary service an attendant to sew on a button in a pinch an on call yoga instructor if needed complimentary room service for breakfast   located in the heart of New York s Fifth Avenue shopping mecca  Soho in feel  Extraordinary describes this stylish hotel that could double as a fine art museum  Loved our stay and will return again

P => Great Value for NY   but SMAAAAAALL  If you re not bothererd by the fact that the toilet is outside the room and shared with a few other guests from your floor it s not an issue  If you re on your own in the cuty and have few luggages it won t be a problem either  After being to NYC many times there s no need to stay in midtown anymore    which makes the hotel location perfect  It s a very charming place and the owner is a really sweet person always with a smile on his face  It s spotless and housekeeping does a really nice work  The room is cozy but too small and the tiny window makes it a bit claustrophobic    Anyway   paying  with taxes to be that well located in Manhattan is sometimes worth it  
P => Fine and dandy once again This was my th visit to Chelsea Lodge in  year and they have never let me down  Paul and his staff are helpful and the location is great for all the action that NYC has to offer  
P => clean good value nice location quiet   but feel slightly cheated The Chelsea Lodge Hotel is clean and excellent value  I doubt my brother and I could have got arate rooms at this price anywhere else in the Centre of New York  The location meant easy travelling on the subway which we managed many times a day without any trouble  There are also excellent restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance and a small convenience store right on the street corner  The HighLine is also only a  minute walk away which I recommend for early morning strollsHowever   we booked our rooms  months in advance when we arrived the receptionist huffed and puffed at the seeming inconvenience of having to book us in  He then stated that one of our rooms had to be a single room since all the other rooms were fully booked  This soured my stay  I am  foot and not best suited to a single bed  The bed was also on wheels which meant that if I tried to sit up in bed it would move across the floorTheir website clearly states that all rooms have a double bed   this is obviously untrue  I know I should have said something at the time  I will email them my concerns and let them know of my disappointmentDespite this I would stay here again and I do recommend it the price is so good  Just make sure you get what you ask for 
P => Great value for money We stayed here few nights last ch and just loved it  Chelsea Lodge is located in a nice quiet surroundings with good connections to subway  The room was very small the shower in a quotclosetquot was kind of funny and the heating didnt work very well ie  the nights were pretty cold  Luckily the bed was small as well so with two people it was easy to keep warm   Anyway this was very adorable place and I could consider staying here again and have already recommended it to my best friend  
P => Perfect for the Price We couldnt have asked for a better place After our hostel quotlostquot our reservation just  days before our departure we were scrambling to find something in our budget in a safe neighborhood  I emailed the Chelsea Lodge and with one room left I booked it  The owners were so incredibly nice and helpful let me print my boarding passes so I wouldnt have to go to an internet cafe and were wonderful with directions and suggestions  Yes the rooms are tiny but who goes to NYC to hang out in a hotel room Our room was on the second floor and on Saturday night there was quite a lot of street noise but the weekday nights were nice and quiet  we shared a bathroom and I never saw another person using it or in the hallways for that matter  It was like we had the place to ourselves  The neighborhood was fantastic  Within walking distance are restaurants and shops and the subway is at th and rd  
P => Chelsea Suites    Garden Apartment Warning As a former New Yorker I like staying in apartmentsand the Chelsea Suites a few doors down from theChelsea Lodge seemed a good option rather thana vacation rental off Criagslist  I wanted the dailyroom service  I was disappointed to find that myquotGarden Suitequot was not the same Garden Suiteon the website but actually a smaller apartmentwith low ceilingsbeneath the web site room    which which has high ceilingslarge windows and is the same price  When I complained tothe young woman at the front desk she did not apologize forthe quotbait and switchquot and said the other room wasbooked for the same week I was there  Make sure you getthe upstairs Garden Suite if you ide to stay here  And be niceto the tenant below and walk softly  Those upstairstenants woke me up every morning clomping around on thehard wood floors  The maidsdid make the bed and clean the bathroom butthey never swept the floor  By the end of the week it waslittered with leaves from the garden and the usual dirt  The halls had old wallpaperwith dirty carpeting and overall it was a little depressing  The bedwas hard and felt like cardboard under the paper thin sheets  The quilt bedspread was worn faded and looked dirty  But it was lovely to lay in my bed and look out on the verdant private garden with a nice tree which hadchanged its leaves to gold  Its hard to find this kindof garden apartment on a pretty chelsea street at this price and for that reason alone Id consider going back But Im going to look closer at the Craigslist vacationrental apartments first    which are half the price  
P => great value fantastic value guesthouse  Its so cheap we were a little anxious but it came highly recommended  We did find our room at the front of the hotel on the ground floor a little noisy and though we were prepared for the shared toilet we werent prepared for walking across reception to get to it  I would recommend requesting a room on the upper floors or one at the back  
P => small but nice We stayed here for a few nights on our honeymoon  The staff we dealt with was pleasant and they let us keep our luggage in the office the day we were leaving since we were leaving after check out time  I dont know if all of the rooms come with a private bathroom but we were kind of in the basement and we had a private bathroom  Everything was clean and there was a window AC unit in the room  It was a good price for New York so we didnt mind the small room and bathroom  We also wanted somewhere with character that wasnt a chain hotel so this was perfect  The neighborhood seemed safe and it was quiet at night  I think the area is popular with the gay crowd because we saw lots of gay couples while we were there  The hotel is only a couple short blocks to a subway stop which was very convenient  Overall we enjoyed are stay 
P => Lovely little guesthouse great local area Chelsea Lodge is charming with its brownstone steps and quirky rooms  The room was bigger than I was expecting for NYC and the toilet being down the hall was not a problem at all very clean and always free  The neighbourhood is lovely   we recommend the Cookshop restaurant two blocks away on th and th fantastic food If you are looking for inexpensive accommodation that is safe charming clean and convenient then this is for you  
P => Perfect Highly recommended We are a newly ried couple from Germany  We were in NY for the first time We stayed in Chelsea Lodge for  days nights and did absolutely enjoy our stay there  Our room was small but very cute and especially very clean  Sink and shower were in the room  bathrooms just next door The restrooms have always been clean and we never had to wait for one as there were enough of them  The stuff was very friendly and helpful room service was great fresh towels every day only could the floor have been vacumed once or twice Chelsea was very nice to stay a very nice and especially quite part of NY city  Grocery stores drugstores delis restaurant and metro stations are all just around the corner All in all If we wil ever be in NY again we would definitely stay at Chelsea Lodge again 
P => Very Small Rooms but Great Location in Chelsea Stayed here for  nights total either side of a bus trip out of New York  Great base for exploring the Big Apple  The Lodge is a converted brownstone on th St between th and th Avenue  Rooms and small but quite comfortable  Small shower  wash basin and shared bathroom in hall outside  We had the room downstairs next to the door first night and a st floor room that was much quieter for our other  nights  Room was clean and serviced daily  Very helpful staff on hand  Location m from numerous restaurants in Chelseas GBLT district  Very reasonably priced for New York accommodation  
P => I loved the Chelsea Lodge and want to go back At first I wasnt sure I was in the right place as there was no sign  As soon as I stepped in I loved it  Lovely little hallway which had a olde worlde feel to it  I loved the pictures on the wall and the green painted bannister  No lift but the lovely guy in the reception room sorry didnt catch the name helped us with our bags  We were on the top floor and looked onto th Street which was lovely and leafy  Room quite small but I didnt find it a problem and we had everything we needed and hardly spent any time in it  I was a bit apprehensive at first about sharing a toilet but it was no problem whatsoever  There were  very clean toilets on each floor and I didnt once see or even hear anyone else in them  In a great location between th and th avenue and and only a few streets from the subway  Id recommend this to anyone and will stay there again if im lucky enough to visit New York again  
P => Great Location and Good Value This hotel is in a lovely leafy street just off th Avenue is is close to the rd Street Subway which is useful for the E line which connects direct to JFK plus all the other lines The area feels safe day and night and has some good bars and resutrants nearby although some do close early compared to NYC standards  There is a superket on the corner and a couple of Starbucks nearby The hotel is very nice although I did feel the rooms were a little small once you opened up the large suticase it was all a little tight a light over the mirror by the sink would also be useful  However we did not spend much time in the hotel and the bed was comfy a reminder to other guests that closing doors can be done quietlyIt is within walking distance of several of the main attractions or areas  
P => Have the ultimate Hello I live here   experience I can really recommend the Chelsea Lodge The location is perfect you will feel very safe and at home in this area and you will feel like a local in no time  The rooms are cozy and well mentained and you will have your own shower and sink  It was not a problem at all to walk down the hall for the toilet  It was always free and clean You will get good value for your money 
P => Once Again the Chelsea Lodge live up to its reputation This was our nd stay at the Chelsea Lodge  months later and once again we were made very welcome and the rooms were very cozy and warm  Thanks again Chelsea Lodge for making us feel at home 
P => Highly recommended My husband and I are two  year olds and it was our first time in NYC If you want a hotel do not stay here Its a wonderful home away from home instead  We stayed for  nights and wanted a place to sleep without bell boys running after us and cheesy greetings every time we show our faces out of our room The staff are friendly when you ask for advise and are prompt to pass on all phone messages Fresh towels and a quick wipe down of the sink are provided daily but we would have appreciated a change of linen at least once as well as a sweep of the floor which was fairly dusty by the time we left   but not to worry  The shared toilet is no problem at all it was always free and always clean Chelsea is a wonderful area and the E train which goes both up and down town is only a  minute walk away as is Murrays Bagels which was frequented by us daily Great value for money   highly recommended if you want a fuss free place to stay The only cons I have to mention is poor internet signal inside the room on the rd floor had to sit on the steps to use it and a very average squeaky bed  
P => Great location good value Just got back from a weeklong stay herea room for two with shared loo was  including all taxes   cheap for NYC  Chose the Chelsea Lodge as we wanted to be able to save a little on accommodation to enable us to spend on eating out  Having read previous reviews we knew the room would be small so were not surprised by this  However it was adequate for our needs and was cleaned daily with freshly laundred towels  There was a plentiful supply of hot water and the pressure in the shower was good  There were two loos to share on each of the floors and I found that there was always one free and they were very clean  Our room was at the back of the building which I was pleased about as it was further away from the loos and any associated noise in the night  Staff kept themselves to themselves but were polite and helpful when asked for advice  There is WiFi access The location was great   this section of Wth Street is between th and th Avenues and there are lots of restaurantsupket delis in the vicinity but a  min walk will get you to Union Square or the West Village   subway stations within a five minute walk thth for lines  and  rdth for lines C and E and thth for lines AC E and L  
P => Bed without breakfast The Chelsea Lodge was easy to find  There was no breakfast provided however there was plenty of choice locally and we found a healthy smoothie for breakfast just around the corner  There is an entrance to the tube at rd Street a  minute walk away and the Chelsea Lodge is well placed for exploring Manhattan  The shared toilet was cleaned every day and it was never a problem sharing as we had a basin and shower in the room  The room was very small and the Lodge was run by a young girl who was friendly but typically of New York there was little by way of introduction or explanation  
P => A home away from home My partner and I always stay at the Chelsea Lodge when we visit NYC  We stay in a suite usually a garden suite and as soon as we arrive we settle back into life in the Big Apple  This place is so homely and cosy and is so comfortable  Okay the facilities arent always the best but we always feel so relaxed and safe when staying here  The staff are friendly and helpful but best of all they leave you alone to enjoy your trip  Staying in one of the suites is like staying in someones home and you have your own key so you can come and go as you please  Everything on Manhattan is so accessible and Chelsea is a great area to stay in with lots of bars and restaurants  We couldnt imagine staying anywhere else in New York this place is gold 
P => Fantastic Location Authentic NYC experience  Spent ch Break here with my  year old dhter and loved it We stayed in one of the parlour suites facing the street just below ground level  Big windows lots of light  Very spacious  Kitchenette had everything you might need to make a meal  we just made breakfast each day to save some time  Radiator heating with two settings On or Off however we like it warm so we didnt mind this  We felt very safe as others have said coming home from the subway at night  theres even a police precinct up the street  Nice neighbourhood Chelsea ket  FANTASTIC Location could not be better Two different subway lines are easily accessible from this location and get you to all the major sites within a very short period of time  Its not a traditional hotel which immediately appealed to us  We felt like we were coming home to our own little New York apartment  If you are sensitive to noise however this is a big city and we could hear conversations on the street outside as well as the usual sirens and other big city noises  So if youre a light sleeper bring ear plugs we did and slept fine  Bottom line Great value for the money 
P => Cozy Quiet and Clean Booked this place last minute before a trip down to see friends for the weekend and what a find  The place is just as the title says above cozy  Room was very clean as well as the bathroom across the hall of which there were two on the same floor  Im pretty sure that this is the case on each floor as far as there being two on each floor  The shower was very adequate and clean and the bed was comforatable  I stayed one night since we stayed with friends the first night and used the room to take a nap after bring out all night and the place served it purpose perfectly  I was very suprised after expecting anything  It was a very quiet street considering where it is and so pleasant  If you dont want to spend the money on parking which is a few blocks over I had seen plenty of spots constantly opening up on the street  
P => Cozy and Clean No problem here   very clean and cozy  If you are claustrophobic the room could get on your nerves  But most of the time is spent outside the room anyway  The neighborhood was great  Only three blocks to the subway  Some great places to eat  Check out Spice around the corner on th for moderately priced Thai some of the best Ive ever had  For breakfast you have to try The Bread Stix Cafe on the corner of rd and th  The best pastries ever Try the cheese danish  I wonder about the thought process that went into putting showers in the rooms but that is a topic for a different venue  I would have preferred a large comfy chair for lounging in while surfing the web but different strokes for different folks  The only downside for me were the stairs  That applies to all of NYC however  I asked for a room in the rear on the first or second floor and was accommodated so that was all I could ask for  My favorite place to stay is Embassy Suites on N  End Ave   a night on weekends  You get a suite and a full breakfast and managers reception  Cant be beat  But during the week it is  Ouch Too much for one person  
P => Location location Right near the subway Chelsea ket good restaurants Atlantic Theater movie theater and lots more The price was very reasonable  The room was small but adequate and very clean with a shower sink and small tv  the toilet is down the hall but I felt I had it to myself as I never met anyone else coming or going  no pun intended No phones in rooms  Pay phone in the lobby this shouldnt matter to anyone but technopeasants such as I am  I intend to stay here again the staff was wonderful and the lodge just right for my tastes  
P => Great location helpful staff I stayed here with a friend for  nights  The location was great   lots of local cafes restaurants superketspharmacies and close to the subway  We had the downstairs suite which has access to a shared garden  The bed was very comfortable but unfortunately the couch doesnt make a good bed  My friend took the couch and he said that it was very uncomfortable although he didnt say this until the end of our stay  Apart from that the bathroom was great newly reated and surprisingly large and it was very convenient to have a kitchenette with a fridge for our drinking water  The owner I dont know his name helped us with our luggage and got us extra towels when requested   he was pleasant and prompt  I would stay here again   we could even walk from Manhattan   only   mins  
P => Bad experience The bathrooms on  out of the  days we stayed there were either out of soap or paper towels  The mattress we slept on was awful  If you laid down in the middle of it the sides would fold around you  And I got bitten by bed bugs and by the time I left The Chelsea Lodge I was covered in welts  I would never recommend this place to anyone  
P => Its my home away from home If you are going to NYC one of the greatest cities on earth why not choosing for a very nice place to stay Chelsea Lodge  Whether you have a business or pleasure trip this charming hotel is absolutely great  Housed in a brownstone in Chelsea a very nice neighboorhood and very central close to Meatpacking District with very good restaurants and galleries near to Midtown aka Shopping Paradise  And also very close to trendy clublife  th Street itself is quiet and very beautiful with lots of trees and beautiful houses But the best of Chelsea Lodge is the cozy hotel itself  The rooms are clean and they offer all the essentials you need a shower sink a nice bed wireless internet And the staff     James and all the others are very friendly and helpful and they know what service is aboutif you want to have sightseeing suggestions they will give you great recommmendations you wont find in a tourist guide  If you are in for a little chat they will making feel you at home  If you need any help you will get it right away And if you there just to do your thing they will respect your privacy  Anyway you will get the picture this place is great and a bargainEvery year I will make at least two visits doing this since   So its my home away from home Europe    
P => great reasonable find in chelsea heard some good thing about the chelsea lodge from friends from LA who stay last ch  The chelsea lodge is a great little hotel on a nice block in chelsea  The rooms were small by very clean well appointed  The chelsea area had some wonderful moderately price places to eat right up the block along th avenue  la bergamont on th ave was a great suggestion for a great coffee and french pastries  cuold not think of a btter place for a get away to the city then Chelsea lodge the surrounding area 
P => Good location and price  We were there one week  Room was small but anyway enough space for two persons when main goal is to see the NYC  Room and toilets were clean  The area is good and it s pretty close to everything  First  days we have room that was on street side and some noise came into room  Earplugs helps  Then we chanced other room that was very silent and we were very satisfied about hotel Sumy good location price clean I will visit again 
P => Small original clean and cheap hotel  Looks like home  No sign outside the hotel it does say a little about the quotspiritquot of the house and its orating  ducks everywhere  Its an old brownstone building with small rooms  Lovely oration showsers ans sink shared WC  Its clean  Very well located  What more to say  Oh yes THE PRICE is more than OK for New York and Chelsea  A bargain Conclusion the staff was cold but go there it is a good choice  No breakfast  Benj  
P => Perfect for our purpose My sister and I both in our twenties stayed four nights  Loved the cozy room as it was a cold week in ember loved the secure building you must have a key to enter or ring the doorbell we stayed in a room on the main floor where it was quiet for the most part    we could hear some noise late at night with people just getting in we go to bed early the room was clean but no frills sharing the restroom was NEVER an issue staff was helpful in finding restaurants Lasagne Ristorante was AMAZING and other questions  The subway was convenient  You must go to Dish a restaurant nearby  If you are looking for luxury go somewhere else but if you are on a budget or are looking for a place that you will always remember this is the place  Great Experience Overall  
P => lovely affordable hotel A friend and I stayed here for  nights  It was a perfect base for our trip  The rooms were small as expected but charming  We were in a nd floor room facing the street  It was very quiet with window closed and only minor noise with the window open  The place was very clean  The walls were a bit thin could hear my friend talking on the phone when I was in the hall but we never experienced any problems with people being noisy so that didnt really matter  Overall it was a perfect place to stay for a very reasonable price in NYC  The neighborhood was very nice too  Some nice restaurants around and it felt very safe  Only a short walk from the rd St ACE Subway stop  I would feel very comfortable recommending this place to friends  In fact I have already done so  
P => Torturous Stay    learned the hard way We were quotupgradedquot without our knowledge and then charged for it  We stayed for three days  Our room was a dungeon below street level  The walls are paper thin and there was quite a bit of noise from other guests  The room was not clean  There were spots of what appeared to be blood above the sink in the bathroom and clearly they have never cleaned the walls or doorknobs in the bedroom  The sheets and towels are threadbare   literally   with holes in them  There were brown stain streaks on both sets of sheets we infested  There was no temperature control in the room  We were at the mercy of the guests above us  The first two nights we froze and the last night we roasted  For some reason they ided to not clean our room on the second day  I can only surmise as a cost saving measure We are staying in New York for  nights and if they didnt have a  hour no cancellation policy we would have left after the first night  We are now staying in a much more comfortable and squeaky clean hotel that is  less a night booked through hotline dot comThe hotel has no service whatsoever  Its basically a motel with no parking  To me that means  star  We are feeling ripped off at this point  night for a room in a converted basement is absurd in any city  For the life of me I cannot explain our experience  I read through previous reviews carefully and we expected some charm here  Alas this was not the case  I am left with the suspicion that the hotel has spammed this board with a large number of their own reviews  I would unequivocally not recommend this establishment  There are many comfortable and clean hotels in New York that have a number of guest services and can be had for less money if you merely take the time to shop on the internet at any of a number of web sites  
P => What a wonderful place to stay The Chelsea Lodge is an attractive brownstone building conveniently located only  blocks from the E train  We arrived on foot having walked from the empire state building via Union Sq  Park  Although it took us about  mins we were surprised at how centrally the hotel was located   we used the subway after that thoughWe arrived early to check in but that wasnt a problem and we were shown to a clean airy room  It was small but had a large window which made it very light  We were only staying one night and had plenty of space  I had read so much about New York hotel room sizes I was expecting a sardine tin and I was pleasantly surprisedIn the room was a good shower and a basin and toiletries  There was also room to hang clothes and stow bags and a TV Sharing a toilet wasnt a problem at all and I never had to wait even at am Overall we had a very pleasant stay at the Chelsea Lodge and it really was amazing value  We would absolutely recommend it  
P => A real gem A big thumbs up from me My  night stay was great  I was given a room that looked out onto the back courtyard and the large window let in alot of natural light  My room was small but for one person it was enough and I never felt claustrophobic There was enough storage space to store my things without cluttering up the room  Heating was kept at a comfortable level and I was neither too hot or too cold  The room was cleaned daily and an abundance of fresh towels was delivered daily  The bed was fabulous Its a firmer matress which I love and I slept like a baby every night  Water pressure in the shower is goo dand the communal toilets are spotless  The staff are helpful and the neighbourhood is great  You are not far away from anything and transport links are plentiful  Theres a pay phone in the lobby and a selection of tourist brochures to choose from  I did not take any photos because what you see on the website is what you get I thoroughly recommend this place and when I next return to NYC would have no hesitation in staying here again  
P => Chelsea Suites is the place to be The Chelsea Suites is an awesome place to stay  It is in a great neighborhood close to many great shops and restaurants  The bus and subway is super close  I stayed in the parlor suite closest to the street  The only drawback is the street noise  I would recommend a suite off of the street for the best experience  I can not wait to go back  This is where I will stay in New York from here on out  
P => A peaceful room in buzzing city We stayed at this hotel in late il early  in one of the ordinary rooms on the st floor  We got ried in Central Park  st so part of the stay was our honeymoon  Alltogether we stayed for  nights and could easily stayed longer It was a small room with a queen sized bed an open closet a drawer a small TV a wash basin and a shower  The window faced the back garden  All the rooms  I think on one floor shared two toilets which were perfectly cleaned all the time and so was our room  The towels were changed every day if you threw them on the floor and shampoo and soap were provided when needed  No hair dryer but I bought one for  dollars at the drugstore on the corner a traveling model that can be used on  and  V The style of the interior design was old American country classic and very suitable for this classic brownstone buildning  The street was calm and quiet and the neighborhood contained of people from all walks of life and had a lot of good breakfast lunch coffee dinner and bar choices  Also you have movie theatres some shops and the riverside walk with all sorts of sporting activities  And several subway and bus lines close by  The staff was very quick and helpful with luggage answering questions and leaving messages when someone phoned us  I can highly recommened this as a romantic get away and if you are to get ried in NYC you have the chelsea flower shops just araound the corner  
P => A Great Place to Stay in NYC Chelsea Lodge is a great place to stay when visiting the city  My husband and I stayed for two nights and this was our second time here we also stayed here in  of this year  The hotel is close to restaurants and the subway and is on a quiet tree lined street  The rooms are small but comfortable  You have a sink and shower in your room and share a toilet  The rooms are cozy and clean and the staff are quite friendly  I did find the room to be a little bit cold in ember  We will definitely stay here again 
P => A little gem in the Big Apple Fantastic and cosy small hotel in a very peacuful neighborhood  Fantastic location near a subway station with lots of great restaurants around The staff was very friendly and the oration remind me a doll house The bathroom in the corridor was never a problem  Always immaculate and available Ill will return to Chelsea Lodge in my next trip to NY  For sure 
P => Highly recommeded We have just returned from a  night stay at the Chelsea Lodge and I have nothing but positive things to say about our stay The accomodation was clean traditional and felt very homely  Our room on the nd floor didnt seem small as other reviews have stated we took  bags rather than suitcases and had enough drawer space to unpack and put the bags under the bed out of the way  The bed was really comfortable which was a welcome relief after a long day sightseeing  The shower and the sink in the room worked well and we never had a problem with the shared toilets there was  on our floor and they were spotlessly clean and always free  We only saw one or two other guests during our stay so going to the toilet in the middle of the night didnt cause any problems either  We didnt hear the pipes banging as some people stated be we were lucky and the hotel room was warm and cosy which was needed as it was bitterly cold out and about during the day The room had everything you need with a small Tv with enough of a selection of cable channels as you relaxed in the evening complimentary toiletries and clean towels provided everyday  The rooms dont provide safety deposit boxes but I cant imagine there would ever be an issue as all the staff were so friendly and had all worked there years we kept our valuables locked in our bags and this worked well for us James on reception was helpful and patient in answering all our queries and gave some useful advise where to shop etc We stayed here with my parents who are in the s and they enjoyed it equally as much as we did The hotel has an excellent location only just over a  min walk to  different metro stations we also walked most of our time and it took just over  mins to walk to Times Square  We found walking the best way to experience New York and so easy to follow the roads as they are all at parallels just get a good map before you go and you wont get lost Be warned however on arrival at the airport as there was  of us we ided to get a taxi dont go with any driver who approaches you inside the terminal as they arent insured generally the offical taxis are outside and it cost us  including tolls to get to the the Chelsea Lodge  If there are  of you travelling you can get the Newark Air Transit from Newark for  per person single journey then a taxi from Penn station to Chelsea Lodge was  although the taxi journey on arrival took about  mins not much traffic when we arrived and the train took closer to hr mins and harder work with luggage when we left Getting around New York is so easy we walked everywhere during the day as mentioned and would take a metro back in the evenings  You can get a  day unlimited metro card for pp a single trip is  which has to be used within  hours of purchase or a  ride ticket for  which has to be used within  hours  We felt perfectly safe wherever we were and only took a metro home at night as we had done som much walking during the day  Taxis if there are more than  of you travelling would work out just as cost effective as they were also inexpensive however it took us a while to flag one down during rush hour and the metro would get you to your destination quicker  Make sure you get the right train from the right station as not all trains go from all stations the lines available are shown at the top of the steps to each metro station once you go in and purchase your ticket you have to swipe it to go through the turnstiles your ticket is then used for that trip so if youve bought a singe trip ticket and you find you are on the wrong stations its invalidated  Also make sure you know if you need uptown or downtown so you dont end up on the wrong train   seems obvious I know but it can be disorientating on arrival Sightseeing we went to Top of the Rock fantastic we did this during the day its not as cold and the Empire State Building as they have plastic sheeting all round   doesnt spoil the view its on  levels and gives you  panoramic views its was about  pp entrance and we didnt queue for long  We visited the Empire State Building at dusk its a such a beautiful building and as it went dark the night skyline is amazing it was very very cold so we didnt spend long but I would recommend a visit again entrance is about pp  We visited the New York fire museum in Soho  Spring Street its only small but has some fascinating artefacts and a erate room dedicated to the  firefighters who lost their lives in  entrance was only pp  We took the free Staten Island ferry to see the statue of liberty you get close enough to get some really good pictures as well as some great pictures looking back at the Manhatten skyline  Central park is an oasis of calm amongst all the madness we spent  hours just walking round enjoying its serenity visit Strawberry fields and the John Lennon imagine memorial placed by Yoko Ono this is just infront of the Dakota Apartments where he lived and was shot outside  The zoo is only small but a nice place to spend half an hour its only pp  The World Trade Centre visitors tribute was particularly moving again its only a couple of small rooms but crammed with artefacts from the twin towers and photos of all those who died as a result of the terrorist attacks entrance was  donation you could have a guided tour with a survivor or a relative for pp which lasts about  hour and is meant to give a more personal insight into events Shopping   fantastic allow at least one day just to shop when going to Macys and Bloomingdales go to the visitors centre on the balcony level with you passport for   discount cards  Macys souveniers in the basement had great price jeans and wasnt as expensive as youd expect  MM world Times Square you wouldnt believe what merchandise you could get over  floors Disney store was really magical as was Build a Bear even if these arent your usual places to visit they seem special because they are in New York  We found Footlocker good for trainerstimberland boots etc one large store in Times Sq and one opposite Macys  Virgin megastore in Times Sq also had some real bargains  Cheaper clothes shop was Old Navy although some of the styles were abit unusual great for topsjumpers etc One piece of advise try and get a list of as many restaurants before you travel when you are tired from a long day shopping the last thing you want to do it walk around looking for somewhere to eat  Eat in Chelsea we found it was at least half the price as anywhere close to Times Sq  We had breakfast at Toasties on th ave between rd which was really cheap doesnt look great from outside but food it amazing and empire diner th ave nd other recommendation Galaxy diner th ave th  In the evening we ate at Dish a couple of times literally  mins just on th ave from the hotel prices are really resonable choice is good and food excellent and also at a Lasagna ristorante mainly lasagnas food was really good but abit more expensive  Also found great rib housebbq close to either thrd metro sorry didnt write down address but excellent food good prices but gets very busy so was abit noisey  Starbucks are really cheap for a warm drink to refuel during the day but dont have much seating   avoid the toilets as they arent particularly clean  There are very few public toilets so its a case of finding them is shops   Bloomindales are   or small coffee shops etc The Chelsea Lodge is ideal as an excellent value for money homely base to see New York I wouldnt hesiste to recommend it and we are planning to go back in a couple of years and would definatly stay there again If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me we had the most amazing time New York is fantastic just make sure you allow enough time to do everything we had  days and it was just right  
P => Wow what a haven from the hustle and bustle We stayed for  nights from th ember  We had a lovely cosy room behind reception which was so quiet at night we had taken ear plugs expecting to need them but didn t  We loved the location and the personal touches in this hotel  The staff were lovely and the rooms toilets very clean warm and homely  we hardly ever saw another guest  Shared toilets no problem at all  The rooms are compact but what do you need more space in a room for We looked forward to coming quothomequot to our sanctuary after each busy day in the city  The Lodge is close to great restaurants and amenities Cant fault it  We would gladly come back  
P => great place excellent value for money This place is clean and in a good location it feels safe and the shared toilets work just fine  The staff are helpful and given the price you cant complain that the room is small it saves you a small fortune when compared to the price of a hotel  It was perfect for our trip we spent our money enjoying new york rather than on a fancy room  Would deffo come back  
P => Great little place   excellent value for New York Excellent value place in Chelsea  Rooms are small and WC is shared but everything is spotlessly clean staff are really friendly and for less than  in a great location you cant go wrong  
P => New Yorks little secret We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for  days from th ober  Great location a couple of stops on the E line from Madison Square Gdn and a few more from Times Square Central Park amp Battery Park   Hint buy a USD metropass for  days unlimited subway travel  Local Shops and Restaurants also just around the corner The Dish did a good breakfast We had a room on the rd Floor which was clean tidy with a comfy normal sized double bed  The room had some hanging space for clothes a  inch flat screen TV amp shower in the corner  Toilets were down the hall   which we knew before we came   they were clean with soap dispensers tiled floors and air freshener just in case Room was cleaned everyday to a good standard and had a window looking out to a covered courtyard   dont use this to judge the weatherAll in the Chelsea Lodge has everything you need in NYC as you are out exploring most of the time and a warm room with a bed is what you want at the end of the day  
P => Chelseas Secret We stayed in the Chelsea Lodge for  nights based on the reviews on TripadvisorWe were given a first floor room the room was quite small with nowere for our suitcases however we were expecting this we only used the room for getting ready and sleeping my friends were staying at the Raddison on Lexington Avenue and there room was nothing to write home about and they paid  a night Great location away from the hustle and bustle of times square only a stop away on the Subway Did all the usual touristy things i would recommend the hop on and off bus tour it takes you everywere and is only  gr value Dont excpect the Waldorf when booking this if you want a central gr valus hotel the Chelsea Lodge is perfect 
P => Worked well for seniors The Chelsea Lodge worked well for us  We stayed for  nights inNew York  We are both over  and were placed on the nd flooracross from the toilets  We found it to be clean the personnelhelpful  It was still warm enough that the heat was not on so cannot attest to the heat register noise  We were in the front andcould hear the school children waiting for their bus  We got adifferent perspective of New York  Enjoyed it and would stay there again  
P => Great Location I chose the Chelsea Lodge after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor  It s in a great location convenient for uptown and downtown with a subway stop close by  I would recommend the second floor garden suite over the basement one it was much better laid out and brighter  Overall its great value for money My one problem was the quality of cleaning service we stayed  nights and not once was the floor vacuumed the beds were not made properly and the linen didnt appear to be changed at all  
P => Felt like home Along with the majority of people on here we discovered the Chelsea Lodge by searching through the recommended hotels in New York City on Tripadvisor and wondered why a small privately owned hotel which seemed so cheap was amongst some of the best reviewed hotels in Manhattan  After reading through the many reviews we ided to contact the hotel directly and ask if they had the basement room available  Whilst researching the hotel we found out that the basement rooms were larger than the normal compact rooms and they are also en suite whereas the other rooms have to share the bathrooms  The hotel mentioned that they cost a little extra but we worked it out to be around   more than a standard room  For additional space and en suite we thought this was worth it  The hotel itself is situated in the Chelsea which is a neighbourhood on the West Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan  The hotel is located a couple of blocks from rd Street Subway  There is no sign on the hotel to indicate that its the Chelsea Lodge so make sure you take note of the street and the number of the building otherwise you could quite easily walk past it without realising  The hotel is a two minute walk to many shops delis bars and restaurants and has pretty much everything you would need within  minutes of the hotel  I recommend the Lasagna Ristorante as a really nice place to eat  Its located on the corner of th Avenue th Street  When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the man on reception  He was friendly and checked us in quickly and made sure we had everything we needed  By the stairs there were information leafletsbooklets and attraction cards with some great discounts on  I recommend taking a look at these as you could save a lot of money if you ide to do two or more of the attractions  He took us to our room in the basement  This was spacious en suite shower no bath and had air con The bed was comfortable and we had two pillows each  When we arrived there were two Hersheys kisses on each pillow  Nice touch There was a phone alarm clock hairdryer in the bathroom with free soap and shampoo  There was a flat screen TV which had cable with around  channels  This was great as it had a football soccer channel and also showed live Premier League games  I woke up watched a live football game and then went and discovered NYC   what a life We could come and go at any time as we were given a key to the hotel front door and also to our room  They also didnt mind if you brought back takeaways  Basically we could treat it like home  The hotel looked quite old fashioned  There were a lot of old pictures up and the wallpaper in our room looked a bit dated but I guess this made it seem more homely than being in a hotel  Overall I highly recommend inquiring about the basement rooms if you want a bit of extra space or be if you dont fancy sharing a bathroom with others  The hotel was cheap clean close to a subway and there were plenty of shops and places to eat in a safe neighbourhood  They made our beds and changed our towels daily  We couldnt have asked for any more  As for negatives about the hotel I guess it could do with a sign or something to let people know that its a hotel and it would have been nice to have a kettle available for tea and coffee but I guess that could be a British thing Overall    it was great 
P => Stay here Remove all fear of the unknown Having put a lot of research into where to stay I am so very happy with our ision to stay at Chelsea Lodge  Thanks to the honest reviews in Tripadvisor on this property and others our  nights in ust  where a blast It is on a lovely treelined street a very short walk from th Ave with a pharmacy shops and numerous places to eat nearby  We arrived late  am in the morning and this was no problem  We went straight to bed and settled our account in the morning such a relieft after  hours travellingThe rooms where good just what you see in the pics  The toilets are clean quiet and a non issue  We had at least  on our floor and no one had to wait  Our room sloped a little but this added to the character I mean this is an old city  Great shower A short walk to the subway great bagels at Brooklyn Bagels  I agree with others DO NOT STAY NEAR TIMES SQUARE or you will never see NYC  New York is about its neighbourhoods not its tourist attractions  
P => Absolutely great place to stay We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge because of Tripadvisor reviews and we were very glad we did  Be prepared though it is not your normal mid America Holiday Inn type of hotel experience  However as long as you do your research you wont be surprised by anything  The rooms are exactly as pictured and many of the other reviews were bang on  Everything was clean and quiet during our stay and as others have written the shared toilets were a total non factor  Other than the price whats really great about the hotel is the neighbourhood We loved the area and treasured our early mornings and coming back late at night after all our adventures  We felt quite safe because of the  restaurants and all the pedestrians and traffic on th  After a couple of days we began to feel sorry for all the tourists staying near Times Square  Be sure to check out the nearby Empire Diner Sarabeth s Bakery in the Chelsea ket and Murray s Bagels for eats although I m sure there are many others we missed  Doing my pre trip research I noticed a Tripadvisor submission by the hotel so if anyone connected to the Chelsea Lodge reads this review please accept our heartfelt thanks for playing such a large part in making our visit so memorable  
P => Wonderful Stay My husband and I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge from t   th and thoroughly enjoyed our stay  We stayed in a deluxe room   in the basement which had its own private bathroom and plenty of room space to spare  It was well worth the extra money spent for this upgrade from their other rooms  It was cleaned out very well only smelled of cleaning solution upon arrival and it wasnt too strong  The bed definitely wasnt the most comfortable that Ive ever slept in and it was a little caved in the middle but it wasnt horrible  After all the long and busy days we could have fallen asleep on the floor The tv had cable and all the movie channels that you could ask for which was great when we had some down time to relax The front desk staff were nice enough We got a good morning every day and they were nice enough to call for a ride for us back to the airport  We took a taxi from Laguardia to the lodge which costed about  with tip and toll included we only had to wait about  min for a taxi there is a long line of cars waiting at the airport to take you amp the city makes sure you dont get ripped off by giving you a slip with rates stated on it  The city can not guarantee you will get ripped off if you flag a taxi outside the lodge to get back to the airport so that is why its recommended to get a flat rate car or shuttle service  Just ask the desk staff the day before you leave to arrange for a car to pick you up from the lodge this service costed  w tip and toll As for New York I learned a few pointers I can share with you  First if you plan on taking the  line subway to South Ferry for the Statue of Liberty make sure you are in one of the first  cars in the train otherwise you wont be able to get off on the last stop that you need to get off of  Also be careful when getting on express subway trains  They skip a lot of the stops black dot stops on the subway maps Second skip the top of the Empire State building amp go to the top of the Rockefeller Center  It costs about the same and you can actually get the Empire state and Central Park in your pictures Third if you are looking for the quality quotCoachVersace or Luis Vuittonquot purses the Cs look like a C and not Q or G go to Canal street into the fake purse shops  Even if you only see the obvious fake purses just ask if they have Coach or wait for them to ask you if you want a Coach purse and then they will show you their secret stash or take you into a hidden upstairs room  Be aware I wouldnt do this alone We were taken into a locked van at one point which I wasnt happy about and no one should be alone it felt unnerving  If they start walking you away from the stores then you are most likely going to a car so say quotnoquot if you dont want to do that As for shows we saw Phantom of the Opera Young Frankenstein and Hairspray  The last two were excellent and funny and Phantom was good too but just not my kind of play  If you dont ide to see a show until that day watch out for raffles done a few hours before the show  Both Young Frank and Hairspray raffled off  tickets  or  hours respectively before the performance  The raffle for YF is actually for front row seats which is excellent  We didnt win that raffle but they allowed us to purchase wonderful balcony tickets for the same price  Dont forget your cash though no cards accepted for this deal If you dont want to take a chance waiting that long to purchase tickets just go to www nytix com and for a one time  membership fee they will give you promo codes on all plays for    off ticket prices which you can buy from Ticketmaster before you even go on your trip  Forget wasting your time and cash at a TKTS boothLast tip dont forget your cash You will be surprised at how many small restaurants rental places boats   Central Park and tickets booths will only take cash  Have a great trip and dont hesitate to stay at this lodge  We cant wait to come back again 
P => Great value and convenience to Broadway Penn Station and Restourants My wife and I stayed there one night to see the play quotEquusquot  We enjoyed our stay and the staff was hurried but helpful  The rooms were clean and quiet  The staff recomended a breakfast and dinner place just up the street that were very good Cheers to Chelsea Lodge 
P => Very nice hotel This is a very nice place to stay  Staff is friendly location is great and rooms are nice and clean  We changed our reservation just a week in advance and there were no problems  I would definitively stay here again  
P => Great budget accomodation We enjoyed a  night stay at the Chelsea lodge in e  The property is located on a lovely street in the heart of Chelsea  The room was quite small shower and sink in your room  Though the toliet was just outside the room it wasnt a problem at all we never had to wait  The reception staff are a little strange not overly friendly but helpful if you required anything  The air con in our room was really noisy so couldnt have it on during the night which made sleeping quite uncomfortable in the high humidityThe hotel is about  blocks from the centre which is about a mile easy to walk  But the area where the hotel is has got lots of nice restaurants fast food places bars and a cinema  We can recommend O Mai   a Vietnamese restaurant just round the corner  Also Qdoba and Rub BBQ are near by   very tastyOverall great budget accomodation amp nice location  A great base for exploring what NYC has to offer 
P => Love Chelsea good value hotel As we had read the reviews on tripadvisor before we booked the Chelase Lodge was what we expected  The room was very small not much room to move at all  However the room was very clean and interestingly orated  The toilets were in the hall  a floor and they were always clean and free we never had to wait for one  The room had air conditioning which was essential in New York in summer  Be aware that there are no lifts so you have to carry your luggage up the stairs  We loved the location Chelsea is so much fun Great restaurants nearby and not touristy at all seemed to be quite residential area which made the area all the more interesting  The subway is a short walk from the hotel  Given how much a hotel room can cost in New York we thought the Chelsea Lodge was great value and we would definitely stay there again  
P => Great place for the price  Me and my girlfriend stayed went up to New York to stay for a weekend of New York sight seeing and I searched for a nice hotel under   night because wed be gone most of the day anyway For the price chelsea lodge is really a great hotel   after reading the reviews I thought the rooms would be so small that we could barley even walk in the doors   but it wasnt bad at all  The beds were very comfy amp the room was big enough to get ready and head out to hit the town The shower was a little small though but it worked ok The toilet down the hall was no hassle at all   we never had to wait or had any issues with cleanliness   actually all the hotel made a very clean amp nice impression We got fresh towels every day and could store our bags the day of our check out while we still did some shopping downtown Great place great price would go back there anytime 
P => Good for a single person This is a great hotel for a single person in New York where hotel prices can be very expensive  However I think it would be a bit cramped for a couple  The shower and wash basin are in the room and the WC is located down the corridor  The hotel is clean and has both AC and a fan and is furnished with arts and craft furniture  Location is quiet but you need to take the subway to get to the action in New York however it is an easy walk to Greenwich village I found a great restaurant close by called Cookshop on th street on the corner of th avenue Great price for a single person in a quiet area 
P => Clean good value and location We wanted to go to New York for seven days but couldnt believe the high price of hotels  We found the Chelsea lodge on trip advisor though and couldnt believe the low price great value The hotel is easy to find and in a good central location within walking distance to most attractions The staff are friendly and helpful but are not in your face which is just what we like  Room was no penthouse but in New York you dont spend much time in your hotel  Bed was comfy and very clean fresh towels and a spruce up every day  Sink and shower in room very clean loads of hot water and good water pressure  T V and drawers also The toilet was across the hall very clean and was always free  I was a bit worried about it being erate but it turned out not to be a problem  Neighbourhood safe and we were not worried about walking aroud at night  Places for breakfast nearby and for dinner check out the Dallas BBQ on rd and th great chicken and ribs Dont order starters   portions massive Tips We went to emipre state at  am no queues In Macys their souvenirs are in the basement all in one place I only found this out on the last day and had been running around the huge store all week Go to Canal Street for cheap souvineers and watch out for the carriage ride in Central Park   not worth the money 
P => love this place its perfect I booked the lodge for a friend and I after looking through a lot of places checking out prices and reviews on this website  Chelsea Lodge had such good reviews and reasonable prices that we went for it  I was a bit nervous about the shower being in the room and the toilet down the hall but it was absolutely fine  We had a nice method worked out where we read a magazine or watched the tv whilst the other came out of the shower there were  toilets on our floor and we never had to wait for one  Everything was wonderfully clean and the bed was very comfy  Our window looked out of the back of the property onto the little garden and the gardens that adjoined it  The room is bedroom sized big enough to sleep in and have our suitcases open and shopping everywhere  A chair to sit on and a little space for hanging things  also we had what looked like an old writing desk with drawers which we could use to put our clothes in and that the tv was stood on  There was a very quaint feel to the building you could almost forget you were in New York when you were inside  We had a desk in our room that was actually a sewing table with the old sewing machine underneath They will store your luggage for you whilst you spend your last few hours in the city and even bring it outside for you when you get back late and the taxi is there waiting for you ahem This was my third trip to new york and ive been lucky each time with my accommodation but this was definitely my favourite  It was on a very quiet street but you only had to walk a few metres to be on th Ave with shops and plenty of places for breakfast lunch and dinner  Tube stops were very near and it was greatly located to go up the city or down  im always going to recommend this place to anyone going there and Id certainly stay there next time i go  
P => Wouldnt stay anywhere else Just got back from a wonderful  day trip to NYC and had such a greatl experience staying at the Chelsea Lodge  We went fully aware that the rooms were small and yes they were but spotless and charming  It is called a LODGE   and thats exactly what it felt like Staff was very nice and welcoming Shared toilets are not a problem at all  Great air conditioning   and we needed it as it was very hot  Located on a very safe street in Chelsea   steps away from many restaurants and cafes  For great morning coffee and pastries try La Bergamote on th Ave at th The Lasagna Ristorante on th is very good as well  Staying at the Chelsea Lodge makes u feel as if you are living there and not just a visitor to a typical sterile hotel room  If you are expecting a  star luxury hotel with all ammenities then you will probably be disappointed with the Chelsea Lodge    but for those who want an affordablesafe clean accomodation with lots of character right in the middle of everything   u cannot beat this place  Could go on for days about how pleased we were  Such a great find    we will DEFINITELY be back  
P => The Chelsea Lodge was a great find My husband and I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for  nights while we were in town to see a concert at Madison Square Garden Pearl Jam  I booked the hotel for  reasons the price and the location  The price was excellent considering the location     Okay so the hotel is not in Times Square but it is in a very nice clean amp fairly quiet neighborhood It only took us minutes to walk to MSG and we also walked to Times Square from the lodge  We felt safe the entire time and our room was very quiet  We had expected the shared toilet so that was not an issue   and I must say that the bathrooms were kept very clean at least on the third floor  The hike up the steps to the room was the only drawback   though it was only  floors up unfortunately our legs were not used to the steep steps The staff were pleasant and the overall feeling of the lodge was quaint  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Great base to explore the city We have just returned from a week staying in one of the ground floor apartments  We found the studio apartment spacious and well equipped with its small kitchenette The location is superb the lodge is in an attractive quiet street which feels very safe which was very relaxing after a busy day out  We found all the staff very helpful and appreciated having the wireless internet  
P => Okay for the money The hotel has an excellent location  I felt extremely safe and the subway red and blue lines is only about a  block walk away  The quotlodgequot itself could use some work  The bed was extremely hard  After a long daynight of walking the last thing you want is a hard bed  There was also a dingy smell to the place but it was tolerable  We stayed on the first floor with a shared toilet  It was rarely otherwise occupied so that really wasnt an issue  The shower and sink worked well in the room  It got pretty warm outside one of the days we were there and so fairly warm in the room  I turned on the ceiling fan and was sprinkled with dust bunnies which was kinda gross  There was not much closet space and only about  hangers so bring some extra if you plan on hanging up your clothes  The desk and dresser drawers were not the most appealing places to store your clothes so we opted for keeping everything in our suitcases  There was a flat screen in the room but some channels didnt come in very well  However we rarley watched tv so this wasnt really a big issue  The walls are thin so you can hear whenever someone else talks  The only reasons this place is quotabove averagequot are bc it is cheap for NYC and has a safe conveinent location  If you are used to chain hotels this place  take a little getting used to but it was worth the  we saved to stay here  
P => Couldnt have stayed anywhere better After reading the excellent reviews we chose the Chelsea Lodge for our stay in New York in il  we had to book in ember though as there was great demandFrom a getting about NYC point of view it was a great base only  mins walk from both the red and blue subway lines make sure you get a  day pass for  bargainAlso you can easily walk up towards Madison sqaureEmpire etc no bother     plus you get to see some sights on the way The Lodge itself is in the village of Chelsea which as we found is a residential area  But this is one of its great points  You walk out into the neighbourhood and its all locals its great not a tourist in sight well apart from you Eating in Chelsea is superb too  We had originally intended to goto chinatown little italy etc for our evening meals but having sampled a few of the eateries in Chelsea we thought why bother sitting on the subway when theres great places on your doorstep We can heartily recommend the Dish for breakfast and the Italianpasta place on the corner name escapes me for evening meals and drinks  Both ppovide great food and service and are cheap too  No rip off tourist prices here Although we did indulge ourselves for a meal at the Rainbow Room Grill one night which is on the th floor of the Rockerfellar Centre overlooking the Empire State Building  Google it for yourselves brilliant place but expensiveThe hotel itself was spotless clean no complaints  We were downstairs in the basement in one of the deluxe rooms which had its own private bathroomtoilet and shower  All of which were great with towels changed everyday  It was quite a hot week when we were there so the ceiling fan was on x but it was silent and did a great job and could be kept on through the night  Theres cabled TV in room also All  staff that we had dealings with in the lodge were helpful  I can see why some people might find the older chap a little dour and unhelpful but thats just his persona he was very helpful with us allowing us to use the internet terminal to prebook our seats etc for the journey home and let us print out our boarding cards and leave our cases in the recpeption room on the day we checked out We have no reservatitions in recommending the Chelsea Lodge to anyone  Okay its not the ritz but it is a cheap and cheerful hotel in the heart of the Chelsea District Dont bother with a Tourist Trap Hotel get yourself in the Chelsea Lodge you wont regret it  
P => Chelsea Suites Rock Arrived in the morning to drop off our luggage and proceeded to JFK to return our car Took the LIRR back to Penn Station twenty minutes and   for two on the weekends and walked down th ave to the Hotel in  minutes James the manger on dutygreat guy willing to offer loads of information and very kind had already taken our luggage and put it in our suite He showed us everything we needed to know about our suite and was very helpful with information about the neighborhood The subway is a  minute walk and the neighborhood is in a fantastic location There are great restaurants all over the place and two kets within a  minute walk  There is also a Whole Foods within a ten minute walk The Chelsea ketwhere Emeril films his show is a ten minute walk away and a must visit to explore all the gourmet foods and baked goods Great for coffee in the morning The Chelsea Pier sports complex is also ten minutes away Check out their web page for all the activities there For   a night you will not find a suite with its own garden huge in a great neighborhood anywhere else in Manhattan Staying there was like having your own apartment in a Manhattan Brownstone on a beautiful tree lined street where you are perfectly safe walking late at night The rooms in the hotel are   a night They are small but the hotel and the suitesabout five doors down from the hotel are impeccably clean The suites are huge and ours had a beautiful white ble bathroom that looked like it belonged in the Trump Towers where the rooms are probably smaller and start at  amp a night  I could rave about this hotel all night long but I probably said too much already and they they will raise their prices  From now on this is the only hotel my wife and I will stay in when we visit N Y  City  
P => Woke up it was a Chelsea morning and the first thing that we heard Birdsong We travelled as a family group of seven and booked two suites   one parlour and one garden  The hotel arranged for these to be on the same level which was really useful  Each room had a queen size bed a sofa bed chest of drawers TV with cable chairs and coffee table  The parlour suite faced the street and was very hot it had a small shower room closets and a kitchenette  The garden suite had no closets a large shower room and a smaller kitchenette The staff were very helpful accepting delivery of some books we had ordered from US bookstores and even returning two face cloths which had been taken with the laundry by mistake Both were comfortable to sleep in convenient for subways local shopping and restaurants The Empire Diner is two blocks west and two blocks north Our teenage children felt confident enough to go around by themselves and we felt comfortable to allow them to Would we come back   definately 
P => Good find It is definitely worth staying at the Chelsea Lodge for the price the location the local amenities the cleanliness of the rooms and facilitiesI went expecting it to be like a nice hostel i e  clean basic rooms with no breakfast and some shared facilities and while this wasnt inaccurate the little touches fresh towels daily new TV complimentary toiletries etc  reinforced its status as a guest house  It would have been even better if there had been a kettle in the room but I understand that this is probably too much to ask of this kind of accomodation TIPS We also had problems with morning  am noise from the radiator in our room G  However as other people have mentioned it is really warm in the rooms anyway so we just asked the guy at reception to turn it off for us you cant do it yourself as it involves unscrewing a cover   job doneI would also recommend requesting a room on the nd floor not sure about the rd or the basement but these might be ok too as I wouldnt fancy staying on the ground floor because of the lobby  
P => simply the best value in NYC If you want a clean friendly helpful no nonsense place to crash after a hard days sightseeing in NYC then dont hesitate to book here  Small rooms shower TV clean bed  Watch out for upstairs rooms though  ridiculously noisy pipes although this was our only moan Situated in a pleasant tree lined avenue in Midtown Manhattan you are a short walk from the Empire State and Times Square but far enough away to avoid the traffic noise Mike and the guys were helpful in arranging transport sorting out checkin until after wed slept   we arrived at am   and of course pointed out a great diner for breakfast  Luggage can be left with them if you have a late flight after checkout  The entrance hall is covered in awards including Tripadvisors so book with confidence  
P => Could be better     Stayed in a basement garden suite for  nights  Wonderful location very convenient for Subway Chelsea Art Galleries Meatpacking District West Village  Room was spacious by NYC standards amp also very quiet except for foot traffic noise from room above Kitchenette was poorly stocked had to boil water in the microwave  Overall or slightly tatty and in need of updating  Also only superficially clean dont look too closely at fixtures amp fittings or under the bed Garden is no more than a neglected patch of scrub These issues were outweighed by the excellent location in a vibrant neighborhood  Pros location location location  Cons in need of refurb neglected garden no kettle in kitchen poor cleaning  
P => A great base from which to expore We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge last week  for four nights and really loved our time there  The rooms are basic and rather small but they have everything you need and are perfect especially if you dont really intend to spend much of your time there as we didnt  The rooms were checked daily and beds were made and clean towels left  The guys on reception were helpful but let you get on with your stay too and I felt safe and secure there   We also liked Chelsea which is a great place to kickstart your trip from as there are lots of shops and bars and cafes nearby as well as the subway which links you to uptown and downtown areas really quickly I would definitely reccomend this to a friend  
P => Lovley  Rooms are small and compact containing a shower sink double bed and desk  Free WiFi  Dont let the shared toilet put you off  The cleanliness was excellent and the or was lovely  The room we stayed in for  nights was on the back of the building which was very quiet  We found the location of Chelsea lodge to be great and it is a  minute walk away from the nearest tube stop  My partner and I have stayed in a few budget accomodations in NYC and this was by far the best  I will definately stay here again  I am surprised that it only ranks   
P => Pretty good but some cons My room was probably one of the worst in the building facing the street on one end and the lobby on the other end  So there was quite some noise from both the street luckily W th Str is a pretty quiet street and the other guest entering the buildinglobby  There was also some kind of waterpipe running through my room and everytime someone was using the shower it could hear the water going up pretty loud  But despite all the noise I wasnt kept awake all night because I was pretty tired from walking around all day long The room itself though was very cute  Yes very small but the space available was used very effectively  It was very clean as well  There was even a small flatscreen TV but the channels on offer were very basic Had some mixed feelings about the staff  Cleaning staff was very friendly but there was one guy behind the desk who was looking at me like I was some kind of stranger entering his building  Weird guy The location was pretty good its just a short walk to the th Street subway stop  And plenty of places to get a good breakfast Overall I was pretty happy with my stay  There is room for improvement but I feel they offer good value for the money  
P => Home from Home I stayed at the Chelsea lodge in ch of this year and had an amazing time I arrived during a massive rain shower and was dripping wet and the staff could not be more helpful and do more for me  My room was on the nd floor and was perfect and very homely  This whole place feels homely and as it is on a quiet st you actually feel like you are living like a new yorker  I had a room that over looked the back yard and woke up every morning to the sound of birds tweeting which i loved as that would be a rarity at any other hotel  The staff were always very friendly and talkative asking how my previous day had been and what my plans for the current day was  Even the cleaning staff were really nice and friendly and your room and towels are cleaned everyday There is a great cafe just round the corner on th between th and st called Dish which i went to every morning for breakfast as the food and staff were amazin  This just completed the feeling of being a new yorker as you got to know the staff like a local would I was there for  nights in total and my only complaint is that my stay wasnt longer but hey thats my own fault  I am going to return to NYC next year and would not even think about booking another hotel as i will stay here whenever i return now Dont delay   book up today and then concentrate on what do to on your trip without worring about what your hotel will be like as if you book here i gaurentee you wont be disapointed  
P => Nearly Perfect But Stayed in the Chelsea Lodge for  nights and it was extremely close to being the perfect stay From reading the previous reviews we knew what to expect in terms of room size toilets sharing etc but these were not an issue Rooms The rooms although small were extremely clean and really had everything one could need  Had no problems at all and I am  Toilets The toilet sharing was not an issue  Never had to wait and again the toilets were spotless  There were  on each floor so more than enough to go round Location The location of the Lodge is probably the real selling point  We had been to New York twice previously but only on this occasion did we feel we were actually living like a New Yorker  It was a fantastic area  Safe buzzing with loads of restaurants and bars  Really was fantastic and we ended up coming back to the area on a couple of the nights Staff Helpful without going to win any awards for friendliness  Small talk was definitely not the order of the day but they are there  hours so no issue NOISE This was where the Lodge lost out on the final stars  There is noise from the street but its New York and busy and we had no issue with that  You can hear other guests but again its relatively minimum and doesn t go on for long  The noise issue we had was with the heater in our room  We were in G and every morning at  am the heating kicked in and the radiator began to hiss and steam at ridiculous noise level  This went on for  hours each morning  We didnt make a deal of it as we were getting up early and the price is good but it was extremely irritating All in all I would recommend the lodge as it is great value in an amazing location and very clean  Go prepared in terms of the room size and possible noise and you wont have a problem  
P => Perfect for a Budget Friendly Girl get away Great location Perfect if you dont want to spend a lot of money  The rooms are small but you should already know that going in  Try and ask for an A or B room  They seem to be a little bigger than the C rooms  Really close to the subway stations  Very safe and clean  The shared toilet is great   very clean and not a bother at all  For food hit up Murrays Bagels right around the corner on th Ave  Great brkfast before a big day  Also Empire Diner on th Avend   great french toast 
P => Will definately be back I stayed at the Chelse Lodge for a week over the New Year period and absolutely loved it  As a single female alone in New York I felt more like I was staying in the spare room of a friends house rather than a hotel  My room H was really quaint and nicely orated the bed was one of the most comfortable that I have slept in anywhere and my room was cleaned and fresh towels replaced daily  James Mike and Jose who worked behind the desk couldnt have been friendlier and really made you feel at home  I was also happy with the neighbourhood there were enough restuarants  superkets to choose from the immediate area as well as  Starbucks  For breakfast   Galaxy Diner on the cnr of th Ave and th street is a must  For burgers   Better Burger cnr th Ave and th Street is also a must the karma ketchup is devine  I used the subway on the cnr of th Ave and rd street everyday and never had a problem  I am planning another trip to New York in  and will definately be staying at the Chelsea Lodge again  
P => great hotel The better place in the better city  And great prices for all you have in the hotel  Im sure I will be back soon  
P => Great Value Fantastic Location and Clean Yes the rooms are small the stairs are steep and the toilets are down the hall but if you stay at the Chelsea Lodge youre in a great neighbourhood youre not paying an arm and a leg and youre minutes from a subway stop  The place is charming central clean and great value  What more do you want in New YorkTip For great coffee turn right as you exit the hotel cross over th and walk half a block and youll find Cafe Grumpy  A quick coffee and muffinpastry and youre good to go for the day  
P => We stayed in one of the suites   live like a new yorker We stayed in one of the garden suites just a few houses down from the main building over the new year for ten nights and we can highly recommend themThe bathroom was big and clean  The kitchenette was very useful   we couldnt eat out  times a day with american size portions so we had breakfast captain crunch ofcourse before heading out in the morning The bed was big and comfy and the room was large something that is not often found in New York apparently  We had fresh towels daily and the room was cleaned late morning every day As for location it is perfect Chelsea felt really safe and had a number of restaurants which were miles better quality than those near Times square and other tourist areas also eat out in Grenwich village It is a couple of blocks from the subway stations which can then take you everywhere and then when you come back to your suite on the quiet tree lined street its just perfect As we were going for  nights we didnt want to be in the centre of it all as we thought it would get a bit much   and there are sooooo many tourists but here we got away from it all at the same time as being only a subway ride away from anywhere in New YorkI recommend the chelsea lodge suites to all and would stay there again It is a fantastic place with my only complaint being that the heating was a little noisy at night which would occasionally wake you but it was lovely and warm even though flippin freezing outsideMY TIPSWhen arriving from the airport GET A YELLOW CAB It is the law in NY for the journey from the airport to manhattan to be  its about  with tolls and tip  The queue looked massive but we zoomed through it  We saw loads of people getting ripped off as they left the airport being approached by private drivers saying the queue would take an hour and a yellow cab would cost them  dollars   we can do it cheaper dont listen its not true get a yellow cabIf you need a superket come out of the chelsae lodge turn right go to the end of the block take a left go down two blocks and on the corner is the cheapest superket we found near the chelse lodge if you want semi skimmed milk its   fat milkUse the unlimited subway pass you will save a fortuneThere are no safes in the room but we had padlocks on our suitcases and used them to lock up our valuables insteadEnjoy the chelsea lodge suites and the rest of New York you will have an amazing time 
P => A delightful litte hotel in a great location If you come t o NYC and want a place to stay that wont break the bank you cant beat the Chelsea Lodge  Yes the rooms are small but they are cute as a button immaculately clean and even have their own sink and shower in them  The two toilets quotdown the hallquot were only ten paces away and I never had to wait for one  Someone commented about street noise but my room on the second floor faced an interior courtyard and wasnt by the stairway so I never heard a sound all night  The staff was very friendly  they let me borrow their computer to check in for my return flight and print my boarding pass  The room size really isnt an issue  I was only there to sleep at night and since the hotel is only three blocks away from the subway getting around NYC couldnt be easier And as you get to the corner of the block you are treated to a great view of the Empire State Building  be sure to see it at night since its lit up in colored lights  The side street they are on is quiet and the neighborhood feels safe even when walking by myself after midnight So the bottom line is if you dont mind the small rooms you cant do better even if paying much more for somewhere else than staying at the Chelsea lodge  The price cleanliness and location make it unbeatable 
P => Finally   a charming hotel in NYC without breaking the bank My husband and I were doing a tour of the East Coast with NYC being one of our stops in the middle of our trip  We stayed in Manhattan for  nights and I feel so fortunate to have gotten reservations several months prior at the Chelsea Lodge because it helped make our stay wonderful Yes the rooms are small BUT in a charming cozy way  The whole ambience of the room just makes you feel like youre staying in a family members guest room not a unfamiliar hotel  The bed was surprisingly comfortable and I felt at home snuggling up in it each night  Also the location of the Lodge was awesome  its on such a cute street in the Chelsea district and a Whole Foods is only a  minute walk away this is what we did every morning for breakfast  Also the subway is also no more than   minutes walking distance  If you havent guessed it already STAY HERE if you can for what it is the price is unbeatable so book early We will definitely stay here again 
P => Disappointed with this hotel Spent five nights at the Chelsea Lodge with our son dhter and son in law  we stayed in the garden suite which is in a arate building with our sonso we had an ensuite   which was tiny and a kitchenette  Our dhter and son in law were in the main building and their room was tinyRoom was clean however the whole place is well past being ready for a refurbishment Three very large windows so room was bright however two had white venetian blinds and the third cream curtains so take an eye mask to help you sleep  
P => Fun to socialize no chance to sleep The location is great the rooms are clean and quite special and a shower in the room is indeed a luxury in NYC for this price  BUT dont expect to be able to sleep in your queen bed if you dont use good earplugs  The holes between the doors and floors make up to cm   it is a noble old house indeed and nothing was done even for the cheapest soundproof  So youll definitely enjoy the location and the looks inside   but to enjoy hearing every room and the reception at the same time from ones bed must be deaf mans dream  
P => Such an incredible bargain   a brilliant find We were SO impressed with this place I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget place to stay in NYC   it was an incredible bargain at   night and far nicer than the hotel room my brother had paid twice as much for just a couple of blocks away Our room one of two deluxe rooms in the basement was bigger than many in the building in fact plenty of room for our three suitcases and lots of shopping and had a full ensuite including toilet   definitely worth the extra   night to my mind  I did take a peek at one of the standard rooms too   it was compact but perfectly adequate and had a sink and shower but no toilet   the high ceilings made it feel less claustrophobic  I imagine that the standard rooms in the ground floor hallway could be noisy though with people coming and going Obviously Chelsea Lodge did not have the facilities of a  proper  hotel   once you had checked in you were pretty much left alone to get on with it   but there was someone on the desk all day and all evening if you needed help or advice and they were friendly in a quiet sort of way  The room was spotless the d cor very quirky and fun the shower powerful hot water plentiful clean towels were provided every day and while the bed was only a standard double in size it was perfectly fine The location is fabulous   very convenient for both midtown and downtown and in a nice and quiet street in a safe area with good local facilities including several nice places for breakfast The only negative was that it was very hot in the room   though there was a ceiling fan and AC in summer   and once we found we could open the window we felt perfectly safe doing this as it was barred and netted we were fine Dont hesitate to book a stay at this place   its just as good as the reviews suggest  Thank you to Chelsea Lodge for a great stay and to tripadvisor for helping me find it 
P => Loved it After iding we didnt want to pay NYC prices for a mediocre hotel room we thought that we would look for something a little different and found Chelsea Lodge  From reading the reviews on Tripadvisor we ided to book and we werent disappointed  Yes the room was quite small you have everything you need a place to hang clothes set of drawers tv etc but it was perfect for what we wanted as we never spend much time in the hotel anyway  We had a shower which was lovely and hot and powerful and basin the toilet was just outside our door and we never had to wait once  One of the best things about this hotel is how clean it is I would much prefer to have a slightly smaller room and stay somewhere that I can only describe as spotless The location is fab there are some good bars restaurants and shops nearby try The Dish for breakfast and Billys bakery for a wonderful New York cheesecake and cup cakes  Also the subway is nearby which we used quite regularly to get to places as we had been to NY before and knew what we wanted to see and also my husband was running the athon so had to save his legs All in all Chelsea Lodge was a fab little find that I would most definitely stop there again  
P => Stayed at the suites and it was super We booked our stay purely based on the reviews from Tripadvisor and it wasnt a disappointment  Originally had a room booked at the Chelsea Lodge but then found a link to their apartment suites on their main website We stayed for  nights at the end of   start of  and it was a great base for our first time in New York  The suites are just down the street from the main lodge on  West th Street  They were very spacious especially for a longer break as they have a private bathroom and kitchenette  For an extra  a night its well worth it  Fairly peaceful as there are only four suites within the apartment  We had a garden suite so we had access to a shared garden although it was far too cold to spend any time in it  Would be great during spring  summer Bed was really comfy after a long day of sightseeing and the room was warm although we had to bring out the extra heater when there was a cold snap minus   Rooms were cleaned every day and lots of clean towels left  I kept flooding the bathroom after having a shower so they came in handy Our suite was kitted out with a hairdryer iron oven and fridge  Loads of cupboards to hang and put away things Location was perfect as there are three subways spread across rd Street which connected you to the main sights  Lots of restaurants takeaways and kets closeby so youll never struggle to find food I would definitely stay here again as it was great value for money  I felt very safe and it was peaceful yet central  
P => what a delight I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge in t   and I thought it was very very cute  I really enjoyed my stay there  It was a safe neighborhood and CLEAN The best part was that it was only like a hundred bux a night The room had a shower and sink in it and bed tv desk etc  all you need for your stay  Plus there was wireless internet   for free   which is a total blessing  Toilets were shared but clean and I never had to wait once  I think there were two toilets to share per  rooms or something  It was also very quiet  The room was pretty small but it was fine for me  Definately fits a couple of people    would be okay if you like to be in close quarters and it sure as hell beats a hostel  Probably a good place for couples to stay but its a place for everyone  I am a  year old gal that was traveling alone and I felt really comfortable here  The man at the desk helped me with my bag even though he didnt have to  There are a few bars around walking distance and lots of restaurants and stores I met some kids from the art school on the corner of the street  Good times   and not too far from a metro stop   i think be like  or  blocks   aka  mins walking in NY I am going to post some pictures  Hope this helps 
P => Highly recommended for the price Great location th St in Chelsea comfortable bedding linens  Smaller than usual even for NYC but nonetheless one of the biggest bargains in accommodations in the city  The place is quiet surprising for a townhouse the people who work there were quirky and nice and the room was cleaned during our short breakfast run  
P => Excellent We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for  nights from the st ember  The place is great  Not very easy to find but great when you get there  The rooms are not too small and lets face it you dont spend much time in them when your in New York  The place is spotless and having showers in the rooms is good  The bathrooms are also always clean and i think i had to wait once or twice in the  nights we were there to use one  One slight downsode was that it was pretty boiling in our room at night which was a nice change from the sub zero temperatures outside it was a little much at times  All in all i would highly recommend this hotel and the area of Chelsea which is a bustling part of the city and always felt very safe  We would return without hesitation  
P => great location great place and a bargain We my boyfirend and i stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for  nights at the start of ember i really enjoyed the stay and wouldnt hesitate to stay there again  Ill give a few pros and cons to help you make up your own mind but as other reviewers have said   you should be expecting a budget guest house with all its charms and quirks and not a bland but perfect   hotel so dont be dissapointed by shared bathrooms and lack of roomservice doormen etc pros  The price   it cost us approx   per room per night   great value  The location great area of chelsea   lots of places to eat and drink nearby on a very quiet sidestreet but just off a main avenue so the best of both worlds we always felt very safe even at night  Also being at the bottom end of chelsea you could stroll into the west village in   mins   The lodge itself was very charming it had none of the blandness that comes with a hotel chain the or though you  not choose it for your own home was quirky cozy and homely and always felt like a warm place to come back to at the end of each day  It felt much more like you had your own studio in new york and felt like we lived there for  days rather then the usual obvious tourist feeling you get staying in a hotel   the convenience   we checked in after pm on our night of arrival and they held our bags for us on our final day until the evening neither were a problem and the staff were always approachable  A few have commented on the manner of the guy at the front desk though i always found him to be perfectly nice and happy to help   he just didnt have that sickeningly nice permanant grin that some  expect cons  the hotel is in a townhouse with steps up to the front door and there are  floors with no lifts so be aware if you would have access problems   its frequently mentioned how small the rooms are and they are probably the same size as a standard double bedroom   they were plenty big enough for us and we didnt have a problem with the size at all but some  prefer more floor and wadrobe hanging space   the in room showers although convenient do leave the room a little overly steamy and muggy but its not a huge issue   just open the windows and voila its sorted   even though it was freezing outside the room got stiflingly hot sometimes and there was no way to turn it down though again this was solved very easily by just opening the window though you  not want to do this on the lower floor facing the street  we had a room that was quiet as a mouse   on the top floor facing the yard and nowhere near the toilet  though i imagine that the rooms on the ground floor just feet infront of the reception desk and lobby must be extremely noisy as would the rooms next to the toilets as the walls are very thin as mentioned before  i think it would be a case of pot luck as to whether you got a loud or quiet room but ours was perfect room awell hope this helps anyway overall a superb stay  
P => Recommended Fantastic location   ideal for great neighbourhoods  Staff very friendly and helpful  Rooms small but very clean  Recommended  
P => Great stay at Chelsea Lodge suite My  friends and I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for  nights at the end of ember and we really enjoyed our stay here  We paid approx  per night which was the best deal we could find at this very popular time of year  though there was a   discount when we paid in cash on arrival As said in previous reviews the suite felt like having our own apartment in new york  It was clean and spacious  we had a queen bed and a double sofa bed  The kitchen was fully equipped   no microwave but a cooker  The bathroom was clean with hairdryer and towels were changed every day  The only complaint we had was that the room was very warm  once we opened the window this was better  It was on a quiet street so we all slept soundly We ate breakfast at the Dish every day  had good breakfast specials there for less that  each  We also had a very nice chinese takeout from the place a few doors down from the Dish  I felt safe walking around the area and the subway was very close  Overall it was a great place to say and I would certainly go back  
P => Simple satisfactory and straightforward  Staying at the Chelsea Lodge was definately a quotwhat you see is what you get experiencequot  Rooms were clean and tidy  You pay your money at the front desk when you check in then youre given the key to your room and the front door and you get on with it Rooms were tidied and towels changed everyday other than that theres no interaction with the staff unless you need to ask the guys at the front desk something they dont speak otherwise Toilets are shared which I didnt find to be a problem at all but it was a bit annoying during the middle of the night having to get dressed and leave the room for the loo Also if you are a light sleeper I would recommend that you ask for a room on the first or second floor as we had one on the ground floor right next to the stairs and it could get quiet noisy at times and we could hear all the conversations had in the lobby  I imagine this to be the same for the rooms near the toilet as well The location of the Chelsea Lodge cant be faulted very near to most things or else just a short subway ride away It felt more to us like we had rented a room in an apartment block for a week and it worked perfectly well for us If youre used to your luxuries or expect your stay in the Chelsea Lodge to make your trip to New York all that more fabulous then this is the wrong place for you but if youre looking for somewhere safe cheap clean and tidy to lay your head after a tiring day out and about then youre on the right track You literally get what you pay for here  I would consider staying here again but my other half I think prefers his own toilet 
P => Great affordable place to stay I stayed for two nights last weekend and had a perfectly enjoybale stay  I knew not to expect the Ritz I did get a clean comfy bed a shower and sink with plenty of hot water and good water pressure and a nice flat screen TV with cable  I was on my own and was out most of the time exploring NYC but I had a very nice room to come home to  The room was quiet and the lock on the door was very sturdy  I felt very safe and will stay here again when I comeback to NYC especially if I am traveling solo  
P => Great location and comfortable for the price Lets face it New York is an expensive place to stay in Whether it be accommodation sightseeing food or transportation it is going to cost you more than other cities around the world So we relied upon TripAdvisor to assist us in finding somewhere of good value  We had heard lots of stories from our friends of NYC hotels where you paid an arm and a leg for an absolute dive complete with bed bugs We stayed in one of the Chelsea Lodge Suites which are located in a arate building about  doors down from the actual Chelsea Lodge which is at  W th Street in Chelsea  The difference is that the suites have a basic kitchenette which allowed us to prepare our own breakfast  No teacoffee provided though but like most of New York there is a Starbucks on the corner about a  minute walk away  Our particular room had its own private garden as well  The room was very quiet safe clean and tidy  Bathroom was a bit small like nowhere it sit your toiletries apart from the top of the toilet sistern but we coped Location wise the Chelsea Lodge is in a good position  It is only a short walk to the blue subway line which takes you either directly to nd Street or downtown to Battery ParkManhattan stations  Chelsea has a large gay community and there are lots of great restaurants and shops located within easy walking distance of the Lodge  Greenwich Village is also close by  
P => Very clean great staff Chelsea lodge is a very clean centrally located place to stay  I stayed in one of the studio apartments down the street from the main building  The main building is very nice though  The rooms in the main building have shared bathrooms but they are very clean and nice  The studio can accommodates  people and has a very clean bathroom  I am staying there again next month Great bargain  One of the best places I have stayed in the city  
P => Great little jewel A great little place in a great location   Hotel is located in a lovely part of Chelsea when you stay at the lodge you can walk to pretty much everywhere well not exactly but you get my drift  The street is nice and leafy safe at day and night some great bars delis and restaurants around within walking distance  I def recommend the Thai place on the corner of th where the lodge is and th ave on the left hand side  Even if you have to wait for a table its worth itYes the rooms are small and youre stuffed if youre on the rd floor like us carrying suitcases all the way up  But really does it matter We wanted a clean place in a nice location a good shower and a nights sleep    Its NYC after all so many better things to do than stay in your room    I was a bit apprehensive about the whole quotshared toiletsquot issue being a neat freak that I am however the toilets were very clean  I tell you cleaner than what Ive seen at some peoples houses  Even though really small the rooms were very clean  We are both over ft and sometimes it was hilarious how tiny the room was for us and the bed was a bit short too But what this place doesn t have in size it has in its charm and fantastic location Some have complained about the noise we had no problems  Yes there is a school across the street and kids can be somewhat noisy in the morning however that did not trouble us  Same with traffic    I mean its New York if you wanted a tranquil place to rest up go to Maldives Yes the guy at the front desk during the day could have been a bit nicer but he answered our questions and helped with our suitcases   Overall Chelsea Lodge is a great little place and I will wholeheartedly recommend it to all my friends  It just depends what you are after  If you want a large room king size bed and room service this is not the place for you  But remember you will also pay a lot more that what you re paying here  If you want a cute little place small but clean room in a fantastic location as your base for exploring Manhattan go for it   Oh and did I say it was not that expensive either    
P => Nice  My wife and I stayed at the chelsea lodge for  nights  We stayed in the basement suite night that had its own bathroom  The room itself was perfectly fine plenty of room bathroom was nice   we enjoyed it thoroughly A couple of issues  the bed   this was the biggest issue for me although not a vacation killer  the bed is a double not a queen which is fine but it sags    fairly badly  So in other words you and your significant other roll into the middle which is fantastic unless your trying to sleep    Solution put a pillow in the middle   it gives support and prevents you from rolling into the middle   noise   Im not extremely sensitive to noise but a couple of nights there were young groups of people walking down the sidewalk who werent extremely noisy but I could hear them fairly easily because there is very little sound proofing from the window airconditioner being in the window  Solution crank up the fan on the air conditioner for white noise or wear ear plugs There is a grocery store a lot of restaurants a few ATMs and two subway stations right near by   fantastic location I mentioned the two issues I came across in staying here but they wouldnt deter me from coming back  
P => Perfect I just returned from a  night stay at the Chelsea Lodge and it was great The room was cute cozy and very clean  I was unsure about the shared toilet situation but it was fine  The toilet was always incredibly clean and I only had to wait for the restroom once during my stay  I was told I could use the toilets on the second floor if I needed to but I didnt want to run around in my pajamas so I waited  The Chelsea lodge is in a great neighborhood on a quiet tree lined street  My room was on the first floor and I never heard any city noise  I came home late each night I was there and always felt safe  Thats a great feeling when you are a girl traveling alone  Also very close to the subway and lots of great restaurants in the area  For anyone with a sweet tooth I recommend Billys Bakery My only complaint was other people staying there  There was quite a bit of noise with people stomping up and down the stairs  Also the lobby was right outside my door and at  am one day there was a group of people who ided to have a loud get together there and kept me awake  And the gentleman who was at the front desk during the day could have been a bit more friendly  He wasnt rude though  I will definitely stay there again and I reccommend it to everyone  
P => Great value in Chelsea We just got home from a  night stay in their Lower parlour suite which lies in the basement a few houses away from their main building  We payed  tax per night and that is excellent value for the money spent The Suite is a large room with a Queen size bed a bed sofa a small table and a large desk  The bed was ok but a little on the hard side  The TV was fine with a bundle of channels I didnt have time to look through them all The Kitchenette has all the basics toaster glasses etc  but there isnt any microwave oven which would have been nice for leftovers the portions are ridicolous in the US The bathroom was ok with a showerbooth so the entire room doesnt get covered in water The cleaning staff did excellent work we had nothing to complain about The suite lies in a nice quiet street between th and th Av  There arent a lot of trafficfor NYC but the windows are very thin so if you are a really light sleeper be you should look at a another establishment Once we got our keys from the staff we didnt have any interaction with them before we checked out  It felt like we had our own apartment in NYC a great feeling In short a perfect place for the budget minded who dont crave luxury just a nice place to stay that is close to the subways and attractions ps  There is a great diner on th Av called Galaxy diner perfect for breakfast  
P => Excellent Wonderful hotel in a central location  Very helpful and at times witty staff In comparison with other New York hotels the price is a steal  As someone who works in a luxury hotel it is clear that the few complaints about the Chelsea Lodge come from those expecting  star standards  As such it is unfair to penalise a hotel that costs just a fraction of the price for perceived shortcomings  The bathrooms in the corridor were during the whole of my stay immaculate  
P => Great little place in a convenient spot We loved this place  clean great spot close to  subway stops  The only downside is that it is really small   Im not exactly huge and I felt claustrophobic in the shower  Also the toilets are down the hall and although this got a bit annoying especially in the middle of the night there was never any wait and they were really clean Next time I would prefer to stay in Greenwich Village because it is such a cool area but Chelsea Lodge is so cheap that if you are planning a long trip in NY it is worth staying there  It is also really close to a place that serves great coffee  La Bergamote on the corner of th avenue and th street and a great bar called east of Eight on Wrd street  
P => Great find Booked Chelsea Lodge after seeing it had won a Tripadvisor Award It is a short walk from the subway either rd or th both on the number  line  The hotel is in a quiet leafy street between th and th avenue  While it is in a quiet area you are no distance away from the sights of New York   it is a great base Our room was upstairs  While it was small it was adequate  The tv was modern with many channels  The bed was very comfortable and we were very glad to have an air conditioned room  The toilets were across the hall and were always available The only draw back was the shower in the room  There was no drying area   so once you stepped out of the shower you were standing in the bedroom Overall I would recommend Chelsea Lodge to anyone wanting a cheap but very clean and charming hotel  
P => Great place to stay in NYC ona budget I stayed here with my then boyfriend in ober  for five days and we both loved it  For the price you couldnt moan about this place at all  At first I was a bit worried about the room size using a toilet outside the room but when we got to our room we were very relieved Room was on the first floor so only one flight of stairs and it was tucked in the left hand side corner either room  or  i cant remember  anyhow we overlooked the street we did hear a bit of noice at night but nothing that kept us awake  The room itself was really cute the bed was actually bigger than i first thought I thought it would be a tiny double bed but it was fine and the shower worked great there was just enough space for our luggage one case under the bed and one on the luggage rack As for the location it was perfect  The area was great the street was so pretty reminded me of Carrie Bradshaws apartment in Sex and the City so I felt like a real New Yorker staying there Went to eat at the diner across the road believe its been mentioned here before but we much prefered the Empire diner turn left out of the hotel and walk a couple of blocks and you will find it its a great s style diner breakfast is great and its v popular Have been to New York before and much prefered this location its a  minute walk to Greenwich Village and a  minute walk to the Empire State so a great place to be  Plus I loved the vibe of being in Chelsea not so mad as the touristy part of NYC Would definatly stay again if on a budget really nice guys who own it felt very safe  Oh and the toilets are so clean so that was great   
P => Excellent   lovely neighbourhood   great apartment A nice surprise  We stayed in the quotsuitesquot rather than the lodge  We had a parlour suite   the very front basement room facing the street  Its like staying in a nice apartment rather than in a hotel  Why pay hotel prices when you can have the privacy of a comfortable apartment  What a great comfortable apartment and a wonderful location  Close to shops and metro stations  The only two negatives were a nosiy neighbour how insisted on re arranging his apartment at am no fun with jet lag and the some of the or was a little dated  Wireless internet worked really well  Very happy with that All in all   a good experience   would stay again without hesitation  
P => Birdsong in New York The Chelsea Lodge a little oasis from the madness of the city streets  We stayed in a garden suite and our accomodation consisted of a small but adaquate kitchen an even smaller bathroom which was clean and had lots of towels an extremely comfortable sofa bed a large double bed coffee table and tv  The main livingbedroom was comfortable clean and spacious On our first morning we had the ultimate surprise of being awoken by birds singing rather than sirens and car horns It was a great base to get to both uptown and downtown sights and the closest subway was  blocks away rd and th which meant easy access to JFK airport  The area felt safe and away from the tourist crowds which made us feel more like New Yorkers for our stay This isnt your typical hotel but if you want to try something that feels homely but also independant then this place would be right for you  
P => Very good hotel I stayed here for a few days last week  The hotel is VERY clean and at a great location quiet street within walking distance of the West Village and about three streets away from the blue and red subway lines  The cable was a little hit and missmovies would freeze periodically I only ad access to about four channels in my room and the room is awfully small but for the price its well worth it  Each room has a private shower and a pretty ent view  There were never any other guests using the shared bathrooms when I needed to go so that was not a problem  If youre looking for a very good value in a very nice laid back NYC neighborhood you have to stay here  
P => A great find  We stayed in one of the two basement rooms with full bath for four nights  Just as we expected from past reviews the room was basic but immaculate everything we needed was there  Flat screen LCD TV worked great as did all bathroom facilities  We loved the location ate breakfast at The Dish right around the corner every morning got sandwiches at Gristedes a block away and had a fantastic chicken dinner at BBQs on rd and th one night  Two subway stations are an easy walk and the neighborhood felt very safe  We will return  
P => Loved The Chelsea Lodge My husband and I recently stayed   the Chelsea Lodge and Loved it We read about it on trip advisor and contacted them ourselves by phone  The rooms are small but very clean and quiet You have a private shower and sink in your room but you share the toilets in the hallway which are also very clean  We only used the toilets in the morning and evening since we were gone all day sightseeing so it wasnt a problem at all  The air conditioners worked great and we had maid service each morning  The staff was friendly and they allow you to use their computor to print your boarding passes which was a big relief there is free WiFi in your room Id recommend staying there to anyone I know and would definately stay there again myselfif I ever can get my husband to return to the big apple We had an awesome time and found New Yorkers to be very friendly and helpful Thank you Lori Higgins 
P => Great Place to stay  The Chelsea Lodge is as described in previous reviews  I completely recommend it for the budget conscious traveler  Having stayed  days there recently I do want to point out some things not mentioned or rarely about Chelsea Lodge in past reviews so you are an informed guest there  Keep in mind I give it an excellent rating for the category it is in  So do not take my negative points as a bad review but as facts you need to be aware of Pros  Clean Very quaintly orated  Cable TV on  inch LCD Fast Wireless connection for your laptop There is a police precinct on th St only one Block away Neighborhood is safe and quiet Our room was quiet   we could hear the birds outside our window in the mornings  also see cons Staff was friendly and helpful the couple times we spoke Cheap Near many restaurants that are good and affordable  short blocks from the C and E line  long blocks from the  line  Murray s Bagels is on  short blocks away   Best bagel I have ever eaten    discount if you pay cash Air conditioned You get Hershey Kisses on the pillows when you arriveCons Basic accommodations   no fridge in the room and no ice available  If you want a cold drink you need to buy one from the corner or do like we did and buy a folding cooler and buy ice which was a pain  No toilet in your room but it was not available be  times in  days and we had the option to use the next floors or just wait  minutes  NEVER was there a line in a  days  Our room was on the main floor which is a pro for hauling your luggage and your butt after along day out  But the Con is that there is a little lobby there with two chairs and on occasion people used the space to visit or hang out  Only feet from our room door it could be come a bit aggravating especially late at night when people came home and ided to talk and lh there  This was not a big deal but something to be aware of  It only really was an issue one night  The room s windows are screwed shut  You have to use the air conditioner or the fan mode in it to circulate the room air there is a ceiling fan too  I have no complaints as to the air conditioner itself as it kept our room cool on plus C r about F days however it did have other issues  The Air conditioner in our room any way was right over the right side of the bed  On these hot days you had to run it all night and even on the cool ones you needed to have the fan on  So you had an air conditioned draft on you all night  As well the room gets very humid with showers etc  There was no way to open a window in let out the humidity  So we had the air conditioner cranked most of the time  Cell phone reception in the building is terrible  In our room calls had to be made leaning up against the window or go outside  They give you two keys one for the front door of the building and one for the room  They are indistinguishable so you have a fiftyfifty chance of getting the right one each time you use them  It would be nice if they ked one with a dot of paint or something  They make your bed daily but do not change the bedding It is overall a great place to stay and we will return  I write all the pros and cons as nothing bugs me more than people who review a place like this comparing it to the Waldorf  If you are informed and I hope my review helps you be that way and know what to expect than you will be very pleased with the Chelsea Lodge  
P => Loved it   just like nearly everyone else I had stayed at the hilton for a conference and then changed hotels to hang around NY for an extra day  was on my own and did expect the room to be a signficant quotdrop downquot after the Hilton but it pleasantly wasnt a big adjustment  Only stayed for a night but the staff still treated me very well they were very efficient with the booking etc  Its been nicely reated and my room was small but perfect for  person fine for one night   Lots of hot water etc  It was definately a very affordable NY option for  person travelling alone  I have stayed in other guest houses in NY and this one is far superior to other experiences thus far  Will be back  
P => Great when the heat is on As with the vast majority of reviewers on this site I was more than pleased with my stay in Chelsea  The Lodge is small the only room I have ever been in smaller than my single was in Japan but spotless and comfortable  The staff were helpful and friendly  My only partial negatives are during a very hot  spell the room was a little airless and if you have never been to NYC before you  not be aware that Chelsea is rainbow friendly  If walking past gay bars and clubs freaks you out stay in another area  I was fine and would stay there again in a New York minute  
P => Thoroughly recommend If you are wanting a basic room at a budget NYC price then the Chelsea Lodge is ideal  Included is a tv with cable channels washbasin and shower cubicle   just what I needed considering I was only there to sleep relax a little and wash The toilets down the hall were always clean and available The staff were very friendly and welcoming  The area felt incredibly safe and neighbourly I could live in Chelsea permanentlyConveniently located   between Midtown and the Financial District There are plenty of shops bars and cafes to choose from and a cinema Subway conveniently close by and if you dont mind walking it really isnt that far to the Theatre District and other famous sitesThe only tiny groan I have is the room could get a little too warm during the night  
P => Great place Stayed at Chelsea Lodge for  nights and was overall very satisfied  I recommend it to everyone that want s to spend the money on something else then a hotel  Small rooms but enough if you just spend your time there for sleeping  Very clean and the shared toilet worked just fine  There were  on our floor I don t think it s possible to find a better place for this money in N Y  Chelsea is a charming neighbourhood where you can be apart of the quotrealquot N Y  Close to wonderful Greenwich Village and walking distance to alot of great areas Cons Next time I will stay there I will ask for a room not facing the street  The Windows are letting throught alot of noise and the few cars that passed in the nighttime sometimes woke me up  There is also a school at the opposite of the hotel with alot of children yelling the morning  No big deal but something I will consider til next time  
P => Great little hotel We picked up on the Chelsea Lodge from the other reviews written on this site and ided to give it a try    good choice We stayed in the ground floor suite in the annexe building just down the street from the main Chelsea Lodge Hotel  West th Street as with the other suites we had our own bathroom and shower both spotless when we arrived and well maintained during the stay  For the price you cant ask for a better location the th Street Subway station is only two blocks away  As for great restaurants where do I start Just up the road on West rd Street  th Avenue youve got the sublime Red Cat which serves up fabulous modern American food  The Rocking Horse Cafe on Eight Avenueth Street has a great Mexican menu with some super strong garitas If you cant tell we loved this hotel send us a message and well tell you more 
P => Super fantastic budget hotel in excellent location I stayed for  nights in this hotel and honestly could not have asked for more As a solo female traveller the location was perfect   situated in a quieter neighbourhood yet not too far out from the main attractions I felt completely safe walking back to the hotel alone Sure the rooms are small but you get your own basin amp shower and the shared toilets were always clean and always vacant when needed Plus the area is fantastic for cafes and restaurants and there were many to choose from    I found quite a few gems just around the corner from the hotel In NYC you would be mad to spend much time in your room so a basic clean comfortable and quiet accommodation is all I was after and the Chelsea Lodge was perfect especailly for a solo traveller  
P => Fantastic price fantastic location but they need new beds My partner and I stayed here for  nights  I read a lot of reviews before we booked so was prepared for the small rooms communal toilets etc  In fact it was a pleasant surprise when we arrived as our room was bigger than expected  Staff were really cool and helpful and the room was always spotlessly clean when we returned to the hotel each day  And of course you cant beat the location Just a couple of minor things that could easily be improved our bed was possibly the worst I have ever slept in  It dipped in the middle and as the frame was on castors the whole bed would move if youor your partner moved around in the night  It was only for the fact that we were absloutely exhausted from sightseeing that we got some sleep Also they loan hairdryers and irons which is great  But it would be even better if the irons workedBut I really liked this place so despite these minor points I would still recommend it 
P => Loation Locaton Location Having visited new york twice before webyf wanted to stay some away form Midtown and the madness This is the most unusual hotelguest house we have stayed in not at all what you would expect in manhattan It was clean cheap and perfect for us  Our room was H on the first floor and was bigger than i had expected after reading the reviews and seeing some pics  Found the staff were friendly  Chelsea is a great place to stay always felt safe lots of bars and restaurants  try la lasagna on th avecorner of th great food and a really good atmosphere  All locals think we were only tourists there you have to have one of there tinis i wouldnt hesitate in recommending chelsea Lodge to anyone visiting new york especially if you would like to get e feel for the city ands its locals  i loved it  
P => It is great please stay away Great value in NYC  Hard impossible to beat  But do I need to evaluateWhy make you crazy for this place resulting in you booking my room  The small room in the back I liked so much  Either on your own or with your partner bed is like room very small  But comfortable nice furniture and feel to it very well situated between subway Wth and Wth street great for walks around town  So my friend stay away from this place and let ME book it again  
P => Great stay overall but some caveats We stayed in the lower parlor suite in   The location is wonderful Chelsea is safe fascinating and convenient to the subway and all of the museums neighborhoods and stores that you want to visit  Staff were very helpful and accommodating we were able to leave our luggage in the office upon early arrival and for several hours after checkout until our train left Penn Station which is an easy  min  walk  Given the great restaurants in Chelsea and subwaybus access to everything else we did not use a single taxi  Chelsea Lodge is a great value and we plan to return but there are some caveats  First the buildings are across the street from a school which means that there is a great deal of noise from the students on school mornings  If you stay in a room or suite facing th street be forewarned about this and other street noise the windows are single glazed and the traffic and passerby noise will be sufficient to wake all but the most sound sleepers  Second while the kitchen and bathroom in our suite were very clean   and the bed linens and towels were also very clean with excellent maid service daily our suite had the filthiest upholstered office swivel chair that we have ever seen   so filthy that we would not use it at all  And while a swivel chair which was the only upholstered chair in the apartment makes good sense if guests need to open the futon or use the folding cot provided there really is no excuse for such a dirty piece of furniture  The other furnishings were minimal and in relatively worn condition but serviceable  Do not expect rugs or curtains our suite had no floor coverings and metal blinds in the windows  Some additional lighting would be helpful our suite had four very small lamps   new but just one next to the bed had a  way bulb  With no bright lamp next to the futoncouch reading there can be difficult  The kitchen had a gas stove full size refrigerator dishes and utensils for  and a coffeemaker but there was no toaster  or microwave  There was a very nice TVVCR with digital cable We have stayed in all kinds of accommodations in Manhattan and overall we had a great stay  But we will request a room or suite that does not face th street for subsequent visits  And we hope that the management will try to provide upgraded cleaner furniture   we saw some beautiful and very low priced items at the wonderful thrift shops in the neighborhood so replacing some of the existing furnishings should not cost a great deal  
P => Superb Experience I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge in early ch  and was absolutely thrilled with the experience I had read a lot of the review on this site and was suitably impressed upon arrival  One of my flights had been delayed in LA so I ended up arriving in NYC at midnight instead of pm  I rang the Lodge from LA and they assured me it would be no problem to check in that late  Sure enough when I arrived I was shown to my room promptly and checked in properly in the morning which was extremely thoughtful and much appreciated after  hours in transit The rooms were small but extremely clean and comfortable  Yes the walls are thin but if ear plugs work for you then you wont have a problem  I found everyone to be very thoughtful of fellow visitors and others were very quiet if coming home late Chelsea itself is a delight to wander around   a very nice introduction to New York as its quite manageable  Walkable to the Village the Flatiron district and a great subway line you really couldnt ask for much more in terms of being central As a  year old female traveling alone I felt extremely safe at night around this area and in the Lodge itself  In fact once in the room it was hard to discern any noise from any of the surrounding streets at all  Not that theres much in Chelsea anywayAs for nearby food there are hundreds of places to eat a small superket a pharmacy on the corner   perfectly accessible to everything I would thoroughly recommend this place to stay while on holidays in New York   Ill definitely be back here again and will tell all of my friends 
P => Cozy and inexpensive in Manhattan My significant other and I have stayed at the Chelsea Lodge twice and both times we have greatly enjoyed our stay  The hotel is cozy and orated in an eclectic old americana style   both rooms weve stayed in have had quilts on the beds and vintage themed wall art  The staff is friendly rooms and bathrooms very clean  The location is great as well   on a quiet residential street just around the corner from a busy avenue and near a subway stop  One thing to be prepared for though is that the rooms weve stayed in are quite small with room for not much other than a showersink bed dresser  For the price though its well worth it and who needs a big hotel room when youll be spending time enjoying the city 
P => Lovely hotel excellent value and location Enjoyed my stay in this pretty converted brownstone very much  Wonderful location in a quiet Chelsea neighborhood just a few steps away from plenty of restaurants and shopping  I was very pleasantly surprised given the low price and recommend it highly to anyone looking for a nice budget hotel in Manhattan  Closest subway station is a little over a block away  Staff was friendly and helpful  The entire hotel looks recently reated  The room was tiny but it was clean quiet and   most importantly had a private shower and sink which is hard to find in this price range for this type of hotel  The TV didnt work very well but I didnt expect a tv in the first place so it wasnt a big deal  Window opened up to a fire escape overlooking residential courtyard  Each floor has two communal toilets which were freshly orated in black and white tile and always immaculate  And each night a hersheys kiss on the pillow was a nice touch  Recommended 
P => Great value great location Just returned from a  night stay at the Chelsea Lodge  Really pleased with our choice of accommodation  The room was a good size with a comfortable bed and plenty of storage  The shared toilet was next door and like the rooms was kept very clean  The building has a nice feel about it and the staff we met were really helpful and friendly The location was great just minutes from Times Square  It was good to explore Chelsea and we found lots of great trendy bars and restaurants in the nearby area  Can highly recommend the nearby Dish for a hearty breakfast 
P => Loved it My husband and I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge the week before Christmas   It is on a quiet residential street   our room overlooked the garden   but still only a short walk to both the red and blue subway lines  The hotel itself was immaculate and the staff was helpful and friendly  The rooms were spacious for the price   we even had a desk and chair   with enough space left over for me to roll out my yoga mat Hot water was plentiful and I never had to wait to use the WC  We will definitely stay at the Chelsea Lodge again 
P => Absolutely great I found the Chelsea Lodge using TripAdvisor  TripAvisor has earned its keep with this onenight in Manhattan   cant beat the price  It was probably the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in   for any price The rooms have their own sink and shower but you have to use the shared bathrooms  All the above are exceptionally clean  I have definitely paid more for a dirtier but private bathroom  Dont let this scare you off   the Chelsea Lodge is a great place  
P => Adored the Chelsea Lodge Only time for a brief review but felt I had to add to the positive reviews on this site  Stayed in the Chelsea Lodge for  nights in ember and was bowled over by its charm  The rooms are small but perfectly acceptable   Ive had smaller rooms in London   and as other reviewers have confirmed spotlessly clean  The area is great everything you could need within a short stroll and very handy for the nightlife of the Village and Meatpacking District  I will definitely return 
P => Same as last time super place to stay Nearly a repeat of my review of   went back to NYC for another pre christmas shopping trip  Requirements  Clean comfortable convenient and most importantly reasonably priced Rang the hotel directly got straight through to James and asked for a room for my my wife dhter and myself  James informed us he did not have any rooms left which could take three but when I explained we were aware the rooms were smallish and had been there before he gave us the same room as last year   A  My dhter being only three slept in with us  When I booked back in  my credit card was charged as agreed  dollars deposit with the rest charged on check in The Chelsea Lodge is a no frills honest to goodness place where you can get reasonably prices accommodation which is only two subway stops south from Time Square  This is two years running now we have hit New York in ember shopping and it is really useful having a base to drop our shopping bags to when we become overloaded  The reception told me about BampH photo which was recommended for camera gear so I walked straight up the street and got a new digital camera which was  euro cheaper than in Dublin The Chelsea Lodge does exactly what it says on the tin  Cheap clean comfortable rooms in New York City  With James and Jos on reception you will be well looked after  It has been suggested on the site the reception is sour and unhelpful but I genuinely believe it is James coming across poorly  He has always been warm and friendly with us although he does seem quiet and is very softly spoken I recommend the Chelsea Lodge to all my friends and know I will go back again  
P => Great budget hotel We just returned from seven nights in NYC over the New Years holiday  We chose the Chelsea Lodge because the reviews were great and because they did not raise their rates at all for the holidays unlike many NYC hotels which raise them to astronomical levels  For the price I very much doubt you could beat the Chelsea Lodage anywhere in New YorK City  Yes the rooms are tiny but they are very clean as are the bathroom facilities and the rest of the hotel  Chelsea is a wonderful neighbourhood from which to explore the rest of the city and a great part of town in its own right  
P => as if you lived your dream in NYC wonderful budget hotel in NYC   even if it wasnt so cheap   it would still be a great place to stay   converted old brownstone on a heritage leafy residential street in chelsea   americana new england style rooms were just charming as were the staff and the general area   at  euros a night this is a real steal   make sure to ask for a double room  
P => Great value for a short stay This is the perfect budget hotel for a short stay but if you are staying longer than  days then you  want to look for a place with a few more facilities Friendly staff and the room was exactly what we expected  Basic but clean and tidy  We stayed for  nights  days and found by the end that we missed having more room facilities and a barlounge to collapse in at the end of the day after sightseeing before heading our for the evening For the price this has a great location and does exactly what you would expect   a place to sleep at the end of a busy day  The local bars amp restaurants are also excellent value for money  
P => Lovely Absolutely wonderful  I came here with my boyfriend a few days before Christmas  We stayed here two nights and had a great experience  I am surprised no one has written about how charming the lobby is  I felt like I own a little brownstone in the city  Our room although small was exceptionally clean as was the shower stall in the room  I saw the cleaning ladies each day and the place smelled of pinesol which I love because it makes me feel clean   The people at the desk were all very pleasant and it was a very quiet place  Yes you share a bathroom but it is also very clean and well maintained  If I have to list some of the cons the only ones are that the room did feel a TINY bit muggy for me after my shower but my boyfriend says that was just me he didnt notice it  The second thing was our neighbors were quiet loud in the morning it seemed they opened and closed their door about  times  The Chelsea Lodge itself is incredibly clean pleasant staff great location its across the street from an elementary school and the room was a perfect size  If you have any questions please feel free to email me at tatumshirin yahoo com about it I wil absolutely stay here again if I am in NYC again  
P => Chelsea Lodge   Perfect My husband and I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge over a  day long weekend stay  It was absolutely perfect for us  Just as we expected  Small quaint clean  The Lodge is close to  way lines blue amp red  It is near to many restaurants diners kets shops pharmacies etc  We were on the rd floor  Never saw another person in the hallway  Never had to wait on a restroom  The Lodge is kept very clean  James at the front desk was very friendly  We arrived at  p m  and was able to check right in  Everyone we met that worked the front desk we met  was very friendly and helpful What a great place  We would stay here again and highly recommend it  
P => Little Gem in New York Stayed in the Chelsea Lodge for  nights in ember   Great little budget hotel its like living as a New Yorker  Looks just like an ordinary brownstone from the outside so make sure youve got good directions if taking a cab to it  Felt safe in the area there is a police station a few streets up and surrounded by eateries and good bars youre never short of a place to eat or drink  Recommend the Dallas BBQ and the Galaxy Diner for eats Flight  bar for drinks  Subway close by and within reasonable walking to Madison Square Garden  Times Square  Midtown area Rooms pretty compact but they have good showers and TVs  or a bit weird lots of ducks and Red Indian heads but not offensive Shared bathrooms not an issue they were never both in use and always spotless  Didnt have any probs with the desk staff always polite and helpful  Would certainly stay again  
P => A great find My friend amp I have just returned from a long weekend staying in the lower garden suite   it was fantastic Big room huge bathroom well equipped kitchen and lovely patio amp garden  We even woke to the sound of birds singing   hard to believe in the middle of New York Chelsea is a safe amp friendly neighbourhood   great for escaping the hustle amp bustle but still convenient for visiting the major sights  Theres a handy pharmacy at the end of the street and a Starbucks just around the corner   along with a number of great restaurants and cocktail bars For night owls the Meatpacking District is a cheap cab fareeasy stroll   the Spice ket Buddah Bar and Pastis are all worth a visit I have previously stayed in one of the lodge rooms and wouldnt hesitate to stay here again   its great value for money  
P => Great value   we will be back My boyfriend and I stayed for  nights just before Thanksgiving and were extremely happy with the place CONS  The room was smaller than expected but that is not a big deal   There is no arate bathroom rather there is a sink and shower area within your room which is my biggest gripe but for the price we paid we cant really complain   Shared toilets in the hallway  This wasnt a big deal as they were always clean and spotless  They werent too far from the rooms either and I probably saw only one other guest in the hallway in my whole stay   No elevators  We stayed on the nd floor so only had to lug our suitcases one level up but could be a problem for those higher up and with more baggage PROS  Great value for money   Not too far from subway stops    Felt very safe and secure  I never felt unsafe in the room or in the immediate area the hotel was in   Walking distance to shops restaurants and other sights   Free wireless internet in our room was a bonus   Quiet in the rooms no real issues with noise The Pros far outweighed the Cons which are more preferences that I could live without and I will definitely be back the next time I am in New York  
P => Feel like a New Yorker  Stayed here on a shoppingsightseeingsemi romantic break in uary   Booked through the phonehotel website  The man who took my booking was not too friendly but when we got there we received a nice welcome and a room ready for us  We had booked a suite a few houses down from the main hotel which was very good value considering that  will pay for a shoebox in one of teh corporate hotels  The suite was a studio apartment situated in a small brownstone house with a fully equipped kitchen a ble bathroom with a powerful shower a bed could have been more comfy and a pleasant seating area  It had really interesting art on the walls and made the place unique  Everything we would possibly want was just around the corner and the reception staff was a great source of local information  It was nice to come in from the cold from some hardcore sightseeing with a box of cupcakes and make a nice hot coffee or buy one from around the corner and lounge around before going out at night    the subway stop is around the corner and the area is very pleasant and interesting  I would also highly recommend the Dish cafe where the receptionist sent us on our first afternoon  Altogether I would always stay there again  I stayed at the Algonquin two years previously for the same money and it looks much grander but you get much less comfort and style for what you pay  Last not least Chelsea is a much more pleasant area to stay in  
P => Exactly what I expected a good thing My husband and I attended a wedding in NYC and needed an affordable hotel for three days  TripAdvisor reviewers wisely recommended the Chelsea Lodge and my stay was just as good as I thought I would be  These are some things I knew from reading past posts the hotel was on a residential street with no sign outside it was small charming and a little cramped in the rooms front desk service is spotty room service is great and sharing toilets isnt as weird as you think it might be  All of that was true  However here are some other things that made us pleasantly surprised While the front desk doesnt exactly go out of their way for things they certainly were nice to us  we got directions they took some pictures for us we got to check in a little early and they helped us with our bags  What more do you need Also we were on the third floor facing the street with the window open you get the usual NYC noises but when we shut it it was extremely quiet and no neighbors were loud at night so we got great sleep  Being on the third floor does mean having to climb  flights of stairs but if youre reasonably fit its not really a problem  In addition even though the room was pretty small and I agree with another poster  NOT good for long stays unless you have light baggage we had a comfy bed the shower and sink in the room worked fine and the room definitely had a cuteness to it  In fact the picture of the room on the website looked exactly like ours  And sharing the toilets really was no big deal at all  They were both right across from our room and were always clean fresh and I never had to wait once  In fact I never saw anybody in the halls at all I sometimes felt like we were staying in someones guest room All in all if you like a quiet neighborhood setting opposed to th Ave  and you dont mind the smallness of the rooms or sharing the toilets with others well then  a night is worth it 
P => Generally good but a few things to be aware of Finding a low priced hotel in New York that isnt a rat infested dive is a problem but for the most part Chelsea Lodge provides a good base from which to explore NYC We stayed at Chelsea Lodge for  nights in early ober and it was fine The building is in a quiet side street in the Chelsea area but is only  minutes from the nearest subway station on th Avenue  Its about a  minute walk to Madison Sq Gardens and a  minute walk to Times Sq or the the Empire State building  The nieghbourhood is very safe very gay and has a lot of good places for eating and drinking theres a cafe round the corner called The Dish does great brunch deals for On the plus side Chelsea Lodge is well maintained and the rooms are nicely orated  They have wooden floors and also have showersink in the room  The shared toilets are spotless and are not a problem as there are  toilets between every  rooms On the negative side the rooms are very small with many having the bed against the wall and only a few feet of space around it to move around  The biggest problem though is the soundproofing at this hotel   there isnt any Because there are so many rooms and toilets packed onto each floor every conversation movement and sound can be heard from neighbouring rooms or worse the toilet The service is okay   though we had much better and friendlier service at other hotels in the USA where we stayed Overall Chelsea Lodge is a sound budget choice if youre going for an action packed weekend in NYC and will hardly be in the room but if you go expecting to have a quiet time and a romantic room with a view youll probably be disappointedAnother tip is to try and get one of the rooms on the first floor closest to the stairs as they dont have a toilet next to them and are slightly bigger than the others  Those that share a wall with the toilets are probably the worst   for obvious reasons  
P => Loved it Great value accomodation for the price  The room was spotless and cleaned daily towels were also changed daily  Shower in the room worked really well and I much preferred this than having to share a shower as we had done in another place previously  If i had to complain about one thing it would be the size of the wardrobe but really we didnt have that many hanging clothes the wardrobe is down the side of the shower in the pics  We were on the rd floor room had no view but that never bothers us  Air con was a def plus point  No noise from other rooms other than opening and shutting of doors which you get in any hotel Lovely area plenty of restaurants and bars and subway within walking distance rd and th  Would definately stay here again  
P => Felt at home in NYC My husband and I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge Suites in a Parlor Suite Suites   more like studio apts Lodge   in a building down the street are rooms with shared bathrooms  The location in Chelsea is perfect    its on a tree lined street with other lovely brownstones near wonderful restaurants several subway lines are within a few blocks  The Suites room we stayed in had a clean kitchenette with frig and stove making it easy to keep and grab snacksdrinks after a long day of walking through the city  The bathroom was also clean and the housekeeping staff refreshed our towels and made the bed everyday  It was wonderful and we will certainly make it our quotplace to stayquot when visiting Manhattan  
P => Great location I absolutely loved the location   it was convenient to the subway and also there were plenty of great places nearby to eat at night  You could also walk from midtown area or from Greenwich Village area which I did a couple of times  The accommodation itself   the room was small but I was expecting that  I had thought there would be a double or twin bed in the room because website specified a full sized bed   but there was a single bed  It was fine just disappointing when I had been expecting a double  Only other problem was that it seemed like this single room had originally been joined with another single room next door   as the shower cubicle for next door was built into an alcove in my room  It only happened once but my next door neighbour ided to have a shower at  am   and the noise was pretty unbearable with pipes creaking etc for a few minutes  If it had happened anymore I would have complained but I felt there was also thoughtlessness on the part of the person next door  Shower in room was fine and TV was welcome too along with an alarm clock which came in handy when I couldnt use the alarm on my phone for a while  I liked the or in the room and hardwood floors  Only thing I would say is that I didnt get a great first impression on arrival because the room stank of cleaning fluid  Someone had gone overboard and the smell stayed in the room for a few hours because window was closed on a warm day  It wasnt a major thing and at least it proved the rooms were cleaned thoroughly  The reception staff werent particularly friendly I found they werent rude but just didnt engage in conversation much  Overall I thought it was a good value place to stay and the location was really perfect  I didnt spend that much time in my room so the size wasnt a big issue  
P => awesome stay in nyc i stayed at the chelsea lodge ove the th of y weekend  this was my first trip to nyc from georgia  i was very nervous at first but when i got to the hotel my mind was eased  the place was very charming very comfortable and in a great neighborhood  the staff was friendly they especially picked on my accent i loved it made me feel very comfortable  the area is amazing  there are several quotnicequot restaurants with one block a very nice little grocery strore which i was shocked by  there are of course a million fast food to go places to eat coffee houses and lots of delis  i must have gained  lbs in  days there is also a gap and another clothing store just down the block and many corner stores and drug stores and a movie theater and this was just on one side of the hotel i didnt even make it to the other side  you could stay here and never have to leave the  block area  and the people watching was amazing everytype size  nationality and ages all harmonious  i am planning another trip soon and will be staying here again  oh yeah good prices and you really do feel like you are staying at a house or apt  loved it loved it 
P => Charming We stayed in the Chelsea Lodge for  nights mid ust  on our honeymoon and loved it  The hotel is on a quiet leafy street and felt very safe  Chelsea is a busy neighbourhood which felt very down to earth and full of real New Yorkers  We stayed in  different types of room   standard and deluxe  Both were spotlessly clean and very pretty  The standard was small but perfectly adequate with a shared toilet across the hall  also spotless  The deluxe was definitely worth the small extra fee  very spacious with arate ensuite shower toilet  Both showers very good  The website photos do not do the rooms justice and Chelsea Lodge is excellent for such a reasonably priced hotel  Staff were very helpful yet unobtrusive  No breakfast on offer though not a problem as loads of places nearby for breakfast lunch dinner nights out etc The Chelsea Lodge is a charming hotel which is perfect for those who want something affordable and a bit different yet clean safe and reliable  We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to other visitors  
P => Small in space   small in rates If youre looking to enjoy New York and just want a clean place to lay your head and shower for a good price then the Chelsea Lodge is your place  Located in a great central location you could not ask for a better hotel  Rooms are neat and clean clean towels provided daily walking distance from everything you want to see  Just wantch the parking if you rent a car     NY parking police love to tow 
P => Met our expectations This hotel certainly lived up to our expectations and the other tripadvisor reviews  The hotel is located in Chelsea in a charming residential quiet street between th and th Avenue where you can find great places to eat and hang out as well as go out at night  The hotel as such as lovingly orated  Our room was very much on the small side with a rather small bed but the air conditioning was working fine and for the small price we paid we didnt exactly expect a palatial room in the first place Showers and toilets were immaculately clean our room was cleaned every morning and fresh towels provided  Our room was very sweet and the oration so charming that size really didnt matter at all  The room also came with free wireless internet which was fantastic  The only thing I could criticise were the thin walls meaning you could suffer if you had noisy neighbours and the slightly unfriendly man that greeted us The night porter was lovely friendly and really sweet  The other guy was sort of grumpy and quiet and made me feel unwelcome  But then   who cares when youre in New York I would definately stay here again  Its a bargain for what it is so dont tell anyone about this place  Lets keep it a secret 
P => Clean and Cute bit unfriendly though The Chelsea loge is in a great location in the heart of Chelsea which is such a cool relaxed area of the city with loads of restaurants and bars  The Lodge was very clean and felt like you were stayng in someones home rather than being a anonymous hotel  We arrived quite late just staying one night but the night porter was charming and helped us with our heavy bags up to the rd floor  our room was small but fine for just one or two nights with a shower IN the room  and the loo right next door  the corridor was boiling hot however so we had the air con on the whole time and this was INCREDIBLY noisy at night     bring some earplugs if you have trouble sleeping the bed was quite small for two people but overalll the hotel was so lovely this didnt matter  We paid  for the night  The owner the next morning though was rather unufriendly and didnt acknowlegde us at all really when we checked out  I would return but would ask for a st or nd floor room that was a bit bigger and didnt have such noisy air con 
P => Lived up to Tripadvisor reviews and my expectations I ided to take a last minute trip to New York for three days over the y  Canada Day weekend  I was travelling alone and wanted a clean place at a reasonable cost in Chelsea not usually a realistic goal for New York  Tripadvisor reviews pointed me in the direction of the Chelsea Lodge and I wasnt disappointed  I ususally stay in  star hotels when I am travelling with my partner so I was a bit nervous  It is not fancy and the room I stayed in on the second floor was small but it was all I was looking for and lived up to my expectations  The location is superb only  blocks from rd and th and the A C and E subway lines  Only   minutes to Time Square Uptown and   minutes to the World Trade Centre Downtown  My room was exceptionally quiet the air conditioning was welcomed on a very hot weekend the sink and shower in the room were convenient and the shared bathroom was no problem  I enjoyed several good restaurants on th avenue and you can even have a meal at  a m  in the City that never sleeps I felt safe walking at any time Its not luxury but a very good budget place that is clean and welcoming  Although I didnt get the names of the men on reception I enjoyed my brief chats and they seemed genuinely interested  I would recommend this place and would return if I was travelling alone  
P => Upper Garden Suite  The only way to go My husband and I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for the th of y weekend  When I booked I was not able to get the Upper Garden Suite for the entire stay so the first night we stayed in one of the Deluxe Rooms the only difference from the regular rooms is that it has its own bathroom  The Deluxe room was very clean but too small for our liking  However we cannot say enough positive things about the Upper Garden Suite  This suite makes you feel like you live in New York  It was an apartment that is now being used as a hotel room  The ceilings are high and the layout is cute  Also there are no kings on the door so you dont get that hotel feel at all which I truly enjoyed  The location of the hotel is superb it is only three blocks from the closest subway th Ave  and rd St   Some of the best restuarants are also in Chelsea  For breakfast try Murrays Bagels on th Ave  and for lunch or dinner try the quotRocking Horsequot mexican cuisine or quotSpicequot thai cuisine  We absolutely loved the food at quotSpicequot and the wait service is excellent  When we visit New York again we will definitely stay in the upper garden suite at this charming hotel in Chelsea P S  James at the front desk is the best very hospitable and willing to help with just about anything you need in New York 
P => like living in the city I stayed in the chelsea lodge suites with my  aunts and my mother in  and the experience was really great  the room was suprisingly spacious even with  people  it had a well stocked kitchenette the bed and futon were both very comfortable and although a little small the bathroom had really good water pressure even if the temperature was a little hard to control at first i really loved the neighborhood  it felt safe and comfortable and was a  minute max  walk to time square without being too busy and crowded  it was suprising how much it reminded me of a mix of the gay village and the plateau in montreal  theres a really great place called billys cupcakes that i reccommend going to if you want to people watch  its crowded with minimal seating but the people are interesting and the cupcakes are really good having a place like the chelsea lodge to come back to after a day of exploring the city by foot was great  weve ided based on our experiences that this will be the only place well stay when we come to new york  prices for suites were  for    per extra person  fairly inexpensive for a clean spacious studio in a great central location  if you pay cash you get a   discount at check out 
P => Lovely hotel My partner and I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge for ten days last month  We had to book quite a long time in advance and I now understand why  The hotel rooms are very compact but are very clean and well maintained in a New England country style  Each room has a shower and a sink but you have to pop along the corridor to the shared toilets  There are two toilets between about eight rooms on each floor and I never had to wait to use the facilities  The people on the desk are very friendly but not overly so  If you are looking for somewhere relatively inexpensive in a great location   it is in the heart of Chelsea a five minute walk to Greenwich Village and near two subway stations   then I could not recommend a better place to stay  New York was a fabulous holiday and we will always have fond memories of the city and our stay at Chelsea Lodge 
P => Chelsea Lodge   A Gem within the Big City I just came back from my stay at the Chelsea Lodge  I have to say the previous reviews written about the Chelsea Lodge are true  The staff of the Lodge are extremely friendly  The rooms are very clean and the beds are very comfortable  I dont remember a bed being this comfortable in a hotel in quite awhile if at all  The shower is great lots of hot water if necessary  Although the toilet is shared I think it is a good thing because there was never any wait to use the toilet so it would just take up more space in the room  Being a native New Yorker who comes back to visit NYC annually I can say that the Chelsea Lodge is in a safe part of town  Just in case you are looking for reassurance on that on the east side of th and th one block east of the Lodge there is a police precinct  Subways or taxi cabs are just a few blocks away  The Chelsea Lodge is in a great central location of the city for virtually any activities you plan  For staying in the city you cant beat the price  I would definitely stay at Chelsea Lodge again and you should try it too 
P => Loved the Chelsea Lodge This beautiful brownstone is nestled perfectly into a landk Chelsea block  The rooms arent huge but they are nice and very clean  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone but book early these guys fill up fast and deservedly so  
P => Charming Chelsea Lodge Our family of four has been ALL over and weve stayed in every kind of lodging    from five star hotels to very personal homey BampBs    and each one of us loved our time at the Chelsea Lodge We stayed in one of the larger units a Parlor Suite and were surprised and delighted at the level of oration and attention to detail for such a very inexpensive stay  This  be budget accommodation in price but not in style and certainly not in cleanliness I only wish my own home would be so sparkling all the timeOur  year old dhter slept on the spacious futon in the living area while a arate cot also quite comfortable was brought in for our  year old  The kitchenette was well appointed and very useful for storing snack items and the ble bathroom has a great shower The location in the heart of lovely Chelsea is another big plus for this place its a little oasis of green and quiet to come home to after a busy day in the City Theres nothing like having your own apartment in wonderful old NYC and if you stay at Chelsea Lodge Suites thats just what you will get  
P => Good price good location  My wife and I stayed in the Chelsea Lodge for  nights in late il  The Chelsea Lodge is in a nice and in our opinion safe area  Shops bars restaurants are a minute away the subway less than  minutes  The property appears to be a converted houseapartments and has a lot of character  Our room was very small but in agreement with other reviews was clean  My complaints are no toilet in the room lack of sound proofing noise from other guests in the corridors etc limited space for storing clothes and no safe  The hotel also does not have a lift The staff are friendly and accommodating and for the money it is good value  
P => Great Hotel Ive stayed at the Chelsea Lodge before and Ive never been let down  The rooms arent very large and the toilets are in the hallway which I though would be a problem but Ive never had to wait and they are always clean The staff are friendly and casual and I like the fact that I never felt like just another guest  I would highly recommend this place  
P => Go stay at the Chelsea Lodge great location for your trip to Manhatten We stayed for six nights at this perfect small brownstone hotel we wanted to experience the real New York  We found Chelsea to be a safe quite neighbourhood  Chelsea Lodge is spotlessly clean all rooms having a daily maid service when towels are changed every day  The rooms are cosy and small with a good shower washhand basin TV ceiling fan and alarm clock the restroom is down the hall but also spotlessly clean  The staff when encountered are friendly and helpful  The hotel is close to rd Street subway we arrived from JFK via an easy journey on the airtrain and subway from Howards Beach For breakfast can also recommend the New Venus Diner on th Avenue between ndrd Street where staff are friendly and attentive For evening meals we can recommend Patsys Pizzeria at  West rd Street which has an excellent family friendly atmosphere We had a great stay in New York and can thoroughly recommend the Chelsea Lodge  
P => Excellent I stayed in a nice small and very clean room  the people are nice and the lodge is near to metrostations   min  walk an excellent choice 
P => Excellent place to stay I stayed in the lower Garden Suite with my boyfriend for  days in mid ober  granted we went during their worst ober rain in  years but it was still a romantic stay  I booked it based on reading the reviews on this site and I am so glad I did  Its a great place on a quiet street as quiet as possible for NYC anyway in one of the best neighborhoods there  Its right next door to a beautiful old church turned playhouse  Clean quaint and for NYC hotel standards it was quotpalatialquot as my NYC gallerist Im a painter said when he saw the place especially for the price  Jeez you couldnt get a better deal  I could easily have lived in there for a few months very comfortably  You cant get a ent hotel room in NYC for less than  so for  we got our own private space with a garden kitchenette and a giant bathroom no tub though but all VERY nice and all newly reated  I wont stay in a dump myself and I was super pleased  I cant recommend the place more  It was fantastic You can see the top of the Empire State building and its very close to the C train  all the great Chelsea art galleries  We were able to walk to all the places we needed and we are not walkers at all so trust me when I say its close to all  A drug store is on the corner stock up on some snacks for your kitchen and save a bit of money  You can dine out once a day instead of  times that way  Great places to eat all around  Even in the pouring rain it was easy to get around when we hung out in the neighborhood  There isnt much in terms of room service and such but if you like your privacy its great  They have even better deals if you stay in their main house a couple doors down and dont mind sharing a bathroom  Nice guys running the place too  
P => Lovely place Spent  nights at this hotel in NYC and I really recommend it It is very clean cosy and very very quiet we stayed in a room facing the back  The location was also great However when I booked the room I did not know the fact that the rooms do not have a private toilet although we had a sink and a shower  Nevertheless the communal toilets were always very clean I must say All in all a good experience  
P => Excellent place I stayed there with my partner for four nights over for New Years Eve time  Its very central   and staff were very friendly  Very cute rooms with everything you need there we had a shower in our room  For NYC at that time of the year it was a very good deal Would definitely stay there again 
P => For the money theres no better place Chose to stay at the Chelsea Lodge on the back of previous reviews in Tripadvisor  What can I say If youre looking to do New York as it should be done then you need to stay here Why spend lots of money on an expensive hotel when this is so well located and such a nice place  Rooms are spotless I had a view of the Empire State and anybody who ever worried about the idea of shared toilets should think again   totally clean and better than many  star hotels Go stay and enjoy 
P => Perfect for a short break on a budget Like many others who have contributed reviews I can highly recommend the Chelsea Lodge I was staying in NYC on my own for a few days and found it very difficult to find somewhere that was not too expensive but was clean warm and comfortable I eventually settled on the Chelsea Lodge and it absolutely ticked all those boxes for me  It is close to all the attractions in the city such as the Empire State Building Times Square etc and has two subway stops nearby to get you everywhere else  However despite its closeness to all these things the neighbourhood is very quiet and indeed very pleasant with tree lined streets and lots of nice diners The rooms in the hotel are fairly compact and pretty old fashioned but very clean  Each room has a wash basin and shower and a TV  The rooms are cleaned every day and towels and bed linen replaced Sure theres a shared WC but on my floor there were two of them and one right beside my room so that was great I suppose the only downside is that parts of th Avenue can be a little seedy and the Chelsea area would appear to be the gay district of NYC is that is something you are uncomfortable with  It isnt something I was used too but by no means was it off putting I have no hesitation in recommending this place  Very homely very cosy and very reasonable  Go for it 
P => Highly recommend this cute Brownstone First of all all the reviews you have read about the cleanliness of this place         BELIEVE IT No seriously I am a microbiologist and extremely picky about hotel rooms and the reviews were what sold me on it  We stayed here for  nights for the New Years festivities  It was still orated for Christmas which was so sweet  This place is awesome because it was only night and had a  day cancellation policy with no charge They didnt even jack the price up for New Years like everywhere else does  The fact that there is a shower and sink in the room is a rare plus too  Beware if you are a modest person and staying with someone the shower doesnt allow for much privacy as you have to dry and dress in the room  The custodial staff were very perky and friendly and greeted us each morning  The guy that owns the place let us store our luggage there hours pre and post checking inout which gave us much more time to hang out  When we came back he had taken our luggage to our room  I have stayed in Chelsea before and it truly is the cleanest safest nicest part of NYC  Just a few blocks from the subway and you pass an Eckerd on the corner so you are easily accessable to snacks and drinks  Only a  cab ride from LGA  You can easily walk to Time Square from Chelsea Lodge Anyway highly recommend  For  there are a few improvements I would make like some coat hooks on the wall or non petruding shower handle The shower is so small we kept hitting it on accident and OUCH The water was scalding or like ice Scarce storage area makes it hard to unpack bulky winter cloths like sweaters coats etc  Overall I loved this place  Brownstones are cool Especially this one  I will always stay here from now on  
P => Awsome Chelsea Lodge I spent months researching accomodation in NYC before I ided on the Chelsea lodge mostly because of the reviews on this sight  I didnt want to do the backpacker thing and had a small budget  Given there were so many good reviews I figured that there must be truth in them and I was correct  The Chelsea lodge was just awsome  The room was small but perfect in size  Hot water never ran out in the good shower in my room  Bed was comfy and the room warm  Each floor had a shared toilet but I never once saw anyone on my floor in  days  The guys there were so helpful and friendly  The whole hotel is done up similar to what I would describe as an English pub   very homely and cosy with interesting paintings and knick knacks orating the halls and stair well Location wise there is th St subway a block down or rd St a few blocks over  It was a great base to explore NYC  And no street noise at all There are heaps of places to eat and have a drink   the area is very safe as is all of New York  Travelling as a single white female for the first time to New York I never felt threatened or worried walking about at night only a little out of place as there are mainly gay bars in the area In sumy I would recommend the Chelsea lodge to anyone and I plan to be returning later this year Thank you Chelsea lodge for a perfect stay 
P => Centrally located good value My wife and I stayed one week in NYC at the Chelsea Lodge for sightseeing shoping and entertainment  We chosed the Chelsea Lodge after researching on Trip Advisor  When we arrived at the lodge late we got a small room on the nd floor no elevator equipped with a queen bed a shower a wash basin a set of drawers and a tv  The room was small but we had enough space for a comfortable base for our visit The good things were it was warm clean and quiet  Even the shared bathroom was tidy  Staff was friendly though we hadn t much contact The location on the th street is a good deal just three blocks from the next subway station and in a save neighborhood a lot of gays seem to live here  It was quite easy to get there  We took the AirTrain from JFK to Jamaica Station and than the subway line E to rd St  th Av  Took us a little bit more than one hour all in all  But watch out there is no sign outside house No   that says  Chelsea Lodge  If you want value for your money and a comfortable clean and quiet place we d recommend the Chelsea Lodge  
P => Good clean chelsea lodge Stayed at this hotel for  nights  We had a bachelor apartment which I thought was great  Very very clean  Although I did not like the bed sheets they were so flimsy and paper thin but in the end its only a bed  Furniture in room was old but again for the location of the hotel and the price we pad  or  us a night cant remember its well worth it  Enjoyed staying in chelsea compared to times square  The Dish restaurant down the street from the hotel is really good for breakfast Also liked the fact that it felt like we were true quotNew Yorkersquot  Our batchelor apartment was in a brownstone which was really cool  If you pay cash you get a   discount at check out  If your looking for a place to stay that is quotno frillsquot and you dont need assistance with front desk this is a good place for you  If you have your own apt you dont run into the people who work there  People who worked there werent that helpful but Im pretty easy going so I didnt mind  We stayed our last night at Best Western Hospitality house in a suite with a kitchen an erate family room which was amazing ANd it was  us a night but they only had one night available and the other nights were   Subway is close by to chelsea lodge which is very convenient  Buy a day pass if your thinking of taking it throughout the day its worth it  unlimited bus and subway access  Also buy any theatre tickets online cheaper try Playbill or Ticketweb  Definitely buy your MOMA tickets on line so you dont have to wait in line  If looking for a good restaurant try Taboon arabic food really really good  Warm foccacia bread served with their dips  We went for appetizers late one night but there main courses looked amazing This hotel books up pretty quick the apartments so call ahead  If you try to book online and there sold out call the hotel directly most likely they can probably accommodate you  Thanks for all the advice from others who have posted here  If it wasnt for them I would of been lost  Thanks guys 
P => Great hotel A really fantastic hotel in an excellent location  I stayed there for  nights in uray this year and for  a night it had everything I needed   a comfy doubl bed tv basin and shower and the staff are really friendly and attentive  I shared a toilet just outside my room with another person not that I ever saw them  I also had a great view of the Empire State Building from my bedroom  For people on a budget I cant recommend it highly enough  
P => Wonderful hotel We stayed at the chelsea lodge for  nights in e this summer  It was our first trip to New York  It was a lovely small hotel with nice country like rooms  The rooms were always clean and tidy  the staff was nice  Once in the hotel it was very quiet and peaceful even though it lays in the center of Manhatan  It felt like you werent in the city anymore  Which was a good feeling after a hectic day in New York  The rooms were also very cheap  It was a very pleasent excperience 
P => Great value Awesome location I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge in il  and wasnt sure what to expect even though most of the reviews Id read about the place were positive  I loved it  The location cant be beat and neither can the price  My room was even cheaper than listed because if you pay with cash you get a discount The room was small which I expected but its just fine for one person  Having your own sink and shower in the room makes dealing with a shared toilet much easier  In fact during my  night stay I never had to wait to use the facilities and I hardly even saw another soul although the place was almost booked solid  Not having cable was a bummer as Im totally addicted to NY when Im in the city but as I only spend daily prep time in my room anyway I coped  My heater made a few strange noises but once I figured out where the noise came from it stopped bothering me  The hot water in the shower was plentiful   except during quotpeakquot morning times but I just made simple adjustments to my daily schedule and enjoyed a little extra sleep Ive recommended the Chelsea Lodge to all of my friends since staying there and Im planning on booking again for a trip this Fall  Its cozy and safe and the staff was polite  What more could you ask for 
P => Great place to stay Great City My husband and I recently returned from New York City for our th anniversary  We had a wonderful time  We stayed at the Chelsea Lodge and we were not disappointed  Like most of the other reviews that I read here the place was clean and safe  The room was more than adequate and it was very quiet especially considering it was a full house The WC down the hall was just fine  We didnt have to wait in que at all  You cant beat the price and the location was incredible  Everyone was friendly and willing to help  The restaurants in Chelsea were great especially the Rocking Horse and R U B  Righteous Urban BBQ  Byron at Rising Dragon Tattoo does a great job at flash design and tattooing The bouroughs are amazing   there is so much to see and do  We bought the New York City Pass tickets we saved about half on the Empire State Building MOMA etc    With these passes we got to walk past about  people waiting in line to get into MOMA   that was worth the price of admission right there  Buy tickets ahead of time if you want to see anybody at the Blue Note   usually a full house  Taj Mahal Trio rocked I loved NYC even though it is good to be home I want to go back 
P => Good enough and a good value I stayed in NYC over Memorial Day weekend and was determined to find lodging for under  a night  The Chelsea Lodge was only  per  If Id been with my wife I probably would have passed since she wouldnt have wanted a shared bath but I was on my own and I dont have a problem with that  I thought the place was fine  The room was clean I had my own sink and shower and the toilet there were  on my floor was kept well cleaned  The hotel is a converted brownstone and has a certain charm in that respect   it feels more like an apartment building than a no frills hotel  The desk clerk was also friendly and laid back chatting with me about baseball when I checked in Ive stayed at far more expensive hotels where I felt like an item on an assembly line at check in  One caveat no AC just a ceiling fan so Id be leery of staying there in midsummer  Also no cable TV but who goes to NYC to watch TV 
P => Comfortable Hotel I stayed in one of the suite rooms for a couple of days and then around four days in a standard room with a mate this il The suite was very comfortably roomy and clean  It was a ground floor room that faced the main street which made the room a bit noisy in the morning and sometimes late evening   though nothing that caused a major concern  The bathroom had a shower with great hot water and the kitchenette was handy though we didnt use it The standard room was very small and dark even though orated with light colours  The room faced the next buildings wall so was generally quiet though no view  All of the other rooms seemed to be packed in very tighly so you could hear other guests through some of the walls and walking up the stairs and down corridors  The shower and basin was fitted in the room which made it a bit snug  The thought of shared toilets made be quiver before I arrived though they were very clean all of the time  The shower had very hot water Staff were generally very friendly For the prices you pay in NYC I think that Chelsea lodge was generally good value  I would stay here again though I would book one of the suites for a more spacey stay  
P => Quaint lodge in quiet area ROOMSWe stayed in a quite nice room overlooking the rear of the house which was much bigger than we had thought  The room was light clean and plenty big enough for  people  The toilets just down the corridor were very clean  We had a TV shower and sink in the room  FOODNo food here but plenty nearby Some great bagel places esp Big Cup and lovely restaurants check out thai food at the very popular Spice STAFFThe staff werent that friendly but they were helpful LOCATIONOn a quiet and seemingly safe residential street  Chelsea is a lovely place to stay just a few minutes walk from the Subway  A recommended area to stay in away from all the other tourists and has a community feel PRICEFor two people inc tax in a standard room approx   Reasonable I would thoroughly recommend this as a base to stay in New York  
P => Has Pros and Cons Stayed for  nights based in large part to the reviews read here and was moderately disappointed  After all the gushing I had my hopes sky high so heres the real deal as witnessed by someone who travels at least once a year Your stay here is going to depend largely on which room you get  While I was there I did see into some rooms which were quite a good size even nicely orated  Our room by comparison was very dark overlooking an alley and looked like it was done up about  years ago  There was some sort of stain by the bed but not an enormously big deal  Now on the huge plus side it is on a very safe very quiet street  Its a great little brownstone and Chelsea cant be beat for awesome diners  The staff are super despite coming in our room when we had the Do Not Disturb sign up it was rectified in a clean efficient manner right away  The shower in the room is a neat idea but getting the water temperature right is very tricky  The shared bathroom was no big deal at all and they are spotless The price cant be beat and all in all I would easily stay there again 
P => Very Good Value We stayed in the Chelsea Lodges suite building the middle part of uary  The price was  per night without tax  The room was very big and had its own kitchenette  We were in the quotUpper Gardenquot suite  Floor to ceiling windows on one side of the room and one of the windows was a french door leading to the backyard  It really felt like I was back living in NYC This is a really nice place in a great location for subways and taxis  Chelsea has some good eating nearby  Youll like it if your an urbanite  If your from Kansas stay in Times Square youll like that better  
P => Reasonable but not worth all the praise The location is fine on one of the few attractive brownstone streets in Chelsea   which is otherwise a rather dull area between Greenwich and mid town  The welcome wasnt the warmest Ive had in New York and my first impressions of my suite were not very good  It was clean enough but not especially well equipped and a little tired  The sofa bed in the living room looked like it came out of the ark and it was incredibly uncomfortable  The street noise is very noticeable at the front of the house   but then who wants to sleep in NYC Overall it was reasonable for the price but when I visit NY again I will be staying somewhere else  
P => Clean very accessible and friendly staff I spent a week there from  nd and enjoyed the experience tremendously  Would definitely stay there again  
P => You Wont Believe How Great This Place Is For the budget price you get  Great servicefriendly staff  Great Location  Clean rooms  Your own key to the front door   No this is not the place for those who like to be pampered  its a clean safe lovely little brownstone with all the necessities  I will DEFINITELY book Chelsea Lodge again next time I go to NYC  
P => Clean Affordable Perfect Stay here everytime im in NYC country feel in the middle of the city freindly staff and great location highly reccomend to all 
P => mmmmmmm When you take a look around New York and see what else is on offer in the   price range you can appreciate why the Chelsea Lodge is booked up fairly fast For the price  tax for a double room its a bargain   The ambience of the hotel is very pleasant with a sort of rustic country or to it  The rooms are pretty small but if youve come to New York youd have to be pretty dull to spend too much time there anyway  The shower cubicle and basin do the job just fine and the communal toilets are very clean and just outside the rooms  However its the location that really clinches it  Located in the Chelsea district the traditional brownstone flat front terrace is in a perfect position to explore what the city has to offer  The subway rd or th st stations is close at hand but its so easy to walk everywhere you wont often need it  Times Square Macys the Empire State building and the rest of midtown NY are just a  minute walk and the bars and restaurants of Greenwich Village and SoHo are a similar distance away  Chelsea itself has an excellen range of bars and restuarants for whatever budget or taste  Among others the Nooch ThaiJapanese noodle bar ket Cafe and Empire Diner   both trendy diners   and Cafeteria barrestaurant were all pretty tasty  
P => Centrally located charm So heres the deal youre going to be staying in the heart of the city    midtown is just blocks away    you can walk to the lower east side    the A train is within three blocks    shopping    restaurants    we actually parked our rental car right in front sort of a Faustian experience anywhere else  The staff is knowledgable and willing to help  Now tell me again why you wanted to stay anywhere else  
P => this place is perfect anyone looking to do new york whether on a budget or not should check out this place  i found it by looking on this site   we stayed for five nights and it was just so clean and good value for money  id read horror stories about getting bed bugs even in the most expensive hotels  not here tho you get a shower and basin in your room a comfy double bed and clean towels and maid service every day  the staff are really friendly and you feel like you have your own appartment no tacky neon lights   and what a great area chelsea is  loads of great bars restaurants clubs and handy for the subway too  wholeheartedly recommend this place u must book 
P => I felt like a native New Yorker  I stayed at the Chelsea Lodge during a bitterly cold weekend in   so the warmth of the rooms was very welcome albeit a little stuffy at night  The staff are friendly and the lodge is too cute for words with flying ducks on the walls and new england type or in the rooms  The shower in my room was great   small but adequate with plenty of hot water  The toilet was just across the hall and i never had to queue When my Big Apple Greeter a New Yorker of  years called at the lodge she couldnt believe she hadnt heard of the place before and said she would be recommending it to her out of town guests in future Although I travelled alone I felt safe warm and happy staying here and wouldnt hesitate to stay here again   so much better than these huge anonymous travel inn places  
P => Two thumbs up Would   recommend Chelsea Lodge to anyone looking for a well priced clean cute friendly place to stay in NYC Small room   but not a problem at all and  night is great for NYC  Although I wasnt totally keen on the idea of sharing a toilet at first no need to share shower as there is a cute little one in the room there was absolutely no problem as they were always spotless and you never had to wait The staff were great   very helpful and friendly  The location is mid way between the Central park Times Square etc attractions and the SoHo Greenwich scenes  Definately walking distances for the traveller who likes to walk but if you are too tired the NYC subway is great also and there is a close stop to the Lodge Also close by  if you are looking for a fabulous palce to eat try the Grammercy Tavern also on West th down near the intersection with Broadway or for a quick tasty and healthy bite Better Burger at th and rd This place deserves its consistently great reveiws  Would definately stay there again  
P => Would definitely stay here again    My boyfriend and I stayed in the suites from ober  through the ober  I thought the suite was fabulous  We had our own kitchen and garden and the place was spacious and clean  It was very welcoming after a long day of walking and sightseeing   seemed like coming home to our own studio apartmentThe location is great    Chelsea is in lower Manhattan close to all the places we wanted to go  The subway is three blocks away from Chelsea Lodge which is very convenient  The neighborhood is quiet and has lots of restaurants and shops nearby I would definitely recommend Chelsea Lodge due to the nice staff they allowed us to leave our luggage after check out to give us more time in the city the location and cleanliness  
P => Everything you could ask for in a budget hotel My husband and I stayed here the last three nights of our NY stay and absolutely loved it  The room was more spacious than we thought and everything was well thought out    we were welcomed with Hersheys kisses on the pillows and bussubway maps were placed in the room for our convenience The room came with a tiny shower a bonus and there were more than enough toilets to share among rooms  Everything was very well maintained and clean A big shout out to Jose at the desk who was an absolute dear even helping us with our luggage up the stairs The neighbourhood itself is charming with loads of cafes little bookshops and art galleries  Its also close to Times Square we walked home one night from there and were surprised that we could Very nice  Chelsea Lodge made our New York experience extra special

P => Good job Jay Clean friendly idiosyncratic  we showered in a closet but it worked  and  relatively  quiet  Great location away from the snooty people on upper th  Felt like real NY experience  Jay and the crew were great hosts  Well go backA few tips  we Europeans like light breakfasts but a bit of ham or smoked salmon wouldnt go amiss look after the rear garden it could be real treasure warn us older folks about the climb or offer rooms on the nd floor 
P => Glowing with charm If you are sick of the usual service and composition you see every time you travel the Chelsea Pines Inn is a must try for every curious traveler to New York City Simply put the reviews don t lie  Yes the hotel is exceedingly clean perfectly situated and perhaps the coziest place away from home you could imagine but The real blessing is the staff who could not have gone further out of there way to accommodate our never ending questions on our first visit to NYC  From event tickets restaurant recommendations to subway directions we truly felt like the only guests in the hotel  The quality of service will leave you smiling guaranteed We cannot wait to go back  No elavator Who cares each step represents how much better this hotel must be than any other in NYC  Truly a gem  
P => What a find We found this brilliant little hotel on Trip Adviser and picked it because of the great reviews  It was so good If you love movies and movies stars this is the hotel for you The hotel is filled with wonderful old movie posters  From the minute we walked in to the minute we left the staff were great The room was clean  Great sheets on the bed The breakfast area is lovely and good mix of things to eat  I will be going back next week to stay another night Great location  
P => Just Couldnt Live up to the Hype The danger of so many five star reviews for in facility terms at least a modest hotel is that it can raise expectations  sometimes unrealistically The excellent service and welcome are well documented in other reviews but we found these to be distinctly patchy on our visit with levels of service and helpfulness varying greatly between the staff the owner was a total starton every occasion I have to say  When I cut my finger at breakfast I was faced with someone who seemed to have little urgency to help and couldnt even find a first aid kit  Some of the recommendations given were also less than enthusiastic which for first time visitors was a little disappointing   its this kind of service thats supposed to make Chelsea Pines stand out  We also had a room mix up which led to us having to move after one night and when we were confused over the tax on the final bill we found one of the staff pretty off hand Again as documented the rooms are original and I can see how this would make a welcome change if you stay at faceless branded hotels regularly but from speaking to friends since for the price its not totally a value option   with offers at some larger hotels you can match what youd pay here Overall its about the hotel experience you want and it didnt really work for us despite the excellent location some friendly staff and friendly other guests  My advice would be to consider hotels in a similar price bracketpackage deal and set realistic expectations  While it wasnt what I was looking for its clearly doing lots right for a lot of people  
P => The perfect place to stay in New York Having been to NY  times and always stayed in mid town we were keen to stay closer to the areas we spend most fo our time in  And as a  month pregnant lady we wanted to make this trip memorable as it will be our last as a twosome We found this hotel on the New York Times website always a good start and couldnt fault a thing  From the moment we arrived we had such a warm welcome and the guys couldnt do enough to make us feel at home  The hotel itself is realy nicely done  The collection of old movie posters everywhere is a lovely touch and we were thrilled ot be in the Tony Curtis room next door to the doris day room natch The room was spotless with a big comfy bed nice ensuite bathroom with a good power shower  Not huge but bigger than many of the other boutique hotels weve stayed at in NY The breakfast being included was great too   lovely fresh coffee muffins bagels and doughnuts plus cereal yoghurt and fruit set us up well for our days out And the location was perfect  A  minute walk to the magnolia Bakery and the gorgeousness of the west village on the doorstep  Then Pastis and all the other Meatpacking district bars and restaurants at the end of the street Dont miss the highline walk whilst youre there  A beautiful way to see the city and again right on the doorstep I coudnt recommend this place more  We are used to staying in lovely boutique hotels that cost twice as much but have not had as warm a welcome as we did here  
P => Most Amazing New York Experience Where you stay on a vacation will make or break a great trip  The service we received while on our honeymoon was phenomenal  Jay and his staff are great  We received nothing but courteous and helpful service our whole stay  Everything from where to eat to getting us tickets to Broadway Shows  The room was perfect  It was all done out in Silver Screen memorabilia  Most importantly the room was clean The whole hotel was clean and new feeling for an older building  The complimentary media room was also a great plus The surrounding area has to be the best in NYC  Ive been before and we were there for a friends wedding  It was funny to find us in our area at the end of the night when out on the stag and wedding night as a group  Incredible restaurants funkychill nightclubs and all regular amenities are literally a stones throw away The personal touches where the icing on the cake for us  Things like the staff taking time to research and find you the best deals on Broadway Shows Jays homemade bread in the morning and the fresh bouquet that showed up in our room for our honeymoon  We plan on staying here every time we go to New York and I would definitely recommend The Chelsea Pines Inn to anyone and everyoneThanks guys for a great trip 
P => Loved it Stayed for five nights in the Donna Reed room super room with plenty of space and character  Al and his staff and Charlie made us feel moore than just guest  Fantastic help with hockey and musical tickets and everything  You really made our stay in NYC priceless  When we come back next time we definitely know where to stayStefan amp Katarina 
P => Great Location quaint film star rooms this hotel is in perfect location for many subway lines and basically walking distance from most tourist areas  Breakfast was included  muffins bread and yogurt but wasnt that varied  some rooms are very small but the beds are comfortable and we didnt spend much time in them anyway very helpfull staff and super atmosphere which made our stay very enjoyable 
P => Clean Quiet Comfortable Convenient  Moderately priced Inn with nicely appointed rooms on West th Street  Wifi and breakfast included great value  L train is a half block away so making the transfer uptown at Union Square is a snap  Service was stellar went out of their way to make my short stay extremely comfortable  Great alternative for business travelers tired of the big boxy and expensive twice the price mid town hotels 
P => Halloween in NYC Flew out from LA and met with a friend from Albuquerque for Halloween in the Big Apple  Daniel and Xavier provided superior customer service which made a great weekend even better 
P => Perfect Chelsea location with great movie theme rooms and a super staff  Chelsea Pines Inn is a great place to stay  Its charming with the feeling of a bed and breakfast but the privacy of a hotel  The rooms are movie themed with terrific photos and posters of movie stars of the silver screen  The staff is warm and friendly and the owner and gm in particular are theater nuts and have wonderful adviceassistance to offer if you are at all interested in seeing shows while in town  They celebrate NY which makes it even easier to find the best places to dine enjoy art and see the town  There is even a Inn Cat quotCharliequot who is very friendly and makes the place feel like home  
P => A place to come back as soon as possible We had a wonderful stay at the Chelsea Pine Inn  The staff is extremely friendly and the location is very nice close to the beatiful Meat District with all the nice reaturants and caf s  
P => great place great people Just really really nice people there enjoy your stay as we did 
P => The perfect location with a very friendly and helpful staff  subway only  feet away  right on the edge of the Village Chelsae and Meat Packing District  plenty of restaurants shopping and parks  Charlie the cat was ther to greet you every day you came back   Business center available to check e mail  Nice daily news letter on what is going on in City  Will stay here on next visit  
P => A real gem We just love Chelsea Pines and would recomend it to anyone travelling to NYC  It is a gay hotel but we have stayed with heterosexual friends several times and they have always made them just as welcome  The hotel location is ChelseaMeatpacking district with a subway right on the corner so you are in a great part of town  Rates are good value for NYC and you get the wonderful bonus of breakfast too  Rooms are clean and comfortable   I think the ONLY thing I would suggest is that as the buidling is tall with no lift if you have any mobility problems make sure you ask for a room on the lower floors Staff are the most helpful and welcoming I have ever come across anywhere  I think its advantage is that it is not part of a chain so the atmosphere is set by its wonderful owner Jay  Book in and enjoy your stay 
P => A great place to stay in New York My partner and I stayed a week at Chelsea Pines and I would definitely stay again  Location is excellent only  metres to the subway station and we found Chelsea to be a very safe area close to some good venues  The hotel is very clean and tidy and the staff were all very helpful  Our room was very quiet and the breakfast each day is excellent  It was our first visit to New York and Chelsea Pines was a great base  
P => Fabulous friendly great located Inn in ChelseaWest Village Ive been staying at the Cheleas Pines Inn for almost  years for both business and personal trips  The management continues to improve and upgrade the Inn to the point where it rivals the best of small boutique hotels in NYC  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful the rooms are very comfortable and the amenities are top notch  The new  room suites are very nice and ideal for  friends travelling together  And the location on the border between the West Village and Chelsea cant be beat for restaurants shopping night life and easy subway access to all of NYC  
P => Wonderful hotel   Great staff Had a wonderful stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn  Beautiful inside and out  Charming converted five story walk up  orated with lots of classic movie star posters and pictures  I stayed in the Lee Remick suite  Lovely Comfortable queen size bed  Gorgeous bathroom Nice breakfast in the morning  Great business center with computersprinters  The staff was first rate The subway was just down the block  Very easy to get uptown to shows and shopping Would happily stay again 
P => Great location most enjoyable stay and frienly staff We were returning guests and  once again greatly appreciated the Chelsea Pines Inn for its convenient location and for the improvements in room reations and other things like Business Center  The breakfast is generous and the staff is very friendly and helpful  We will definitely come back again  
P => Great place to stay in NYC friendly staff great location and nice rooms We stayed in the Celsea Pines Inn for three nights and really liked the place  The location is right on th between th and th close to  in Chelsea Soho and Meatpackers  The first thing you notice when you step into the hotel is that its cozy clean and well kept  Second thing you notice is the very friendly staff who welcome you very nice indeed  The room we stayed in was one of the standard rooms cozy functional with a good bathroom nice bed and a view to the garden  Also loved the breakfast fresh bagels juices etc The only downside was that we booked last minute so we had the room on the top  Fourth floor no elevator so a good workout to get to and from your room  Other than that we loved our stay  I would really recommend this hotel and we would come back 
P => Great Style and or   helpful staff My dhter and I stayed in this boutique hotel and were delighted with our room and the staff  Our room was small there are larger rooms we just figured we wouldnt be spending much time in ours so ided to save and use the savings elsewhere but was so well designed that it worked very well and was comfortable  Bathroom upgraded and upscale with granite counter tile and plush linens  Love the old Hollywood or and movie posters  Desk staff very helpful and issue an info page each morning with weather forecast interesting things to do etc  Business room has computers and a printer at no charge   Continental breakfast included  No elevators though so we got a good workout to the fourth floor  Close to the subway station  
P => My first visit in NY was fab thanks to the guys at Chelsea Pines Inn This hotel in NY isnt just situated in a really nice area  Its clean welcoming has creative and fun orated rooms and foremost a wonderful staff  They will help you find what ever youre looking fore and they fill this special little family reeling hotel with a nice atmosphere  A big plus for the small backyard where you can take your cup of coffe in the morning   Nina from Sweden 
P => A superb home from home with the friendliest of staff We had stayed at this hotel  years previously and chose to return as we found its facilities location and the helpfulness of the staff an absolute must  In fact the hotel had been refurbished and the new internet suite came in very handy as I discovered Id lost my wallet on arriving there The owner Jay couldnt have been more concerned and helpful as regards this unfortunate occurence  
P => Cute small hotel We stayed three nights in this hotel and were pleased  I had booked a double room in advance and everything was alright when we checked in  Hotels rooms are dedicated to film stars and we stayed in Rock Hudson room  I loved the interior and old movie posters  The only downside in this hotel is that it doesnt have a lift and the steps are pretty narrow and steep The room had arate hall with a small table two chairs and a fridge  Bedroom was spacious and there was also couple of chairs and a small table  Bathroom was clean and comfortable  Theres really nothing bad to say about the room it was cozy and we liked it Breakfast was included with the price and there were the basic stuff bread cereal coffee tea and juice  Hotel is located on the th street and the location pleased us we didnt want to stay near tourist attractions  Subway entrance is near there were many nice restaurants nearby and some interesting shops  It is a gay neighborhood so if you have a problem with that I suggest you stay somewhere else  We had an enjoyable stay and could stay here again 
P => Clean stylish hotel with fantastic service in great location  Stayed at Chelsea Pines for the first time after reading great reviews on Trip Advisor  Was not disappointed    in fact even better than we expected  Chelsea Pines is in a great location walking distance for Meatpacking District West Village and Soho which all have great shopping dining and nightlife  Hotel was spotlessly clean with fabulous bed linens and plush towels  Staff were all extremely friendly and helpful catering to our every need with a genuine smile  Great breakfast every morning which is served until am which is nice not to have to get up at the crack of dawn after a night on the town  The check out time of noon is nice too    most place in NYC are am  Would highly recommend this hotel to both couples and families looking for a small friendly stylish quotfamily runquot place to stay  We will definately be back  
P => Friendly stay in great location Chelsea Pines is gay friendly straights should read that as simply friendly  It was a key part in my wifes enjoyment of her first visit to New York from New Zealand and she thinks it the most characterful place shes ever stayed Its not a full service hotel but the staff are very friendly and obliging and they organized a car to Newark International in the middle of the night with great efficiency  The self service breakfast is excellent in the bagels and muffins genre and there are lots of places to eat in the immediate neighbourhood the Chelsea Pines recommendations are both reliable and very precise once you make the simple step of realizing that quotconvivialquot can mean quotnoisyquot to fogies like me Chelsea Pines is Hollywood themed and there are lots of movie posters around but it is not over the top  It is quiet and restful and the hotel cat is of the meditative kind well hes old and sleeps a lot  It was a real pleasure to come back here in the evening We had a premium room with good space though the whole building is kind of narrow so the space is mostly in the length dimension  Everything was clean and worked properly the bed was huge and very comfortable and firm which is excellent for aging backs on a sight seeing trip  The noise level is excellent for its location and we had no trouble sleeping Were already recommending this to our friends and hope to return soon  
P => The Inns warm welcome carried on throughout our stay  Excellent location with a very pleasant and helpful staff  We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and enjoyed our banter with all staff members  We appreciated their wonderful and insightful ideas and recommendations for things to do and places to eat  
P => I cant recommend this hotel highly enough I have just returned from New York after spending  fabulous nights at the Cheslea Pines with a group of girls to celebrate my birthday  What a treat this place is  Clean stylish incredibly welcoming and an all round pleasure to stay in  I cant recommend this hotel highly enough  The staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful even putting up with  girls in high heels clattering around the place and the added touch of a bunch of flowers in my room on my birthday was a lovely surprise  The  rooms we stayed in were really spacious clean and the beds were so comfortableBreakfast each morning was also an added treat where yummy bagels muffins and home made breads were all laid out waiting for us  A lovely way to start the day The location is excellent with a subway stop just down the street  All in all we had a lovely time and Im so glad I found this gem of a place 
P => great room great staff great location Staying at Chelsea Pines Inn was a pleasure  The room was very comfortable nicely orated and seemed new  The aircon in summer was a definate plus  We slept really well as it was very quiet but in a busy bustling area of NYC  The staff were very friendly including the resident cat  Each room is named after a hollywood movie star and has photos and posters up of the star in your room  I would recommend this place to friends and would stay there again myself  
P => Great location great people great place The quotPinesquot is a great respite from the New York pace  I visit for work quite often and really appreciate the personalized service and attention  I have been a customer for  years and have never had a negative experience  I look forward to my time there it feels like home 
P => So Friendly and greatly located if you are fed up with hotel chains you will love this charming guest house ideally located in Chelsea and near the Meatpacking district one of the hot spot of NY the staff is really nice and helpful for sure we will return  
P => Classy interesting small hotel in a fabulous neighborhood  Classic movie themed small hotel is fun and comfortable  If you arent used to stairs be sure to request a room on one of the lower floors  
P => cool fun and friendly This place was excellent in every way  I rang to make a reservation and requested a quiet room so we had one facing the garden which was fine  The people on the desk were extremely knowledgeable warm and helpful making us feel that nothing was too much trouble  The hotel is in a great location near the new High Line park which is wonderful and very handy for the Subway  There is a daily information sheet they produce telling you whats on and stuff of interest  The room was very comfortable and clean with air conditioning essential in ust  We took two teenage boys  and  and they both loved it as well  It was both very relaxed and extremely efficient I would highly recommend it  
P => Fantabulous From the location to the people nothing beats Chelsea Pines  I just wish I had a permanent room there  convenient to the Meatpacking District and Greenwich Village Chelsea Pines is a little home away from home  
P => Great value and location We are not very keen on anonimous big chain owned hotels and based on the reviews on Tripadvisor ided to give it a chance on our first visit to New York   It was a great ision  We stayed for  nights at the Debby Reynolds suite which consisted of a ently sized bedroom and a small sitting room equiped with flat TV in each room air conditioning private complete bath hairdryer refrigerator and air conditioning The location is great right between Chelsea and the Village near a lot of good restaurants and just a few steps from a multi line subway station The free wi fi  business center and continental breakfast were a much appreciated plus Staff was very nice corteous and helpful  Daniel thank you very much for your all your assistance It will definetely be our hotel in NYK  
P => It felt like being home in the great city of New York Chelsea Pines Inn is hands down the nicest hotel Ive stayed at since I moved out of the New York area four years ago  Ive stayed at a number of places since my move   and Chelsea Pines Inn was the one that felt like home   sophisticated like the city itself with a wonderful sense of style and humor in its or B movie stars an incredibly friendly staff a clean quiet room a terrific range of breakfast choices a great little garden in back for that first coffee of the day    Im a playwright and was in town to see a performance of a play of mine   and Chelsea Pines even went to the trouble of blurbing my play in their daily in house newsletter    Close to subways great restaurants the wonderful new High Line park   I couldnt have asked for a nicer place to stay    Hope to stay there again and highly recommend it  
P => This hotel had a most comfortable atmosphere with all the conveniences of home  This is a clean and comfortable hotel which offers ample self serve breakfasts included in the price  The staff are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful in all ways  There are computers available to use at all times  The location is great   accessible to public transportation and all amenities  My dhter and I had a great time  I am diabetic so having breakfast on the premises and a fridge in the room for snacks were very important to me  The only drawback would be the stairs no elevator if climbing is a problem however the staff are more than willing to help out with luggage if necessary  Ask for a lower floor is this is a concern  
P => Friendly comfortable and cool as hell This place is fantastic My girlfriend and I spent two nights here on a break from working at a camp and it was absolutely perfectThe staff were super friendly and helpful  Made us feel more than welcome and gave us a load of information on where to go in the local area including one amazing Vietnamese restaurant round the corner The rooms were very spacious and comfortable and the movie star themes were very cool and quirky  We felt very much at home and comfortable in the hotel and really enjoyed the self servicekitchen style breakfast bar and back garden  Hopefully will return to this hotel next time were in New York  
P => Great Choice for a NYC Visit We stayed here for  nights in ust   thank god the air conditioning worked  Its a terrific choice   the price given the location was excellent  Then you have the staff who were all very very nice  They were happy to advise on restaurants routes through Central Park Metropolitan Museum of Art etc It was a little surprising when we opened the door to our room when we arrived and Charlie Chaplin the cat walked out but we love cats and enjoyed patting him on the head whenever we saw him The room is typical for an urban area like NY   oddly shaped super narrow but that plus the movie posters gave it a fun funky feel  BTW we were in the Lee Remick room    The only negative thing that happened during our visit was the gas company starting construction right out the front door and below our th floor window at  AM one day  Of course the hotel had nothing to do with that   it got us out of bed and on our way for the day at least The breakfast was fine   there was a good mix of bagels muffins cereal and fruit to go along with juice and coffee  The TV was tuned to a news station so we could catch up with current events if we wanted It was great having a subway station about  feet from the front door   we each bought an unlimited ride  day ticket for  and got our moneys worth even though we were there for only   days The neighborhood felt super safe   if you head south into the Village there are a zillion restaurants to choose from in a lively setting When it was time to leave the front desk made arrangements for a car service to take us to JFK   its only a few dollars more than a taxi and a lot more comfortable I will absolutely stay here again   it was terrific 
P => Good value great location cute cat Have stayed at this Inn three times over the last ten years or so   its always been fun and great value  Its especially good if you are in your s and s and on a bit of a budget   or if if it is your first time to NY It is set in a great red brick building and has an extension at the back for breakfast and chilling out The rooms are named after various celebrities such as Rock Hudson but its all done on the right side of camp Essentially it is of course a gay Inn but friendly enough for all to feel welcome   though to be fair it is not the sort of place to go with a young family It is really close to the Metro and has some great places to eat and drink nearbye thanks to its location in ChelseaGreenwich The times I have stayed there I have always found the place to be clean  The rooms are of a good size you should pay the extra for the better rooms if you can and the facilities are good I have not been there for a few years now and I hear the prices have gone up which would be a shame and I have ked it down a bit because of this   it is still a place to go on a small medium budget as much as one can in NY It can get a bit noisy when people are coming up the stairs note   stairs no lift late but in this place it only ever seemed to add to the atmosphere  Likewise yes you can hear sirens but its in the middle of NYC   I would ask for refund if I could not hear the noise of the CityI dont know if I will ever stay there again I have different circumstances now but I have very very fond memories of my three visits there and of course of New York  What else to say The cat from here and the cat from the Brass Key in Provincetown both know how to run very good guest houses 
P => excellent accommodation I dont know what were the expectations of people that wrote a negative review on this place because we ve found a clean and cozy hotel with a courteous and pleasant staff that gave us many suggestions on restaurant and place to visit  We stayed in the quotDonna Reedquot room for three nights be its not a big room just like a lot of other places in NY    but was clean and comfortable I will recommend this place to friends that are looking for a place different from an anonymous hotel owned by big chains this is an hotel that has its own personality  
P => a delight The Chelsea Pines Inn was an excellent place to stay in every way  Perhaps the most notable aspect of this charming hotel is the delightful staff  Everyone we met was friendly and very willing to go the extra mile to be helpful  Moreover the hotel was sparkling clean and tastefully orated the location cant be beat and the breakfasts were excellent  This place is much more personable than your average hotel but more casual and enjoyable than staying in a prissy bed and breakfast  I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting New York for any purpose  
P => Definitely  our  hotel in NYC from now on My husband and I recently spent  days in NYC at The Chelsea Pines Inn  It was perfect The staff is excellent friendly amp attentive with daily newsletter that highlighted things we would have missed otherwise the location you cant beat   subway just a few steps away quick walk to the HiLine park overlooking the Hudson dont miss this Chelsea ket great restaurants etc  The rooms are quiet very clean sophisticated amp beautifully updatedbaths flat screen TV A C  amp more and they offer about every sizearrangement you could need from single rooms to neat little suites  The business center on second floor made keeping in touch with work printing maps researching the city very easy and convenient  Loved the nice touch of the kitchenbreakfast area   and the   cookie jar  I especially enjoyed being able to have coffee and breakfast on the patio outside and read the NYTimes  For some the stairs no elevator  give you pause but I found a th floor room not an issue at all and after the first day of quottrainingquot my husband actually welcomed the exercise and noticed improved conditioning each day  Of course you can stay on lower floors too  It is a great value  Cant think of a single thing to improve  If you want your nails done dry cleaningetc  plenty of great places nearby  F M Andrews Louisville KY 
P => Great Service Location  I recently enjoyed staying in a suite at the Chelsea Pines Inn  On arrival the service was excellent continued from all staff during stay and we were quickly and efficiently directed to our room  The suite is quite roomy with arate bedroom and extra television  There was plenty of room to store our luggage and the bathroom was excellent with a large shower and two basins  The room was on the th floor no lifts which was a bit of struggle after a day out exploring New York although well always a pleasure to return to  The breakfast offered was good and location excellent  There is a subway station along from the Inn and there are plenty of sights that can be visited on foot  The inn provides a computer room with free internet access and also supplies a daily newsletter with events and touring suggestions  The reception staff were also very helpful in providing information for sightseeing  I would not hesitate to recommend the Inn to other travellers and will return there on my next trip to New York  
P => The Chelsea Pines Hotel is a safe and clean place to stay in New York  The Chelsea Pines Hotel is a safe and clean place to stay in New York  All of the hotel employees went out of their way to make our first trip to the big city the best  They provided a daily listing of interesting sites and discount coupons  Their front door is just steps from the subway and the continental breakfast was well supplied  Even the hotel owner checked on us Highly recommend   
P => Loved it great value for NYC My partner and I stayed here for  nights and it was great value for NYC  When we arrived we were upgraded to a deluxe room which by new york standards was huge  There was downside it was on the th floor and there is no lift and it faced out on a busy road but thats new york  It didnt bother us too much Staff were very friendly and location is great  Id definitely stay here again  
P => Well be back A charming hotel great location and wonderful hosts   the rates were a real bargain     
P => Excellent hotel My wife and i read about the hotel on trip advisor and it certainly lived up to its reviews  The location was great with the subway only one minute away  The hotel was quiet which was great after a long day site seeing  The rooms were tidy and the cookie jar downstairs was great  The staff and Jay were extremely helpful and had excellent recommendations for things to do and money saving tips  We are looking forward to going back to New York and staying at the Chelsea Pines Inn  
P => Relax in New York I go to the big city to get away and Chelsea Pines is a great place to do that  The staff is very helpful with tips on what to see and how to get around  Go to the bookstore and get a small laminated map of the NYC subway system and you can get anywhere you want to go  I have stayed there  times and will definitely stay there for my next visit  
P => p e r f e c t we spent only one night in Manhatten after we missed a connecting flight and it was a happy coincidence that we discovered this wonderful little hotel  It is excellent value the rooms are clean and nicely orated and overall the hotel has a very pleasant ently informal atmosphere  The great staff made our short stay in NYC a great experience  We highly recommend this place  
P => Great stay as always This was my second time at the Chelsea Pines Inn and I am a totally satisfied customer  The rooms are very interesting particularly if youre a film buff  They are very clean and the beds are very comfortable  The staff is very friendly and helpful  overall its a very personal place and thats very important to me  Ill definitely be back  Tim Hauser 
P => Couldnt fault this place hope to return  This hotel is a hidden gem  The staff gave us a warm welcome and were incredibly helpful and friendly  The hotel was very clean and we were not bothered by noise  We were thrilled to stay in the Doris Day room at the back of the hotel recommended  The room was spacious and featured a huge colourful poster above the bed and lots of other fun movie prints  The ensuite was great and the sheets were fantastic Breakfasts of coffee muffins bagels and cereal were great and there was ample room to store our luggage on the final day of our stay  Nearby attractions include the High Line elevated park from a converted railway the Mac store really   it is glorious and fabulous places to eat and drink  I hope to return to the Chelsea Pines Inn   it was wonderful 
P => More stars than there are in Heaven     As visitors know finding a good and not overly expensive hotel in NYC is not an easy task  We discovered Chelsea Pines Inn through a New York Times review   a very positive one indeed  Now having been Chelsea Pines Inn guests twice wed like to share some additional positive comments  Chelsea Pines Inn successfully mixes high standard services typical of a multiple star hotel with a cosy and wed say familiar atmosphere  Standard rooms  be small but enriched by nice bathrooms colorful oration confortable beds and complimentary wi fi  The small Business Center recently added with two brand new computers and a printer represents a further improvement of the already high standard of the available services whever asked the staff is eager to help with ticket reservations suggestions or anything you mighy need  At Chelsea Pines Inn the day starts with an original and useful newsletter The Chelsea Morning slipped under your rooms door suggesting attractions shows and concerts for the day followed by a rich breakfast that you can enjoy in the kitchen or in the conservatory in a very informal atmosphere  You feel at home but at the same time the personnel is always careful and available ready to refill the serving plates where you can find bagels muffins scones and even salmon and fresh cream during the we  In conclusion do not expect the standard chain hotels features or atmosphere there is no elevator and some of the rooms might be perceived as too small but Chelsea Pines Inns slogan quotmore stars than there are in Heavenquot is definitely appropriate Whenever we leave in the taxi to the airport we start planning to come back  
P => Not as great as Id hoped    Read reviews and booked based on what Id read  It was a very friendly place but didnt have the wow factor I had imagined  Breakfast sometimes ran out the bagels are amazing and shower was cold  Wasnt the cleanest of rooms hair in bathroom  Was a bit small for a suite specifically wanted more space  Liked location although on main road so very noisey  Recommend going on High Line and Brass Monkey bar as well as lovely bars on Bleeker Street which are all nearby  
P => Cant wait to go back I picked this hotel due to its ratings on here  I loved every minute of my stay I went with my boyfriend and stayed in a standard double which was really spacious and the bed was amazingly comfortable  The themes to the rooms is really cool and the cookies and tea and coffee that you can get free all the time is a nice touch  Its so relaxing at breakfast coz you can just make whatever you want and chill out  The staff are all so friendly and helpful nothing is too much trouble for them The location is perfect for a young couple we loved wandering the streets of chelsea and greenwich village  Highlight was the safron vietnamese restaurant near the hotel which we were recommended by the staff brilliant food and pretty reasonable LOVE LOVE LOVE Im booking my next stay there now 
P => Love love love the Chelsea Pines Inn Booking a hotel based on its website it always a leap of faith   will it be any good what will the staff be like will it be in a good area etc When we arrived at the Chelsea Pines Inn I was incredibly happy with the ision we had made  Its in a fabulous location nice and close to the subway and tons of fabulous restaurants cafes and delis  Id been warned before getting to NY that the rooms would be ridiculously small but again I was pleasantly surprised to get a ent sized room with a great bathroom the shower was amazing  The hotel staff were helpful and friendly and provided great information of things to do around the area  Charlie the cat was gorgeous and is definitely worthy of a kiss and cuddle every morning Breakfast was included and was a perfect start to a day of sightseeing  Bagels coffee cereal etc were set out every morning in the kitchen  YUM The complimentary business centre had  computers and a printer which nmade it easy to look up addresses keep in touch with people at home and print off boarding passes for our next location  If you stay there dont miss out on walking the high line ask the hotel staff  It was a beautiful tranquil idyll in the middle of a bustling city and a testament to the people who worked so hard to get a disused transport corridor turned into urban greenspace Again I would heartily recommend the hotel to anyone wanting to experience a great location in a hotel that provides personal service and comfortable surrounds  
P => Why Stay Anywhere Else The Chelsea Pines Inn Is Fantastic Four years ago a colleague turned me on to the Chelsea Pines Inn and it immediately became my only choice for lodging in Manhattan  It is in a great section of the city   meat packing  Greenwich Village that is convenient for business or personal needs  The property is charming and is very well maintained  The staff including Charlie the cat are nothing less than excellent really everyone on the staff is really great  Until recently i traveled to the area for business in both Manhattan and Connecticut  Although I no longer have professional responsibilities in Manhattan I still stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn and commute to Connecticut  Yes the Chelsea Pines is that great  When it comes to the bed amp breakfast concept they do it right and better than anyone else around  I highly recommend it  I am a frequent lodger and will continue to be  Hopefully Ill run into you there 
P => Wonderful Place Wonderful People My husband and I LOVED this place  It is quite charming  The staff was so friendly and helpful  They made us feel at home right away  We had booked a standard room which we expected to be small for NYC standards but it was actually bigger than the room we stayed at during our previous visit to NYC at a popular mid town hotel which actually cost much more per night without any of the coziness the Chelsea Pines Inn provided  Even better the second day we were there the manager upgraded us to a super deluxe room at no extra charge How nice is that I instantly fell in love with our room the Jeffrey Hunter room with its blue walls and vintage movie posters  The bed was super comfy too  We had a nice sitting area with a little table and two chairs  The room had a nice sized mini fridge and a wardrobe for clothes  The private bathrooms were surprisingly large and attractively orated  Our first room had a lovely modern glass bowl sink and our second had a glass block wall for the shower  The room was impecably clean as was the entire Inn  The fact that its a walk up wasnt an issue at all for us as we got used to the excercise fairly quickly  The location is fantastic only steps away from the crosstown L train and the ACE trains  The complimentary breakfast bagels muffins doughnuts cereals yogurt juice and coffee was quite tasty and came in handy on the go  And last but certainly not least Charlie Chaplin the Inns black and white cat was always ready for a visit and scratch behind his ears  I would recommend this place highly and I cant wait to go back 
P => A great location friendly and helpful staff clean comfortable and definitely worth returning to  Close to several kets Greenwich West Village the new Promenade the Hudson River the subway and a number of super restaurants  If the New York hustle and bustle is not for you  this is your spot with very easy access to it all from a quieter neighbourhood  Thanks to Jay and his colleagues for your suggestions  
P => Terrific small hotel with lots of personality Terrific small hotel with personality  Lots of personal attention  Staff is friendly and helpful  Rooms are all different  Nice breakfast  Feels like your coming home after a busy city day or evening  Small business center allows free use of computers  Great location within walking distance to the Village and Chelsea  Subway on the corner  
P => Have stayed at the Library Hotel and the Casablanca but would choose Chelsea Pines any day Weve been to NYC several times and stayed in a variety of hotels including some that have very good reviews on Trip Advisor  However we had never stayed in the Village and this hotel appealed based on the reviews wed read and the price  We were not disappointed  We booked a standard room and asked for a high floor with a room at the back of the inn  We were given the Ann garet room which was on the th floor overlooking the back garden  It was larger than we expected and had room for  armchairs in addition to the bed  There was also a built in wardrobe safe fridge flat screen tv and i pod docking station  There was also plenty of room to strore our empty suitcases behind the armchairs  The bed was really comfy and the room was nice and quiet with no street noise being at the back and no noise from neighbouring rooms despite the inn being pretty full  Yes its a long climb up  flights of stairs but it got easier as the week progressed and helped us work off the generous free breakfasts of muffins bagels pastries fruit cereal cheese yoghurt juice tea and coffee no we didnt eat everything  The extra touches include free wifi  computers with internet access and printer also free and the excellent daily newsletter with suggestions of things to do  The inn is in a great location less than half a block from the subway station which has the ACE and L lines enabling you to travel northsouth or cross town  There are plenty of good places to eat within walking distance including the Chelsea ket which is certainly worth a look  However the absolute best thing about the inn is the staff and owners and in particular Jay and Al  Al is a real comedian and should have his own show  He was funny interesting and above all helpful  We felt very at home and were made to feel really welcome  We were sorry when our week came to an end and will certainly stay here on our next trip to the city  
P => Still the best place to stay in New York for location character and service and value I last reviewed Chelsea Pines  months ago after a great stay  I have been back  times since the latest earlier this month and would not consider anywhere else in New York  Location is ideal welcome is warm rooms are character full and clean and service is attentive  These high standards have been consistent for every visit and staying here adds a great deal to my enjoyment of my trips to New York  
P => Perfect place for NYC explorers Me and my wife stayed at Chelsea Pines Inn for a week exploring the NYC  This hotel is probably the best bang for the buck there is in NYC  Great location excellent staff small but cosy rooms service is top notch great free breakfast two free computers with i net and a nice plump cat    Hotel staff helped us with everything from directions to booking tickets for the phantom of the opera on Broadway  All positive but of course there are some minor cons such as small rooms noisy pipes from time to time and you can hear the neighbors quite well but really these tiny cons are NOT a deal breaker Rent a room here if visiting NYC Thank you Chelsea Pines Inn for a lovely stay 
P => Our stay in this hotel was extremely fantastic Specially the location Chelsea Meatpacking District and Greenwich Village on walking distance  And the subway in th with th Ave  The room was really comfortable and being a single for two was more than enough  Some other great things the Daily News a sheet of paper with proposals for the day and the breakfast incredible specially the onions bagels and the cookiesThe only thing to comment no lift  The th floor is so high specially if you do long trips walking in the city  
P => Location location location Our round the world trip brought us to NYC and the Chelsea Pines Inn  We booked after seeing it in the gay listings  All the rooms are named after movie stars and there are film posters everywhere  Very individual  Helpful staff including very cute guy on reception Our room was on the th floor we had four heavy bags and with no lift we got super fit Hotel has a slightly rough around the edges feel which makes it really quite charming Rooms immaculately clean comfortable bed free wifi aircon nice complimentary bathroom products breakfast rather sparse but fine  Dont expect to eat healthily   bagels cream cheese peanut butter muffins doughnuts and they could invest in a good coffee machine really which would make a big difference Something really good is their morning newsletter pushed under the door with ideas of things to do and whats ons  It alerted us to a fantastic evening of music at a jazz theatre overlooking Central Park  Hotel a great price for NYC and its perfectly located   right on the border of Chelsea and West Village  Lots of lovely cafes and restaurants nearby and gay nightlife close by too  We had a lovely stay  
P => Love this place I cant say enough positive things about the Chelsea Pines Inn  Ive stayed there twice and wont stay anywhere else in NYC if I can help it  The rooms are elegant comfortable and immaculate and the staff is stellar   so helpful and very friendly  As a woman traveling solo its nice to feel like the people at your hotel are keeping an eye on you and your well being  And you cant beat the location  
P => Ticks all the NYC boxes Stayed here recently for a few days with my wife and could not have picked a better location Hotel is clean and welcoming as are the staff  and you really feel that they are going the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable  After a hard travelling around the city it is nice to come back to people welcoming you back by your first names Location is superb with the subway so close that anywhere in Manhattan is  to  minutes away and JFK Airport is within an hour on the Subway  The fact that CPI is on the crossroads of  areas is good in that you can socialise expensively or as inexpensively as you choose  From high end Restaurants to proper Drinkers bars are all within  minutes walk  The lovely deli Balduccis on the corner is a good point also To sumise if you want a quiet and friendly location that gives you quick and easy access to all that NYC has to offer i defy you to find better value than the Chelsea Pines Inn  
P => Film Nostalgia in Chelsea Ive been to the Chelsea Pines twice in the past year once in ember  with my wife and once in ruary  on my own and had wonderful stays both times  The inn is a great location in Chelsea a half block from the subway and walking distance from restaurants nightlife etc  Each of the rooms are named after a star or starlet of the silver screen Ive been in the Tony Curtis and Jeff Chandler rooms and feature a set of vintage posters advertising their films  To top it off the staff is amazingly helpful and friendly  With the rooms being reasonably priced for NYC where can you go wrong 
P => Best place to stay in NYC Dont waste your time searching hours for a good quality hotel because Chelsea Pines Inn will cater for your needs  For the past  years that I have been traveling to New York I have continuously had the pleasure of staying at Chelsea Pines Inn  I could if I wish stay at any hotel in NYC but I like to call Chelsea Pines Inn my home from home  The basics are all covered a clean hotel quality furnishings rooms are of a pleasant size with facilities such as Satellite TV a multitude of TV channels and WiFi  Lets not forget how each room is themed on famous Hollywood names each stylishly accessorized with original film posters depicting the star in question  Each morning a wonderful selection of muffins and other breakfast delicacies greet you including tea and coffee  The staff at Chelsea Pines Inn are fantastic no task is too great they are always on hand to help  The extra touches also go a long way such as a morning newsletter providing information on local events and attractions including a heads up on the weather  Luxury toiletries in the bathrooms quality linens provided along with extra bedding if needed some rooms equipped with a arate kitchen  seating area whilst each room in the hotel is tastefully orated  For any visitor to New York a stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn should certainly be considered  The hotel is situated within walking distance of many attractions including SoHo Greenwich Village Meatpacking District and the Hudson River Park which is great for jogging enthusiasts like myself or just chilling and watching the world go by  Jay the owner alongside with Al Rich the staff will certainly help you get the best out of your trip to NYC whilst providing you with good value quality accommodation whom if you are like me will consider calling Chelsea Pines your second home Sammual James   McLoughlin 
P => Love this Place   Definitely will come Back I loved this place   It was our first trip to New York and we heard alot of mixed reviews about some of the hotels in New York Found the Chelsea Pines inn on tripAdvisor and I am happy to say its a Great place to stay  We stayed in the quotJeff Chandlerquot room  Room was quite compact but really cool and well laid out and had everthing we needed definitely added to the enjoyment of our trip  Staff are really friendly and Helpful place is really clean    And the free buffet Breakfast is delish and a nice little perk Really nice location Quiet and quite central   Subway on the corner      For when you get lazy  Love the cookies and coffee all day another nice little perk      Definitely will be staying here again when we are going back to New York this ober  
P => Wonderful value for money My boyfriend and I stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn the week before Christmas and we had a wonderful time The atmosphere is very homey complete with a friendly cuddly cat  The staff were superb  We got a lot of help with directions and travel information in addition to some very helpful recommendations for things to see and do  We would never have known to go to Top of the Rock instead of the Empire State Building for great panoramic views And the pizza place they recommended was perfect  I have seen other reviewers complain that the rooms are small but look guys this is New York and no room is going to be that big on an average persons budget  Though the room we were in was big enough I thought  Who needs a big room when the city is where we all want to be anyway I think Chelsea Pines Inn makes up for that inevitability with little touches like a fresh and varied breakfast menu a daily print out of events and weather information delivered to your room lovely whimsical or and a general ambience of goodwill and hospitality  We will certainly be returning on our next trip to NYC Ive already recommended it to friends  
P => Loved The Fresh Bagels at the Chelsea Pines My wife and I recently stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn and found it to be a great experience  The location is great for subway travel as well as walking to area locations  The staff was top notch and Charlie the cat added to the pleasant atmosphere  The continental breakfast which consisted of coffee juice fresh bagels and lox just to name a few items was superb and exceeded our expectations  
P => Great stay for our Honeymoon We found Chelsea Pines on the recommendation of Pauline Frommers NYC See More Spend Less guide  We were beyond pleased with our choice The location is great   just half a block from the subway station at th St amp th Ave  We took the subway everywhere we went so this was a huge plus  The accomodations were kept very clean and the room we had for most of our stay a superior deluxe was quite spacious  We moved to a superior standard for our last night and even it was a pretty ent size  Both rooms had a mini fridge a flat screen TV and an iPod dock on the alarm clock  Very nice The staff was very friendly and always ready to help  And the breakfast was quite good  We ate it every day of our trip except for one  The homemade bread each morning was a special treat  I cant say enough great things about Chelsea Pines Inn   we scored a home run on this choice and I wouldnt think of staying anywhere else in NYC  The price was an amazing value as well  Highly recommended 
P => Really loved this hotel during our Christmas visit to NYC We recently stayed at this hotel and had a really great time  It is very conveniently situated and great value for money  I visit New York quite a bit and will from now on stay hereWell recommended  
P => great location at good price My first stay in this hotel was  years ago and I was nicely surprised by the recent makeover  good jobThe staff was very helpful and friendly the room was good size with a nice and modern bathroom the complementary breakfast was much better than average and the price for Manhattan  Chelsea Meatpackers  is a bargain   
P => Very nice place to stay during visit to NYC Very nicecharming and well located hotel in NYC  Rooms are very niceclean and small but as Manhattan hotels average  Staff is correcthelpfulf and location is really great in a nice neighbourhood safe to go out at night and very close to underground station  It is gay friendly hotelbut as we were hetero couple no problems during our stay it is open for everyone Rooms are very original and berakfast complete one is included  
P => Adorable Inn and a Great Location The Chelsea Pines Inn is adorable has a great location for walking or hopping the subway and is very reasonably priced  Rooms are on the small side but the sheets and towels are great  The staff is super 
P => Perfect hotel in the perfect location My husband and I spent three nights at the Chelsea PInes Inn on a long weekend break to New York   we loved it and heartily recommend it  The location is perfect if you want to be in walking distance of all the major sights of Manhattan but away from the tourist rabble and high rise madness of midtown  The location between the Chelsea neighbourhood above the Meatpacking district next door and Greenwich Village just below is great for strolling to lovely restaurants and bars in the evening and experiencing a bit more of local life We stayed in Albert Finney room which was located on the ground floor so no stairs and right by the complimentary hot drinks and cookies available all day until pm   perfect as I am six months pregnant The room was spacious the bed super comfy and the bathroom well equipped clean and stylish  We loved our visits from Charlie Chaplin the resident cat The staff are what really make the hotel special for New York   nothing was too much trouble and they were really friendly without being at all intrusive   they struck the right balance  Each morning you get Chelsea Morning delivered under your door which is a selection of suggestions of whats on that day in the city   a nice touch to peruse as youre enjoying the yummy complimentary breakfast including home made bread and the worlds largest bagels  Well be back 
P => Great Stay Great hotel very nice room good breakfast  Great service and a fantastic connection to the public transportation  We will stay at this hotel all the times we travel to New York in the future  Peter and Kiki 
P => What a gem A friend at the Times suggested two places my wife and I opted for Chelsea after checking their websites and some other reviews  The owner and staff were fantastic Given our length of stay  d our request for quiet and our ages s we were assigned the Doris Day room and survived a hike up a couple of flights of stairs to a quiet clean and commodious by NY stds room  Need tickets No problem They found excellent seats for Millers All my sons and Spring Awakening at half price suggested excellent restaurants nearby always responded to our requests  The breakfast repast was always very good including lox and cheese on a couple of days  All in all we would not hesitate to recommend this spot to others or stay there again  Great location great digs great people  Oh and a bit of a warning  This place is not perfect but then theres always the Waldorf Personally we prefer the Chelsea  
P => Excellent location and helpful staff Excellent location and helpful staff Chelsea Pines is a great place to rest your head during you New York visit  Located  stops from Time Square walking distance to the Meat Packing district and Greenwich Village  Very central great for tourists  The staff is also very friendly and kind helping us make the most of our visit  They offered excellent dining recommendations and assisted with all of our quottouristquot needs  The owner is a gem  
P => Home away from home If you like spending time in Chelsea the Village and the Meat Packing District this is your best choice  Great price and the friendliest staff in town   and an adorable house cat  Very nice selection for the complimentary breakfast  The rooms are small and youll need to climb stairs but if you are up for that look no further  Well be back soon 
P => Good location nice staff but overall disappointing the hotel is in a great location and the staff were very nice  however i couldnt help but be a little bit disappinted by the whole experience  i think some rooms have been refurbished the reception definitely looks nice and new but ours certainly wasnt  we stayed in the lesley caron room on the top floor and while it was okay it was just that okay  while the room was reasonably clean the or is a bit old and drab especially the sink area   the mini fridge was ancient we had to unplug it complained so much  the shower kept going from hot to cold the air conditioning made a clunking noise that made a good nights sleep impossible and if you open the window you get lots of traffic noise form th street plus mosquitos  our room wasnt cleanred one day at all  so all in all it was ok and since prices in NY are so crazy probably good value for money even though its not cheap at all but we wont stay here again  
P => RECOMMENDED  Tripadvisor member AntwerpBelgiumWe enjoyed our stay in this hotel very muchThe location is just exelent with the subways nearbye  We will book in this hotel again but probably ask for a room not higher than the third floor due to lack of an alivator The room and the bathroom is clean and the bed comfortable The staff is very friendly and will not hesitate to help you to book an event or explaine how to get somewhere  And       they serve breakfast  
P => Plesant friendly comfortable Chelsea Pines Inn is a small hotel with a few limitations because of its size and the age of the building   First the one con No elevator Now the pros You get a considerable discount for staying on one of the upper floors The staff is among the most helpful and friendly at any hotel I have stayed at in NYC  They try to accommodate every request will reserve restaurants for you book theater tickets and find discounts if any are available and finally book a cab to get you back to the airport when you leave  And you won t want to leave they really make your stay special and their assistance in getting around the city and finding things to do is pricelessThe rooms are well appointed but a bit small as to be expected at an older NYC hotel  All the rooms are non smoking rooms but there is a small outside area where you can smoke  Our room was cleaned daily and was always fresh  Apparently each one is named after a movie star and ours was orated with posters featuring that star  I believe that the posters are originals not copies Breakfast was self serve continental with breads pastries cereals juice coffee tea etc  Unlike some places they kept it open until around AM which was great as we were out late every day and got up late  Coffee was available all the time While not cheap by most standards the price was much less than any other place we looked at in the area so I guess it was a  bargain  but boy are hotel rooms pricy in NYC  We will definitely stay here for our next visit to New York  
P => Fantastic find in New York  I thought I would let you all know that there is a wonderful hotel in New York in the fashionable Chelsea area of the Meat Packing District  The staff are brilliant especially Shaun Daniel and Al and were always so helpful and polite  The hotel itself was spotlessly clean and recently refurbished to a lovely standard  We had a great time in New York and they made that stay even better nothing was too much trouble  In the past this hotel has been predominantly known for its high percentage of gay guests and while they still do have some gay paying guests they have all other types of couples too myself and my Husband was there with my In laws and their were varied types of couples staying and of all ages so please do not stereotype your thinking because you will be missing out on a great place to stay when in New York Keep it up guys   this is what hotels are supposed to be like       
P => Great location not so great hotel We stayed here in ust  and we loved the location  The hotel is just near a subway station and a few minutes walk away from the West Village wich we LOVED  There are some great restaurants and shops in the area  But the hotel itself couldnt live up to our expectations  The owner Jay was really nice and helpfull but all of the other staff seemed bored werent really helpfull and didnt have humor AT ALL  Also there was only cold water coming out of the shower in the mornings  Because of that they gave us our last night free of charge that was really nice  The rooms werent always cleaned and sometimes there was an ackward smell in the small room  All in all it was an OK hotel on a great location  If we could come to NY again I think we would go to another hotel  
P => Great location Hotel is in a very good location   away from all the tourist traps  Close to Union Square and the Meat Packing District and Balduccis is right around the corner excellent meat deli there by the way  The rooms are okay   nothing special and not always the cleanest either in our experience  There were days when the toilet wasnt cleaned and I dont think they even look under the bed so be you shouldnt either  The breakfast area is a nice touch especially the courtyard at back and most of the staff are pretty friendly  Not sure if Id stay here again be for one or two nights max  Not terrible but nothing too special either  
P => Chelsea Pines made our stay Chelsea Pines was amazing  The rooms were fun spacious enough for two and the staff was very accommodating  The continental breakfast was great each day they offered a plethora of fooddrinks which included fresh fruit bagels donuts cereal juices hot tea coffee  Charlie the resident feline was an absolute sweetheart and a bit of a ham  Great value clean rooms fantastic Manhattan location subway right on the corner     another subway with a lot of other lines at union square was only a few blocks down th  Its really hard for me to sum how impressed we were in words  Staying at Chelsea Pines really did make our trip  I will say right now that the Inn is not suitable for all types There are a lot of stairs if you have a top floor room and there is no elevatorlift  This was not a problem for me but if you do not like stairs or cannot easily get up stairs on your own this  not be the place for you  As for the man with the newborn a stay here  have been do able for your family but it certainly would have been difficult  Im sure the staff was trying to inform you of that before you came to stay  They were MORE than helpful if I ever had a question or needed a roll of toilet paper  
P => Great hotel worthy of its rating on here I chose the Chelsea Pines Inn for the New York leg of my honeymoon trip after reading such good reviews of it on Trip Advisor  We stayed for four nights and I was really pleased with the choice that I made We stayed in the Lee Remick room which was clean and very comfortable and like all the rooms at the hotel had cool movie posters for oration  It was on the fourth floor with a nice view of the street as other reviewers have mentioned there is no lift at this hotel so there were quite a lot of stairs to climb but I was aware of that in advance so it was fine  The street wasnt particularly noisy and as we were up quite high we were never bothered by the traffic It was very hot and humid in the city during our stay but the air conditioning worked very well and so it was very pleasant in our room  Breakfast was nice kind of Americancontinental with a range of muffins and bagels breads cereals etc  You could also get tea coffee ice and cookies from the breakfast area at any time during the day which meant you didnt miss having tea making facilities in your room The hotel was very quiet I dont think they encourage children there which suited us very well  I heard no noise from any other rooms or even from people passing in the corridor The staff were lovely and very helpful  We had no problems at all with arriving late about pm and they were able to give us lots of useful information on where to go and what to do in the city My only criticism would be that our room often wasnt made up until about pm which meant when we came back in the afternoon we sometimes had to wait while they finished it  This wasnt really a problem and might have been because they start on the lower floors and work up  We never had to wait more than about  minutes anyway so by the time wed got a drink downstairs it was fine The location is good as it is close to a subway station and if you dont mind walking you can get to Times Square in about half an hour  There are lots of restaurants nearby and the gay bars of Chelsea and the West Village are within easy walking distance I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and if I came back to New York would definitely try to book here again  It really does deserve all the good reviews its had on here Thank you Chelsea Pines 
P => Its great I stayed at the chelsea pines for one week with my best mate we are from englandThe general areas of the hotel are exremely clean and fresh the breakfast was good   self service in kitchen to the rear of the property We stayed in a budget room and each room is based upon a theatre show I think       our room had a big yellow stripe thing accross the wall from memory Yellow brick road The staff were very polite and really helpful  We spoke at length to one of them blonde s skinny and he was always answering our questions Its location is good a  minute walk into town and the hotel are always happy to book your taxis for airport runs etc Would recommend it no problem 
P => Chelsea Pines Inn is a great little hotel with a fantastic location We stayed for a week last e  The hotel is truly wonderful great rooms orated with a movie theme every room a different moviestar very funny  The rooms are large for NY  Our room was on the backside and it was absolutely QUIET really great One of the best things about the hotel is its location    First of all it is on the edge of Chelsea and West Village close to the hip Meatpacking district theres even an Apple Store on the corner so theres plenty to do and see and even more to eat    But equally important it is literally  minutes from a subway station that has lines both going north south but also east west which means that it becomes really easy to go anywhere in Manhattan really quick  Jay Lesiger the owner and a very nice man gave us the great suggestion to get a  week metro card for     Outstanding value  And Jay will prove to be a great help in pointing out things to do see and eat in the area and the city  I truly recommend the Chelsea Pines Hotel for anyone who would like something else than a Times Square Large Impersonal Hotel Chain Hotel Mike from Belgium 
P => Gem in NYC We just returned from an overnight at The Chelsea Pines in in NYC  We were attending a concert at the Hiro Ballroom in The itime Hotel and couldnt afford a room there  So we started doing some research to find something more reasonable  We came across CPI from a map quest search for hotels close to the concert venue  The Hotel was spotless very tasteful exceptionally welcoming a plus for us since we dont know NYC very well and felt a little overwhelmed  Each room has a movie star theme  But its nothing gaudy or tacky  In our room we stayed in Room  the Tony Curtis room there was a Tony Curtis gold star on the door and it was orated with very cool framed movie posters from his films  The bed was very comfy the AC worked perfectly the towels were heavenly the toiletries were exceptional the room was clean and comfortable there was a safe and a fridge very nice TV with cable and free wi fi access  Some rooms the Economy rooms share a toilet but have privates showers  Our room was a Deluxe Superior and had a complete private bathroom  Your stay includes a great continental breakfast in a cute kitchen area and you have access to coffee tea cookies etc at all hours  Also there is a cute veranda for outdoor seating  I should mention that while NYC is obviously noisy the CPI was totally quiet from the moment we walked in the front door  I dont know if its a noise proof door or what but we were very impressed  Our room was equally quiet although we were aware of people using the hallway toilets during the night  The CPI is also easy walking distance to lots of great restaurants bars and shops  We were disappointed we only had one night thereThe Chelsea Pines Inn is a gay hotel although they welcome all orientations  My husband and I obviously not gay felt completely comfortable and welcomed by everyone we encountered  We will absolutely stay at The Chelsea Pines Inn again when we make it back to NYC 
P => Absolutely amazing What a fantastic little hotel The staff were very friendly   you might be mistaken to think you were somewhere else but New York The room was spacious and clean  The breakfast was good and the all day coffee and cookies was a nice treat  The subway is also very close to the hotel  I stayed here for four nights that seemed to go by so quickly  I will definitely be back here again soon 
P => great stay Ideal location very very close to subway station breakfast provided for free room very small but doable for a few nights and to be expected from new york  Staff very friendly and helpful  
P => What a delight We stayed nine nights at Chelsea Pines so we had ample opportunity to experience the many facets of hotel life  The quiet pleasant respectful atmosphere of the hotel made it a nice place to quotcome home to quot With excellent access to all lines on the subway Broadway and the Financial District are no more than  minutes away  Two blocks away on th Ave  are many of the hottest night spots in the city but Chelsea Pines remains a calm amidst the storm  We loved the neighborhood away from the roaring madness of Times Square but with easy access if we chose to go there  I cant say that I loved climbing two flights of stairs but it was good for me and having Charlie the Cat greet us during most trips made the climb a little more effortless  The staff offered help with luggage so that was not a problem  The movie theme of each room is playful and adds to the ambience  The rooms were spotless each day and the staff was quick to offer help with any needs  
P => Good location value To give some frame of reference for my review When my wife and I travel especially in Europe we tend to stay in small hotels and pensions independently owned and without most amenities  That is the type of establishment to expect with the Chelsea Pines Inn  It is run by a friendly staff that happily held our bags while we explored the city and immediately addressed any small concerns that arose  The hotel is located in Chelsea less than a block from a subway station A C E and L lines and within an easy walk to Greenwich Village and Soho  The breakfast mainly consisted of breads bagels and the like with coffee milk and juice but the all day cookie jars as well as a welcome candy dish added a nice touch of hospitality  Before I go any further I should mention that we stayed in their least expensive room on the th floor  That is important for two reasons One the hotel has no elevator  After a day of walking the steps are not nearly as welcome as the candy dish  Second as we walked past rooms being cleaned many looked cleaner larger and more well kept than ours  That being said it does seem fair to judge a hotel based on the accommodations they offer and ours were slightly below average in terms of cleanliness or and comfort for this type of hotel when compared to other cities this was my first time at this type of hotel within the City so I have no direct comparison  The lobby and the convention of naming rooms after old Hollywood stars implies a hip atmosphere that got nowhere near our room  Institutional green walls and an old flat pack cabinet were the interior orating  But again we didnt have to spend much money the place felt safe the staff was friendly and we didnt vacation in New York to hang out in our hotel room  When all is said and done it did the job as well as was needed  
P => Home away from home at the Chelsea Pines Inn The Chelsea Pines Inn wonderfully located on West th St in NYC has got all the details right  The staff are personable and friendly yet there is a sense of valued privacy for all  The rooms have movie star themes for instance I was in the Kim ack room complete with movie posters and a star on the door  Towells are thick beds are very comfortable the lighting is flatteringly adjustable and the vintage of the building allows great audial privacy thick walls and floors  In other hotels I can often hear my neighbors sneeze shower etc It is a walk up no lift so do be prepared to schlep your bags up the stairs  Coffee and freshly baked breads are offered each morning  An amusing and informative news sheet Chelsea Morning News is slipped under your door each dawn with all the current details of importance weather local eatingdrinkinggathering establishments events in the city  I found this daily missive a very thoughtful touch The location is ideal close to subways easy walking distance to Chelsea Greenwich Village Chelsea Piers  There is even a movie star cat Charlie Chaplin in black and white only 
P => Great stay We loved our stay in the Chelsea Pines Inn  It is in a convenient part of town on th Street between th and th Aves within walking distance of Soho Greenwich Village etc and very close to a subway stop  The hotel itself is clean and our room the Ann gret room had everything we needed safe ironing board aircon ipod charger etc  The staff were friendly and helpful and the complimentary breakfast was a bonus  The only downside was the staircase   be prepared to trudge up the stairs with your luggage unless you request amp pay more for a lower floor Overall though we had a great stay for the price and would stop here again  
P => Perfect Value Perfect Place This place is amazing  We just stayed in the Tony Curtis room  It had a bathroom and was very clean and wonderful  The directions to and from the Inn were helpful and its centrally located and easy to get to  I found all the staff friendly and helpful  We had a lot of great recommendations for restaurants and things to do  The continental breakfast was a life saver and very hearty and good  The rooms are small but we didnt mind that  They were really clean however and there was air conditioning that worked well along with big windows that opened  Our room was on the nd floor in the back and really perfect  We had a view of the garden and it was quiet and really wonderful  We were sad to come home Well definately return again  
P => Lovely Hotel in the Heart of The City This hotel is such good value and much better than the traditional tourist hotels  The location is excellent and you actually feel that you are staying in the real NY  The rooms were spotless and very comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful  One minor complaint was a lack of breakfast one morning but this is easily forgiven considering the selection every other day  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in a small comfortable hotel at a great value price  
P => A Bargain at Twice the Price CPI is my favorite inn in NYC  Everyone is welcome and the diversity of visitors having morning coffee in the breakfast room can be as interactive of an event as you want    theres no forcing of dialogue as in some BampBs  Fresh pastry and bagels are brought in every morning and its well attended to by staff therefore there arent crumbs banana peels and used mugs ever competing for space at a table  The owner Jay even makes fresh bread every morning The staff is extremely kind generous and helpful and the rooms are elegant in their simplicity and clean clean clean  The neighborhood is full of restaurants and conveniences and the property is less than a block away from the subway  CPI is a wonderful place to call home in the city    and upon returning from a day at work or touring there are chocolates cookies and tea  There is no elevator so if you have a lot of luggage the staff will assist or if you carry your own bags this can ameliorate any guilt after discovering those bottomless cookie and chocolate jars  Ive stayed in almost every room in the inn and each one is a retro treat with movie posters from ages past  Rooms facing the street have white noise machines which block well most ambient noise  The guest rooms across from the bathrooms can be a bit noisy though but it is overall a very quiet inn thats personalized but not intrusive in its service  
P => Excellent location good value neutral service The location at the confluence of two or three intriguing neighborhoods spitting distance from subway stations   is ideal  It was even pretty quiet at night our room did not face the street  The patrons were all grown up well behaved types so no partying sounds  A local daycare lets the kids out to play at about AM    its a nice noise to wake up to I think they  have remodeled recently as I did not notice any of the shabbiness that previous reviewers mentioned  My husband did say he thought it was a little rough around the edges though  Yes when you enter the lobby there is a little mustiness    I think there  be dryers on site that dont vent so well though Im not sure  But the upstairs rooms climbing  flights a few times a day is not bad as long as you know what youre in for were bone dry There were great elements    quality beds excellent sheets  Mini fridge without any of the usual expensive impulse snacks  Varied fare at the continental breakfast  Thoughtful listing of three eventslocations of note slipped by elves under the door each night There were some lacks    no hooks towel racks or phone books  Not a big deal but those things would have made an extended stay a little easier for us  Small spaces of course so there was some creative bathroom fixture placement    dont be too obese if you expect fit in certain important bathroom nichesThe guys who cleaned the rooms were friendly and genuine  The guys who worked the desk were unfailingly polite patient and helpful  In general though there was not a warm vibe  It was kind of like    efficient waiters  Which some guests will be very happy with certainly  But I see that at least one other previous reviewer noted there is little chatter between guests or between guests and staff  be this is just NYC and Im a closet Minnesotan I think that the campy or made me expect a little more   chatty casual interaction human warmth give and take lhter One owner went out of his way to help us once  The other owner well    he made me feel as if I was in his way during his day at his hotel a few times  Like I was in his living room In general I would describe the tenor of the service as reserved   or standoffish depending on what you like for interaction during your vacation It did bother me a little that no women seemed to work at the hotel  It was not an  exclusively  gay male clientele so why the apparent lack of women employeesDefinitely book a stay if you want a ent value at a great location a seamless NYC stay  After all who wants to spend much time in the hotel room in that city Id think twice if you are a single person travelling alone wanting to make friendly connections with people  Go to Toronto  
P => Great Hotel We stayed here for a short break and I would highly recommend it  The complimentry brekkie in the morning is a nice touch and a great way to mingle with the other travellers Its not as central as you would like if you are looking to be in the middle of it all  But it has an underground station just on the corner so your set for transport  The hotel itself is lovely the rooms are snug but clean  The guy on reception his name was Rickie Poe hope I have the spelling right was a real character so friendly and was great for information he really made our stay in the little jewel called Chelsea Pines well worth it  
P => would not again Ive stayed at a few gay hotels Barcelona Phoenix San Francisco and they all had more atmosphere than this one  If I had it to do over again I would stay at one of the hotels in the area that lists itself as gay friendly  I feel as though I paid for the privilege of being in a gay owned hotel    like it was a tax Granted the guy at the desk upon arrival was very welcoming even entertaining  I had the Rock Hudson room on the th floor  Didnt mind the climb but didnt much appreciate each day having to step over the vacuum cleaner stored right outside my door  And gazing at the extension ladder hung on the stairwell wall  I think for the price there are better places As for it being a gay hotel compared to the others where Ive stayed this one didnt have much gay atmosphere  Other than the  friends I traveled with and we stayed there on the high recommendation of one of them no one else seemed interested in engaging in any conversation or even acknowledgement As in another review the Rock Hudon room had a double bed up against the window and a single against the wall  I used the single as a suitcase rack but the doublesingle combination reminded me of some inexpensive family rooms one would find in London or other parts of Europe    a bit like a dorm room  In all fairness no street noise though My biggest complaint we were there in hot early tember was the the air con unit sump pump kicking on and off with a thud every  seconds or so and even when I turned my unit off the unit for the next room over still clicked on and off noticeably all night long  Mentioning this to the front desk got absolutely no acknowledgement other than Yeah thats the air con unit  Others have mentioned it too  Too much money for no atmosphere  
P => Loved it What a sweet hotel The staff were so helpful and friendly and we loved the bagel breakfast  Our room was spacious and funky   only problem was that the shower cubicle leaked a bit and made the room smell a bit damp  Otherwise we loved the area too and found it very convenient for Greenwich and other cool areas  Would deffo stay here again  
P => Great Place we were recommended the chelsea pines by two friends who are regular guests   it was really superb  Greta location for subway to all parts of NY as well as being close to the Village and Chelsea districts The room was great   lots of space we had a superior deluxe on nd floor The staff were all friendly and the inclusive breakfast and all day coffee and cookies was a nice touch Will definately return 
P => Would Return My bf and i stayed in  last year and was very happy with everything apart from Housekeeping as our Deluxe room was only cleaned twice in a week The other problem was the noise if you stay on the ground floorwe had the Albert Finney room next to the Kitchen and the staff are very noisy at midnight banging plates and getting breakfast ready and then again each morning was noisy The room was clean shabby chic  Bathroom was boiling all the time but clean and nice Nice tvnice wardrobe but small and with all our shopping we soon packed the room full of all those bargains Never had breakfast only the odd cookie and tea we are returning again this   as it was all in all pretty great Staff were friendly  
P => Brilliant We stayed for five nights in the Chelsea Pines Inn for our first trip to New York  We were given a warm welcome and love our Tony Curtis themed bedroom  Facilities were clean staff were very friendly and the breakfast was great  I would recommend this place to anyone Reasonably priced for a great location and fantastic service 
P => Great hotel great location lovely breakfast I stayed here in   with a group of friends and my husband  We were in the Debbie Reynolds room on the rd floor  The room was warm a fairly ent size for NYC and the bathroom was really nice  Rooms were cleaned daily and you also got a newsletter giving ideas of things to do every day  The breakfasts were sensational Huge muffins bagels cream cheese smoked salmon yogurts teacoffee doughnuts   very delicious and filling  Teacoffee and cookies were also available all day which was nice when you came in from a long days shopping  The guys who own the hotel were really friendly and gave some great recommendations for restaurants in the area  A couple of the staff werent so helpful but on the whole I found them pretty good  The hotels location is really great   right on the corner of th Av and th St   really handy for the subway and shopping  We had friends in a  person room on the th floor which was also pretty nice and a deluxe room on the th floor which had a arate area with a table and a much bigger bedroom  The stairs were quite a challenge with the suitcases but really not an issue   you need something to help you work off the breakfast every dayThis was my second trip to NYC and I think that value for money wise you really cant do much better than this place  
P => A little rough round the edges but charming with it My boyfriend and I had  nights in the Chelsea Pines at the end of a   month roadtrip round the US  Our dream had been to end the trip in style with a luxury stay in a trendy NY boutique hotel but lack of funds and the mistake of arriving the day after Thanksgiving somewhat put paid to that  We had a lot of trouble even finding a hotel that had rooms for less than  a night but luckily the Chelsea Pines came to the rescue  We had  nights in an Economy room on the th floor and then switched to a more expensive room on the th floor  The Economy room was adequate although pretty cramped and a little frayed around the edges  The worst thing was the shower curtain which looked as if it had been there unwashed for a good few years   in which time it had got pretty stained and mouldy at the bottom The room or was also a little random although we loved the film posters a theme which is continued throughout the hotel  The skirting boards and the sides of cupboards all had metal checkerboard which is an unusual style of or to say the least The more luxurious room we had for the last two nights was great   much more spacious with a arate tiled entrance area off of which was the bathroom and much nicer or and furnishings overall  Being on the th floor though it did take it out of us getting up and down those stairs The communal areas of the inn did suffer slightly from being a little shabby and not quite as clean as you might expect   they had a bit of a musty smell which  have been down to the resident cat  However the breakfast area was very nice and as the other reviewers have said a ent spread for brekkie with great movie themed plates Staff were on the whole friendly and helpful especially the managers  One or two of the more ior staff were a little surly but we put it down to the early starts  Overall the whole atmosphere was very laid back and guests are left to their own devices The fantastic location is the best thing of all about the inn with a subway station practically next door and Chelsea Soho the Village Meatpacking district etc all short walks away  Some great thai restaurants up th Ave and great bars and pricier restaurants in the Meatpacking Overall we had a pleasant time here and the friendliness and location made up for the slightly ramshackle nature of the place  
P => Great location  Stayed here for  nights in ember  We stayed in the Rock Hudson room on the top th floor which was a bit of a slog even without luggage It was one of the deluxe rooms and I think the reason for this was the space really  It had a double amp a single bed the typical quirky film related or as has been mentioned a flat screen TV and an ipod dock  There was also a fridge in the hallway which we didnt use but could be handy  The room was nice comfortable and felt spacious  It was front facing though so we bought earplugs as not used to city noise If you were in one of the rooms at the back you would probably be fine though  The bathroom could have done with a bit of reation but Im sure the owners know that  It was all a bit old amp worn although everything worked fine  I wouldnt really have wanted to take a bth though  Breakfast was good with plenty of variety and plenty of everythingThe staff were friendly particularly the managersowners  We did ask one guy about the best way to get to Newark we had arrived at JFK and he was spectacularly unhelpful but went back later when one of the managers was on the desk and he was very helpful and booked a Carmel car to take us there As everyone has said the location is excellent very near the subway and places to eat  Less than  minutes from Bleecker street  If youre looking for places to eat nearby the Italian they recommend is good and good value as is the Spanish resturant Centro Nacional down the street and Mi Cocina on e Street  mins away Only criticism   could be a bit cleaner  I think they need a new vacuum cleaner as theirs isnt really doing the best jobAll in all I would say for the space you get breakfast amp location plus the relaxed amp friendly atmosphere its great value  
P => kept me toasty in chilly NYC I just got back from a  night stay at Chelsea Pines and really liked it  The service was really wonderful the bed comfy and there was no chance we would be cold on those  degree evenings as the room was always warm and the bed sufficiently dressed  Perfect location entertaining or great TV selection  Subway access was jut a few steps away as well as a Balduccis for all our gourmet snacking needs  Chelsea ket also at the opposite end of the block  Neighborhood was excellent and a short walk to the West Village and Magnolia Bakery Would stay again and recommend it to like minded casual laid back NYC visitors Oh   and Charlie the cat was a sweetheart 
P => A Good Deal for NYC but Average I was in New York City for a couple of days to see friends and I was looking for a place     that was clean and comfortable  My room at the Chelsea Pines was reasonably cute it looked like a tiny East Village studio minus kitchen  I never quite felt comfortable there though  The carpet wasnt quite clean enough for me to walk around barefoot the bed was obviously years old though not horrendously uncomfortable  The hotel does however have an exceptional location near many subway lines  After this experience I realize that on my next trip to New York I need to bite the bullet and pay  for a room in which I will feel comfortable  
P => enjoyed and wud stay again we stayed   for  nights having booked directly with the hotel the staff where really helpful and when i emailed them prior to staying asking for some advice they responded straight away  during our stay they continued to be really helpful and always acknowledged us when we were coming and going we stayed on the rd floor  which made me out of breath each time but i knew that when i booked it  the staff took our bags up and brought them down at the end of our stay  the room was nice a fridge which was really useful because there is a amazing deli on the corner a little noisy but so is everywhere in NYThe location brilliant subway on the corner on th and th  i so lov saying that it makes me sound as if i know what im talking about  Greenwich village round the corner nice walk to  mins  to Times square etcBreakfast was lovely very relaxed from   i think breads  different one each day  muffins donuts ect and smoked salmon for the bagels at the wend  the bfast bar was nice during the day as well as there was coffee and biscuits throughout the day and plates and glasses if you wanted to eat take out  the deli was amazing and we couldnt miss the opportunity at least one night overall really nice what made in special the customer service and Charlie the Cat 
P => Excellent value for such a popular location For  a night this property was a good deal  We had a Superior Deluxe on the second floor  The railroad car shaped room had adequate space for the two of us and our luggage  But as their website clearly states this is a converted  story brownstone with no elevator and the stairs are quite narrow and steep  If one of the attendants carries your luggage to and from your room be sure to tip him well  He will have earned it  The bath was clean but tiny  no sharing  The shower was a arate glass brick enclosure around the corner in the sitting area  The bed was extremely comfortable and our room facing the back was very quiet  The central air worked perfectly but it was nice to be able to open the window for fresh air  The quotsitting areaquot was spartan with a small round table that barely held a laptop and the lamp  The  metal chairs could have used cushions but at least the the free wireless was very fast  Each morning one of us would fetch a muffin and coffee from the kitchen downstairs and both were fresh and tasty  Everyone on the staff was courteous and helpful and it was great to have someone at the desk  hrs  If you are comfortable with B amp Bs you should like this place and although it is not particularly quotbotiquequot or plush it does have character  When  and  star hotel rooms that week before the NY athon were going for  it was a find  And having Balduccis and the Chelsea ket at opposite ends of the block added to the experience  With superb flights to and from Seattle on Jet Blue and excellent towncar service fromto JFK by Carmel it was a wonderful  days  And we saw Xandu on Broadway twice  Go youll love it  
P => Home from Home I loved this hotel I arrived after an  hour journey from Atlanta  Its just a short walk from Wth Street station and was an welcome oasis  Also close to the Village Richard on reception was very welcoming knowing who I was as I came through the door exhausted  I was staying in the Tony Curtis room at the back of the hotel  Its a standard room with bathroom  It was small but I loved it   very homely There is no lift so not ideal ias you have to carry your own bags Its so often the people that make or break a stay and the staff here was so welcoming  I had a quick run in with the guy who looks like the uncle from The Sopranos when I lost my room key but he was only looking after my own security Continental breakfast was included and is taken in the small room at the back  Its small and I couldnt find a table to myself and not feeling sociable at that time of day I had breakfast at Balduccis on the corner Starbucks and the corner diner on different morningsI cant recommend this place enough and Id like to stay there again on my next visit  
P => Great location too    The person we spoke to when booking was very helpful and informative even offering travel advice for other parts of our extended visit to the east coast The room was perfectly prepared and the housekeeping for the  nights we stayed first rate  The oration was completely charateristic of the unusual style and or chosen for the hotel One expects a NYC hotel to have a higher price bracket to those elsewhere and given that we felt the super delux room was good value for money  Breakfast provision was very satisfactory although it could get quite cosy if too many guests ate at the same time  It was nice to have the use of proper plates and mugs For us the location a couple of minutes from the Subway and allowing full walking access to The Village was just right for the evening choice of restautant and drinking or simply strolling One small warning if you struggle with stairs and carrying bags up them this  be an issue as there isnt a lift elevator  Wed recomment the Chelsey and would stay again  
P => An excellent little hotel in a great part of town We spent a great  nights in the Donna Reid room and absolutely loved the hotel and its location  The staff are very friendly and really make you feel at home  We had a standard room on the th floor worth booking at least a standard so you dont have to share a toilet  The room was small but large enough  The bed was very comfortable and the window which overlooked the small courtyard garden had a blackout blind so we got some great sleep Breakfast was a help yourself affair the Sunday morning offering included smoked salmon and cream cheese  In the week we got a big selection of muffins doughnuts and cookies plus cereal fruit and English muffins with jam  You could help yourself to a hot drink and cookie at any time of the day and you could buy bottled water from the fridge for  a bottle  A short walk from the hotel there is a huge selection of bars restaurants and shops  This was my fourth trip to New York and this is the friendliest hotel I have stayed in in by far the best location  Walking down Hudson street you could choose a different restaurant everynight for a fortnight and still not experience it all  Theres also a great choice of bars  If youre gay youll love the relaxed and friendly atmosphere and if youre straight   ditto Highly recommended and well definitely go back  
P => Excellent base for visiting NYC We really enjoyed Chelsea Pines Inn and would happily recommend it to anyone as an excellent place to stay in New York  Its perfectly located for exploring   close to the subway and easy walking distance to Chelsea the Village just about anywhere  We were in on the top floor NB theres no elevator only some fairly steep flights of stairs   a good cardio workout which overlooked the garden so the room was very quiet and surprisingly spacious  The provision of a fridge was handy  The staff are really friendly too  
P => Fantastic find Myself and my partner spent five nights at the Chelsea Pines  The experience was fantastic on arrival we were made feel very welcome and given advice on what to do see shows to take in etc  We were staying on the top floor but if youre relatively young and fit you wont have any problems and the room Deluxe was fantastic  It was much bigger than we had expected with a erate seating area in between the wash room and sleeping area  The breakfast was highly commendable and the stairs made a welcome way to burn off all those carbs and calories a good choice of cereals bread porridge donuts muffins smoked salmon along with coffee tea and juice as much as you can eat  Theres also a nice terrace to the rear of the building which is nice to sit out on and enjoy breakfast or just chill outThe area cannot be rated highly enough its as listed right on the edge of the meatpacking district chelsea and greenwich village  Theres lots of restaurants which open late in the area and plenty of bars  The subway is almost on the doorstep  We broke our trip to NY with a stop off in Mass we stayed elsewhere on the second occasion but regreted not coming back to the Chelsea Pines not because our second location was poor quality it just didnt compare  Well be back at the Chelsea Pines on our next trip to NY next summer  
P => wonderful welcome My husband and I were delighted with the warm welcome we received  The staff and owner went out of their way to be helpful  The location is perfect the rooms while tiny provide everything you could ask for and the friendly hotel cat charming garden and good free breakfasts make this small hotel a real find  
P => Made welcome at a perfect location Great location   really near the meatpacking district  Staff were friendly and welcoming  Rooms felt really unique total opposite of most generic hotels  Loved the daily newsletter they put under your door with hints of things to do for the day We were on the third floor and it really isnt a drag at all walking up the stairs so dont let that put you offWould definitely stay there again next time Im in NY  
P => A resident cat with a goatee I stayed at Chelsea Pines Inn in late il   The staff were helpful and friendly and the resident cat Charlie was a regular drinking buddy  Both the private showers and shared toilets are kept very clean and tidy  Great value for money in a fantastic location  
P => Outstanding My children and I stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn recently  We found the staff and owners outstanding  Service with a smile  The rooms were fantastic and newly painted and very comfortable with a movie motif in each room and hallway  The breakfast was continental and very good  Parking is three doors down and the subway was easy and at near corners  Questions were answered with ease and again a smile  Very secure area also  Even groceries and bakeries nearby along with many many shops and eateries  Looking forward to our next visit  
P => Super clean and affordable The hotel was very clean and to rooms were very unique  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly  They have a great continental breakfast and an outside courtyard to enjoy it  Extremely close to the subway so you can travel all over the city  Excellent italian food at Primitivo a few blocks away  
P => Clean comfortable pleasant This hotel was great My friend and I wanted a place that was clean tidy and worked so we could to sleep wash and get changed  This place fitted the bill perfectly Because it is a relatively small hotel there is greater attention to detail than in the bigger super hotels therefore if you have a problem or query you are dealt with sincerely The staff were friendly the rooms clean stairwells tidy and it had a nice atmosphere  The themed rooms female Hollywood gay icons were a great touch and not imposing  They really gave the place some charachter I think it had just been refurbished   and therefore looked nice and tidy  Great transport links th Street Subway is m from the door enable you to get anywhere quickly  The trendy areas Chelsea East Village Soho Grenwich are all within  or  mins walk  
P => Perfect location and hosts  We loved it here     so easy to find from Port Authority it was scary  Three or four subway stops away and the front door is only about a thirty second walk from the subways exit  Great location between Chelsea and the meatpacking district   the hotel is just a few blocks from Tene a celebrity hangoutThe Ann garet room was nicely appointed with both a double bed and a twin bed  Extremely clean and orated with movie posters  We actually didnt mind the walk up the stairs this room is on the fourth floor because we had to burn off the calories from all the Italian food we ate at Primatera Primavera an excellent restaurant that our hosts recommended on the first night  The owner of the restaurant gave us two free shots of Limoncello while we were there Moving on a nicely sized bathroom plus a arate shower room very European in design  Lots of closet space for our belongings and even a small fridge for our cold drinks  Nice to get a newsletter each morning sumizing the daily NYC happenings  What a beautiful view from our large window  We realized there is a nearby daycareschool nearby on our first morning so this is going to sound cheesy but its true we found it nice to wake up to the sound of kids lhter  Continental breakfast which includes fantastic donuts    again we didnt mind climbing the stairs to get to our room Also juice coffee fruit muffins etc  Cookies always on hand if youre hungry at pm     mmmm  Nice inside area to eat in as well as an outdoor patio Wed definitely come back  Youre not going to find nicer hosts or a better location while staying in the city  My only complaint is that Charlie the Cat didnt seem to like us very much     he always ran away Next time Ill bring liver treats  
P => Loved Chelsea Pines The Chelsea Pines was pretty close to being PERFECT The location was unbeatable Right around the corner is Greenwich Village for great shopping and the trendy Meat Packing District is literally a block away where there are some great restaurants and fancy stores  The subway is right at your doorstep  My sister and I stayed over the Easter weekend in the Anne garet room both of our beds were really comfy and the room came with a fridge  That was handy since there is a really great higher end grocery store called Balduccis right around the corner where we stocked up on snacks and even bought some great dinner stuff that we were able to heat up in the kitchen  The kitchen was always clean and is newly reated  There was always coffee you could take it to go too which was perfect and cookies available  The breakfast was everything you could ask for  Fresh bagels yogurt fruit pastrys and even some salmon and eggs one morning  The staff was very knowledgeable and really friendly  They let us check in early and they held our bags on our last day  The Chelsea Pines is definitely not your quottypicalquot hotel which is why we chose it  It is young fun and very welcoming  I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again 
P => Fabulous Inn We loved our stay here  The rooms were clean and roomie considering its the city  Breakfast was great every morning and included fresh baked breads  The staff was very polite and let us check in a little early  They also gave us suggestions on which trains to take where  Every morning we got a newsletter telling us of things to do in the city like new museum openings or shows at near by theaters  There were maps of the city and fliers for different things to do in the hotel as well The location was great too and for the price you just cant beat it  I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends 
P => Great fun in a fun part of Manhattan  My partner and I discovered the CP Inn in a guide book  And not wanting to spend years trawling the net for a better deal we called them direct and made the reservation Let me say it clearly and without ambiguity This place is great and for all the right reasons Yes each room is themed and has name of an Academy Award winning actor     but lets talk for real This place is central its clean and although it was being reated during our stay it was very comfortable  The other great advantage to this hotel is that if youre a gaylesbian traveller who likes to meet other people when you travel there are lots of opportunities to do just that  The typical traveller to CP Inn is not a snooty type theyre on a budget too remember and that means that your stay in New York can be extra fun  Location is fine  remember youll be in Manhattan and nothing is really that far away  Loads of shops restaurants and what ever else youre inclined to do around the corner  
P => Great Location Stayed for a week at the Chelsea Pines Inn  It was a great location close to the subway and also to a grocery store which came in handy for water snacks etc  Room was small very clean  Great breakfast  We stayed on the fifth floor and there is no elevator so we did get our exercise every day  Take that into consideration when you book  We are in pretty good shape and did alot of huffing and puffing as we climbed the stairs especially with luggage  That is the only reason why I rated it average  Id stay there again for sure 
P => Fabulous digs for little dough We recently stayed at the Chelsea Pines for about a week and loved it  The location is fabulous at the intersection of Chelsea the Village and the Meatpacking DIstrict there is no lack of things to do and the subway is a half block away for wider excursions  The hotel itself is a great home away from home friendly pleasant clean and stylish if your sense of style runs to the funky and kitsch which ours definitely does  Rooms are on the small side as youd expect in Manhattan but are laid out to take advantage of every inch and are very comfortable to be in  The included breakfast is a bonus  The staff is a gem  We will definitely stay here again  
P => Ok for straight folks too At a quite last minute ision I scrambled to book a BampB in NYC  The Chelsea Pines was available and I had glanced at the website very quickly  They didnt charge me any different for only a one night stay and the customer service on the phone was extremely informative and friendly  After I booked I examined the website further to see that the Chelsea caters more often to the gay community and I had no problem with this but wondered if wed feel like the outcasts at all  This was NOT the case at all  Getting there was extremely easy from Penn Station only one stop using the quotAquot train downtown  The inn is directly visible upon exiting the subway station  It is secured and service is right inside the door  We were given key cards and told that coffee is always available  Our room was  flights up and had just been cleaned  It was small but nicely orated with Ann garet movie posters  The bathroom was very clean with wonderful thick towels and had a arate shower stall  It came with a fridge amp full cable tv  For a short stay I would highly recommend it  If I stayed for a weeks worth the only thing I might not have liked was the hike up stairs but it is the city so it worked  We did not take advantage of breakfast but I did grab a coffee in the evening and although it was about pm it was good and fresh Check out time was at  they kindly offered to hold our luggage for us if we needed them to  The service at checkout could have been a little friendlier but they seemed a little busy with some business people so be were distracted  
P => Great location and staff but quality issues Manhattan is always a tricky proposition when it comes to lodging  Reasonable price and comfort rarely occupy the same space  For Chelsea Pines I chose a reasonable price over other considerations This property is ideally located on West th with easy access to the West Village Chelsea and the Meatpacking District  The staff here is a gem  However if you are accustomed to a certain level of comfort this is not the place for you  For the budget traveler well youre a budget traveler Even though I booked about six weeks ahead for the week of Thanksgiving I was unable to reserve a deluxe room  I booked a standard instead which was a big mistake  The bed in our room was one of the most uncomfortable Ive ever encountered and the shower was tiny  Yes even by European standards  Luckily due to a faulty light in our toilet area located in its own closet we were moved to a deluxe room for a couple of days of our stay  The deluxe room was like staying in a different hotel with a bed that was actually comfortable extra space for sitting and a ent sized bathroom  Bottom line despite the location and a very helpful and friendly staff I would only consider staying here again if a deluxe room were available  
P => Great Little Place in Heart of Manhattan If you are a GLBT traveler looking for a fun place to stay in NYC this is it Friendly staff superclean rooms and reasonable prices combine to make this a great deal  Located on West th St  and Eighth Ave  Chelsea Pines is within walking distance of most of the clubs and restaurants in Chelsea and the Village  Its also a short subway ride away from the theatre district and midtown  We stayed a week and felt as if we had our own home in the big city  Simple but adequate continental breakfast gets your day off to a good start  
P => Friendly clean helpful staff   a great hotel We stayed here twice during our visit to the US in tember  Both rooms were clean quiet with great facilities and large comfortable beds The staff were really friendly and helpful  The breakfast was lovely and fresh with the hotels home made breads a real treat With coffee and cookies around all day the breakfast roomconservatory was a pleasant homely place to spend some time between sight seeing trips The only downside was the narrowness of the breakfast area when it got busy in the morning   but on the whole other guests were pleasant polite and worked around each other      its not the Hotels fault that the odd  or  fellow guests were pretty obnoxious and thought they owned the place   but fortunately they only stayed  days Can happen anywhereI would definately go back and recommend it to friends with no hesitation  The movie posters gave the place a great quirkieness which really let you know you were somewhere interesting and memorable   not a bland corporate quotcould be anywherequot hotel chain The location was superb being situated in between really interesting and lively areas and right on the Subway lines  
P => Are You Inn to Chelsea Awesome Each floor is painted a different colour all the rooms are based on a gay quotIconquot and the hall walls are covered in old movie posters We stayed in the Rock Hudson room on the th floor th for non americans  It was a differen colour from the hallway and the wall were covered in posters   see our pics Coffee is available all day and a very nice continental breakfast available in the morning The staff we really great and helpful with booking shows basketball tickets etc  Also some great suggestions for food n the area Only downer is the stairs   after a days sight seeing   they are quite daunting  
P => The Judy Garland room It doesnt get much gayer than this  Plastered with memorabilia of screen Divas and Divos from yesteryear the CPI is a great little place to stay that wont break the bank  Most of the staff is super friendly the rooms are clean and unlike a lot of shared bathroom places the rooms themselves have showers and sinks  Fantastic location too 
P => Fabulous and Welcoming The FABULOUS staff gave us one of the warmest welcomes Ive ever received and made us feel incredibly at home  The location was perfect and the building clean and cool   and the fresh daily speciality breakfast breads   FABULOUS Highly recommended to anyone with an open gay friendly mind 
P => Very comfortable and convenient I stayed for one night in a deluxe room  My room was long and narrow  the width of the room was the length of the bed which I had to climb over to reach the window  Most of the hotel is painted in dark colors and orated with movie posters which gives character but probably makes the rooms feel smaller  The quotcouchquot is a single bed so the room can fit  people  Everything seemed clean and comfortable  Nice to have a refrigerator in the room  Breakfast included very fresh bagels and muffins fruit etc  Service was friendly  Subway at the end of the block  
P => Great Value With my first trip to New York I wanted to stay away from the usual tourist centre of times square and closer to the night and restraunt areas of New York The Chelsea Pines Inn was great between  Subway Stations on th street  Only  stops from the central subway station and also walking distance ot times square  But it had the greatest neighbourhood with the best buzz  Room was basic but had a fridge Toliet was shared with the floor  The staff was amazing and always helpful  Breakfast was provided everymoring in their patio area to start the day giving a bigger cost saving  This place was great if you are on a budget and need a clean and comfortable place to stay  
P => Cool place great value Last month I took my first ever trip to New York City  As someone from a small town I admit I was a bit nervous about visiting New York alone but I had set up several interviews and was looking for a good hotel value for five nights  Some friends back home recommended Chelsea Pines so I thought Id give them a try  Very glad that I didLocation was terrific right in the middle of gay New York art gallery New York great restaurant New York   well you get the idea  Price was lower than anything else I checked on the web and rooms were a good size for New York I thought considering the stories I had heard rooms at twice the price the size of walk in closets and the movie themes for all the rooms was way cool I stayed in the Jeff Richards room never heard of him but very hunky and I asked to see several other rooms which were equally cool  My room did not have its own toilet but the shower and sink area were really nice room was well layed out and even though it faced the front of the building a pretty busy th Street the windows are double glazed and they thoughtfully provide a quotwhite noisequot machine which drowns out any street noise Staff was extremely helpful and friendly when I told them it was my first time in NY they gave me all kinds of info and maps and advice and a good restaurant discount card for a cool local diner  Breakfast room which leads out to a pretty greenhouse and an even prettier garden was chockful of goodies tasty homemade breads every day real NY bagels fresh coffee which was also available  snacks and cookies too  Rooms were cleaned daily chocolates always on my pillow and even the hall WC was kept clean Still waiting to hear about a job offer but if I come back to NY to look for an apartment Ill definitely be staying with the great guys at the cool Chelsea Pines 
P => simple reasons why youll love this place    The best staff you could ask for   friendly and helpful with lots of knowledgeNice and clean roomsThe bagels at breakfastBeautiful quiet gardenWireless internet access all over the placeCoffee Located right between Chelsea and VillageLast but not least the overall ambiance   once youve set your foot at this friendly and easygoing place youll keep coming back year after year Anders Thorssell 
P => Grimy Flea Bag A crime that anyone can charge money to stay in this place Ive traveled all over the world and this is the filthiest place Ive ever stayed in  Radiators coated with  inch of dust dirty sheets someone elses clothes in the room when I checked in    you get the picture  Looks like they havent employed a handyman in three ades  Staff at reception desk smoked and were generally unhelpful  Do yourself a favor and avoid this flea bag  
P => Best choice for gay visitors We stayed at the Chelsea Pines for a week at the end of ch  The staff cannot be faulted in their friendly and helpful service  The room was clean breakfast great and constant coffee in the kitchen very welcome  Being in the heart of the gay district meant that you have bars and clubs on the doorstep but the main tourist attractions Empire State Building Macys etc were only a  minute walk away  The subway is  seconds away on the corner of th Ave  Cant recommend this place enough  The kitchen was a great place to meet fellow guests and swap stories about where to go and what to do  I wont come back to New York unless I can stay at the Chelsea Pines 
P => Ill be back Stayed for two weeks in ch in a quiet ground floor room with bathroom and couldnt have been happier  A fridge a couple of cable TV channels a reliable shower and pictures of hunky George Nader on every wall  what more could one ask A huge breakfast in the dining room  hour coffee and tea perfect position at the th St  subway and extra friendly staff were all greatly appreciated  The room was over heated and we had to ask that it be vacuumed when we arrived but otherwise I wouldnt hesitate to stay there again  Many thanks to Jay and Al 
P => Great location Stayed in the Doris Day room which has a private bath and is only a two flight walk up as other posters have noted there is no elevator  Yes the rooms and hallways have movie posters but rooms and hallways are exceedingly drab  The bottom drawer on the dresser didnt work the ironing board is one of those tiny things that never quite works right three bulbs in the bathroom remained burned out during the length of our stay       The quotbreakfast areaquot off the lobby is teeny tiny and we finally left rather than try to work our way past the other lodgers there  We did notice a slight odor in the lobby one day from the cute little cat That said this hotel has to have one of the best locations in all of New York for the gay or lesbian visitor    walk a few blocks this way to Chelsea and a few blocks that way to the West Village plus the subway is right on the corner  And I can stay in a drab room when the price and location are right  The rooms did seem clean and the management makes the attempt to quotgo the extra milequot they slip a small flier of the next days cultural events under your door each night  As with any hotel the helpfulness of the staff is hit or miss    some hardly seemed to care while others bent over backward to be helpful So if you dont go expecting too much and dont expect to spend much time in your room we didnt this is an excellent choice for the budget conscious traveler  
P => Great Stay Had a gerat stay here the staff is so helpful and attentive  My room was so cute with great old movie posters  Breakfast was great and a good money saver The place is clean and the location cant be beat with the subway on the corner  Best of all they were able to get me tickts to the theate at   off  
P => I heart New York and this place is OK too I stayed here at the start of tember   My room was fine though a little dark I ended up with a body crisis for my first two days because of the bad lighting   couldnt see me in the mirror properly  The window didnt seem to shut properly and the air con unit was very loud  However if any of these things concerned me enough at the time I would have mentioned it to the staff then   they didnt and so I didnt  Breakfast was good and a great way to meet your fellow guests i e  pick up but dont get me wrong this is not one of those places where you check in get it out and then get it on  On the whole I must say this place felt a little musty to me it needs a good cleaning and dusting be thats just the house wife in me coming out  I also thought the shared WCs could have been a little cleaner Ill admit that I am quite fussy about that kind of stuff but I dont think it was at the standard that most people would expect anyway who goes to New York to sit in a WC  The staff were friendly and helpful and the location is great  If I stayed here again I would get an en suite room  
P => I will be staying at The Chelsea Pines Hotel again      I loved my stay at The Chelsea Pines Hotel  It is certainly located so that I could walk to most places that I wanted to go  The hotel was clean and the hotel staff was friendly and helpful I do have  suggestions  It would have made my stay somewhat better if the shower head had been better  When taking a shower it is nice to have a full stream of water  I must say that I could      harder than the water coming out of my shower head  I would suggest one of the  Rainmaker  showerheads  It feels just like a shower The other suggestion is my cable wire connecting my TV needs to be permanently connected  One day I was without cable because the wire had come loose in the back  I did not realize this because I thought the cable had gone off  Only the next day when I realized that the cable wire had become disengaged I reattached the wire  Also could you please get a couple more channels on the cable be CNN TCM and AMCThanks so much and I am looking forward to my next stay Christopher Freeman 
P => Bring Your Own Ajax The Chelsea Pines is just plain dirty  I found myself actually cleaning the walls as they were too disgusting to deal with  Never again  
P => Disgraceful Traveled from Canada    what a dump Anyone who comments that this is a great place to stay needs serious help Very tiny room and dirty carpets  Run for the hills 
P => Great Value Charming Friendly Im a native New Yorker who moved away last year  This was actually the first time Ive stayed in a hotel in NYC and I wanted to spend my money on clothes and entertainment rather than a  star hotel  I was very surprised at how cheap the Chelsea Pines was comparatively speaking night for large deluxe room when  stars charge over night  Its very conveniently located at th St  between th and th Aves  only a five minute walk from the center of gay life in NY  I like staying in gay and gay friendly hotels and the Chelsea Pines was one of the better ones Ive experienced in the last few years  Very friendly accessible staff fun and kitschy rooms I stayed in the quotPaul Newmanquot room replete with original posters of his movies and a ent though not super breakfast  Also I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was  Ive stayed in a few places where drunken screaming queens raging in the hallways make life miserable and this was definitely not in that category  I saw that someone gave this hotel a very negative rating and Im puzzled because Im quite demanding and this hotel exceeded my expectations  
P => Charming A charming old fashioned BampB in a quaint historic building Great service friendly staff Right in the middle of everything What more can you ask for 
P => Chelsea Pines great for Gaygay friendly travellers A friendly well located for the Village and Chelsea clean hotel  Staff were helpful and rooms were comfortable and quotuniquely oratedquot The only thing to watch is there is no lift and the stairs are steep due to the age of this quaint building  
P => A New York Gem

P => wonderful hotel my huisband and i stayed here for the  weekend  It was wonderful  Had a room on the third floor great view  clean bed comfortable and staff pleasant  Complimentary coffee and pastries given between     am  Close to parking garage and all entertainment piers eating establishments 
P => Super Location and exceded expectations My wife and I and our yr old dhter stayed at the Chelsea Savoy Hotel     Stayed in a double room with  beds  By far the best hotel I have stayed in for the   I was afraid the rooms would be small based on other properties we reserched before we left  To our suprise the were very roomy  Bathroom was big and the shower had good water pressure  The staff was very nice and helpful  The elevator halls and rooms were impecably clean  Excellent location  Step outside and there is the Subway    Awsome location  We went everywhere we could for our quick  days  I would definetly stay here again  
P => Friendly Clean and Basic Stayed at the Chelsea Savoy for three days     Checking in was easy and fast  The staff was courteous and check in was simple  My room was on the th floor and away from the noise down on rd street  The room was very basic and spot free  The only thing  the room was a bit small    however you dont go to NYC to sit in a room all day so I didnt mind  The elevator was a bit slow but again nothing major  The complimentary continental breakfast was pasties and coffee but there are dozens of places in the Chelsea area to eat any time of the day or night  Its steps away from all the major subway lines both uptown and downtown    and midtown is only  stops away  The bed wasnt very soft but the shower was clean  plenty of towels toiletries and other hotel staples were stocked  Check out took about  seconds and the staff was again very helpful  Ive seen other reviews complaining about the noise but its NYC    its always noisy but not so much you cant sleep    try to request a room on the th th or th floor if youre concerned  Its a lively area and Chelsea stays up late  
P => Budget and Good Cost only USD a night with free pastry and coffee tea breakfast  centralised location to Time Square Empire State and many places D 
P => A budget hotel to be sure This is a budget hotel to be sure  It deserves credit for being clean and for a really nice complimentary continental breakfast as well as great subway access  That said unless you want to sleep on mattresses that are hard as rocks use threadbare linens and have a choice between listening to neighboring rooms toilets flushing all night long or the rattle of a poor air conditioner Id look elsewhere  
P => GREAT I have been in NYC many times amp stayed in many hotels besides the big chains hotels Millenium Times square Double tree Hilton Sofitel and riott Park Plaza this is THE BEST hotel Ive stayed in very nice quiet room ask for the ones not facing the street for NYC standards quite large too with clean bathroom amp a small refrigerator inside  The location is the best rd st  between th and th aves  so      you have the red line on th and the blue lines on the th so trains runing at all times you have access from anywhere this time I arrived to Penn Station and took the  to the rd the hotel is above the station The breakfast is not that fancy but you have pastries and coffee very nice deli on the corner of rd and th ave  One thing I have to say is that the bed is really hard  I read it on reviews nevertheless is confortable  Hey for the money you cannot find a better deal my rate was   plus taxes at the end of my stay I did make another reservation for thanksgiving week this one obviously at a very different rate but when you compared with other hotels still a very good deal 
P => A Good hotel to stay close to Times Square Stay at the hotel was a pleasant experience  The staff extended a warm welcome and had our room ready when we entered the hotel  The room was very clean and good  Its quite close to Times square  stations  You can get an MTA right next to the station I mean it there is a subway once you come out of the hotel  Its nicely located on the intersection of  Ave and West rd street  You also have a good superket  minute walk from the hotel which is open till  pm  Our overall experience was very pleasant and memorable  
P => Unbeatable value We stayed for just one night in il of  and the Chelsea Savoy had no problem taking a booking for Saturday night only which not many other hotels were willing to do  A lot of the other reviews here mentioned poor service but the two people working at the desk Saturday afternoon welcomed us as soon as we walked in and we very cordial and polite the whole time we were there  The rooms still have that funky quotjust paintedquot smell but after a few minutes you dont notice it at all  The bathroom was big as others mentioned for New York City standards  The room and bathroom were both very clean  The hotel literally sits on top of the  and  lines rd st  subway station and is a block away east from the BDFV or west ACE subway lines so you can be practically anywhere in Manhattan within  mins or so  We were on the second floor and still had no problems sleeping with the street noise but others might notice it  As others have mentioned the breakfast is nothing special just pastries and coffeetea  There is no restaurant at the hotel as of  but there are about  or  ently priced diners within a block in either direction so its no big deal  The hotel was more than happy to keep our bag for the afternoon after we checked out The deal maker for this hotel is the price  We paid  for a queen bed on a Saturday night   extremely low by Manhattan standards and an incredible value for the money We will be back to the Savoy on our next trip to NYC  
P => Loved Chelsea Savoy My dhters and I spent a long weekend at the Chelsea Savoy a couple of weeks ago  It was great   very clean nice and roomy quiet a great street with great deli grocery pharmacy etc  all nearby  It is between  subway stops very convenient The breakfast was good with delicious pastries muffins and good coffee  Another friend was in a nearby chain hotel and paid  times as much for less room and no breakfast I will stay there again  
P => Perfect for our NY stay  My husband and I walked by this hotel the last time we were in NYC and due to its perfect location we ided that we would stay here the next time  And so we did  The hotel is clean and cheap by NYC standard and it has everyting you need  We loved that the room had a little fridge  Rooms are not large by american standard but compared to average rooms in Europe the size is great  The so called breakfast is so so but it doesnt matter as there are plenty of nearby places to have breakfast  There are also many good restaurants and bars within walking distance and the area seams very safe  You can easily walk to most tourist attractions during the day  The only problem is the traffic noise but I guess that thats the case in most NYC hotels  
P => Great spot for the price My husband and I had booked into the Hotel Chelsea aka the Chelsea Hotel for  nights in tember  It is half a block down from the Chelsea Savoy Hotel but were so disgusted with the place that I spent almost two hours online and calling around the next morning to find another reasonably price hotel  I despondently walked down the block to get a coffee and stumbled upon the Chelsea Savoy Hotel  I walked in and found a clean lobby and friendly staff  They only had a smoking room available for the first night but a king non smoking room was available for the rest of our stay  I checked out the smoking room and was pleasantly surprised to find a room with new carpet nice furnishings including a mini fridge a great bathroom and best of all no smell of smoke  We stayed there the first night then moved to the king non smoking room the next day  The beds were firm the rooms quite and the water hot  Perfect for the price of  for the queen room and  for the king room  The rate also included coffeetea and pastries each morning  We grabbed a bagel and teacoffee on our way out  fresh warm and wonderfully chewy bagels  The front desk staff was particularly helpful taking me up to see several rooms when I first arrived to assisting with directions shopping suggestions luggage storage and more  It is not a  or  star hotel but overall we had a great experience and would definitely recommend the Chelsea Savoy NOT the Hotel Chelsea  run from this place to anyone looking for reasonably priced accommodation in a great location  
P => Dingy noisy no frills but inexpensive hotel in a great neighborhood I actually did not stay at the Chelsea Savoy but I booked it for a business colleague  The main reason to choose this hotel is the location and a super cheap price for this fabulous area of the city  Be prepared though room was small and sort of dark and dingy and extremely noisy  When I asked for room at the quiet side of the hotel the staff person said any side would be noisy  Ive stopped in there a number of times I live in the area and have found the level of service inconsistent  If you are on a budget and not going to spend time in the room this  be the hotel for you  Bring ear plugs  
P => Good value great location I was looking for a good clean hotel near the Fashion Institute and was very happy with my choice of The Chelsea Savoy  The rooms are small but then most are in NY unless you are willing to spend a lot more money  The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were redone a few years back  Each morning they provide coffee tea hot choc and assorted breakfast danishes and bagels which beats having to get dressed to go out and get that wake up cup of coffee  There is a subway stop directly across the street and Penn Station is a short walk  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends  
P => Very Nice Hotel This was the first time I stayed at this hotel and was very impressed with the service and cleanliness  The room I stayed at had  beds and was very large and even had a small refrigerator  Price was very reasonable considering what some hotels in New York get  Very good location near subways and restaurants  Staff was very accommodating  Would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Down Right RUDE Front Desk Staff RUDE RUDE RUDE front desk staff  My first and last time staying there  The girl who waited on me should find another job cause she sure seems miserable there  Not to mention the nasty and dirty carpet in the rooms  I also payed for the internet service they provide and it only worked  of the time  
P => Yankees Fan A friend told my family about the  Best Cheapest Hotels in N Y  So I went online read some reviews and booked a couple of rooms at the Chelsea Savoy  That was the first week in y   We returned to N Y  the first week in   and the Chelsea Savoy had no vacancies  My next trip to N Y  we will stay at the Chelsea Savoy  Our rooms were very nice amp clean  Great location  
P => Exellent Hotel We just stayed at the Chelsea Savoy for  nights and the experience was just plain awesome This hotel is perfectly located near everything cab rides are cheap and the subway stations are all within about  block  The service was great and the room exceeded our expectations  Very clean air conditioned and the newspapers waiting for us at our door every morning was a great added touch  The complimentary pastries and coffee in the lobby every morning was just the icing on the cake it was an excellent way to start our day  This is going to be a yearly trip for us from now on and we will definitely be staying at the Savoy again  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New York and is looking for an affordable clean place to stay  
P => Great Hotel Great Value I got a recommendation from a friend about this hotel  I took her word for it and made reservations  This hotel was great  I booked last minute and got a nicely maintained hotel  The lobby is kind of small but the rooms are nice and spacious with ACheater  It has a convenient location right next to the rd street station downtown  Cross the street and youre at the uptown station  The staff was also very courteous and was able to answer all of my questions  The Chelsea Savoy Hotel also has complimentary breakfast and coffee and USA Today and the New Yorker Im pretty sure newspapers delivered at your doorstep However I got a nd floor room right on the corner of rd and th and it got noisy at times  Also the cable doesnt work too well and there arent many channels  But this is NYC Why watch TV when theres a whole city outsideAll in all I gave this hotel a  for service appearance comfort and value  Top notch hotel  
P => My least favorite NYC Hotel The positive if youre looking for a hotel in a convenient location you cant beat this place    its within steps of the  and  subways and if youre a downtown type its a great launching point  The room was clean and for a NYC hotel the bathroom was enormous  The staff leaves newspapers at your door USA Today and the New York Post  The rest Just because a place is a budget hotel doesnt mean it has to be completely uncomfortable  The room smelled like paint and it also smelled musty  The bed and pillows were terribly uncomfortable  The coffee and danish they serve each morning couldnt have been more unappealing  The hotel contracts its internet service and for  day I had the opportunity to have a non functional internet connection I was in a room that had a very poor wireless signal  For a  deposit I could have had a quotboosterquot attached to my macbook  Fortunately there was a Starbucks across the street and I could easily and reliably check my email and the like there  On TV while I dont go to NYC to watch television I was still appalled by the poor reception and lack of cable choices  Its the worst of any hotel Ive visited budget or otherwise in NYC Concerning the front desk staff while I dont care about their being my new best friends this crew was downright surly  I had originally checked in for six nights I left after two  Ive stayed in some pretty lousy hotels in NYC but this wins the prize for the worst  I would never stay here again  
P => Its all you need Ive stayed here twice now and will probably not bother looking for any other hotel in Manhattan  My take on this place is the same as the others who liked it so I wont bother repeating the same information  Both times I made my reservations over the phone and got the same price and type of room as quoted  As for the staff theyre not overly friendly but are polite and do whats asked of them  If you need to be pampered go somewhere else but youre going to be paying a lot more than you would here  
P => Very Happy With Chelsea Savoy Best Value In New YorkI searched many hotels on the net before iding on this one The others at or below this hotels price had many bad comments on many feed back sites that frankly turned me off We arrived early and the staff kindly stored our luggage for us so we could go see the city When we arrived late that night we checked in fastgot our luggage and went to our room  It was very large and modern by New York Budget Hotel Standards including the use of a Key Card  Yes the room was basic quotIkeaquot type furnishings and one Picture on the wall  Also Very Clean with no sign of ever having any pest problems  The Bathroom was modernvery clean and a normal size  Large by NY Budget hotel standards also included SoapsShampoo and Lotions   Individual climatecontrols also a big plus Subway stop right on the same corner  Red Line  Two Freenewspapers at your door in the MorningThe continental Breakfast was suitable with DonutsMuffinsFlavored and Butter Croissants  the addition of some Simple Fruits would be the only improvement I might suggest to the management  apples oranges and bananas  Reg  and af CoffeeTea Hot Choc  The stated time was  am but they had it up and running at  am when we left for the Day Yes I could hear street noise in our street side room but ony when the AC cycled off for short periods of time  And I suspect that this would be common in NYOn our last day we left our luggage with them again so we could finish our sight seeing  We returned in the late afternoon and got our luggage with no problems The Chelsea Savoy help make our  day  night Trip To NYC very pleasantI would suggest the hotel to any one or family looking for a ent Budget priced hotel in NYC Calling directly using the Toll Free Number on the web Site is a Good way to make reservations 
P =>    per night   I booked this room last minute three days before depature Rm   Great location  This room directly overlooked rd street  It was noisey and you constantly heard traffic shouting  ect  Id highly recommend call the hotel directly for reservations  I filled out the online reservation form twice and got no reply  dont even think about checking in early  From what I understand check out is late and the maid staff also comes in late  My room wasnt ready until pm and this was on a friday check in  The breakfast I read many comments like  quotgreat coffeequot  quotmmm coffee out of this worldquot ect     but it tasted like standard generic coffee to me  Dont execpt eggs pancakes    its all bread items  sweet and non sweet  Hotel had a hard time keeping bread and coffee stockedRoom  is double bed  with TV  air con and a private bathroom  Right across from the elevator  The room was clean and smelled nice  My bathroom light didnt work when I finally checked in and it was changed in under  minutes  This is a nice location between the subway   and CE train lines  Id highly recommend the bake shop on the corner of th amp rd  There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel boston ket cuban resturant ect but I liked the mangopapaya spot that was diagonal across  amp th  
P => great Stayed in the Chelsea Savoy and thought it was brilliant  I thought I was going into a horrible place but it was lovely  spotlessly clean  papers outside your door every morning staff always polite and very helpful  Have seen some reports on this hotel from Tripadivsor and I dont know where they can get their views I always bring my own pillow and sheets with me  But when I seen the rooms and inspected the bed in this hotel they stayed in my case  SPOTLESS  Breakfast is not provided but go down to the lobby and you have all the coffee   beautiful  and Danish you want  You cannot fault this hotel in its price bracket  Everything is whitin  mins and its clean spotless the staff are brilliant  Going back to New York in ember and will be staying at the Chelsea Savoyif there is room  So cheap and so comfortable and for meso clean  Stay there  Basic       but lovely  
P => great hotel would highly recommend My friend and I have just returned from spending  nights at Chelsea Savoy  Speaking from my friend and my point of view we were more than happy with the hotel  Rooms are a good size as are bathrooms  Beds were very comfortable good wardrobe space plenty of hot water tho shower pressure not too strong  My only quibble was that there were not too many power points european visitors remember american adaptor  Rooms were cleaned daily  Hotel does not do b fast but free v  good coffee bagels and muffins in lobby from am and plenty of delis and coffee shops in area  Contrary to other reviewers I found reception staff very friendly and helpful  Most are of Polish nationality and couldnt be nicer  To my horror I cracked a tooth on my first night reception staff were super located a dentist and Ava one of staff even offered to give me her appt  with her dentist All in all I would recommend the Chelsea Savoy Location is great subway stop outside the door great shopping on th th sts between th and th avenue esp  Loehmanns  Also on th Ave  and rd  mins from hotel there is a superb organic wholefood ket  Fab ket selling cooked and raw food and products we ate from there a lot  Cant wait to go back and will defnitely stay at Chelsea Savoy again  
P => Not for sensitive types Staff was unsmiling and all business  No sense of warmth whatsoever  There is one foreign accented woman at the front desk who was extremely rude to me when I asked her for help after I checked out  
P => would stay again WE just spent  days at the Savoy  Great location close to subways walking distance to Time Square  Lots to do all around the neighborhood  Simple clean and reasonable hotel  I stayed here a few years back for  nights and I would stay again  
P => Loved it I have stayed at several other quotbudgetquot hotels in the city and have never been as happy as I was that the Chelsea Savoy  Quiet clean extremely affordable for NYC easy access to subway continental breakfast every morning  newspapers delivered to your door Monday Friday small fridge in room private bathroom soft beds laundromat just  blocks away very helpful for long stays helpful and curtious front desk and free luggage storage  If you looking for a basic place to stay thats quiet clean affordable and easy access to all the city has to offer this is the place  I plan on staying here again very soon  
P => Good hotel Positive large and clean rooms very good location some steps from subwayNegative some of people staff are unhelpful bad lightning in the room 
P => Great stay at the Chelsea Savoy We have just come back from a four night stay at the Chelsea Savoy and faulting our experience would be difficult  The rooms were spacious and clean with a great view looking over th avenue  The location was perfect for us as it was a short walk to Times Square Madison Square Garden Empire State Building and th Avenue shopping  The Staff were helpful and organized taxi s excursions and recommended some great restaurants within Chelsea  We were also pleasantly surprised by the breakfast which consisted of pastries muffins tea and coffee  We were also able to check out a little later due to our afternoon flight  Overall a very pleasant stay and next time we are in New York we shall be staying there  
P => Basic Hotel Great Value for NYC Finding a good reasonable priced hotel in NYC can be challenging  We usually stay in mid town but the prices of hotels in mid town has increased quite a bit  We ided to stay in Chelsea and we found the Chelsea Savoy Hotel for less than  a night unusual for NYC  The hotel was a basic hotel much like a Holiday Inn  What we found the rooms were clean and roomy for NYC standards  The bathroom was larger than most hotels we have stayed in mid town  The staff was friendly enough and they were always happy to store your luggage  There is a continential breakfast included with the room but it looked rather sad so we only had some coffee  We had a great breakfast at the restaurant quotCafeteriaquot on th St  amp th Ave  The location of the hotel is great rd St  amp th Ave  It is a safe amp convenient neighborhood  There is the  subway lines right outside the hotel door or a block away at th Avenue is the A C E lines  Whether we were walking or taking the subway it was easy to get around the city  What we really loved being in Chelsea was the many great restaurants and bars at reasonable prices  If you like shopping there are many stores and the Chelsea flee ket is on the weekends  For the price and the location of this hotel we look forward staying here again  
P => Terrific place for the price We just returned from spending  nights at the Chelsea Savoy   we stayed there during quotWelcome Weekendquot for Parsons the New School for Design college freshman orientation so there was naturally a lot of walking and possession schlepping going on  In the evenings we just wanted to collapse in a ent room   and we really did choose an ideal place Our room featured a king sized bed  feather pillows on it  foam pillows in the closet small refrigerator genius tiny safe ironironing board TV and remote  Bathroom had little containers of shampooconditioner body lotion etc    which surprised me  Bathroom also had a make up mirror and an in the wall hairdryer   nice touches reminiscent of a higher priced hotel  Two things to note about the bathroom the sound of the toilet flushing is VERY loud and there are no facial tissues provided  Also be aware that the water pressure in the shower is pretty weak although the termperature is great quotContinental breakfastquot is bagelsmuffinspastries in the lobby with pots of coffee   absolutely nothing fancy for one thing there are no tables or anything so you bring stuff back to your room but welcome nonetheless  The one ice machine in the hotel is also on the lobby floor Front desk staff is helpful and courteous  There are no bellmen per se but we were asked if we needed help with our bags so presumably someone could have helped us if wed needed it  Housekeeping is efficient   we never saw them but our room was spotless every night when we returned  The hotel is at rd Street between th and th Avenue right in the middle of Chelsea and pretty close to midtown  Lots of interesting stores ent restuarants etc  nearby and of course a cab ride can take you pretty much anywhere you want to go in New York The best part of our Chelsea Savoy experience was that we only paid  per night   WITH tax For that price a very nice room indeed  For New York City an amazing deal to boot  
P => All the basics in a great location at a great price All the basics are here cleanliness   functional bathroom with plenty of sink area counter space stocked with soaps shampoo conditioner mouth wash functioning electrical outlets and appliances tv with remote mini refrigerator clock radio picture over the bed air conditioner comfortable bed front desk staff who were helpful and didnt have long lines tasty breads for complimentary breakfast  I arrived at  am before my room was ready  but storing my bag was no problem they took it right away and in the afternoon retrieved it very quickly offering it to me with a ready smile Location was great  roughly a ten minute walk to Penn Station along Seventh Avenue  The rd Street station on the Seventh Avenue Subway was right at the corner And       would you believe I got a room rate of  plus taxKeep in mind that this was not a room for picky travelers  When I booked it the clerk warned me that it was next to the elevators  I didnt hear any noise from the elevators and the room was very quiet in general but the room   did have an unusual shape to accommodate the space for the elevators  The room didnt seem large but I didnt feel cramped  Just inside the room is a conventional but small bathroom and an alcove for the apparently queen size bed  As you keep walking farther into the room you have a corridor like extension be  feet wide roughly  Walk down that for roughly  feet and you get to the closet  Just beyond the closet is a small window  The view is just part of the hotel and some nearby buildings  not very impressive  The air conditioner was a bit noisy  but Ive experienced that problem elsewhere and despite it I slept well Also I noticed some scuff ks on the walls  In the lobby the covering on the couch had some tears For me those issues were not important  I didnt visit Manhattan in order to be a room inspector  I wanted a place to stay that was conveniently located comfortable functional and clean  with staff that would facilitate my arrival and departure  
P => Great Place to stay This was our first time in NYC doing the site seeing and was a bit worried about what we would find  I scoured this site along with other review sites for a ent inexpensive hotel  This hotel was great for the price and location being close enough to times square but quiet and peaceful enough for a goodnights sleep AND being next to a subway The hotels front entrance was small but much larger on the inside  the room we stayed in was a double with a very clean private bathroom  The bed linen was changed everyday along with a copy of two newpapers one being the new york times delivered every morning and doughnuts and coffee in lobby in the morning  I had I think one of my best ever nights sleep in this place  If I had to complain about anything it would be the missing power button on the TV but thats really nothing to complain about at all  Most interestingly we discovered a fridge in our room on our way out The staff were very accomodating and helpful  I will definitely try to book this hotel again when I head to new york city  
P => Terrific hotel found on Trip Advisor After combing Trip Advisor reviews searching online and hotel websites for inexpensive NYC hotel we booked this hotel for visit  It was perfect  Front staff were always more than helpful and cleaning staff also very pleasant  We arrived early and very easy to leave our bags  Were advised that room would be available early   about  rather than the technical  check in  The room   especially for NYC was huge    is a terrific double  Even had little refrigerator in one of the cabinets  It was in the back off the street front and quiet  New carpet throughout hotel  Very clean new bathrooms  Looked in other rooms each day being cleaned  All were in excellent shape and some with quirky shapes  Ranged from typically small singles one double bed to larger  Continental breakfast was good coffee refreshed regularly good assortment of bagels croissant etc  Served in small lobby area with limited seating but not a problem  Could also take to the room but I enjoyed overhearing conversations in Italian Spanish Russian   who knows  Visitors seemed a mix of young older and families with children  Location next to famous Hotel Chelsea was perfect with access to subway at each corner wonderful walking area  Would look forward to staying at Hotel again  I believe their prices might be increasing so double check  But still a very good NYC value  Have stayed in more expensive less quality  
P => Convenient clean and affordable New York location This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel  It is conveniently situated on the corner of rd St and th Ave  Travel to all of NYC is convenient travel up or downtown by subway just outside the hotel with a cross town bus on rd street  It is a relatively small hotel  quiet clean efficient and importantly for New York City great value for the prices charged  However there is no meal service  There are many restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance I had no trouble finding a room at short notice about a year ago but found this year that rooms were booked well in advance and cannot be relied on at short notice  The staff  are courteous  This is an unpretentious quiet clean and conveniently situated hotel offering basic services for a very affordable price  
P => Large rooms clean low key This place would be just average for me but my room was rather large but dark  It was clean with a ent bathroom  Coffee and bagels and muffins are served in the lobby in the AM  The wireless internet is reasonable  Aesthetically the place is bland  But I had plenty of room to spread out in it was clean and the location was great  
P => Nice Little Hotel   Would Stay Again My husband and I were visiting a friend in Chelsea for the weekend for a holiday party  We ided to stay at a hotel as our friend already had about  of our other friends staying at her apartment  We wanted to stay near her and remain within our budget of    Because it was ember all our first choices were either a booked or b too pricey  After reading the reviews on this site I ided to book at the Chelsea Savoy  We paid  per night  If I visited during a more off season time I would have definitely expected to pay less  We arrived Friday night to a quick check in  However I must say that when checking into a hotel I dont really expect the staff to totally go out of their way to put a smile on my face  Just a simple hello and some general courteousness will do  And this is just what we received here  No problems  Our room was right by the elevators facing the street and it didnt bother me in the least  A few honking horns here and there but hey this is NYC  The room was about average size for the city and pretty tidy  I bill myself as a clean freak and didnt run into any problems  Enough room for one standard bed and two nightstands desk and entertainment center  Our bathroom was clean and there were a few nicely scented soaps and shampoos for us to use  The hotel offered coffee tea bagels and pastries in the AM  We dined at Le Zie one night right around the corner which was great Fabulous food but be prepared to be seated within inches of your neighbor again typical in the city  Also we checked out a nice wine store down the street past Le Zie cannot remember the name    All in all we had a great time  The hotel was perfect for what we needed  The area has a great selection of food pharmacies close to the subway etc  I would stay here again in a second and highly recommend it  Hope this helpedAndi 
P => A bargain at half the price While it  be true that proper planning is the key to a successful vacation there usually exists an exception for the more spontaneous traveler  And in my experience trip advisor has been an excellent tool for that very situation  So when I planned a last minute trip to Manhattan and wished to spend less than  a night I found my options were limited but not completely hopeless  Or were they The Chelsea Savoy had rooms available for barely under  a not too shabby review on this website and hey the B s apparently stayed there  Unfortunately the experience was tolerable at best but I will spare you a laundry list of disappointments and sumize my complaints by saying simply that shower shoes are highly recommended  
P => Great hotel super location Stayed here for  nights in late il with some mates on a trip to meet with old friends  Our fifth floor non smoking room was away from the road and very quiet  Comfortable beds clean bathroom helpful frontdesk and housekeeping staff  The only gripe was that the carpets have just been replaced so a pretty strong smell in the room which took some getting used to but then we weren t there for much more than sleeping The Hotel s location cannot be beaten in my opinion all the major subways are within one block of the hotel including routing directly to JFK airport  There s a great bar right next door   Jack s I think and once again very friendly owner and staff  There are diners bistros restaurants and even Starbucks all within  mins walk  The hotel provides free light breakfast coffee with bagels muffins and pastries I ve stayed in some pretty grotty places on Manhattan and even stayed in New Jersey to find a ent family hotel at a reasonable price  The Chelsea Savoy is the best value hotel I ve stayed in on the island I d happily stay here again any time If you re planning on staying here ask the hotel in advance for a room away from the road on the higher floors if you value peace and quiet  
P => Great  cheap  NYC hotel This is a great NYC hotel for people that are looking to spend a bit less in the city  The price was still a bit high but worth it for the clean hotel room and great location I had a great stay and was very happy with the hotel Thank you 
P => Absolutely Fabulous What a find I had a modern very clean single room and only paid  plus taxes low season deal  Who cares if the room was quite small and with hardly a view out the window  For this great price I had a comfy queen sized bed my own bathroom toiletries included and cable t v The room was serviced daily a basic light breakfast was provided and a newspaper left outside the door every morningThe location was ideal   the subway was close by and if you dont mind walking its not too far from the Theatre District Midtown and Downtown  Overall Chelsea is a great place to stay and really safequotI thoroughly recommend the Chelsea Savoy Hotel 
P => definitely will stay here again We absolutely loved the location very near transit and close to the galleries  The rooms were small but immaculately clean  I felt like it was a bargain for the location  
P => Clean and reasonable place to stay in Chelsea We stayed in a room with a king size bed for Valentines Day  The hotel was very clean and we felt safe  The room was small but the carpets were new and bed comfortable  The bathroom was updated with a ble vanity   We wanted to stay within walking distance of the tha Stewart studio as we had tickets to her show the next day  It worked out perfectly and there is even complimentary coffee and pastries at am in the lobby of the hotel  
P => Perfect Little Hotel This website was so great in helping to plan my trip to NYC so I had to post a review I found the Chelsea Savoy through a friend that used to live in NYC  What a great find Its a small boutique style hotel with super friendly staff  They let us check in around  hours early and let us check out pretty late as well since our flight was in the middle of the afternoon   The location is fabulous Its about a  minute cab ride to Times Square and  minutes to Central Park  There were at least  subway entrances around the corner from the hotel also  Of course there are a ton of restaurants near by  Overall the location is really what sold me on this place   I had read on this website about a breakfast place called Murrays its on rd amp th ave  Its wonderful They have a tasty egg sausage cheese on a bagel sandwich  Go by there 
P => Nice place but over rated for the price I admit the location is GREAT and the hotel in general is fine  I think for the price though that the reviews are a little high  We paid an average of night on a FriSat with tax and all that and felt the room itself was very dated and average  I have paid that much in NY and stayed in a much nicer hotel  I am not complaining about the place just saying that I would expect it to be cheaper  I would recommend this place but keep your expectations a little lower  
P => Great place to stay for people who want to get around by foot bus and subway  Good PointsThe staff was always wonderful   whenever we interacted with them they were cheerful helpful and acted like they were glad to see us  Mind you this is not a place to stay if youre high maintenance   no one is employed just to wait hand and foot on you  But when you need their help they treat you like someone worthwile not like a chore or a nuisance  Rooms were kept well cleaned without undue fuss  Location is another great point in this hotels favor  Its on the corner of rd Street and th Ave  which puts it almost on top of one subway line one block from another subway line and also on a cross town bus line which will get you to just about any other subway line you would want  In addition with just a block or two walk there are several restaurants delis a  cent store for that one item you forgot a Ben and Jerrys and a Baskin Robbins if you insist a drug store an excellent gourmet grocery store called quotGarden of Edenquot which I highly recommend visiting to put together a classy picnic of cheese lox bread olives and fruit and a couple of places to get souvenirs that you wont find on every single corner  As my husband puts it   you can get anything you need within a two block walk  My favorite part of the hotel stay They provide lovely sandlewood soap with the toiletries  Bad PointsInternet access is available but for a ridiculous price  When we went it was about  dollars for thirty minutes or ten bucks a day  You have a couple of other options  Theres a Tasti D Lite in I swear nearly every other block and you can buy  minutes of time on their PC for a couple of bucks which is just enough time to locate that one place you wanted to go that you forgot to note the address of  There are also tarbucks everywhere but you have to pay for them as well if you dont already have an account  Your best bet if you bring a laptop is to head to Murrays Bagels for breakfast  Walk west to th Ave then turn left and walk another half a block  On weekdays get a LEO lox scrambled eggs and sauteed onion on your favorite bagel and surf for free while you eat breakfast  I never actually saw a sign promoting their free internet we got it word of mouth but it netted them breakfast for two four days in a row  And the food is outstanding The room was ok  We had two double beds and the bed we slept on sagged a bit in the middle and had a topper that shifted occasionally but it was more nuisance than real hassle  I did find the layout poor for using the desk and the chair uncomfortable but I never used a hotel room desk before laptops either  The room has a tub but they are really only giving lip service to the idea of actually taking a bath   its too shallow for soaking so youre better off just taking a shower  Final evaluation great place to stay for people who want to get around by foot bus and subway  
P => Great Find The Chelsea Savoy was such a good find i almost dont want to give a great review so its not booked up the next time we go to nyc  The  subway line is right next door  coffee and bagels in the lobby in the AM  Located right outside the Times Square area which is within walking distance down th  I asked for and received the most inexpensive room it was small yet had a small fridge tv  phone    for a local call it is a safe area that has people around the streets pretty much through the night   saftey in numbers Dont expect a view or ambiance yet a safe place to stay  There was no dresser in my room had closet ironing board iron small safe  own bathroom  Clean 
P => Best Kept Secret There is honestly nothing you can say bad about the Savoy  I have stayed there for roughly  years and typically travel to NYC about  times a year  The saff hasnt changed much which is nice and they know me by name  For a ent     star place in midtown amp Chelsea   you cant beat the price  They now have wireless internet access which is a nice touch  The room is very basic but they have been making upgrades to certian things like the internet access and toiletries etc  I have read some of the reviews of this place and the ones that bash it   all I can say is quotDont get mad if you booked and paid for a   star hotel and expected to get the Waldorfquot I love the Chelsea Savoy and have recommended it to all my friends  It is a great budget hotel in a great area  
P => Perfect location for exploring NYC We picked the Chelsea Savoy on the basis of reviews here on TripAdvisor  We were stuck with getting a hotel at the last minute due to having booked an apartment and then having to cancel it  after reading the reviews of the apartment here on TA   Well I couldnt have been happier with this hotel  It really is in a perfect location for exploring this beautiful and totally fantastic city  The hotel itself is bordering on basic but it is spotlessly clean very well serviced daily with ample towels and free toiletries etc  The hotel doesnt serve food but there is a free breakfast bar of coffee and danish each morning and Monday thru Friday a comp copy of USA Today is left outside your room door  The beds were extremely comfortable I had a room to myself with a big queen size bed   wonderful to get into after a hard day walking round the cityThere are plenty of amenities close to the hotel itself  a deli next door plenty of diners including the wonderful  if tackily named Malibu  serving cheap meals in jumbo size portions  Honestly breakfast in the Malibu is enough to keep you going all day for about   If you choose to stay here dont miss an evening meal in the East of Eighth cafe with its garden restaurant  Wonderful setting and again great value with dinners running about  to  with a drink  Its on th street a block from the hotel  A few minutes walk brings you to the bargainhunting daddy of them all Filenes Basement which has TJ Maxx upstairs  TK Maxx in the UK and Ireland   Ralph Lauren shirts for  dollars And its also worth noting that there is no sales tax on clothes or shoes under  in NY as of last il  Im intending to go back and explore NY some more next year and Ill definitely consider staying at this hotel again  The only real gripe I had  and its not the hotels fault  is the  different taxes added on to the bill   a  room becomes a   a day  Some difference adding  to the bill  For a city that is still trying to woo back tourists the State could be give some consideration to the high cost of hotels in the cityThank you to all the lovely and wonderful people that we came across in New York who were all without exception kind hearted considerate and very welcoming  
P => Great value and location for exploring NYC My friend and I flew into Manhattan on Thanksgiving day and stayed at the Chelsea Savoy for four nights  We picked the hotel based on reviews from this site and couldnt have been happier with our choice  The location is excellent  very close to restaurants bars and several subway stations  Our room was spacious and clean  No frills but still very nice  The front desk staff werent overly friendly but were gracious enough to offer to call a car service for us  All in all I would highly recommend this hotel  perfect place to sleep and clean up before exploring the city  Cant beat it for the price  
P => Perfect Business Hotel Ive stayed at the Chelsea Savoy several times on business trips to NYC  The hotel is no frills but very nice  The front desk staff is friendly and is aware of who all of the guests are   they recognize you when you come and go which is nice as you dont fear that there are any non guests lingering  The rooms are small  The hotel is fairly quiet at night despite the bustling city outside  It is clean well air conditioned Ive stayed there only in the summers and is in a location fairly convenient to the metro   just a block away  There are good restaurants just around the corner and a movie theater too  It is an awkward place to catch a taxi to go uptown but to go downtown it is a perfect location  If you are going uptown walk a block first so that you are headed in the right direction to begin with  The price is right and it is a perfect place to sleep but not much else in NYC  
P => Great Location Clean Rooms Friendly Staff Ive been staying at this hotel for many years when traveling to NYC for vacation  Rooms are clean if small but who can complain when youre spending so little to stay and the staff are helpful and friendly  The location in the hip Chelsea neighbourhood has plenty of great restaurants shopping everything from Whole Foods to the designer discount store Loehmanns and nightlife  Chelseas a great quothome basequot to start exploring the rest of New York   Times Square and the Theatre District is a mere  minute walk away Greenwich Village and the Meatpacking district are equally close and Soho is walkable or a short cab ride   The subway line a great method of traveling from the hotel to the other neighbourhoods runs along rd  
P => Good base of operations Im always on the search for affordable hotels close to my companys NY office  This has been the best one yet  Great price for the area good location plenty of restaurants easy access walking subway taxis to rest of the city  Nothing fancy but clean and comfortable  Only complaint was the limited number of electrical outlets for recharging phones Palm Pilots etc  Had to get creative  However for roughly half the cost of other hotels its a minor problem  
P => Great deal quiet room good location My dhter and I stayed here for my first trip to NYC her second we stayed  nights   I was surprized at first at how small the room was until I found out just how small all rooms in NYC are In Boston we have larger rooms on average we had a very quiet room   it was on the inside of the hotel    vew was just of some residential roof patios   who cared  we only slept here and the location let us sleep very well and we woke up at AM  mornings  was clean beds comfortable   slept very well  We walked or hailed a cab to places Central Park Broadway but easily walked to these places    walked the neighborhood a bit and it was interesting all kinds of stores we find in suburbs are there for residents it is basically a residential neighbor hood   in the  range   a friend of my dhter paid  for a one bedroom around the corner Yikes coffee and pastries wonderful   all the basics and was comfortable   all I wanted  The  I saved I got to eat out more and saw a great show   and got cabs instead of subway  But the subway is just a few doors down  If you are going to NYC to see the place and need a resting spot and comfortable bed    in a good accessible area go here   and ask for a room not on the street if you can  this street is no more noisy than ANY street I was on  I had them store my luggage for the day I checked out   so we got to see more of the city for the afternoon before we got our bus out of the city at PM  That was great  
P => Great Little Hotel at a nt Price We stayed at this hotel for  nights  We found it to be well worth the money  Great location for branching out to all areas of the Manhattan  Subway station right outside too  If you intend to spend your time exploring the city and want a place thats clean to put your head down then this is for you  
P => Do not expect much First the price is great for NYC in the high season  But only go realizing you are getting what you pay for  The location is for the knowledgable NYC visitor otherwise you  find your self in a neighborhood you are not use tocomfortable with The cleanliness comments from past reviews are a mystery to me  I did not see many signs of a housekeeping staff  the rooms are very tired greatly in need of refurbishment On the plus side the front desk people are fine  And the coffee and pastry in the lobby in the morning are first rate  Also there are many nice little neighbood restaurants down th avenue or the meatpacking districtchelsea ket are not that far away  Also the location on the amp subway lines is also great  bottom line if price is the main factor this is the place but do not expect any more than what you are paying for  
P => A good choice My wife and I stayed at the Chelsea Savoy for three nights  We found our room to be clean with a comfortable bed  The bathroom was fine except for the paper thin towels  The hotel sits on an extremely noisy intersection with horns honking throughout the night  So dont expect tranquility  All in all a fair value for the price  
P => Great Place Perfect for enjoying the town      I have stayed at this hotel several times now and love the location  The hotel is clean and simple   no frills I have always found the staff extrememly freindly and helpful but be because I have stayed there  or  times now  I definitely recommend the Chelsea Savoy if you are looking for a simple inexpensive place to sleeprest and shower before exploring the town 
P => Great Place For NYC Visit Stayed there wmy  teenage kids for their first ever NYC visit  We had a quad wa roll away bed  The double beds were incredibly comfortable firm mattress wa featherbed on top very lux  The room was spacious clean and quiet  The bathrrom was large wfull size tub completely tiled  Newspaper was delivered to our door on weekdays brewed coffee and very good danish muffins rolls are provided in the lobby every AM  The staff was very helpful and friendly  BIG PLUS our flights arrived early AM and left late PM and we were allowed to store our luggage AT NO CHARGE before check in and after check out  The location is great Chelsea is a good walking neighborhood wshops restaurants and clubs nearby but the best was that the subway station was  doors down at the corner  Highly recommended and will be going back again   
P => Excellent Value Neighborhood and Clean For work and pleasure I travel to NYC frequently  I normally stay at a small ridiculously cheap place in Chelsea but this time was unable to find space there  Hence I came to the Chelsea Savoy with some hesitations Yet for a NY hotel in this location the Chelsea Savoy is an excellent value  Our room was clean surprisingly spacious and a relative bargain  For the traveler not looking for perks and pampering this is a terrific place  
P => Good price good location     Good value for the money and an excellent location Above the th Ave subway rd st for the  amp  lines  One block either way to the V amp F or AC amp E lines Quiet neighbourhood  
P => Pleasant stay     I had a pleasant stay at the Chelsea Savoy this past the staff was helpfull the rooms were nice and clean  the location was also perfect  away from the tourists in Times Square I would recomment this hotel to anyone wanting a more quotrealquot New York City experience  
P => A pleasant place This is a very nice hotel that I have been staying at for the past few years  Very convenient with subway right outside the door  Clean rooms and bathrooms  Quite roomy too with a closet and iron  Rates are very reasonable for NYC  Highly recommended  Only hassle would be parking your car  Garages nearby are VERY expensive  I lucked out and found a spot nearby on th Street just a five minute walk  But prepare to search long and hard if you dont want to shell out  bucks a day to park in garage  
P => Dissapointed

P => Trendy modern  not for all tastes This hotel is best for a romantic getaway type of deal  Id give this  stars were it not for the loud cracking noise from the heating system  The regular rate is  for a petite which is overpriced unless you can get an upgrade to a queen or larger  If you are into sleek dark masculine and more moderntrendy style its for you  If youre into classic warmth coziness than you should try something else  It has an excellent location  I got a special deal through hotels com at the last minute  They upgraded me to a queen room with a terrace which was awesome and probably worth the money    They also let me check in  hours early  The look is very dark masculine and romantic  Television behind the mirror nice entertainment system  Nice bath products and a sexy bathroom set up dark walls mirrored walls etc  It would not suit all peoples tastes its very modern and quotcoldquot  The staff is very helpful but not that friendly  There were loud crackingdrilling noises that I was told was due to the heating generator  I had to turn off the heat to get rid of the noise  I ordered room service for breakfast and it was neither generous nor that tasty  They give you cookies which is nice  Overall Id say good for the younger trendy set thats looking for a weekend away together  I liked the bathroom  Would not pay more than  to stay here   for that price you could find something nicer  
P => Great location and price    room had some flaws This is a boutique hotel just a stones throw from Times Square  It is on a lovely somewhat quiet street next to some beautiful historic properties  The Algonquin The Iroqouis are next door  There is a large Brooks Brothers store a few doors down  If you are looking for an inexpensive place to drop after a night of Times square or taking in some theater this could be for you  We got it for  a night on Hotwire   the other hotels I mentioned start their room rates at  a night  Sofitel is also on the street  a night So  this place is a quotbargainquotThat said  there were some real problems with our room  It was so dark  the lighting in there made it impossible to shave or do make up   I had to go into the hallway  The bedroom was SOOO tiny that I tripped on the baseboards every time I went to the bathroom  The bathroom is lovely almost the same size as the bedroom but again   poor lighting made it impossible to do anything in there There were some quotbells and whistlesquot which were nice   Frette linen and an ipod docking station  It was VERY clean  Wonderful cookies on our pillow at bedtime But I dont know if I would stay again  be I would   and just upgrade another  to a bigger room  
P => Lovely Hotel great staff and fantastic location Travelled for a long awaited weekend break to NY with my husband  We flew into Newark Airport and got the express but to Bryant Square which was only very short walk to the Hotel  Staff were very friendly on arrival and stored our bags until we could check in Room was lovely very clean and the bed was exceptionally comfy  The wardrobemini barsafedvd player were in a small closet in the wall but provided us with ample space for our stuff  We had a lovely sofatable and some chairs and drawers either side of the bed too  TV hidden behind a picture plenty of wall lights with handy dimmer and the bathroom had sliding door lovely large shower plenty of toiletries towels  Huge basin plenty of mirrors towels and dressing gowns  Morning newspaper on door before we were up and room cleaned to really high standards once we were out Staff couldnt do enough to help free internet passes on request prompt and efficient room service on the one night we used it  We didnt go to the DB restaurant whilst we were there but it looked lovely Check in and check out were fast and efficient all staff members we encountered were very pleasant without being overbearing  The location of the hotel was fabulous for my husbands first time to Manhattan   very short walk to Times Square and Grand Central either way and just off th Avenue  We had usual street noise from out th floor room but nothing too noisey Weve recommended this hotel to two people already and would definately stay there again if we wanted to be right in midtown  
P => City Gem with  drawback The City Club hotel offers an eclectic style for such an old City  All the buildings have a history about them  Not that the City Club doesnt  They have taken an old holel and given it a different feel  We loved the staff they were GREAT  I spran my ankle while visiting and they were quick to respond with ice  Our room safe needed a new battery and they quickly fixed that as well  The beds and linens are also top of the line  I have never slept that well out of town  Great location   very close to Times Square shopping and Theaters I enjoy smaller hotels as they seem more personable and City Club fits that model  With only  rooms it is fairly quiet for the city and not difficult to find your way around Here the drawback  The rooms are small  We did have a balcony witha ent view which made up for the size  I realize it is NY and a lot of the rooms are small in size  If you are staying for an extended period and have a lot of clothes you will be hard pressed to find someplace to put them  Closet space is shared with your refrigerator and you have a small night stand with  small drawers  If I was to make a recommendatation to the hotel if they could just find some way to create a bit more storage for your belongings they would be top notch  
P => An awful room in a good location The hotel advertises a quotdeluxe kingquot room  Says its open airy etc  But ours was tiny with barely enough space to get around the bed  The pocket door to the bathroom was very difficult to open and close  Lighting in both the room and the antiquated elevators is almost impossible to use for reading or getting the correct floor  Dont worry about the air and light because all the windows faced a brick wall  Otherwise the location is very good and the employees are helpful but the price and value are the worst weve experienced all over the world  Weve had much better values in most cities of Europe and Asia not to mention the rest of the U S  
P => Great Location Very nice hotel with great location  Good value for money 
P => Teeny Tiny Room We got placed in this hotel after a priceline search for a four star hotel in midtowntheater district  I know that rooms in NYC are small   I have stayed there before   but this was ridiculous The room would BARELY hold our double not queen bed  There was literally about  feet on each side of the bed for suitcases etc  The bathroom was nice if a bit outdated with a bidet and black ble  The hotel itself is definitely trying a bit too hard to be quottrendyboutiquequot  The hallways were all PITCH black with weird accent lighting  The elevators as well  The hotel itself is just very very tiny   the lobby is basically just one room with a tiny desk Our service was pretty non existent so cant really comment on that  Basically in the end I would not call this a  star hotel  More like   
P => After the shocka pleasant stay When booking this hotel through a booking agentwe expected two beds in our room  The exceptionally small room contained one double bedno chairsno table     very small    Those were the negatives  The bed was so very comfortablethe room very clean and the shower was amazing     especially appreciated after a long day of sightseeing and theater going in NY The staff was friendly andclearly do their best to accommodate their customers  The location is perfect and the hotel is so very quietWe would stay there again 
P => Great price good location excellent hotel I stayed at the City Club for  nights while on a business trip  I initially picked it only because of the location right across the street from where I needed to go but I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was for the price I was paying   a night with our corporate rate ROOMoration of the room is very modern  Have a super comfortable bed spacious bathroom and nice shower  The room itself is a little small   you open the door and the bed is pretty much right there and you stepped out of the bed you are pretty much in the bathroom  But even though its petite it contains all the essentials and comfort you need unless you want a desk to do work on   in which case there really isnt one LOCATIONThe location is very central  Being on th Street its only a few blocks from Times Square on one side and a few blocks from Grand Central on the other  There are a few subway stops within walking distanceMISCELLANEOUSThe reception has a booklet that you can pick out free DVDs from but I was too tired from work to borrow anything but it is a nice to have  Since there is a DVD player in the room I guess you can bring your own DVDs to watch too Every night I come back there is a plate of two cookies awaiting me   I thought that was a nice gesture  And when I first arrived I arrive really early and they allowed me to check right in so that was nice too  They dont have a gym but I think you can pay for a pass to use the NY Sports Club nearby  Although I dont think they open very late  
P => Dark and poky  There are better  boutique  hotels in NY Good location but hotel is dark and poky and not worth the money  Air conditioning in rooms too loud and becomes very annoying  More like a glorified youth hostel  
P => Good Location great service and style I travel to NY frequently for business  I saw City Club at a good rate online so I booked it as I needed a hotel that was centrally located and had a restaurant onsite for meetings  I was really pleased witht the service  My room was very comfortable  it had a queen sized bed great bath amenities fast wireless internet access  The restaurant was very good  The beds were really comfortable and the fresh cookies that greeted me when i got back to my room at night could not be beat  The service was very good  the staff always greeted me when i came in and out and the bellstaff was always there to open the door for me  Will stay here again and have recommended it to my colleagues  
P => Well located good service from young staff Im very positive about this hotel mainly because I got a very good deal from Expedia and then an upgrade when I checked in  So for about  I got a spacious by NYC standards room in a cool hotel thats perfectly located for sightseeing  You cant beat thatThe hotels location on West th St  is great    near all the action in Times Square but not as hectic  The staff at the front desk looked like they hadnt yet graduated from college but were among the most efficient and professional Ive encountered  DB Moderne one of NYs best mid priced restaurants can be reached through the hotel lobby and you can even put your restaurant tab on your hotel bill although the two businesses are arateOne amusing thing about the room or is that it tries to camouflage things  If the front desk neglect to tell you that the TV is behind the painting or wherever youd never find it  I thought at first there was no closet then realized it had been cleverly hidden with the wallpaper There were a few things I didnt care for  My room on the second floor faced the street and wasnt soundproof  The shower curtain didnt keep the water from splashing all over the floor But those are the only negatives I can think of  If you can snag a deal on this hotel by all means stay here 
P => very small rooms We should have read the earlier reviews because like Loveslife review   we also booked our room through hotwire and expected a nice  star hotel room   and yes we also got a deal   but then again when we arrived we learned that the only room we could have was a petite room with a double bed  The room was fine in its furnishings etc but given its size and having only a window to a brick wall it was claustraphobic  Unfortunately unlike Loveslife we were with two persons So there was no room to move and no space to put our suitcases in the end we put them on the floor in the shower  Furthermore the room didnt have a fridge or safe  It is indeed likely that the larger rooms are very nice and the location is great  Just know what you are booking and if the price is right and you dont mind being in a closet   even if it is a nice closet  it is worth it   with many thanks to Loveslife 
P => Just a little more forethought City Club at  West th street was a great location a good deal cost wise small but sufficient room exceptionally clean room and building friendly and knowledgeable front desk teams confortable bed as I was lead to expect from other reviews BUT we ordered breakfast through room service for two the catch being there was only one chair in the room  So someone had to picnic on the bed  In addition we ordered two different kinds of tea but one the insulated carafes had been used for coffee so frequently it was still stained with coffee residue  When we opended that one we thought the order had been misread and then sent one coffee and one tea  It even gave that pot of tea a bit of coffee flavor  These are really picky things I have to admit and they will not discourage me from stayting at City Club again  Over all it was ideal for a nights rest after the theater  
P => be careful what size room you book I booked my room through hotwire and expected a nice  star hotel room   and yes I got a deal   but then again when i arrived I learned that the only room I could have was a petite room with a double bed  The room was fine in its furnishings etc but given its size and having only a window to a brick wall it was claustraphobic  It was a least good that I was alone  My guess is that the larger rooms are very nice and the location is great   Just know what you are booking and if the price is right and you dont mind being in a closet   even if it is a nice closet  it is worth it   
P => A little gem in the heart of the city This was an exceptional place to stay from when we first disembarked our cab upon arrival till they held the door open for us to depart  The service by every member of the staff was so fantastic that in our short stay we ended up on a first name basis with a number of them  Any request was met with politeness and efficiency Room was a ent size for NYC esp for the price and the location could not have been more ideal in terms of its proximity to the subway and numerous sites of interest Loved that the TV was tucked away and the bed and day sitting area was super comfortable  The bathroom was stocked with fine toiletries and everything was very clean and well appointed My husband and I had breakfast in the restaurant downstairs and everything was very tasty  Room felt very quiet for the city as it is on a  lane street    some traffic noise but nothing that was prevented a pleasant stay Would definitely stay here again not only because the room was comfortable and nice but mostly because the service was so outstanding  
P => Exceptional Service This is an amazing hotel situated in the center of Manhattan  From the moment we stepped into the lobby to the time we checked out the service and staff were incredible  We stayed in the King Luxe room which was incredibly spacious and very stly appointed  Our room had a day bed over looking th street and a TV behind our full length mirror Such a creative use of space  My favorite part about our room were the oversized chocolate ble bathrooms  Our rate included complimentary wifi passes to the New York Sports Club and discounted parking across at the parking garage across the street  And I can not leave out that the hotels restaurant is one of Daniel Bouluds We were able to order a fantastic French continental breakfast in the morning followed by our pre theatre dinner later that night Over all I had a fantastic experience at City Club My only regret is that I was unable to stay longer 
P => Great location and environment Im still lhing about the comment below regarding lack of TV in the room  The TV is behind a glass wall   when its off its as if it werent there  Anyhow I have stayed numerous times in this hotel since it first opened and if youre a theatre goer this is one of the most amazing locations  The Red Flame diner a few doors down is a gem plus DB Moderne is one of the best restaurants in NYC  I love staying at this hotel  
P => Beautiful stylish design has best restaurant in Times Square area  We loved this boutique hotel on one of the best blocks near Times Square  We could easily go to the theater or walk Fifth Avenue to Rockefeller center and shopping  The design was amazing   oversized ble bathrooms and the televisions were ingeniously hidden behind two way mirrors which were controlled by pointing the remote at the full length mirror  The room service by the Daniel Boulud DB Bistro Restaurant was the perfect french breakfast and we enjoyed their famous although expensive   foie gras and truffle hamburger Service was extremely helpful and friendly   Emanuel at the front desk arranged theater tickets for us and dinner reservations at some difficult to get into restaurants  Overall we had a great stay and recommend this hotel 
P => Perfect Getaway The City Club provided the perfect setting for our recent romantic getaway to New York   We were allowed to check in  hours early   the staff and service was excellent   there is discounted garage parking across the street   the room was larger than expected for such a boutique hotel   room and bathroom were clean   trendy modern or throughout   there is free internet access and a free computer to use on the second floor lounge  the restaurant next door is supposed to be amazing   however we didnt eat there bc we wanted to explore other parts of the city while some might be turned off from the quotdarkquot feel throughout the hotel dim lighting dark earth tones in the bathrooms etc    we thought it only added to the experience  the biggest drawback was the view of the brick wall and the bathroom was small but ample  however we werent in the room much its New York after all so it didnt really bother us at all by far the hotels greatest asset is its location  nestled right between th and th avenue and just blocks away from Times Square Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building the only time we had to hop in a cab was to explore greenwhich village and the financial district we would stay at the City Club again in a heartbeat    
P => Nice hotel We found this hotel thanks to a New York city guide of a Belgian Newspaper  The review on this hotel was really good so we ided to try it out and were not disappointed  All the staff were helpful and very friendly The room was very nice and big enough and the bathroom large but as already said in previous reviews the closet could be bigger and the AC less noisyreally too noisy to be able to sleep  The location is also perfect  We did all our visiting trips by foot and we were able to find good restaurants at night within walking distance  For this we used the Zagat restaurant guide we found in the room  However the best dinner we had was at the DB Bistro  Service and food were perfect  If we have one negative rek about the hotel it is the absence of a comfortable bar where you can enjoy a drink before or after dinner and relax in a comfortable atmosphere after a long day out  The first night we went to the DB bistro as suggested on the website but as from pm the place is full of people having dinner  We went elsewhere the other nights Anyway if you are looking for a comfortable small hotel with great service this is the place to be  
P => Great Beds We booked this hotel through Quickbook at the last minute  We often do quick NYC get a ways when we can get reasonable last minute rates  We have stayed at many NYC boutique hotels including  Columbus The Benjamin Hotel Giraffe The Muse etc   We will definitely add The City Club to our list  We had booked a queen but because they had availability they met our request for a quiet room and upgraded us to a king at no additional cost  They also met our request for a later check out at   There are many great restaurants near by and we had dinner at Triumph next door at the Iroquois Hotel which was very nice  Im sure the hotel restaurant is very nice too but quite pricey  The fabulous location enabled us to walk to Central Park one day and we walked home from Soho the night before  Very pleasurable all round experience cant complain about a thing 
P => Love love love this hotel This is a wonderful fantastic place to stay in NYC It is so friendly yet professional and the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy  The room was fabulous super comfortable luxurious and well just perfect  Its small and intimate and beats the choices in the s amp Broadway by a mile  All the grace luxury and class of the chain luxury hotels with none of the pretense  The location is perfect  Just steps away from the theatres and several amazing bistrorestaurants that feel like neighborhood places just outside the door  Now I wont stay anywhere else when in the city  
P => A for effort City Club is a small boutique hotel in a great central location in midtown Manhattan  Staff was very helpful and accommodating  Rooms are a little on the small side with no view not surprising in Manhattan  The fabric wallpaper is showing a lilttle wear and tear but the room was clean  Bathroom was great with good quality soap and shampoo water pressure in the shower that would blow you down the block Hotel was quiet and rooms have black out shades for great sleeping Turn down service came with killer chocolate chip cookies  Staff recommended the restaurant next door DB Bistro Moderne for lunch   which was terrific There is a large fitness club a few doors down to which guests have complimentary access Only real complaint about the hotel was that despite the property being a non smoking hotel our room reeked of smoke  Suspect that because of fabric wallpaper the smell is difficult to get out but it was off putting Room rate was competitive with other hotels of its class  Did get a much better rate off Expedia than I was offered when I called the hotel directly  Overall would definitely stay there again  
P => Hip Quiet and Relaxing  Perfect for business  I travel frequently for business and have stayed in many hotels in NYC  I find myself coming back time and time again  The rooms are quite large by NYC standards very well appointed and quiet  The bathrooms are among the best of any hotel I have stayed at  The room service from db Bistro is likely the best you will find at any hotel albeit a bit pricy  The cleaning staff has never once knocked or intruded while I am there   they seem to have a th sense about when to come and clean  One tip is to request a room at the front of the hotel  This will give you better daylight and a nice view of W  th but it can be at the expense of some traffic noise  
P => Perfect spot I booked this hotel as a surprise trip to New York for my boyfriends th birthday  I chose it because of the location and because hes into technology and it looked right up his street plus the beds looked huge and sumptuous A nice touch having the tv hidden behind the mirror and a CD player to create some abience The only downside was the view    there wasnt one  But seeing as we didnt spend too much time in there anyway we werent complaining Great spot to get around Manhatten as its literally around the corner from Times Square  Theres also a great little diner a few doors down which the staff recommended  Cant remember the name but we ate breakfast there each morning   deliciousWe had one minor issue whilst staying there and this was the  hour room service  We tried to order food at  and there were no staff to fulfill it so we went to bed hungry  Plus the juice in the mini fridge was well past its sell by date  However when I told them they went out and bought us back a big carton of Tropicana so we were happy with that  
P => Pleasant botique Pros great location for most tourists parking garage across the street well appointed but simple room with big nice bed moody lighting black ble bathroom with nice toiletries turndown service with cookies a nice touch complimentary DVDs to borrow surprisingly good sized room by New York standards Cons most rooms have a poor view closet is small but really not THAT much different from any other hotel poor writing desk television not at a great angle Im really stretching for negatives here Would definitely stay again  Very nice gay friendly hotel  
P => True definition of a hip boutique hotel wonderful location If price is not on your mind this hotel is spectacular Lots of hotels spend thousands on a snazzy lobby but shabby rooms but City Club Hotel did something out of the ordinary  Its a very simple and small lobby to check in just adjacent to an excellent restaurant but the rooms are elegant and dramatic Ipod alarm clocks ble bathrooms Hermes bath amenities extremely comfortable beds and a free business computer on the nd floor made my stay very enjoyableThe lobby is light and airy in contrast the rooms are quite dark and masculine but still comfy  I would not recommend to stay here on business just because they focused on mood lighting and not desk work stations  If you want your own quiet corner of NYC just steps away from Times Sq you need to stay here  The staff were accomodating and helpful  
P => Truly lovely small hotel After hours and hours of searching for a nice quiet hotelduring the holiday season in NYC we found the gem inCity Club Hotel  The rooms were perfect the bathroomsso up to date and hip and the staff was among the bestweve encountered  The assistant g m  is so attentive andgenerous with her time the front desk people are delightfuland the doormen can make your day  The smallest thingscan make a trip worthwhile  They found out that I was acoffee quotaddictquot and made sure I had a new coffeemaker in myroom with supplies  The restaurant attached to the hotel isbeautiful although we only ate there once during our five days Order the bagel and lox from the hr menu late one nightP S  Wonderful beds and linens  
P => Great location otherwise mediocre Plusses  excellent location   walk to everything in Midtown  in the same block as the Algonquin Hotel the Iriquois the Harvard Club and the New York Yacht Club  near Times Square if thats what you want  easy to walk to Rockefeller Center  friendly staff calls you by name all the time  superb beds   so so cookies on your pillow at night  you can open your window if you get a room overlooking th street    to listen to all the Times Square noise  yes they are wireless    and they have ONE public computer on the second floorNegatives  typically they run late when you want to check in  You  have to wait an hour or so on the second floor   very noisey   jack hammers start nearby at am amp go all day  clothes closet for bedroom is  feet by  feet very small  no coffee maker in room but theres a quotdiner likequot restuarant in the same block and a McDonalds two blocks away  no ventilation fan in the bathroom  Mirrors steam up   lighting is tricky  You have to find the dimmer switch  The reading lights over the beds are useless   TV speakers blare in the bedroom AND the bathroom   Bathroom is a black ble very masculine Again a GREAT LOCATION within walking distance to everything in Midtown but otherwise very mediocre  
P => Great food not really an hotel You arrive at a small desk to check in there is no public area and no hotel atmosphere but the staff is nice and involved The room was extremely small even for NY not mint dated with a view to a wall  You can hear the noise from the corridor only covered by the noise from the street in the morning  There is no reading light  The TV set can only be seen standing Room service from the DB restaurent is efficient and excellent The breakfast its brioche and the whole menu is to die for Nicely located on th street but prefere the Sofitel next door better value better rooms better atmosphere you can go to DB for breakfast next door  
P => Shame on the City Club Hotel  In all fairness the City Club Hotel was at one time my favorite place to stay in the city  I was a frequent guest from the time it first opened in  until a year ago I recently returned for a  night business stay and booked a King Deluxe room online using the hotels website What a huge disappointment it was compared with my past experiences  Before this one I always enjoyed my stays largely due to the staff and their attention to service  From the onset the Front Desk staff was aloof and indifferent  When the room type I had reserved was not available I was put into a smaller room type without warning or explanation The attitude and overall demeanor of the European woman who checked me in was just plain lousy  Her English was ridiculous and she spoke much too fast which made it even more difficult to understand  Generally she acted as though she just wanted to get rid of me and did not try to hide it  Shame on her and on the City Club Hotel The beds are still very comfortable but the rooms showed major signs of wear and tear  Frayed carpeting overly worn towels stained and threadbare robes obsolete entertainment system scuff ks on walls and doors loose tiles on walls of bathroom For the very high prices that the City Club Hotel is charging I could have stayed in a more trendy hotel in a neighborhood that doesnt close down as early as that one does At least now my colleagues and I know not to return we shall try one of the newer better located hotels which charge the same rates  
P => Lovely beds The standard of this hotel is very high for being New york  Nice beds great minibar professional staff  Housekeeping does a great job and will never miss a thing  Turndown service is also a pleasant treat  
P => Cannot beat it Second time ive stayed at this property and it just gets better everytime  The staff are the most helpful and gracious i have ever ecountered in NY  The rooms are spacious and extremeley clean  Beds are out of this world  Great location to everything will always make this my home when in Mahattan Keep it up City Club 
P => Fantastic We arrived at the hotel after a long flight and were immediatley greated by friendly and professional reception staff  As we were staying at the hotel for  days they had given us a room on the top floor with a balcony  Which was fantastic to have a bit of extra space  Plus as it was very warm whilst we were there it was lovely to sit out at night and in the mornings  The staff at the hotel were fantastic booking restaurants and cars for us  In regards to the rooms I was surprised as we booked a queen room which should have been around sq feet  The room was definatley smaller than I expected although it didnt turn out to be a problem and we did have the added bonus of a roof terrace  The bed was comfortable and the room was cean and airy i loved the bathrooms and all the amenities  However I must say that I was very surprised for the price of the hotel that there was not a coffee or tea maker in the room  This was a big dissapointment and would definatley make me consider staying here again  I know it is only a small detail however it is nice to have the choice of a hot drink when you get up in the morning  We were very happy with the hotel in all and found the location prefect for a sightseeing and shopping holiday in the city  Being only a short walk from th avenue and minutes from Grand central station it was fantastic  And if you stay you have to try the DB Bistro for dinner or room service  The burgers are amazing 
P => Hated it Too masculine and dark If a mens club feel is what youre after then I guess youd like this place  However as a woman traveling alone on business it was quite a depressing place  First of all it is not easy to find  The main entrance consists of a single glass door squeezed between their restaurant and another hotel  The doorman at the Soffitel next door didnt even know where it was when I asked for directions  A corridor masquerades for a lobby that leads to a dark blackbrown tiny reception desk my kitchen at home is bigger than this lobby  Only saw two staffers on entry and exit in the lobby  One at the desk and the other at the door  The corridors leading to the guest rooms are narrow and dark with low lighting and dark walls and doors  Once inside the rooms are no better  Small rooms low lighting dark or dark brown tile on the floor stark in furnishings  Very much a mans retreat  The bath was all dark brown granite no tub   just a large open concept shower  Even the Bigelow toiletries were in dark brown bottles  Having forgotten my shampoo I used the hotel provided one Hermes and now smell like Im wearing mens cologne  The room had two old fashioned wooden paned windows on either side of the bed neither of which opened  However you wouldnt have wanted them to open anyway since the glass was dirty with soot and both faced out to other similar old buildings whose windows were only about  feet away  The window coverings were only pull down shades that were a dirty beige one of which had a huge patch of a different color right in the middle  Given the horrible condition of the windows and the non existent view I kept the shades down the entire time  This only added to the dark depressing feeling of the room The bed also faced directly toward the entry door and the TV was hidden behind some artwork built into the wall beside the bed  You couldnt see the TV from bed without getting a crick in your neck but had a clear view of the brown entry door  I would not recommend this hotel  
P => Great Hotel I just got back from NYC and  nights at the City Club  I read the reviews on here before booking it but made the res in spite of some idedly negative reviews  I am glad I did because I absolutely enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again  The staff was very good overall  though some definitely more helpful than others  The cookies at turn down were great as was the location of the hotel  I was on a media tour and we were smack in the middle of everywhere we needed to be  My standard room was actually much larger than i was anticipating as was the bathroom  The towels bed and amenities were great  I love moderncontemporary design and felt the hotel was designed in great taste My only minor complaints had to do with a fixed AC temp of  degrees which was a little chilly for me and a low level of light  If you really wanted to get a lot of work or reading done in the room youd be stuck sitting on the bed or camped in the bathroom  Luckily that wasnt the case for me  Also the bathroom outlet was hard to find  I saw that another reviewer said there wasnt one  be they just couldnt find it which isnt a good thing One more note  i think some people are put off by the lack of a lobby  On the same block there are many fancy hotels to have a drink and loiter in and I actually enjoyed the fact that ours wasnt going to turn into party central  Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and stay there again  
P => Nice hotel I enjoyed my stay at the City Club  Its a small intimate place with a lot of personality  Feels like a private club  The location is very central close to Bryant Park Grand Central and Times Square  The City Club is right next to the Algonquin the Iroquois the Sofitel and the Royalton  There is no ostentatious sign outside so its easy to miss it  The lobby is very small and more like the entrance of an upscale residence  My room was on the th floor and the size was ent  It was very clean and perfectly orated with a very upscale masculine feel  The bathroom was very classy both in size design black ble and for the top quality amenities Hermes and Bigelow  I especially loved the shower  The hotel was quiet with a limited number of rooms and guests  All in all I cant complain about anything  The price   though relatively high   was quite acceptable by New York standards  Business hotel chains  offer large rooms but they can hardly match the classy intimate atmosphere of the City Club  Would definitely return to the City Club  
P => Great Hotel but some problems I really likied this hotel and would consider staying there again  However although the staff is very cordial and efficient they are not very sophisticated and could use to stay on top of the latest happenings in NYC  Also my room did not have any bathroom outlets or a desk and chair something that is standard at any Days Inn  Other than that the hotel was cozy quiet and substantially upscale more like a private club than a hotel  
P => Chic Style No Substance The quotchic boutiquequot hotel category was at first a welcome and refreshing change from stale corporate mega hotels and down  in  the  dumps road warrior outposts  Many of the first entrants really transformed the usual hotel stay into a wonderful and exciting getaway with non boring rooms and or interesting public spaces and above all above the ordinary levels of personal service As the category grew however style began to trump substance  Name brand owner personalities mattered more than professional hospitality  Over indulged interior orators exercised their creative vision while actual comfort and service were after thoughts  The City Club sadly falls into this latter description The front desk staff are obviously chosen for their looks rather than for any particular talent in professional hospitality so dont ask for anything out of the ordinary or have a problem that they cant immediately solve  In our case the sheets one night of our stay caused a horrendous rash on both of us neither of us has a tendency towards sensitive skin by the way but trying to get any action from the front desk or housekeeping was a painfully drawn out affair The rooms themselves while visually interesting at first are impractical with relatively few useful light sources places to sit or hang ones clothing  In our case the windows could not be opened and perhaps it was just as well as they were filthy with dirt and cobwebs  Apparently the lovely staff dont stoop to actually clean We ate in the restaurant adjacent to the hotel one of a series run by celebrity for those who care about such things chef Daniel Boulud  One of the bragging points of the place is that he sells the most expensive hamburger in the worldquot  Apparently this is a place for the pretty people to see and be seen by each other   there was a lot of posing going on there    but the food was quite enjoyable so we just considered it part of the floor show The hotels location is very close to Times Square so that is great if you want that but be aware that theres virtually no lobby or public area to greet visitors or wait for friends and the front door opens out to a busy street without a turn in for your cab so it can be tough checking in and out with luggage  Your stylish and good looking porters wont exactly hustle but they do sport little ear pieces to be in touch with the front desk or at least look kinda cool A one time only visit for us  
P => Mixed feelings this time Ive loved this hotel since it opened  Stayed here   times for a night or two  This time came for almost a week and persuaded friends from L A  who were also coming to NYC to stay at the City Club  The location cant be beat  The staff are friendly and always helpful  Housekeeping is excellent and thorough But     the bloom is off the rose  There was the elevator that didnt work one day and no one seemed to know why not then the bathroom door that was off its track and no one could figure out how to get it back so it required brute force to open and close then the toilet that needs a new flapper valve so that it closes each time and room service who ided quotyou must have an old menuquot but wouldnt bring a current one upstairs  I still like this place  I like it a lot  But after the latest visit I will check out other new places before automatically coming back here  The NYC hotel scene is highly competitive   at current rates youve got to stay on top of your game I hope the City Club management can kick it up a notch  
P => Great Spot small trendy hotel with a nice feel to it  very comfortable beds nice ble bath contemporary warm not to far over the top perfect mid town location  We had a second floor room and had no problem sleeping  nice staff  perfect for our needs  
P => thrilled with this find Very lovely quiet cool or great location  Spent  nights there with my sister and mother in one of their suites  our New York friends thought it was a great find  we were thrilled  
P => stop that infernal racket My stay in Manhattan could have been a much nicer one had i known about the construction going on here I arrived late at night for a  night business trip  The construction started at  in the morning and continued until  at night I dont know what I would have done had I been with my wife for a relaxing stay  As mine was for business I had to get up early anyway  It still bothered me though that I wasnt informed about this inconvenience when I booked the room The manager refunded some money back to me but it was too little too late I would have preferred to stay elsewhere  
P => Nice Hotel I stayed at the city club for the first time in ch  The small hotel is very nice quite and has a feel of quality   the reception staff was delightful  The room was a little dark for working but high on design    the bath room was the best Overal this was a great find in a city where it is sometimes had to sleep 
P => very nice room The rooms at this hotel are very nice  Large ble bathrooms  Service is okay  Overall this is a quiet nice place to stay  
P => What a mistake I travel regularly for business and always stay at The Sunset Tower when Im in LA  I am always pleased with the service so I ided to give the sister property in New York a try  What a mistake  The hotel is no where near the level of The Sunset Tower  The rooms were ok but the service was terrible  Clearly the management of the hotel needs to be re evaluated  The staff seemed clueless and no one was eager to please at all  When Im travelling I am generally stressed and dont feel like dealing with incompetence  There was confusion at check in and I was downgraded to a room that supposedly had a queen sized bed though I cant say I believe it was  Room service was a disaster  I kept being transferred between the restaurant and the front desk with no one wanting to actually take my order  Like I said Im a frequent traveler so I understand that things can go wrong but this hotel was just not up to my standards  I wont be staying there in the future nor will I reccomend it to anyone else  Im hoping that The Sunset Tower keeps its standards a bit higher and doesnt follow suit and become a mess like the City Club 
P => Wonderful Christmas stay at the City Club My husband and I spent six days at the City Club celebrating our wedding anniversary  It was the week before Christmas and we were looking for an intimate centrally located hotel which would give us easy access to all the holiday sights of Manhattan  As it turned out we were delighted with our choice and would definitely stay here again  For a start we were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room second floor facing the street   we entertained six people for drinks with no difficulty whatsoever  Comfortable bed and furniture   great bathroom with excellent products and wonderful shower  I missed having a bathtub but apparently there are some rooms that do  Maid service was thorough and reliable   they leave huge and delicious chocolate chip cookies as part of their quotturn downquot routine   a mixed blessing if youve just had an enormous dinnerHowever what really set this trip apart was the charming and helpful staff  It seemed as if nothing was too much trouble for any of them and every request   tickets a cab a dinner reservation directions info  about skating shopping etc  etc    was handled efficiently with a smile  We never had to wait for help at the front desk which can sometimes be a problem in larger hotels   and people like David and iette  started to feel almost like friends by the end of the week As with any hotel there were some minor negatives   the lobby is very small and waiting there would be a problem as theres nowhere to sit  The room could definitely do with more storage  and theres no point in having an quotinvisiblequot closet door that wont stay closed Some reviews mentioned the lack of lighting in the bathroom but there is in fact a less than obvious dimmer switch   be a small discreetly placed sign would help All in all  we had a fabulous time  Thank you City Club for making our special trip one to remember  well be back 
P => Nice room  Weak service  We stayed at the City Club Hotel for a four night vacation over the long weekend  I am an experienced traveller having been around the world for business and pleasure staying in a variety of accomodations this was my rd stay in NYC  The purpose of our trip was a vacation and for that the hotels location was ideal although th and th proved to be a mighty busy intersection  FYI   The street in front of the hotel is the shalling area for parades on th ave The check in at the hotel was uneventful and efficient as it should be  We were checked into the nd floor  which was facing the street more on that later  The stairs were inconveniently located and rather creepy so we used the elevators no problems there The king room was large clean and just really nice in general with a really huge plasma TV on the wall no mirror setup that other reviews have complained about  It really is a comfortable room  The king mattress was sub par compared to similar class hotels that I have stayed at  Specifically the mattress felt old and the bedding had a distinct albeit faint odour of curry nice on my dinner plate not so nice in my bed  The bathroom was perfect except for a door that would not close  The scuffing on the floor was evidence that this was not a new problem and indicative of a poor maintanence budget in the hotel or simply a lack of caring The shower curtain was clear plastic for those of you who like to view yourself in the wall sized mirror while you shower  Some positive features   free wireless internet speed was best Ive seen for a hotel and the housekeeping was excellent Overall noise levels at night were indeed quite high  The street noise was beyond tolerable levels on Thursday night as the windowswalls had very little soundproofing capability  I live in a busy city street myself and am quite accostomed to sleeping with sirens car honking etc  but this was quite bad  Everything from the Friday morning garbage pick up to the taxi honking  A visitor from the midwest suburbs would probably remain sleepless  A city dweller would not care so much The desk staff were useless not to be confused with the very helpful doormen  Keep in mind that we have high expectations for a hotel on this level  Plain and simple the skillsets they displayed are not on par with either the room price the claims put forth by the hotel or the previous reviews on this website fakes  First test I called the day before our arrival to make a simple request that flowers be in our room for our arrival and cost added to my bill  quotJonathanquot assured me this was a piece of cake and would be taken care of  Strike one   no flowers no apologies no nothing  Next we attempted to procure some advice from the desk on nightlife options  Wow they looked like we asked them for directions to s  They were lame and unprepared for standard service requests throughout the stay  Strike two and three  Bottom line   this hotel desperately needs a concierge  Or retraining for exisiting staff I think its only pretending to be a full service hotel  Theyve made their money and now its not worth their effort to maintain because people like me keep showing up and giving them money  At check out the staff did not even ask us if we had any comments so its clear that they are not interested in pleasing their customers  That said the room was great and the location was terrific  So if you are willing to pay the money and get zero from the staff or be you are a business traveller then you might give this a  star rating  
P => Reakable Hotel My newly fianc  and I just returned from our  night stay at City Club Hotel  We booked one of their Grand Duplex Suites which in my opinion is an understatement  Our room was beyond words The hotel is located on the north side of th St  between th and th Ave  It is also sandwiched between the Algonquin and Iroquois Hotels and across from the quotfamousquot Royalton  The doorman Ray showed us up to the room and gave us a brief overview of how everything works in the room  We walked in to the perfectly dimmed room with smooth jazz Christmas carols playing all throughout the suite  The spiral staircase to the bedroom instantly grabs your eyes  Once you look beyond that you see the giant floor to ceiling windows with a door that leads to your own private terrace that overlooks th st  To the left is toward th ave to the right is Times Square which is literally   blocks or a   minute walk  Once we got done talking in the sights sounds and smells of the city we ran upstairs to check out the bedroom and bathroom  The bedroom is partitioned only by a glass railing that allows you to look outside as well as downstairs  The bed is extremely comfortable especially after an exhausting day of walking all over the city  The bath has a lot of charm as well  I didnt think that Id like the chocolate ble but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it in person  It really bring an elegant look to the bath  The shower isnt very wide but could comfortably fit two There is also an automated privacy shade that cover the entire length of the floor to ceiling windows They offer a breakfast as room service or available for dine in at the db Bistro Moderne for    We never got a chance to check it out but there is a great place a few doors down toward th Ave and Times Square called The Red Flame which has great food service and pricesIf you are looking for a place to unwind and have a few drinks be sure to check out OLunneys  Its on th St  between th amp th Ave  Paul the bartender is funny and keeps you on your toes One night we went over to the bar at the Royalton and it was about as expected a hipster bar with hipster prices  OLunneys is  for  for the money compared to the Royalton  Overall my experience with the City Club was amazing  The entire staff was amazing and extremely helpful My only complaint was that the downstairs TV didnt work initially  I called the front desk and they immediately sent someone to fix it  We then found that the remote didnt work and was missing a battery however when the bellman came up with the battery the remote still didnt work  The bellman must had left and came back   times trying to fix the remote before finally getting frustrated and giving up  Ultimately it never got fixed but we were OK with that because we would rather enjoy listening to the soft jazz over the TV  
P => Best Kept Secret To end our Honeymoon that took us to Grand Cayman Island and Miami my wife and I checked into the City Club  To best describe the hotel Ill describe its neighbors  Across the street is The Royalton an Ian Schreggar property that is consistent with the quazi club feeling of the lobby complete with ample seating hip crowd and drink service  A few doors down The Sofitel guardian of the epi european inspired lodging experience  If you are cant envision the feeling of the City Club make note that this block also includes the Harvard Club Yacht Club New York Bar Association and Princeton Club  OK    now youre getting it  The most priveledged little street in NY with its requisite understatement  The City Club has amazingly taken in all of these accounts as its own  Its non descript signage  a visiting friend couldnt find it having walked past the entrance twice and cozy loby with a front desk that should only accomodate one but always seemed to hold three ready to accomodate staffers give the feeling of a very private place to be  Yet dont think heavy wooden beams and shelving and superflous cabinetry  Rather the design of City Club is neat soft and airy  It seems to have the cool feel of the Royalton just not the space  It soon becomes evident that this is by design  I booked our room directly through the company site and indicated that this was our honeymoon  We were given a wonderful room overlooking th St  which easily was the most lodging space Ive ever experienced in Manhattan  The design while efficent is not actually modern but more transitional  Cool guy features include Ipod Docking alarm clock a television that shows through wall mirror and the ultimate answer to in room entertainment a complimentary list of DVDs to be delivered from the front desk  A courtesy bottle of wine and cookies awaited us in our room  We quickly felt torn between exploring the city or soaking up this unique experience  We ided to go walk about which is the second reason to stay here  Cool things are steps ahead  We did take a drink at the Royalton which confirmed our suspcicions great place for cocktails probably not a place to lay your head  We attempted to hang at the Sofitel but the place seemed to be oover run with families and fuddy duddies  Of course neither group is bad except if youre looking to kick it in NY to round out your honeymoon  OK back to the City Club    we ided to go in and reqroup  We saw our favorite bellman  A breif aside explains why  We drove up to NY from DC in our White Yukon Denali  Upon arriving at the Hotel while my wife remained in the truck I got the attention of the bellman and explained that we were checking in needed help with baggage and inquired about valet parking  However each of my requests seemed to be a slight disconnect for him  After asking if all of the luggage needed to be collected he informed me that I could park in front of the door  Which if you know NY is the craziest thing ever suggested  While he showed my now disembarking wife to the room and managed the bags another staffer said nothing about parking on the street but directed me to a garage and even held traffic so I could make the manuever  When I arrived to our room my wife was lhing with tears in her eyes  Apparently my odd interaction with the bellman was because he thought she was a celebrity and I was her driver  Apparently Yukons are now the fleet of the chic my all black outfit appeared more uniform then stylish and her waiting in the truck with sunglasses and fur coat all communicated something different to someone who obviously has gotten used to a very different clientle  We got the biggest kick out of it and shared lhs with the staff about our new found celebrity for the rest of our visit  If there is an achilles heel for this place it is only that room service appears to come from a diner a few doors down the street  In winter this almost gurantees that your food can not be piping hot  Although since it i s adiner it seems almost any request can be satisfied  I know this isnt a traditional hotel review about towels and high speed internet but thats because this is not a traditonal hotel  Its a place that serves as base of operations for hanging in the city and returning to a quiet comfortable and upscale environment to recharge your batteries only to do it all over again  Cheers 
P => Great stay at the City Club I was going for an overnight trip to New York and knew that I would not be spending much time in my room  So I was looking for a nice stylish hotel in a good location at a good price  I managed to snag a  rate from Quikbook for a quotpetitequot room and it was perfect for my needs  The room was small   not much bigger than the double bed   but I expected that  It was beautifully appointed and stylishly orated  TV DVD player mini bar tucked away  The ble clad bathroom was very nice with plenty of towels and Hermes products  There were even a couple of fresh chocolate chip cookies at the end of the day  And the NY Times at my door in the morning  The room might be tight for  people and it would be too small if I was staying for a few days  But there are larger rooms that are very nice   I looked in one as I went down the hallway  My only complaint is that the tile in the hallway echoes any footsteps that go by your door  Its not a big deal but carpeting would deaden the noise  The reception and doormen were friendly and helpful  The lobby is small and connects to the well rated DB Moderne restaurant where meals can be taken  Im a pretty tough critic of hotels but I would stayat the City Club again  
P => Loved it Recently stayed at the City Club for four nights  Wonderful stay We were upgraded to a King and found the rooms to be very clean and comfortable Loved the dark colors the privacy the cookies on our pillows every night The staff were curteous  Location in midtown perfect for theatre proximity to Times Square and easy access to the subway to other parts of town Would absolutely stay here again anytime 
P => Problem with Booking Online We booked a stay at the City Club for mid y   We booked the reservation on the hotels website and thought we booked a queen sized room  When we arrived and despite the email confirmation I received and had with me the hotel informed us that the only available room was a petite room which was a full bed in a room that would have been better as a itors closet because it was so small  Although the bathroom was lovely my husband and I barely fit in the room together  The TV was not a flat screen but rather a  inch regular old TV  What a disappointment  We were told that the hotels computerized booking system erred and resulted in us booking the wrong room  To his credit the hotel manager tried to find us a room at another nearby hotel but apparently they were sold out as well  The manager then discounted our rate gave us a bottle of wine and free breakfast for the two mornings of our stay  The only reason I would stay here again is that the manager kept in email contact with me I preferred email    he offered to call instead regarding our room and was quite helpful  The room however was so small and the bed so uncomfortable that next time rather than take the chance of this type of error happening again Id probably stay at the sort of big hotel I was trying to avoid in the first place  
P => Stylish Little Gem If youre looking for a stylish small hotel and are more of an Armani than Versace person then look no further  My husband and I have had the good fortune to stay in some amazing hotels around the world   from country houses to trendy boutiques to spot on large hotels like The Mandarin Oriental and The Four Seasons  The style of City Club is low key and I say this as a compliment  Its a small unassuming hotel offering excellent service and a perfect place to rest your head in chic comfort  Location wise its on a fairly quiet street perfect for Midtown th Avenue Central Park and Times Square   for venturing further we never had more than a minute wait in hailing a cab  What makes the service stand apart from many other trendy hotels is that it did feel personal         returning after a long hot day and many a late evening of exploring this ever changing city it felt unusual and uplifting to be recognised and acknowledged as guests of the hotel and for our day to be enquired of by the staff  The guys at City Club are just spot on     happy for a start welcoming courteous and extremely willing to offer suggestions and recommendations  The only downside of writing this review is that it means our holiday is now over and im back in Ol Blightly      I could have quite easily of taken up residence  
P => Highly Recommend City Club My fiance and I just returned from a  night stay at the City Club Hotel  This is a unique alternative to the more mainstream name brand hotels out there  Very quaint modern or although some rooms were a bit small it really provides all that is needed  If you are looking for a quiet comfortable place to lay your head at night this is a great place  The bed was very comfortable  The nd floor provides a comfortable quiet space to spread out   with internet access  The location is one of the best  Just a block or two from th Avenue and high end shopping with a short cab ride to the south into Greenwich Village area  It really is a very central location and is removed from the craziness of Times Square  Its actually a very quiet street  The staff were very friendly and accomadating and provided information on what to do and where to go  Its small enough that they actually recognize you after a day and greet you with a warm smile upon entering to retire for the night  That was really nice something you dont get with a larger hotel group  Continental breakfast was provided every morning which was also very sufficient  Would definitely return here again in the future  
P => Never again Found of Boutique Hotels this one makes me wonder if I should not forget about BH in the future    For  USD you get a room the size of   your bed staff look at you as if you were coming from a different planet when you complain about it and have nothing to say  Tough luck you are in a Boutique Hotel where you cannot open your suitcase as there is no space you cannot work as there is no desk Does not help much in giving a good name to Boutique Hotels there should be an industry standard so that not everybody can abuse this name  Next time any other Hotel will do but this one never again 
P => Great one week stay at the hotel I spent  nights there last Easter with my family  We had a family suite which consists on a queen and king rooms at the end of the corridor connected by a door that closes allowing the rooms to gain a spacious foyer  Our stay there was excellent both the staff at reception and at the door were young and very helpful and attentive We found the rooms to be a ent size for a family of  adults nicely appointed with some well thought details  We had a double bed in each room as well as a daybed the one in the king bedroom was a bit tight so we used the one in the queen room it was made everyday as opposed to what someone said in a previous post  The location on th between th and th right opposite the Royalton can t be beat I strongly recommend it and would definetly return if we can book a similar rate  
P => Sophisticated and Classy Little Hotel Tucked Away Our stay in this boutique hotel was perfect from start to finish  Sleek but cozy room  Spacious ble bathroom with oversized glass shower was beautifully appointed  Everything looked squeaky clean and fresh  Bed was comfy and the staff was gracious and attentive  Though tucked away on a quiet street it is only a short walk to the theatre district and convenient for traveling about the city  The windows in the room even opened Five star restaurant in house was a surprise bonus  
P => Great place to stay in the middle of everything Five  something adults stayed in the family suite for one night  There was a queen and daybed in one room and a king and daybed in the other room  Each room had a very nice shower or combo bathshower  One bathroom had a very large shower and a bidet in the bathroom  Very nice or  The beds were extremely comfortable with featherbed toppers  Guest robes were provided full size hair dryer Hermes toiletries and even a little jar of cotton balls and cotton swabs  The  rooms became a suite by opening room doors and closing a common door in the hallway  The rooms were very small  Just walking room around the beds but youre not going to New York to hang out in the room all day  The staff was extremely attentive and responded immediately to requests  We got a great price  through express res  The rooms were very clean and in good shape  Nice sound system in the room with a dvd player and complementary movies  TV was kind of odd as it was placed behind the mirror  There was some glare when the lights were on in the room but it was still pretty viewable  Overall we were very satisfied and would definitely stay again 
P => Tiny lovely jewel with amazing service I usually stay higher up in midtown but due to the crazy prices in NY these days booked at the City Club Hotel for night on quikbook  This price point is very good value for what you get considering other available rates at other hotels  The most rekably good point was the service  The bell  and doormen were all young ish men not so much the groomed and plucked Calvin Klein ad types with attitude that you find at say the Mondrian in LA but more Gap ad types    but with none of the immaturity and I was floored and amazed at how professional and helpful they all were  How have they made people this young so professional I would really like to know  They grabbed a cab for me and pre loaded my luggage in the cab without my having to ask for assistance  They were energetic and quothop to itquot an unusual quality in a city and profession where its easy to present an exhausted or weary demeanor  The front desk is also run by a very professional gentleman  When I checked in the night staff presented me with an Internet password automatically Of course I started off with a good experience because I was upgraded to a large king room from a queen deluxe  I would pay between  to  for a room of this type but probably not above   The Hermes amenities are delectable and really set the City Club apart from other hotels  I was at first a little put off by the thick plastic sheet that serves as a shower curtain but subsequently realized how functional it is    it really serves to keep steam in the tub area and creates a lovely little sauna effect  I thought that was extremely well considered and designed  The bathroom in the king room is quite large  Free internet is lovely  I thought the projection TV behind the  way mirror was also a thoughtfully designed space saving touch although I couldnt get the thing to work after my gracious bellman Paul demod it for me  True that the fake cork stick um tiles are a bit off putting and the closet is miniature even in the king room  The elevator smelled positively rankdank  But for  night for this size of room I had a lovely experience and would definitely return  
P => Tiniest hotel room Ive ever seen   seriously This was the smallest hotel room Ive ever seen in the U S  Stayed there on business last fall and wasnt really impressed for the price The only upside was the in room snacks   Dean amp Deluca  
P => Mediorcre at best Quality and room size should be better for the price  
P => pretty good we  people stayed in one of their duplex suites  the suites were gorgeous     floors with a living room and  bath downstairs and a bedroomloft with a great big full bathroom on the nd floor  the only problem temperature control  on the lower level of the duplex the temperature was fine and thats where the thermostat was  upstairs though it was sweltering hot like a sauna even though the balcony window was open and the  degree outside air was blowing in  the upstairs doesnt have its own temperature control so the bathroom and the bedroom was just unbearably hot  for  a night with tax etc  id like at least the temperature in the room to be bearable  the minibar was well stocked and the toiletries were nice but the temperature control wasnt  and we were a bit loud and had complaints from the neighboring rooms    but we could hear them too and we didnt complain  the walls are a bit thin or at least not thick enough   youd think thered be better sound proofing  the room service was adequate though over priced  staff was friendly and helpful  dont think id stay again  for the price id rather get two big rooms across the street at the royalton  
P => NOT BAD   BUT A BIT OVERRATED Just returned from three nights at the City Club  I find it difficult to believe that this hotel is ranked   on tripadvisor com out of over  hotels in Manhattan  I guess there are City Club moles on this site voting for their hotel The bathroom was a good size with wall to wall brown ble  Hermes bath products are a cheap grade found in most riott Courtyards  The shower was large enough for a small orgy but was the same level as the bathroom floor so there was water spillage outside the shower and into the room There are touches throughout the hotel to evoke a boutique and trendy feel however most of it was done on the cheap  Overall it feels like an old building with a dimestore makeover  Laminated cork floors show wear after only four years chipped paint pealing wallpaper dim lighting to hide the flaws  Mattresses feel old but are covered with a nice featherbed and ent linens Staff was good at providing restaurant and nightlife recommendations and went out of their way to do so  Midtown Location is good on W  th street between th and th Aves  Im not an expert on NYC hotels but night for this hotel outside of New Years is not a good value when you have the Regency and SOHO Grand available for   more per night  
P => Terrible Service  Just back from  days at the City Club  First off I must admit that I am terribly fussy so you  wish to consider that when reading this review  I traveled extensively and have been to New York several times  I love the feel of a smaller property and realize the amenities will not be as extensive as in a larger property i e  swimming pool spa etc Had a king room with a bath  Nice or the daybed is a really nice touch  The room was cozy which is typical of New York  Not a great deal of room to maneuver which I suppose is the product of the king size bed  Storage is at a minimum which came into play with the winter clothing  Room is nicely equipped  dvdcd player  IPOD audio system at least in the room I was in  large bathroom  Id give the quotTelevision cleverly hidden behind mirrorsquot a miss if possible because the glare from the lamps makes viewing virtually impossible  Like noted in other reviews the common areas and rooms are looking a little worn cork flooring with big gouges from dropped items  tiles peeling off ceiling and elevator wall paper peeling off the walls These are minor irritations at best but they do diminish the overall look and feel of the property However the real problem was the service  Staff seemed to be far more interested in posing rather than being of any real service  Upon check in there was no one to greet us and no bellman to be found  Taxi driver helped with our luggage in the rain  Front desk really couldnt be bothered explaining the features of the property  Limited knowledge of restaurants in the city always seemed the person I spoke to had to quotask someone elsequot for information Best of all on our final day when we were trying to flag a taxi down which was extremely difficult because of the rain  Finally the doorman from the hotel next door grabbed an umbrella and helped us while our bellman no real doorman at the City Club stood inside and watched the whole thing  Guess he didnt feel the need to get his ultra cool City Club toque wet Overall the hotel is okay great location and the restaurant DB Bistro Moderne is excellent  Generally speaking what usually sets smaller properties apart is the personalized service and it just wasnt there  This is made all too glaringly obvious because there are essentially  other hotels right next door  Next time Ill give the Sofitel a try  
P => Great find I stayed with my girlfriend    in this excellent little hotel  I stumbled onto this hotel while reviewing my options with better hotels or so I thought  Apparently every hotel in New York has raised its nightly prices and I wasnt about to pay  plus a night at The Drake where I normally stay for in the  reigion  We go out often when we stay here and I wanted to stay closer to the meat packing district MPD  I dont mind paying top dollar for a good hotel but in New York if you havent been to the hotel your staying in odds are high pricing doesnt equal high quality  This hotel just happened to appear on my search for hotels in the West VillageMPD and Im glad it did  Its located in the thearter district between Time square and Fifth Ave  but you dont get heavy pedestrian traffic from either  The prior reivews were on the money  The hotel is clean staff friendly and rooms were comfortable  Luxe Queen was great for night  Only inconvinience was the closet space but we worked around that  The restaurant down stairs DB is excellent for the pallet  Ill would stay here again but since we always eat and handout at the villageTribecaMPD area I am more inclined to stay at a closer hotel like the itime  Over all good times good times  
P => Petite well designed room I reserved a quotPetite one full bed roomquot and so was prepared for a quotpetitequot room with a brick wall view which is what I got  There truly was just room for a double bed and one bed side table  Deep built in shelves gave you some storage space and also housed TV and CD player  That being said I loved the crisp modern design and perversely enjoyed the cosiness of the small but well designed space  With the tans and beiges as well as dark cork floors and dark brown ble in the bathroom I felt like I was staying in a little chocolate box  The Italian sheets were THE most comfortable I have ever encountered in a hotel  The bathroom too was small but had a nice ble shower my partner admired a large fossilized shell and Hermes toiletries  I think the lack of natural light would be a negative on a long stay but for one night it was negligible  I did get a lh out of seeing the New York Post outside my door in the morning  The lobby staff was friendly and unpretentious  I would have completely balked at the price last year but thats what the prices are in NY right now  The block is nice and the location is very convenient to subways and most parts of the city  
P => Great Stay Had a great experience here  We came in on the red eye and couldnt check in right away but they stored our bags for us and when we came back at am they had a king room for us upgraded from queen room  It had a lovely full bath and the room was just right  The bed was completely comfortable with great pillows and the room was very nice and clean  Even had turn down service both nights  Would highly recommend this hotel 
P => Great Hotel I was so impressed with the city club hotel I plan on staying there everytime I return to NYC  The rooms are beautiful  The location is perfect and the staff is very accomadating  The new Ipod docking stationalarm clock was also a nice touch so I can listen to all my music through the high end speakers the hotel provides  I would highly reccomend the city club hotel to all NYC travelers 
P => An amazing chic hotel  Just returned from a  night stay at the City Club Hotel and I dont have a bad word to say about it      in fact it was THE best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in  The entire place is the ultimate in chic and trendy living from the gorgeous rooms to the discreat entrance amp lobby and last but not least the very helpful and pleasent staff  The location of the hotel is fab if you are looking for a central base in NYC  Times Square is only minutes away if you like that sort of thing but best of all th Ave is even closer  The hotel staff were great and recommended fab barsclubs in the trendy Meatpacking District and Soho      just the kind of place me and my boyfriend were looking for  All the little extras really make you feel like a star from the Hemes bath products City Club umbrellas in your room to the daily weather forecasts and chocolates that are delivered to your room every evening  Not forgetting the cool TV behind the miror idea  The rooms were even better than I imagined  We booked a king size delux room and we certainly werent disappointed  Plenty room for  people with a large closet and gorgeous sitting area  All done in the chic and trendy feel of the hotel  Surprisingly a chic and trendy room also meant comfortable      uncommon in most modern hotels  The bath rooms where just incredible and huge with plenty of lighting and mirrors  Me and my boyfriend absolutly loved the City Club hotel and will certainly be returning on our next visit to NYC  Choose this hotel and you wont be disappointed  
P => An amazing trip at The City Club  Recently a friend and I stayed at the City Club Hotel on our first trip to the Big Apple  We had a wonderful time  The staff was very knowlegable about showsshopping and restaraunts  They were more then happy to make recommendations and make us reservations  Its in a great midtown location so we were right in the mix of everything going on in New York City  We loved the entire or of the hotel and its trendy chic vibe  The room had Hermes bath products down feather bedding and had more then adequate space for us two girls with a lot of luggage and not to mention the gorgeous bathroom loved the bathtub The entire hotel staff went out of there way to make sure we always had what we needed and put in that extra effort to make our stay that much better  Loved the hotel loved the staff and loved the whole trip  We will definetly be visiting NYC again soon and reserving a room at the City Club  
P => Not much to love at City Club While the location of the hotel is great you  want to stay outside your room the entire stay  While the staff is courteous and helpful they are also making up for whats lacking at this hotel   extremely small rooms like the Hudson stained bedspreads loose tiles on the bathroom floor and an air conditioner that ran full blast but had no effect despite an unusually cool  weekend Many corners seem to have been cut in making this place sleek and chic but no corners were cut in the charge for rooms  If youre looking for a cool funky hotel with a great lobby or lounge this place isnt it  Try the W  But do try DB Moderne which is the restaurant connected to City Club  A great scene with great food although it too carries over the quotsmallquot theme  
P => Smallest room for the money I have ever stayed in  Small room nice bathroom  It was a warm week in NY and the temperature in the room was never under  degrees with the air on full blast I guess there are larger rooms based on the glowing reports in the other reviews but for   a night Ive done much better elsewhere    and for much less  Nice view of an alley with a large fan that ran all night Next time in New York I will go back to the W and get twice the room for less money  
P => Good Location OverPriced Room Great location  Uneven room  For the price one would be better off staying elsewhere  Strange combination of luxury frette bed linens and bathrobes ble shower with Hermes products and shabby tiny standard room old bed blanket stains on carpet broken AC unit broken shower handle plywood painted table creaky scary elevator  
P => Stylish but no comfort This is a ridiculous hotel  orated with superficial style that is uncomfortable on almost every level  The hotel seems luxurious in photos but for the same money you can do better anywhere in the city  The deluxe room is a good size but it has no dresser no drawers and a closet that is so small that clothes hang on the mini bar and get crushed when the door is closed  Be prepared to live out of your suitcase  The hotel is an old classic building with the original windows which is a nice touch until the cold winds blow and the garbage trucks arrive in the middle of the night  There are no curtains and the painted plywood shutters do nothing for these problems and also don t allow for any privacy during the day without losing all daylight  The room was kept clean but the carpet and bedspread had many stains which made the place feel dirty  Even the hotel staff    friendly and eager to help    admitted that they hear complaints constantly  I can t imagine that anyone stays at this hotel a second time  
P => You could do far better    OK the location a block or two from Times Square is excellent but I think that this is all the hotel has going for it On this trip I was travelling with my son  The rooms are just not big enough for two people and as mentioned by a previous reviewer the storage and closet space is minimal so if you are staying for more than a weekend expect to be living out of your suitcase Bring a flashlight   the rooms and corridors are dimly lit an effort to be trendy I think Dont expect soft drinks from the mini bar to be free as mentioned on their website   they are most certainly not Dont bother with the DB Burger at the ajoining restaurant its a waste of  Good points are location free dvds and er thats about it  
P => Unexciting  I am normally stay at the Royalton just across the street on Wth but despite some misgivings having read other reviews on this site   ided to try out the City Club on a one night trip to New York  The room on ther nd floor was pleasant enough except that it was very gloomy with the two windows facing a wall about ft away an issue at the Royalton too sometimes  Huge bed was very confortable and the TV hidden behind a large paiting was a nice touch  Bathrooms ok but not a patch on the Royaltons bathrooms  As noted in other reviews the wallpaper was ked amp very slightly peeling in a couple of areas The hotel has a discreet entrance but no lobby and no real bar   basically a couple of tables at the back of the db restaurant  I was meeting someone there at pm got there a little early and waited at one of the tables listening to the chef brief the staff about the dishes of the day and what was left over from lunch that he wanted to shift No drinks available until the clock had struck pm  As soon as it had though the staff were very attentive and the place became packed very quickly  Clearly a popular meeting spot In sumy if you like very small discrete boutique style hotels then City Club would be fine if it were at least a third cheaper  I however will revert to the Royalton on my next visit to New York  
P => Worth it if you can manage a discount The rooms are small and there is little closet space and no drawers  But the bed is large and comfortable there is a good sized couch and the bath large and impressive with Hermes bath products  We got a good deal through work but I dont think it would be worth it to stay there paying full price  The attached restuarant Bistro Moderne is worth a visit  
P => On the whole a very good experience I read a number of the reviews on the site before staying at the hotel for a week at the beginning of    As with all of these things I tried to read between the lines and make an evaluated judgement before booking my stay This is the third hotel I have stayed in in the city the other two being Ian Schrager hotels The Hudson and The Paramount  The first thing which struck me was the size of the room  I had a front facing King Room on the nd floor room  which was very spacious  I would estimate at least twice to three times the size of the rooms I had stayed in before The or was minimalist without being too stark  The bed was enormous and exceptionally comfortable  I only found the tv behind the mirror a real problem if we had all of the lights on  The CDDVD player was a nice touch and the free DVDCD library available from the reception was a real bonus  I really liked the black ble bathroom which had an excellent shower which was also very large  Some  find this a touch too masculine for their tastes but i loved it  The finishing was also to a very high standard and I liked the Hermes toiletries  The Frette robes were so nice that I would have considered buying one if there had been any more space in my case It was also useful having a well stocked mini bar with Dean and Deluca goodies a mini ironing boardiron and a safe  I liked the soft furnishings seats were comfortable the books useful I was also surprised by the quality of the Maid Service  To return to my room to find all of my spare change arranged in neat stacks by denomination showed someone who did a thorough job  It was also nice to find a card with the weather for the next day and chocolates on my pillow something I have normally only got from hotels much higher up the price scale The DB bistro was excellent though on my visit they had sold out of the famous burger  I found the food on par with many of the top restaurants in the city which I visited on other evenings  The hotel does not serve hot breakfasts but there is an excellent old fashioned diner The Red Flame just a few doors down which did an excellent breakfast and was always packed with New Yorkers on each morning we visited this was also good value for money I found the staff on the front desk both helpful and knowledgeable they had neither the stuffyness you expect from some of the hotels at the highest end of the scale or the arrogance you can find at some boutique hotels  They were just genuinely helpful The hotel was also in an excellent location just off th Ave near to all the shops you want to visit close to all the public transport if you wish to go up or down town  Very close to the theaters and Time Square without being right on top of it  It also shares the street with a number of nice institutions such as the Harvard and Penn clubs  My room also over looked the Royalton  There is also a very good dry cleaners across the street from the hotel which recently won the award as New Yorks Best in the New York Magazine On the negative side the lighting was a little too dark if you wished to apply make up in the bathroom  There were no drawers for putting clothes altough we did have a couple of shelves next to the hanging space  We found the hanging space insufficient for two people staying for a week  However this was more than adequate for a business traveller on a short stay Given that this hotel probably falls into the middle of the price bracket for New York it was very good value for money  Sure you can find cheaper but this was a cut above the rest in terms of the overall package location and many of the small touches which made it an enjoyble stay I did have a look at one of the Suites before checking out on my final day and although there were exceptionally nice the king size room we booked was the better value  I would recommend booking this size of room This is definately somewhere I would recommend to my friends and will be my first choice the next time I visit New York  
P => Great location service and rooms  
P => Great Location good value for Money  
P => Tremendous

P => A great simple place We spent a few days at the Solita  The folks at the front desk were all very nice and the rooms were very clean and modern  The rooms were teeny so if you are looking for closets or space this is not the right place  It is great to be at the edge of soho and little italy  
P => Great location pretty room no wireless  I had to spend a weekend in New York inbetween meetings  I wanted to stay at the Solita because of all the nearby dining shopping and entertainment possibilities and it did not disappoint  The rooms are small but nicely orated and on the th floor anyway very quiet  The hipsters at the desk were very friendly  The only disappointment was that there was no wireless in the rooms I had not cable with me but I was happy to discover that the cute little New York Public Library branch at Mulberry and Jersey does have free wireless 
P => Perfect hotel for what we needed on this trip  Stayed at The Solita with my wife and  year old dhter  The main purpose of the trip was to go to the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy  The hotel is only a block away from where the festival took place  Aside from location the room was clean and comfortable   typically NYC small   but worked fine for us  Front desk staff very friendly and helpful  They mentioned that we would be better off with a higher floor due to nightclub noise and graciously found a room for us on the th floor  Parking at the nearby lot on Centre St  was high   quotfestival ratequot of  per day  but I found free street parking the next day a few blocks away to eliminate that expense  All in all a great bargain if one needs to be close to Little italy or Chinatown  
P => Would stay here again Great hotel staff were friendly and courteous  It was very clean and nicely outfitted although a small space  We had two double beds which were very comfortable great pillows Outstanding location for Chinatown shopping and near the subway  
P => Great hotel on good location I travel to New York alot and have stayed at various hotels I usually stay in L E S  mainly at the sohotel  Anyway I wanted to try something new and searching around I found the Solita hotel and booked it for this time  Knowing rooms are tiny and showers usually pretty crappy in NYC I really really liked this hotel room ofcourse small but nice and clean the shower is actually the best I ever had i NYC  Staff very nice and helpfull  In general Ill say I will definetely be comming back to the hotel next time I hit NYC 
P => Great location but do not book queen rooms Hotel is clean modern but queen rooms are too small and hot You cannot leave the air conditioning on because it is too close to the bed Book king or double rooms    I saw them while cleaning staff was inside  There is a work in progress area close to one side of the hotel so if your room is on that side you can hear a little noise when they start working early morning  Btw his location is fantastic Soho is a very nice area  blocks from Little Italy and a walk from South Manhattan or uptown   subway is close too   
P => Great location great value stayed here  nights with my wife and dhter on their first trip to NYC  Great location for walking to stores that were appealing AND affordable for a  year old girl  Also walked to some great Chinese and Italian restaurants   all recommendations from the staff Rooms are really small but its New York   what did you expect The biggest drawback was that the double beds are really only doubles   its been a long time since my wife amp I slept in a double  I forgot how many elbows she had We stayed on the th floor and didnt notice a lot of street noise  Theres no business center and I needed an e mail printed out  Andrew at the front desk just had me forward the e mail to him and he printed it out for me  
P => Very nice This is one of my favorite hotels now  very well appointed rooms close to chinatown and little italy  i stayed for  nights and the staff there did everything they could to make my stay pleasant  im in the hotel business and they were tremendous im jealous that i dont get to work with them  Best hotel ive seen in a long time especially considering the location and the price  both awesome 
P => Great location small rooms but nice and clean Great location in NYC next to Soho Little Italy Chinatown and by walking distance of the East Village or Greenwhich Vilage  Loved it all Manhattan and Brooklyn were easy to access  
P => Perfect location comfortable bed excellent service    Okay so the rooms are small but it is NYC so thats to be expected  Ive stayed in larger rooms in the city for around the same price but one was filthy and one we shared with a family of mice  Cleanliness is such much more important to me than size and I was very happy with the cleanliness of our room  The hotel staff was excellent  They were friendly and courteous and quick to respond to our needs  We had the misfortune of being on the second floor right above the disco but that didnt really bother us any as we never made it back before am  The bed was very comfortable and I dont usually sleep well in hotels but slept great  The location was perfect  Took a walk through little Italy and the St  Anthonys was going on which was a nice surprise  There were a lot of great places to shop within walking distance  I was walked to Katz Deli a place I visit on every trip to NYC  The subway was right around the corner  We were fortunate to be in town when the John Lennon exhibit was going on at they NYC Rock n Roll Hall of Fame annex and that too was within walking distance  I was disappointed with the size of the TV  There is definitely space on that wall for a much larger TV  The hair dryer left a lot to be desired  It would overheat constantly  Overall we were very pleased with our stay and will definitely stay there again  
P => Perfect place to stay in lower Manhattan The Solita is a small hotel in Soho  My husband and I stayed there twice on an extended trip going to and from NY  The price is very reasonable  The rooms are small as is everything in Manhattan but very clean and very nicely designed  If you get a room on the higher floors noise is not a problem  The biggest plus of this hotel is the wonderful staff  All of them were genuinely friendly and helpful  The second night of our stay we had problems with some partying college students that woke us up and the person at the desk gave us a price break for the next time we stayed  This is the hotel we will stay in every time we go to NYC  
P => Great hotel great location AAA member discount I loved this hotel  Since this is NYC dont expect a huge space  However if you are a very long legged person or someone who requires ample space to walk around the room this might not be a suitable hotel for you The room we stayed in was on the th floor so we didnt hear the disco downstairs  When you book make sure you book at the higher floors  I recommend th floor or higher   The room was beautiful the bathroom was ent  Its safe to flush if youre husbands taking a hot shower  Since they give you a few towels set one on the floor to avoid slipping accidents when you step out of the tubshower  As far as floor space to set your luggages in theres enough room for  small trolley luggage and a backpack on the floor  If you have anything bigger youll have to close you luggage and set it upright otherwise youll be hopping over them to get to the bathroom  Theres a safe in the closet  it can fit a small quotmacbook  free internet access and a flat screen tv with some ent channels  You get a copy of NYTimes in the AM Also I highly recommend a cool little bar around the corner  Baby Grand  youll meet the friendliest New Yorkers here I would definitely stay here again 
P => Not a Clarion Standard We stayed at the Solita Soho Hotel at the end of uary and found the only positive about this hotel is the location  Its situated close to both Chinatown and the Soho retail precinct  The hotel is small with  rooms per floor the room is tiny so is the reception area  Furthermore we had no room even to put our  bags not to mention the pillows on the bed  Theres only one lift therefore during busy times of the day we had to use the stairs  The air conditioning in the room is stuffy and extremely noisy I think its done deliberately to mask the noise from the outside  We could hear the subway noise the night club on the ground floor and fire trucks police and ambulances outside all night  The front office staff were generally helpful except one girl that worked the night shift   she didnt want to be there at all  The internet wasnt working neither  Overall its not a  star hotel more like a budget  star hotel  We wouldnt go back again  
P => Great Location  Great Hotl  Great time in NYC Just stayed at the Solita Soho and loved it  The location could not have been better for us right in Little Italy and walking distance to China town Greenwich Village  The only complaint that I would have is that the rooms were small like other reviews said it was tight for all four of us to fit but it worked just fine  Are room was on the th floor and we could not hear the nightclub that is right next doorwhich I was worried we would hear  Other then that the place was awesome definitely worth checking out next time your in NYC and if you do stay here check out Petit Abeille for breakfast on  west broadway only a  minute walk from the hotel  
P => Friendly  This was our first visit to New York and this hotel was recommended by friends From the minute of arrival to departure we felt well looked after and most welcomed which was very nice after exhausting sightseeing in the city Although  in a room the cleanliness and good housekeeping kept our room fresh the whole week  From the th floor we also enjoyed a very good view The location in Soho is perfect for those who like a more lay back style which is still very central with very good cafes restaurants and shops minutes away The staff were very efficient and welcoming  It would be impossible to write this review without a special mention for Stephanie  Her natural charm humour and care mixed with her efficiency and knowledge of places to enjoy New York made our holiday very special  
P => Great Location Great Staff We stayed here for one night for my wifes birthday  It was a great little Manhattan hotel  The room was small but very clean  The location was superb for our needs as we were going out for the night  Best of all the staff were great  
P => Clean and convenient    a great bargain We chose this hotel after reading other reviews on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed We were looking for a basic but ent hotel that was close to the subway  The hotel is small    only  rooms    and has no business center restaurant or workout room and not even much of a lobby Having read that rooms on the lower floors should be avoided due to noise from the nightclub next door we asked for a room on the highest floor possible and were given one on the top  th  floor  It was very small but had a nice flat screen TV and a clean modern bathroom    and a view of the Empire State Building  It had two double beds which were each a bit small for two people but otherwise OK   It was very quiet and we didnt hear any noise from downstairs    surprising since the music was very audible when we were in the lobby  We had hot water every morning with no problem  and the shower had two arate shower heads each of which could be aimed arately   My husband had forgotten a cable for his computer and the front desk clerk gave him a quotloanerquot one to use while we were there   The free wi fi worked well too  Also they delivered a New York Times to our door each morning  As advertised the hotel was about two blocks from the subway  Our only two minor annoyances were   The in room safe didnt work we asked for someone to fix it and were told the next evening that it was fixed but it still didnt work  We ended up just doing without it    One morning when we got on the elevator we pushed the button to go down to the lobby but nothing happened  We ended up walking down  floors  The front desk clerk said quotHmmmquot when we mentioned the problem and said the elevator had to be re set but didnt apologize  When we came back in the evening the elevator was fixed  All was fine with it until the morning we checked out when it was out for a few minutes for quotroutine maintenancequot  Other than those minor issues the hotel delivered exactly what we had hoped for    a clean quiet room that was a good place to crash after a busy day  I would also recommend the Landk Coffee Shop located directly across the street    the pancakes and French toast were very good and the service was excellent 
P => Best thing is the location This hotel is perfect for sightseeing in New York  Its well placed in Soho so makes a change from staying in Manhattan and the usual touristy areas  Good for second timers to New York who fancy something differentWe found it was a good price had nice small but its New York clean rooms and a lovely clean bathroom with good toiletries big towels and a good hairdryer  Our main concern was going to be noise from the nightclub having seen other reviews on here before  To solve this we emailed the hotel direct and got a written promise we could have a room on the upper floors  We took this with us and presented it on arrival   we were given the th floor which was silent Couldnt hear it at all so our ear plugs were not needed  The hotel staff are desperate to get the club closed down but have had no luck so far with the management and some legal reasons apparently We had no issues with bedbugs  We had no cause to speak to the manager so cant comment on him but the reception staff were very friendly and helpful to us  There is a good little deli over the road for breakfast so you dont have far to go if youre starving when you wake up no breakfast at the hotel Its located close to Little Italy and Chinatown and also a subway stop when coming from the airport with all your luggage you dont have far to walk something to bear in mind  Taxi was about     I think but at am we didnt mind paying Reception staff were very helpful esp Lorelei in providing maps and info on things to do and how to get to attractions calling taxis etc  There is a really good off licence over the road with some lovely wines in unusual in America but they close at pm and I think  on a Sunday not crucial but bear in mind if you want a drink in your room after a meal out   the next place is a fair walk away and just sells warm beer Having said that there are plenty of nice bars around SoHo No complaints about this hotel and we would definitely go again and recommend to others  In fact I did recommend to a friend she has just been stayed on the th floor and had a great time  
P => Family of  Spring Break Dwntwn Manhattan The Good Great location within walking distance of the Lower East side SoHo whats remained of Little Italy and of course Chinatown  If you go further north the Village and further south the South Street Seaport  There is a ent diner across the street for breakfast attached to the hotel is a reasonable French resto   we didnt eat here but looked at the menu and sounds OK with manageable prices considering this is NYC   Ate mostly in Chinatown since its cheapest Lombardis Katzs  We walked everywhere and saw a lot considering we were only there for  nights  The staff was very pleasant  Dont be put off by the gritty old looking neighborhood  We found it safe  Locals were always milling around  It got quieter at bedtime but you probably wont be able to sleep in in the morning if needed The Bad the hotel room is SMALL say  sq feet including bathroom area for night reserved months in advance   this would have been very uncomfortable if the kids ages   were teenagers the beds were up against the walls that Ive banged up my elbows a couple of times  ive banged up my knees on the heatingAC unit because it was too close to the bed    you cant use the ironboard there is no room to open up the ironing board we had to relocate the coffee maker to the bathroom to be able to use it   and there is hardly any counter space in the bathroom so the lesson here is dont bring a lot of luggagetoiletries because there is no room to put them we only had a medium duffle bag and an overnighter so its not like we had a lot of luggage  the hotel also sells itself as a boutique hotel i dont see the reason yeah they have ONE bath robe there were  of us   Oh be because their shampooconditioner is organic    Make sure you know the address we passed it by because it does not have a quee on top  I saw another couple looking for it and they would have passed it if they hadnt heard us talking about the hotel All in all I would stay here again if i cant find anywhere else to stay  I would recommend this hotel to people whove been to NYC and familiar with the prices interested in staying downtown and know what theyre getting into    
P => OK Hotel in Convenient Location I stayed a the Solita Soho for four days during the first week of ember for business  Honestly it wasnt our first choice but hotel rates in NYC that week were insanely expensive and the Solita was reasonably priced  I think we were pleasantly surprised as you could do a lot worse in NYC  The room was your standard boutique hotel room  A little small but most are in NYC and I actually had a double  The heat worked well very important to me and it had standard beds and pillows  They also provide you with a robe  There is a small wardrobe for you to store your clothes in but dont plan on putting your luggage in there as it wont likely fit  I just left my bag on the extra bed  The bathroom is clean the toiletries are good and the showerwater pressure is good too  They have a double shower head which was interesing  My room was right next to the elevator and I had no problems with noise  On a side note   one of my colleagues requested a smoking room and ended up with a room right above the adjacent club  He didnt sleep for days   P We thought be it was to discourage people from the habit Location is very convenient  You can walk to Little Italy Chinatown and Soho  Its easy to catch a cab  You can grab breakfast across the street at the diner  if you are inclined  The staff at reception offered great restaurant recommendations in Little Italy all within walking distance  Essentially a good hotel if you need a place to sleep so its good for business travelers  If youre looking to hang out in your hotel then this  not be the place for you  
P => Pleasantly surprised Picked the Solita based on location price and style  I was more than happy we did  GREAT location China town little Italy Soho the lower east side  Awsome area  Hotel was clean comfortable nice bedding and a HUGE bathroom  Very nice Coffe in room a robe free wi fi  We got a corner room  I think just a little bigger then the rest of the rooms nice  Will stay here again The people who complained about the noise are either overly sensitive or were on a lowere floor than   I could just barely hear the club no louder than other NYC noises and we stayed on a Saturday nightNice people at the counter  Overall very happy 
P => Great location quaint botique hotel would return  We recently spent  nights FridaySaturday at the Solita SoHo Hotel and were impressed  Location The hotel is located only steps from the central spine of SoHo as well as Chinatown and Little Italy  Though at first glance the street looks a little questionable we did not observe or have any issues  We parked our car on the street just a block away without incident  There are numerous restaurants and clubs in walking distance as well as shops  Hotel The room was standard size for NY which all be it means small but offered everything we needed  The room was spotless and updated in a modern style  Robes were provided as well as higher end toilteries  We did not find the lobby quotghettoquot as noted by some though it does not offer much besides the reception desk and a small seating area  but really what else does one need We had no issue with noise from the club though we requested and stayed on a higher floor  We found the staff friendly though not particularly knowlegable as to offerings for restaurants and nightlife in the area  Though they did offer without us asking guides for things to see and do  Touristy magazines were offered in the rooms  A NY Times was supplied on Saturday morning We would most certainly stay at the Solita SoHo Hotel again  
P => Obnoxiously Loud The hotel is well located for SOHO activities  It is clean  The rooms are nice enough  The room size is small but fairly ok for New York standards  The water pressure is great  BUT    The insurmountable problem is the club mentioned by others  We stayed on Friday and Saturday nights on the rd floor  It was literally impossible to fall asleep until  am or later I think exhaustion did the trick at that point  The music coming from the club techno stuff was obnoxiously loud  Every time the bass boomed you could hear items rattling in the room Im not kidding  I still cant get the never ending techno version of Stars and Stripes Forever out of my mind With absolute sincerity I dont understand how a hotel can get away with charging people for these rooms  be the noise is not as bad on higher floors  It was literally unbearable on ours  Which is too bad because everything else was fine  I just like to be able to sleep  If you make reservations and are stuck on a low floor youre out of luck  
P => Great Hotel For People on the Go This hotel is good for someone on the go  Its not an amazing hotel by any stretch of the imagination  Its in a good area for getting anywhere in NYC   close to the tube  The room is very small the staff is friendly and the lobby looks really ghetto  We had a problem with noise one of the nights we stayed here because there is a club downstairs  However the other nights we stayed here we went out on the town so it was not a problem  If you want a hotel that takes great care of you   stay somewhere else  But if you like to roam the city and wont spend much time in your room   definitely stay here and save some money  
P => Good hotel but very nosiy While the hotel is situated on a nice block in Soho the night club attached to the hotel would drive you nuts  the music was loud and went on all night long stopped for an hour then statred up at AM on Sunday morning no less  Talking to other guest they all have the same complain  I will definitely think twice before booking here again  
P => Very small room but I liked it overall This is a small hotel  The rooms are small by most cities standards  However I have stayed in smaller rooms in New York City and paid a lot more  The bathroom was ent size and amenities are good You can open the rooms windows which was great since the weather was nice  I would stay here again  
P => My New Fave NYC Digs Booked a room at the Solita based on Trip Advisor recommendations and wanted an affordable downtown hotel  Went thru Expedia and had no problems at all  Some reviews said hotel was noisy but we me husband and teenage son were on the rd floor facing Grand St  and all slept well  be other travelers were not accustomed to the usual City sounds   I love the constant hum of the city and the nightclub noise was a really faint sound I only noticed a couple of times  The room was typically small its NYC but nicely appointed  No big amenities but who in the world eats room service in New York City The blocks surrounding the Solita are filled with incredible Peking Duck dumplings noodles and roast pork  I am not big on eating Italian in Little Italy only for newbie tourists but there is a neat French restaurant next door and great West Village and LES eateries in short walking distance If you are an experienced NYC traveler looking for a nice little room to crash in with good linens flat screen TV nice service and a convenient downtown location the Solita cant be beat  We walked past the Sohotel which is much more expensive and it is in a crappy and boring area of the Bowery  We are looking forward to our next trip to the City and will return to the Solita for sure  
P => OK but disappointed We took the ision to stay out of midtown for the first time and feel we should have researched a bit better  While the location like virtually everywhere in Manhattan is great for subway access the locality verges on being bland with no really great bars or restaurants adjacent  Internet was down and it took days to fix so the front desk was helpless in answering any queries we had  Many not all hotel employees seemed not to be particularly attentive and our room wasnt cleaned until after pm Noise was rather an issue with the windows not keeping noise out and an adjacent club keeping us up most of the night  Many intercity buses also leave the area at all times of day and night On the plus side the room was recently refurbished and pleasant enough with coffee facilities fresh water bottles each day and bathroom stuff was fine I guess underwhelmed was the word I would use  Will look for somewhere further west if staying downtown again  
P => perfect location clean nice people  Actually its not much more than a desk and a lot of rooms  But what more do you need when youre in NY If on holiday youll be out of your room most of the time so you need a good and clean bed and bathroom  Everything you need is in the room  A tv coffee machine locker etc  Its a small room yes but I couldnt be bothered  It really is very important to ask th floor or higher because of the nearby club  The people at the desk are so so friendly and willing to help you with everything  The location is the best feels very good  I will definitely stay here next time I visit NY C  van der Horst   Amsterdam The Netherlands 
P => Excellent Very nice hotel  Clean medium size room with two windows looking out to city  Incredible location in Soho Little Italy Chinatown area  Great walking area in Soho Village etc  Bathroom clean nice  I have stayed here twice and will stay again  
P => Great Place This hotel was perfect The staff was helpful The rooms are small but VERY clean  after all its the city  The room we had was a corner room single bed flat screen TV  The hotel has a hooka lounge at night  The music is very loud we could hear the music in our room we stayed on the th floor however it didnt really bother us  Parking is a few blocks away and costs about  for a  hour period  When you walk out of the hotel about one block to your right is China Town and Cannel St and about a block to your left is Little Italy  Overall we enjoyed out stay at this hotel and would stay again  
P => Great hotel in SOHOChinatown The location of this hotel is superb  About  blocks up from Canal street a few blocks from Little Italy and a few blocks from great shopping in Soho The rooms are really small but nicely furnished  There is a little noise at night from the nightclub we were on the th floor but I would think rooms on the higher floors would be quieter The staff at the front desk was helpful and the price was definitely good for Manhattan  
P => Loved our stay at the Solita My friend and I stayed at the Clarion Solita Hotel for four nights and had a great time  The entire hotel staff was wonderful  Peter Hakim Stephanie John Emily and the maids gave us excellent friendly service  The room was small but very nice clean and modern  The flatscreen TV was great  The shower was nice and the bathroom was redone in ble  The beds were very comfortable  You can have a mini fridge put into your room and if you ask for a higher floor it is quiet  The coffee maker was very handy  The room location and the staff made this the perfect getaway  Thanks to everyone at the Solita You were great  
P => great location I just got back from a two night stay at this hotel with my  yr old dhter  We have stayed in the theatre district many times and wanted a different location for a change  This was perfect  Yes the room was small but we were only there to shower and sleep so no problem  The room was immaculate and was nicely appointed  What everyone says is true  a great shower with lots of hot water  We liked the fact that we were only  blocks from China Town and Little Italy and very close to Soho shopping  For quick morning coffee and breakfast runs turn right out of the hotel go  blocks to Ferraras Italian bakery  Or go  blocks up to Spring St  Balthazaars french bakery is there  Both were great  We also had a great meal at a little place called Mexican Radio nearby  While this hotel has no ammenities like a gym restaurant etc  its perfect for people like us who were out and about all day and dont go to New York City to hang around the hotel  We will definitely go back  
P => Great Service Clean ideal location This Hotel rooms are small but very clean with great hospitality  Great deal  The young lady at the front desk was very helpful and kind  I brought a group of  and they handled the groups needs with propt service  All the people that went on the trip loved their stay  The hotel is very modern equiped with flat screen tvs and sleak interior design  Very accommodating and I would definitly recommend  
P => The Good The Bad and The Ugly The Good The room was very clean with nice pillows and bed linen  The AC worked well not a small thing in summertime NYC  Free internet in room The Bad This was probably the smallest room Ive ever had in a US property  My room had two beds  One side of each bed was against the wall with less than an  in  aisle between them  The room has a tiny wardrobe with a safe being the only storage space  The hotel has NO amenities no bar no restaurant no business center and no parking or ent loadingunloading area  The ice and vending machines are only located in the quotlobbyquot area  The first night the water temp regulator in the shower wasnt working and I almost scalded myself  The AC was one of the loudest Ive encountered but that did mask the street noise and music from the nightclub others have mentioned  On this visit I was required to have a vehicle  The nearest garage was about  blocks away and cost just under  dollars to park overnight  Did I mention that this place is small There are only  rooms per floor I could literally stand in the elevator and open the door to my room The Ugly I had to cut my stay short due to being called home by my employer  I immediately called the hotel from my work location and told them I would be checking out  days early  The desk clerk said OK not a problem  The night before my departure I stopped by the desk to confirm everything with the desk clerk  At first they denied I had met the notification deadline and they would have to charge for an extra night  After I showed her my phone log she then said I told them I was checking out not the next day but the day after that  She said she would check into it and get back to me  She never did  The next morning at checkout the desk clerk was adamant that I said Thurs and not Wed and refused to remove the charge for the extra night  The manager had not arrived for work yet so I couldnt discuss it with them  Since I had a plane to catch I couldnt hang around to wait for the manager to show up  The matter has been turned over to my corporate travel office for resolution If you are in NYC for pleasure this place might be OK depending on your tastes  If you are there on business avoid it like the plague  The lack of facilities size and flexibility on the managements part make it a poor choice in my opinion  
P => great great great This hotel was perfect  It was  blocks one way to chinatown which has a subway station that will take you anywhere or  blocks the other way to little italy which has fabulous food  The hotel was very clean and the front desk was so helpful and nice  The room is a little small but other than that this is the very best hotel in NYC  The price is perfect  
P => A great experience  I had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel which is modern well maintained well staffed and in a great location  I was just a couple of blocks from the Canal Street subway from which you can get anywhere in a few stops on the express trains plus three great neighborhoods are within walking distance Soho Greenwich Village Chinatown  Hotel staff are friendly and helpful  
P => Couldnt ask for more   just what we hoped for I have just got back from a weekend in New York  I wanted to find somewhere in the heart of downtown and somewhere laid back and pleasant as it was a th present for my husband  When I started looking to book I looked at all the fancy boutique hotels around Soho and the East Village but then came across SoLita in Soho through a web search  I am so glad I booked it  The front of desk staff are really friendly and the room was small but very clean with a lovely view  The bed linen was lovely and the bed was very comfortable  The bathroom although a little old was clean and the double headed shower always gave a lovely hot flow  When we stepped outside and got our bearings we discovered we were slap bang between Little Italy and China Town with all its buzz and interest  We were also right by Broadway with all its shops and only five mins from the centre of cultural Soho  The price was great and you pay for what you get with the SoLita no frills but very happy friendly service  They booked us a car back to the airport and we were able to leave our luggage with them so we could enjoy our last day  
P => Great little hotel in the hottest part of NYC Looking for a reasonably priced but well located hotel around SOHO Tripadvisor helped us choose this modest hotel  We were initially concerned by the size of the room tiny and were constantly annoyed by the lack of storage space for a couple BUT we had such a good time when we were out of the hotel which was most of the time and slept well when we were there that we couldnt see any merit in spending  times as much for anything more upscale  The bathroom was fine beds comfy housekeeping a high standard  Front desk girls were great   guys not so helpful  Cheap entry to a fantastic gym around the corner was a bonus  One problem   a noisy club abutts the hotel and we could hear quotduf dufquot on the th floor on one night  Fortunately we travel with a white noise maker to drown out such noises  I know the hotel is concerned about this and is trying to tone them down  Best bet   book a room above the th floor  In sumy not a quotspecialquot hotel but a good honest and exceptionally well positioned place to call home for a few nights  They would do themselves a favour by increasing storage even hooks on walls as suggested by a previous reviewer  
P => Friendly great location Our group rented  rooms at the Solita Soho hotel at the end of ch  Its a great location if you want to get out of Midtown and see an entirely different side of Manhattan  We walked to and from Little Italy Chinatown the Lower East Side Tenement Museum and Katzs Delicatessen the East Village the West Village Soho and the Brooklyn Bridge  Several subway stops within   blocks Rooms are small but not so much by New York standards  Clean and nicely appointed with internet connection flat screen tv and two head shower  Staff was very friendly and helpful great at recommending restaurants and bars within a few blocks of the hotel The only complaint amongst our group was from someone staying on the rd floor due to the club noise mentioned in other posts  Nobody else in our group staying on th floor and above were affected  
P => Second Stay   Just as nice My friend and I try to get up to Manhattan every year  This year we stayed at the Solita again  The staff there is wonderful the place was clean and safe and while it is low on storage space you can make it work  The one thing Id love to see them put in is some coat hooks on the wall though  The beds are comfortable and the room was quite clean  Yes the room is small but for the rates and amount of time you actually spend in the room its works well  The shower actually has water pressure which is also a nice touch   Everyone at the front desk greeted us and there were cars waiting for us when we needed to leave the area  The front desk person was nice enough to arrange that for us when we mentioned we were checking out later that day The only issue we had was noise from the nightclub downstairs on one of the four nights we were there  The music was turned up loudly and I think when we go back we will ask for a higher floor we were on floor   The neighborhood is great  You have soho  blocks away chinatown and the subway  blocks away and litte italy  blocks away  Theresa great diner across the street reasonable priced ent food and I have never seen two people work as hard as the ladies in there do  Great for a cheap breakfast or a quick lunch  The bar around the corner Lafayette bar is a great place not responsible for the aforementioned noise either  Very nice group of people there  Coming back to the hotel regardless of hour I never felt unsafe during our stay  I will definitely be back 
P => A great downtown hotel I have just returned from spending a week in New York at the Solita Soho with two friends  We were attracted to the hotel by the good rates and downtown location and were definitely not disappointed Just a few blocks from the main streets of Chinatown and Little Italy the hotel is in a perfect location to explore the downtown area of Manhattan  Greenwich village Union Square and the East Village are all walkable if youre a keen walker like me  For places further aflied the Subway is just two blocks away For breakfast a cafe is located across the street which serves reasonable food and there are lots of other cafes and restaurants in the surrounding area  At night we felt and indeed were perfectly safe walking the streets even well past midnight  To the previous reviewer if you were scared walking around here I dread to think how you would react to a genuinely unsafe neighbourhood  As for our room it was small as you would expect in NY but clean and comfortable  Bathroom was compact but we got a small tub and a lovely two headed shower  The quotqueenquot beds were pretty small but very cosy and you get a flatscreen TV with plenty of channels  We were up on the th floor and had a good view of the old Police Headquarters building and the surrounding streets The quotnightclubquot mentioned in other reviews was audible from the lobby but not from our room  Incidentally the entrance to this bar is around the corner on Lafayette Street and is worth a visit   Moroccan themed with live music and a fun unpretentious crowd of people there Overall I highly recommend the Solita Soho  Its great location makes for a perfect hotel for those looking to escape the Midtown tourist trap and see more of New York    
P => Solita Soho is so welcoming When my grandson was born early in ch  I needed to travel from Michigan and find a hotel fast  The Solita Soho Hotel is  blocks from my sons residence but I knew nothing about the property  I called for a  night reservation  The first night was booked and I had little time to call around  Christina the manager offered and found another property for me for that first night and I stayed at the Solita for the rest of my stay  I have been going back ever since on a montly basis as have other family members  I book my stays directly and the staff is always helpful and welcoming  I feel like family whenever I go and always stay in the same room  The floors are small with only  rooms so overall it is very quiet and there is a fun diner right across the street for breakfast  I love the Solita  
P => Unpretentious with great location My now  yo dhter and I go to the city every year or so  She always wants to stay in a different place  Id be quite happy to just stay at the Solita from now on  First I will never stay in a midtownTimes SquareRock Center place  Who needs that aggravation when you can get a cab or subway to a show from about anywhere as fastThis place is in the best location I can think of in the city  At the intersection of Chinatown Little Italy and Soho with Lower East Side East Village and Tribeca an easy few blocks walk away The neighborhood felt quite safe and comofortable  Precinct station  yds away  Local breakfast place across the street  Front desk people pleasant and helpful The room was small clean comfortable and functional  Best NY hotel shower Ive experienced Come to think of it the name quotSolitaquot SohoLittle Italy is a bit pretentious  
P => a gem in little italychinatown We stayed here for our st anniversary and enjoyed the hotel very much  the front desk staff was helpful and the bellman exceptional  the location was great close to the subway and within walking distance of some fabulous eateries  the room was well appointed but could have used some detailing as far as cleanliness though it wasnt too bad  we are visiting the city again in  and have booked a room at the solita for our stay  be sure to ask for an upper floor the basement club noise and street noise are LOUD  
P => The place to stay downtown My wife and I stayed at the Solita Soho in ober and ember  three weeks apart  We know the city well and usually stay at her fathers apartment in midtown east side when hes out of town but downtown is really where we spend our time Soho Tribeca Chelsea the Village so we were looking for a downtown hotel that is not  dollars a night in the fall or more  I discovered this place on TripAdvisor what a great site this is and ided to give it a try The best thing about this hotel is the combination of location quality of room and price  Price Hotels in NYC between Labor Day and Xmas are insanely expensive  its high season  but we stayed here for roughly  a night just under  after taxes  In NYC in the fall you could spend more than that and end up in a dump  star ratings are notoriously useless for NYC  There are  lots  of crappy night hotels Quality small but sharp lobby smallish rooms though not unusually so by NYC standards  Ive stayed in smaller rooms for double this price but very nice furnishings linens bathroom carpet flatscreen Zenith wall mounted TV  and free high speed internet just ask for your cable at the desk  Small boutique y feel  Staff is fine  not bad not great  NYC bored but competent Location Unbeatable  There arent that many hotels downtown compared to midtown  This is midway between the Spring St  and Canal St  subway stops two blocks from Broadway and within easy walking distance of many of the best restaurants and funkiest retail in the city  Safety is not an issue  For breakfast just walk to Broadway take a right and Cafe Miro is right there  along with lots of other places  Spring St  three blocks to the north has fabulous restaurants including the famous Balthazar Lombardis pizza and Spring St  Natural among others I only have one caveat about staying here and you must pay attention to it there is a barclub in the basemant of the hotel adjoining and on weekends it is REALLY LOUD until  a m  On our first stay we stayed on the th floor and it was no problem  On the recent stay we were on the second floor and it was insanely loud I would have requested a room change but I knew the hotel was full  So you need to stay on the highest floor possible  Next time I book Ill tell them Im not staying below the th floor period and if they cant guarantee it Ill go somewhere else  Otherwise when we go to NYC this is where well stay  
P => Forget the other reviews   Amazing location  My sister and I stayed there this weekend and were pleasantly surprised after reading the negative reviews  There is tons to do around the hotel  Heart of Soho  blocks Chinatown  blocks Little Italy  block  Could ask for a better location  Staff was very friendly and helpful  Rooms were very clean a little small but come on you are in NYC Definitely give them a chance great place for the money  
P => Better than I expected This is a small hotel with either  or  rooms on each floor  It seems to be in a bit of a no man land but Little Italy Soho and Chinatown are just a couple blocks away  The efficient room size is to be expected from a boutique hotel in New York and suburban people  consider this place small but I found the size to be fine for my trip  The room had one full sized bed one side table one armore approx  ft wide with iron and ironing board a full sized desk with coffee maker and internet access a  in  flat screen tv attached to the wall a luggage rack that fit right next to the desk ble bathroom nice toiletries and a very good shower  I think I was on a floor where there was a water pressure pump as there was great water pressure in the shower  The towels were fine and the bathrobe was a nice touch  There is an updated hotel HVAC wall unit which was a bit loud but at least it was not a radiator that hisses and pings all night  There is a nightclub on the st floor of this motel and when the HVAC fan was not running and drowning out noise I could hear a little bit of the sub woofer from the night club in my th floor room  A set of ear plugs that I normally carry to NY hotels solved that problem just fine  Other than that this hotel was surprisingly quiet when I stayed  NYC is just a loud city in general but this motel is not on a major street so I really did not hear street noise in my room  
P => small but nice Great location where soho little italy and chinatown meet  Stayed there for business and was lucky enough to be there during the San Gennaro feast in Little Italy  The rooms were clean and the bathrooms looked remodeled and had plenty of room considering the size of the hotel  The staff at the front desk was very helpful  Not the biggest rooms in the world but plenty for one person  Lets remember this is NYC where space is at a premium  
P => It was cool My wife and I just stayed this weekend here and the place was definitely cool This boutique hotel has fifty rooms small and we stayed in the th floor  Amenities in the room were spaciously arranged considering the small room size  The bedsheets and the or were pretty nice along with the black carpet and other sleek stuff  The lobby and lounge were boutique style with suttle neon lights  The only bad part of the hotel is the views its in the middle of chinatownlittle italy area with no scenic views from the rooms  If youre young or into hip stuff and can deal with having a nice small room with uninteresting views it OK 
P => Great Deal Comfortable Stay I stayed at the Solita Soho on a Friday night  I was seriously doubting my choice due to recent postings but I am very glad I stayed at the Solita  As stated in reviews the Solita is small the lobby is small the room is small  However it is also clean convenient and filled with many special touches  The rug was in excellent condition the TV was very cool some kind of smaller flat screen dont know the name the bedspread bed linens pillows and towels were clean and in excellent condition which is such a pleasure when you are away from home  I was on the th floor  The only thing that woke me up during the night was when the heater would come on but I always went right back to sleep  I felt safe and I had an exellent stay  There is a little Greek breakfastlunch diner right across the street where I picked up a delicious toasted bagel which I ordered as take away  A short walk brought me to Spring St  with its wonderful restaurants and shops  They also provided a free NY Times to all guests at each door  I would stay at the Solita again  
P => okay We just stayed there on the ninth floor and had awful construction noise from diagonally across the street It sounded like there were trucks backing up all morning quotBEEP BEEP BEEP    quot  The rooms are really small but you do get what you pay for  We did like the location because we were walking distance to so much   SOHO NOLITA Chinatown and Little Italy  
P => Noise from new restaurant Choose this as thought it was away from the noise of Times Square  However a new restaurant around the corner  Lafayette apparently opened up  It is more of a club with a live DJ playing loud music through the night  Complained but management couldnt do anything  Make sure you dont get a room facing the back or you will need ear plugs to sleep Otherwise it is a nice small room  
P => Terrible place I was down in NYC for a work meeting and my assistant put me down there  After staying there for one night I have to say quotstay away from this placequot  The rooms are extremely small  Also when I was there my toilet was leaking and there was water everywhere in the bathroom Customer service is also poor and there is no lobby to speak of  Also the location of the hotel sucks Its in the middle of Chinatown with no points of interest in the neighbouring couple blocks Conclusion If you are gonna be paying close to   night   why not stay at a better place 
P => Great Location and Nice Hotel While the hotel and rooms are small I really enjoyed my stay  I was there the weekend before Christmas with one of my friends  The staff was able to give me an early check in and the room was what I had reserved  I accidentally interrupted the person setting up my room but he was really nice  I think the rooms could use a coat rack on the one wall they have the TV on  The bathroom was a good size   something thats needed when two women are staying in the room A little short on counter space but with a little creativity it was fine  As a former business traveler Ive slept on a lot of hotel beds  These were some of the most comfortable beds Ive ever slept in  The neighborhood was safe and quiet  Nothing like staying in the noise of times square or midtown  There is a huge police station across the street  It was two blocks from the subway two or three blocks from SoHo and not too difficult to find a cab when needed  There was also a cute little bar around the corner on Lafayette that was great too  The people were really friendly and it was reasonably priced hard to believe in NYC I know  
P => Clean Inexpesive Well located The Solita is a great hotel if you want to avoid midtown tourist crowds and high prices  My wife and I along with my sister split a room on the fifth floor with two double beds facing Grand St  The rooms are small I would not add a th adult but are clean and well appointed  The beds are also very comfortable and the double headed shower is very soothing  A bit of noise reaches the room from the streets below but it is nothing out of the ordinary if you are used to living in a city  As far as location I dont believe I have ever stayed in a better one in the City  I often stay at the Millenium Hilton near the WTC site because of its great rooms and rates but the trade off is a remote location  The Solita is two blocks from Mulberry St  in Little Italy and you can walk to the best bars and restaurants on the LES and in Soho within  mins  The best pub in NYC Puck Fair is a three minute stumble away at the corner of Layfayette amp Houston  Finally the B D F V N R W  trains are all within a five minute walk as well  Highly recommended if you are looking for something affordable below midtown  
P => Just Say NO There are much better options than this hotel in this price range  They charged us for an extra room and four months later we are still dealing with it  The hotel manager is rude and nasty  The rooms are cramped even by NY standards and the airconditioner sounds like a truck engine  You would do better to spend the extra money and stay at the Grand or if you are on a budget The Holiday Inn in the East Village at least they treat you like a guest instead of an intruder  
P => Great hotel for a short break I stayed at this hotel for  nights for a christmas shopping break with my boyfriend  The best thing about the hotel is its location its actually in Little Italy rather than Chinatown and its about a  minute walk from Soho  The room was fine   clean modern nice bed nice TV    and no smaller than the average new york hotel room  The only drawback is that the hotel offers no additional amenities e g  restaurant bar or gym but that didnt bother us at all  One other thing   the heater in the room isnt ideal  It makes a noise so you cant leave it on during the night  But we had no serious complaints and its a lot cheaper than other good downtown hotels like the Soho grand  
P => The most comfortable beds in the world Situated in China Town my first impressions of the area werent great especially given the price tag that came with the room while the hotel itself looked very inviting and clean there was a building site accross the street and streets bore more than a striking resemblance to Soho in London  Once inside our room though it was a different matter plazma screen tv adorned the wall and a double headed shower in the bathroom was a really nice touch  My friend and I shared a twin room which had quite simply the most confortable beds in the world with  big soft pillows each  While the room was rather on the small side it had everything we could want in there The staff were a little New York with their approach to customer service but were very helpful if you asked for something specific recommending places to eat for us and helping us with the trains etc The location of the hotel was dissapointing to me at first but it was soon very apparent that we had the best positioned hotel in New York not only were we one block away from all the shops on Broadway but also close to the fashionable Greenwich and Chelsea areas and in the best place ever for chinese or Italian food The other thing we found with the location was that after going into midtown Manhatten and shopping til we fell over it was easy to get a cab back to Soho as the streets were mostly clear and a far cry from the total gridlock and noise which you would have to encounter if you were staying in Time Square for instance I would fiercely recommend this hotel to anyone going to New York and would stay there again if I went back  
P => ent My friend and I in our s stayed here in ober so we could attend the Halloween parade in Greenwich Village  The hotel was small  we actually walked right past it at first The lobby and rooms are very modern and clean  It seems as though they  be adding a bar in the near future  The phone in our room did not work but we loved the bathroom faucet that comes out of the wall and the double shower head  It was an easy walk to the Village  however the area surrounding the hotel is questionable at night  You have to walk a couple blocks north to get to the nice part of Soho with the trendy shops and bars  We didnt feel as safe when we walked east or west of the hotel  We thought it was pricey  per night but it was the cheapest we could find in the area  
P => A fantastic place to stay My husband son dhter son in law and I stayed at the SoLita SoHo while attending a Bar Mitzvah over the weekend reserving two rooms  The hotel has a great location as far as being able to walk to a variety of popular sites  The rooms are small but very organized with storage places for all your needs  The beds are extremely comfortable with down pillows amp blankets and obviously soft expensive linens  There are modern touches throughout the rooms including a flat screen TV  Also the gentleman at the front desk during our stay was always helpful and polite answering our many questions and responding to any request quickly  
P => Vaguely trendy   but nothing too special I usually stay at the Hudson when in NY   which I love in spite of its tiny rooms   it gets everything else right  On this occasion though my business was down SoHo way so I gave this hotel a try What can I say Its OK   but its not the Hudson even though it would like to be in a smaller way For a start it has no bar and nowhere to eat  The rooms are tiny and the flatscreen tvs are not top notch  Its a small hotel in a slightly out of the way location     ie its in a rougher street than usual  But if you love the shops on Broadway eg Dean amp Deluca etc its very conveniently positioned for all the SoHo trendy places Would I stay there again Its relatively cheap I guess    but I think Id spend a bit more and stay at the SoHo Grand next time Im down this way  
P => Good location but noisy    My husband and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago  The outside and the street area dont make it too inviting but the location turned out to be really great  We had dinner reservations in Soho and it was so convenient to be just a quick walk away from the hotel  Little Italy is also just a few blocks away which was nice The main problem we had was the noise we were on the th floor and the street noise was fairly loud but understandable  It was the noise on our floor that was more irritating  There are only  rooms per floor so the hallways are tiny  There were also linen and electrical closets on our floor so we were constantly hearing keys gling and doors opening and closing   VERY loudly  They have flat panel TVs attached to the wall  No matter how many times we tried to adjust the angle the TV screen would fall to tilt downwards so my husband rigged it up somehow wa pen cap  This is not a huge deal seeing as we only watched it for a specific baseball game but if you care about that sort of thing it might be annoying I would definitely recommend this hotel for early risers who dont mind being woken up in the morning or the afternoon by all of the noise  You really cant beat the location for the price  
P => Great location great little hotel We just returned from a trip to look at New York University for my son  I hadnt been in the city in  years so I asked my travel agent to book something within walking distance of the university  I couldnt have been happier This hotel is so well located and more than that it has the high tech look that I love  From there we walked all over even down to Battery Park and Ground Zero  The rooms are handsome and use space very efficiently  There wasnt much maneuvering room but all the amenities are there    hair dryer tv high speed Internet etc  I brought the wrong ethernet cable and the concierge gladly gave me one  There are a couple parking lots within walking distance too if you have to have a car  One tiny problem was that the pipe in the shower began clanking just as the temperature got to the perfect point  You could stop it by making the temp a tad warmer or cooler  Otherwise a fantastic place 
P => Nice LITTLE hotel I stayed at the Solita SoHo from      The hotel is small only  rooms per floor but it was relatively new and modern  I traveled with a large group and  people complained about the room size but these were also people who had never been to NYC and didnt understand that in NYC space comes at a premium The beds were very comfortable the rooms have plasma screens because the rooms are so small  The bathroom was also nice  The bed linens were all white the carpet was black and the window coverings were gold  Each room comes with a robe and complimentary bottled water they also leave a bottle of  water if you want to buy it  The high speed internet onnection was free  The only drawback was the ONE elevator  We were on the th floor but we never had to use the stairs  If you have trouble walking you  want to request a room on a lower floor in case of an emergency   or you get tired of waiting for the elevator  The hotel is close to lots of shopping on Broadway and Canal Streets and restaurants   the place across the street should be for emergencies only   its not all that  The subway is also close  If you travel alone or are cozy with your travel partner youre good to go in these close quarters  I was with my sister and we shared a room as kids so it was no big deal for us  
P => Couldnt Ask for More My friends and I mid twenties visited NYC for the day in the beginning of e  After we finished spending all our money shopping in Soho we made our way to Chinatown for a quick lunch  The three of us ided to stay in the city for the night instead of going home to New Jersey  We walked in to the Holiday Inn in Chinatown but they were completely sold out so they recommended us to The SoLita SoHo Hotel  Only two blocks away we arrived to the brand new boutique hotel  The lobby is a trendy modern design with its blue lights chrome walls and vibrant music  The young man at the front desk even ran to open the doors for us so we could fit through with all our shopping bags  I must say the staff from front desk to housekeeping to management were extremely helpful and friendly and greeted us with warm smiles during the extent of our stay  As we entered our room on the th floor the size wasnt much of a problem what can you expect in NYC since we requested  double beds  The rooms layout is perfect   everything you need is in the room  Plus everything was comfortable and convenient including the plasma TV double showerheads ble bathroom and wonderfully comfortable beds I also loved the black carpet    the hotel is definitely bringing out the modern look  The price was  but it was worth it  Believe it or not their rooms cost less than most hotels in the area  You get the best of  worlds   Soho Little Italy and Chinatown  If you want to grab a bite plenty of bakeries stores and restaurants are within walking distance  The hotel is highly recommended for tourists couples friends and students  Oh I forgot to mention that I thought I locked myself out of our room but I put the key in the wrong way   I thought the light was broken so I called down to the front desk and they sent a copy up right away before I could try it again  I guess thats a plus for a smaller hotel   you get more attention I love everything about the SoLita SoHo Hotel and already have another room booked with my boyfriend for the end of ust 
P => Great Place to stay Location is perfect  We stayed at the Solita Soho for  nights in e  and had a wonderful time  The location is great especially if you love to eat Chinatown and Little Italy are at your doorstep  Shopping up Broadway is just a few blocks away  Greenwich Village is an easy walk  Staff is very accomodating and welcoming  Room is a bit small but very clean and nicely furnished   loved the plasma TV and the double showerhead The bed is also very comfortable Street noise can get a bit bothersome but with the air conditioning in operation it was hardly noticeable  We had a problem with the elevator and had to climb  flights of stairs but it wasnt as bad as it seemed  Found out in better shape than we thought We booked for the Italian Festival and cant wait to return  
P => Great location and price We just stayed at this hotel over a long weekend  It was great value for the money  The hotel sits at the intersection of the Soho Chinatown and Little Italy neighborhoods  A great FrenchItalian cafebakery where you can eat breakfast is just two blocks away on Grand  The rooms are contemporary and like a mini W Hotel love the Plasma TVs  I will definitely stay here again  Hint   Ask for a room that ends in quotquot e g    These are rooms on the corner of each floor that are a little roomier  
P => Good Value We stayed here for a week in il  The hotel is on the NW edge of Chinatown and is convenient to subways shopping and restaurants  We were on the th floor and like other reviewers could hear and feel the trains running under the building  The rooms are small but the bed was very comfortable the internet access was broadband the TV was LCD flat screen and the double headed shower made me want one at home  The hotel is small our floor had only four rooms  The staff is friendly and doesnt try for a tip ever time you turn around  I have two complaints  There are not enough hangers in the closet and the staff didnt have any extras  Also the black carpet was dirty and needed to be shampooed  Other reviewers have touted the pancake shop across the street for breakfast  We only tried it once  There are more interesting places within short walks nearby

P => Wonderful room  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  The service was above and beyond  The staff was knowledgeable fast and super courteous  Room was GREAT and located right at the  subway station and a block from the  or  This hotel gets top ratings from me  
P => Nice hotel   great for weekend trip My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our time at the Club Quarters  We got a room on priceline it wasnt cheap though but nothing in NY is  It was definitely quite a bit less than the list price on all the usual sites approx  less and anything that I saw in Manhattan  The hotel itself is pretty far down Financial District but it worked for us We were just a short subway ride from everything we wanted to see    Broadway central park etc  The hotel is very near the South Street Seaport which has a TXTS booth half price or discounted Broadway tickets and a variety of shops  We received a free bottle of wine cookies and chocolate covered raisins upon arrival  Also we were upgraded on arrival doesnt help to ask   even with priceline to a superior room from standard on the th flr  I realize that the regular rooms are pretty small at least thats what Ive heard so it might have been less enjoyable with a smaller room  Recommended for people who wont be too upset that they are not in the very very heart of Manhattan for tourists at least  Near Wall Street Century  and basically steps from the subway stop  Yay for New York 
P => Priceline Trap Priceline Trap  Ok first mistake using Priceline never again  Now for the hotel it s really for the business traveler  I was in the suite which I had to upgrade from Priceline so the room cost more  Priceline booked us in twin beds  I ll take twin beds if in Europe The room has a basic feel and style it s an over size office  The bathroom is tiny and not private at all so if your with people that you don t know so well OR had curry your not going to like the bathroom set up  The suite had a king size bed on one side and desk and pull out sofa on the other  The room has an open partition so you can hear the TV in the sleeping area over on the other side where the pull out is located  TV s are small be a quot  Room was clean so that s plus and love they have a water machine on each floor  Warning the area of the hotel on the weekends is a ghost town and taxis are hard to come by  Front desk not very helpful this hotel is on the self serve side  Overall if your looking for a fun NYC weekend and want to bump into other travelers this is not the place  There s really no lobby so you won t hear I just eat at this great place we just saw so an so etc   If you want your stay to be low key for a weekend trip and know your way a bit around the city it s stay able  Since your right in the Wall Street area I m sure a M F stay will have more of a jumping atmosphere  
P => Perfect   For the right kind of trip This hotel is great for the right kind of trip  Its not luxurious beautiful or even remotely interesting    but it is clean comfortable and inexpensive The downtown location is perfect for wall street business travelers and offers easy access to nearly all NYC subway lines which is a huge plus Its a great stay for anyone who is familiar with NYC and looking for an affordable bed while they explore the city    but i would not recommend this for anyone who intends to spend lots of time in their hotel room or is looking for luxury accommodations  
P => Good HotelGood Location My wife and stayed here overnight  It is located in the Financial District and  not be the best choice for a first time visitor to NYC  But if you are looking for affordable accomadations and a ent value it was good  I would also recommend it for a short stay  
P => Very nice hotel for a nice price After a bid on priceline was accepted by this hotel I visited tripadvisor to look at reviews  There was one negative review in particular that had me scared of what I  find upon arrival  Needless to say this hotel does not deserve a bad rating  The price was right and the room was very very nice  In fact the room was double the size of what I had previously enjoyed in New York City  In addition the chilled spring water was a lovely added bonus  The subway is one block down the street from the hotel and while this hotel is not located in the hustle and bustle of NYC it is pleasant to not be in such a busy area and everything is yes a short subway ride away  I definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Got better after Check in I got this hotel through Priceline so although the view consisted of the rooftop ac unit I got a great deal  After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor I was disappointed and worried that I got this hotel  Check in was not so great  We walked up to the front desk lobby is tiny and nothing fancy and waited for the receptionist to serve us  Then another couple walked up behind us to get in line while we waited  However instead of serving any of us the receptionist served a pushy young woman who walked up and butt in front of all of us to ask about her dry cleaning  My friend and I as well as the other couple behind us all looked at each other for being brushed aside like that  He could have politely told her to wait while he served us who have been waiting patiently Thankfully that was the only negative thing about our stay  Although the lobby was tiny there was an adjoining quotclub roomquot with nice furnishings and  computers for free use  There is free wi fi throughout the hotel i had no problem using my ipod touch to surf the net from my room  I was relieved when we got to our room and it was big enough for NYC standards  Its not like we spent a lot of time in the room anyway  It was very quiet  The furnishings were modern and new albeit kind of IKEA like and the room and bathroom were clean  There is free filtered water w bottles in the self serve closet in the lobby along with other little basics like more coffee amp sugar so that you didnt have to go ask for it  The hotel is right next to Wall Street directly next to Trump Tower and convenient to subways  Its within walking distance of the Staten Island Ferry and the ferries to the Statue of LibertyEllis Island  The only thing is since its in the financial district its pretty dead on the weekends and even Starbucks near the ferry opens late am or later  That didnt bother me too much bc it also meant the area was quiet at night  There are some restaurants behind the hotel  If you want to be right where all the action is stay further up in midtown Manhattan  For us it was no big deal to jump on the subway to get up there quickly Checkout was better than check in  It was a different guy and gal much friendlier  They let us check our bags after checking out of the hotel since we werent leaving NYC until later in the evening and he said it was no hurry at all to pick them up  Overall my friend and I were very happy w the hotel and would stay there again  
P => Perfectly fine for the price We got a great deal through Priceline over the Labor Day weekend stayed  nights at CQ Downtown  The standard room we got was small yes but very well designed to fit in all the important things  bed tv desk wardrobe  Bathroom had only a shower but it was spacious and clean  Asked for extra pillows as we were going out for dinner they were in our room when we returned  We knew when we booked that the Wall Street area clears out on long weekends but we enjoyed walking around with lots of other tourists the old streets Club Quarters is what it is  not a full service hotel but fine if what you want is a reasonably priced room with FREE INTERNET  We figured with what we saved on the room we covered some other more important city splurges  
P => This is not a  or   star hotel despite anything priceline of hotwire says My partner and I stayed here for  nights recently after buying the rooms over Priceline  I specifically wanted a   star hotel and was hoping for the soho area  This is conveniently located if you want to spend time around wall street   otherwise you will be on the subway frequently  The room was like a converted motel room  The shower hadnt been reated since the s at a guess and the hot water service was intermittent  During our first day there was no hot water at all  On other days it only seemed to work at off peak times i e after midnight and around midday  The mattress was hard and not very comfortable   only  pillows are provided and you are directed to a communal guest closet if you want extras  Unfortunately the extra pillows were stained yellow and extremely lumpy  There is no way this is even a  star hotel let alone a   star  After  days here we moved to the Roosevelt in midtown   a hotel that has its own faults but at least it is   stars as advertised Staff all seemed ok though  
P => You get what you pay for Not a nice NYC hotel I unfortunately got this hotel through a Priceline scam    if you name your own price on priceline for a hotel in quotSohoFinancial Districtquot this is the one you will get  Pay extra money and pick out your own hotel  The room is VERY small and dirty  There was dust everywhere and the room smelled  I wore flip flops the entire time I was in the room  especially in the shower gross There was hardly any hot water and the water pressure was like showering in a drinking fountain  I woke up everytime the air conditioner turned on during the night  it is so loud you can barley sleep through itThe only positive about the hotel was the staff   they were very nice and helpful The location would be ok for someone in NYC for business and not having to travel far from the financial district  You end up spending more money on transportation to and from the hotel then if you paid for a hotel in a better location  
P => Value in NYC Perfect for short stays in NYC and a new neighborhood for many to explore  The hotel is very clean and has free purified water in the hall  Although this hotel is in the financial distrcit there were plenty of people around on the weekend and there is an indooroutdoor bar and restaurant nearby     Ulysses  A walk from Battery Park up the Hudson is a must  The subways are nearby for quick travel uptown  Duane Reade drugstore accross the street has all the essentials  Cheap eats can be found near city hall  The room like apts in NYC was tiny  
P => Is this really what  star hotel gets one in NYC This hotel was rated  stars by people who have reviewed it or higher on this site  Reviews describe free internet connectivity in the lobby   that is IF you can ever find a computer free     ever Our room looked like a converted dorm room   did I say TINY The photos online are very eptive  Essentially we had a queen sized bed a desk chair with built in desk and a single chair in the entire room The TV was attached to the wall  The one positive thing I can say is it was clean  We wont stay there again as it was just too small for us to feel comfortable  be a single traveler wouldnt mind  Staff was friendly and helpful  
P => Just Fine I went to this hotel for a week end escapade  The location is fine but during the week end the area is dead as its the financial district  The room were small there is flat screen TV and free wireless internet that is great  The bed were comfortable  On each floor there is bottled water service for free  The service were limited only a small gym that was close during my stay  Also there is no parking at the hotel  You have to take the one on Liberty street not so far   The staff were not helpful considering we want to add a room they did not try to accomodate us   they just say the hotel is full  I will recommand it for a business trip because of its location and services offered 
P => Its fine not great but fine We got a good deal on this hotel at priceline and it was much more reasonable than staying in times square  The room was very very small with one queen sized bed  The room was clean and there were complimentary beverages in the lobby  Check in was easy except that the computer kiosks they use for check in randomly assign room and we got a smoking room  The staff changed it for us without a problem  I would probably pass on staying here again  
P => Good hotel Great location would definitely stay again This hotel was great  The room was small but we didnt need anything big   I mean were in New York   we only needed the room to drop off our shopping bags in and sleep The location is awesome   close to the subway ground zero Century  best shopping the Chelsea Piers    Everything was in walking distance  The staff are super helpful and nice  I would absolutely stay here again The room has air conditioning not loud at all and we had a microwave and mini fridge as we were there for a full week no extra charge  The only down side was the hotel restaurant Williams  It was way overpriced for what we got which is why we only ate there once and the service was not so stellar  The up side to that is there are  other restaurants within walking distance  The atmosphere is cozy and we felt very safe and at home  I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends and I will book again on my next trip to NY  
P => Was better in person great hotel I first read the reviews on here before booking because Travelocity offered an unbeatable flighthotel package for this hotel  I read reviews that it was a great hotel just had small rooms so I was expecting for my room to be small but it wasnt  be because my room was at the end of the hall dont know but it was a nice size  I enjoyed the bottled water feature in the hallway cool or appreciated the ipod dock very clean and the water pressure in the shower was perfect  Ive stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania and the Hyatt in NY in the past but I loved the Club Quarters the best  Red Bull Restaurant was great as well  
P => Great hotel for the money We spent the Memorial Day weekend at this hotel and booked it on Priceline for  a night  Just what we needed  Room was spacious for NY standards and very quiet  Entire area was quiet because it was a holiday weekend and that was wonderful because there was zero street noise  It is just around the corner from the  and the  subway and close to other lines  Easy to get anywwhere in the city  It was great for our needs however I didnt love the shower in the bathroom but thats just me  Very clean and there is free internet in the lobby  I would recoomend this hotel to anyone  
P => Very Nice Hotel in a Nice Location Hotel is cool  Very cool  Ive been reading reviews and they obviously dont know much about this hotel  Staff is nice  Rooms are kind of small but what do you want it to be Its a hotel and your in NYC  Who stays in the room Subway is like  steps from the door  Police are patrolling the area all day and all night with AK s  No violence going on down here   haha  Cant wait to go back up there and I will be staying at this hotel  Great place  Me and my bro had a awesome time here  Thanks Club Quarters 
P => Good Quick Business Stay I see other reviewers have issues with this hotel i e  WiFi service  I did not attempt to use the WiFi service  My company had me stay at this hotel for a few nights for meetings around Wall Street  The location is excellent for downtown in the Financial District of NYC  Also the hotel is incredibly quiet  I was surprised by this since the rooms since close along the halls but I absolutely heard nothing during my stay  The hotel rooms are small but all you need for staying on business  I would not recommend this hotel for a leisure trip to NYC for a couple  The restaurant closes early by NYC standards   but it is Downtown  It closes about  p m  However there are menus for local restaurants at least one that is open  hours where you can place an order for delivery have it charged to your room as well as delivered by the hotel who receives the order in the lobby I would recommend this hotel for a business stay in downtown Manhattan  
P => Not so much a business hotel My company booked me here for a business trip  I know not to expect much in the way of space or quiet in a NYC room  However for a hotel that supposedly caters to the business traveler CQ has some problems  WiFi connection is unreliable  There are only two PCs in the business center which is part of the noisy lobbylounge  Barebones amenities in the guest rooms and the help yourself closet is usually out of the basics  For instance one iron and ironing board per floor usually one or both are gone  I like the fact that hotels now give you the option of leaving your towels on the floor to be washed or hanging them up to be used again  However I dont like leaving my towel on the floor to be washed and coming back to find it hung back up This happened to me and to a colleague staying the same week as I was  As it is you get only two far from luxurious towels  Having to reuse one picked up from the floor is a bit much  Finally the beds are unusually hard and there are no extra pillows or blankets unless you get lucky looking in the help yourself closet  
P => best deal in New York City I have stayed in almost every hotel in the city and this hotel for the price might be the best   From the time Jackie and Ms Maldanodo check you in you feel like part of the CQ family   The rooms were nice and clean and what are you expecting for the price This truly is a great value and for the price its awesome        anybody who complains is soing so out of not knowing the ket I LOVE THIS HOTEL and will be back      great people and a great price makes this your    destination in NYC 
P => Great Downtown Location Booked this hotel last minute on Priceline and think I got a good deal Room was small but I expected that and they made good use of space When I booked it gave me  Queen bed but when I checked in I asked if I could have  twins and it was no problem There was a bar and restaurant that looked very nice although we didnt try it There was a parking garage around the corner and it was  for  hours  Will stay here again on next trip  
P => Nice Hotel We stayed in this hotel for one night in il  Check in was very quick  The room was ent size  The only thing that I can honestly say I didnt like about the room was the shower  It was more like a shower at the gym  It was only a shower no tub and as someone else had mentioned previously it took probably  minutes for the water to get hot  We really enjoyed the bottled water that was supplied on each floor  I got an excellent price through Priceline and would definately stay again but not for the rack rate  We checked out early Sunday morning and they held our bags for us until later in the afternoon with no trouble whatsoever  Very close to the subway  Turn left and walk one block and there it is   Very convenient  
P => Exceptional Service I was intially booked to for a reg room however they ided to give me an upgrade for free  The suite had two TV a bedroom and a living room  The suites were clean and also had free bottled service  THe location is exceptional located very only a block away from the Subway  
P => Great Hotel for Business or Solo Travel Perfect for young businessmen in the heart of the financial district  Dont be fooled the outside looks like a health club and there isnt much of a lobby  I enjoyed free use of their computers in their business center to check internet  The rooms are clean attractive and small adequate by NY standards  I especially liked the in room coffee maker and microwave as well as the filtered water in the hallway  A bonus was the mini frig NOT stocked with mini bar supplies so I had room for the few items from the pharmacy found on the corner  The subway  line to Manhattan is one block away and it made it easy to get around  I highly recommend HopStop com to help navigate around NYC I stayed three nights in NYC and each night I stayed at a different hotel I felt adventurous  This hotel was booked through Hotwire at night  I would definitely stay here again if it were just I  
P => Good Price for a Clean NYC Room  This hotel is not bad  Clean room but out of date good room service but slow and it came in cold and near a metro and South Sea Port  Not a fancy place but okay for a quick NYC trip  However it is not a great location for night activities  We had the hardest time finding cabs in and out of that area specially on weekends  ent spot for business travel Im sure  
P => great deal Clean safe friendly staff down the block from subway  All at a great price 
P => Great place to stay in the Financial District I had heard of Club Quarters but never stayed at one until this year  Ive now stayed here four times  This place is in a great location close to the   subway stop   Wall Street and right in the heart of the Financial District  The rooms are a good size for NYC and have ent amenities  Another great benefit is the Duane Reade across the street pharmacyconvenience store that really helps when you forget something like I do frequently  Theres a lot to do nearby including great pubs bars and restaurants  If you work too much and dont get out they actually have a great service for you  You can order from a list of nearby restaurants Japanese Barbecue Chinese Indian etc  and they charge to your room and deliver to your door  Great service Theres also a great lounge downstairs with a restaurant  Ive yet to eat there but theres a good menu and prices are comparable for the area Overall the value of this place is great considering where it is and what you get  
P => A great value hotel in the uber expensive NYC Its not easy to find a safe and high quality hotel in NYC for an affordable price  Club Quarters Downtown is a great hotel if comfort a convenient location and good value are what youre looking for  Located less than a minute away from a subway station the hotel is in the financial district  Certainly theres not a lot to do in the financial district as a tourist and youll have to either walk or take the subway to the midtown area to see the sights but armed with a subway pass this hotel is perfectly located  The area is quiet at night but very safe so no worries there  The rooms are very clean modern and aesthetically pleasing  The service is fine and the hotel also has free internet on the ground floor  I would definitely recommend Club Quarters Downtown  
P => Sleek and Efficient Business Hotel I got a great deal on this hotel  with taxes and fees through Name Your Own Price on Priceline  My girlfriend and I drove down to New York for the weekend to see a show at Madison Square Gardens Parking here is easy enough for New York City  A valet garage is located across the street and the hotel will validate the ticket the cost was  for  hours  The hotel is located just around the corner from the garage Club Quarters Downtown is representative of the financial district in which it is located  The rooms are small modern and professional  This is not a romantic hotel by any means but the rooms are very comfortable  One nice feature was the adjustable wall mounted flat screen television which can easily be viewed from anywhere in the room There were no cleanliness issues as the room was very tidy upon arrival  The hotel offers numerous amenities including a high tech fitness room and complimentary bottled water on every floor  The room service is affordable and several area restaurants offer excellent late night delivery options There are numerous shops and restaurants in the area and the subway is a block away if the financial district doesnt suit your mood or budget  The area is safe and very quiet at night with little city or traffic noise I would recommend Club Quarters Downtown if you are on business or traveling for work  It is not necessarily family friendly or romantic but this hotel is a great option if you can get a good rate 
P => Great service small rooms and slow internet PROS  GREAT service   check in staff was very nice and welcoming  It was just an attitude of helpfulness and friendliness and very personable  CHEAP prices   I was pretty cheap compared to NY standards  FUNCTIONAL amenities like the Club lounge for all guests with sofa computer printer internet coffee etc and the in room diningflatscreen TV  CENTRAL location   just minutes from Wall StreetCONS  SMALL rooms and bed types are only a choice of one Twin or one Queen for the singlestandard room  Rooms are definitely on the small side but still very functionable  COLD water from showers until you turn it on for  or more minutes eecially in the evening  SLOW and ridiculously slow wireless internet both in room and in lounge  The only way to connect is via wireless internet and it is frustrating as this hotel is a business hotel and people like me need fast internet to work and this is unacceptable  LOUD air conditioning that drives you nuts and makes it difficult to sleep  The air conditoning roars like a lion for  minutes then quiets down for  minutes and roars again   it is difficult to sleep like that  THIN walls and you can easily hear from conversations at the hallway or the other roomOverall I would probably not recommend this hotel unless you are on a budget and want a ent hotel with cheap price in great location  There are many hotels nearby in Wall Street and I will probably consider those other options next time  
P => Great hotel This is a fantastic little hotel in a great location Very friendly staff and excellent facilties  Rooms are a little on the small side but nothing to really complain about  
P => Unforgettable journey I read many feed backs about this hotel  Ill be short then Ive been in this hotel for  day for Christmas holidays I found the room unexspected LARGE very comfortable  The staff was available efficently plus other advantages of place very closed to the stops subways shops and etc I will probably come back if have the pleasure to go to New York again Francesca 
P => Nice place great stay just spend a weekend at this hotel and it was very nice  the rooms are small but its what you would expect from a hotel in NYC  its dowtown but i prefer that location over others simply because at night you can actually sleep without hearing hoards of tourists cars sirens    its quiet and after a whole new york day a bit of quiet is always goodthere is a subway within two steps of the hotel and whitin a few minutes you are midtown in the heart of the action  right around the corner there is a great breakfast and lunch place called Kozina  basically this hotel is really well surrounded with the things you need not to mention it is right in front od a pharmacy which can be quite helpful esp  for famillies with young children the staff was great and really very helpful and polite  there is a parking lot that gives you a discount if you stay at the hotel and its really close by as well  i think it was a bout  a day to k the car after the discountlittle story about the staff we had lost our parking ticket before leaving and we were pretty sure that the cleaning lady had thrown it out by mistake  When we asked the front desk what we could do about it and would the parking let us take out our car she told us yes but that the parking would charge an extra  for the lost ticket since there was a chance it was the cleaning person that threw it out the front desk person immideatly handed us a crisp  bill we hadnt even asked for anything from them and they just handed it to us  that small touch really made a difference you dont get service like that in many placesthe rooms are clean and modern looking yes the bathroom is small but who cares how much time do you really spend in a bathroom anywaythe free bottels of water on each floor is a great plus and the guest closet where you can simply go into and get any extras you  need for no extra cost is a fantastic conceptfree internet in each room AND two PCs in the lounge area that are free to use really make this hotel stand out honestly this place is great and i definetely recomend it it has everything you need in a hotel and a few extras you hadnt even thought of  
P => Great bargain   great staff This place was great I read many positives and negatives on the Internet before I booked  The price was a steal   The room was super clean comfortable well appointed lots of extras like free computers in lobby free bottled water free roll away  The room was compact but very adequate  The staff couldnt have been more helpful were always handy with great directions to get everywhere were friendly and accommodating  There are  subway stations within a block or two  We always felt safe in the area  There was a great coffee shop right downstairs  I was so pleasantly surprised and it was a great experience 
P => great location rooms are big but bathroom is quiet small and ramshackle  The service is not very good staff is rude and hasty  I booked a triple but the th bed wasnt ready  
P => Wack The room is nicely equipped with a microwave mini fridge and coffee maker  Beyond those things there is nothing to get excited about The room is tiny the bathroom is tiny the TV is mounted in an awkward position which makes it weird to view e g  if I lay on my left side in the bed the TV is BEHIND my back you can barely turn around in the shower  The wireless connection from the room is absolutely horrible though it works well from the lobby which cancels out any convenience at all  Ive asked the staff twice about the internet connection only to be told that the quotrouter needs to be restartedquot  Each time there was no noted improvement The room service is WAY too expensive short ribs for    not to mention there are only  lunch amp dinner items on the menu not a lot of variety The location of the hotel is convenient to the financial district though after PM its pretty dead down here  Most of the touristy things are located up town Only stay here if you will be working in the financial district and only if you will be staying here for a few nights  If you really want to get out and see things andor will be staying for more than  nights choose another hotel  
P => Quiet on Weekends for Peaceful Stay in Downtown New York The Club Quarters located in the Financial District of New York ended up being the perfect spot for our long weekend in New York  At first I was bummed that we were not staying in a more culturally interesting area but it all turned out for the best  Since the financial district is so quiet on the weekends it ended up being an oasis in the city  We love walking in New York so each day we used the hotel as our base and walked to Chinatown SOHO etc  We also took the subway when necessary  We also got what I would consider a fabulous deal on this hotel  It only cost   per night on Priceline  Somehow without asking we got assigned the Diplomats Suite  It had two rooms two flat screen TVs a pull out couch King size bed kitchenette though we did not really use it  The bathroom just had a shower which was fine with us  This was a fabulous deal in my estimation for New York City  To boot we had excellent service from all members of the staff  Unrelated to the hotel we ended up getting two parking tickets when we parked near the hotel because we did not read the signs properly so that is a little heads up If we could ever score such a deal in the future I would definitely be up for staying in the Club Quarters again  
P => Great place  Clean Comfortable and Good Location This was a great choice in the big city  The location is perfect as it is a block away from the Wall St  subway station and a few blocks from the busier BroadwayNassau station The room did not seem small considering this is NY  The room was nice and clean the bed was comfortable the bathroom was small but ample enough to be comfortable  The AC worked perfectly and the free WiFi was ent The front desk was very helpful in holding the bags  Early check in is available but not guaranteed and we did not ask for it until the check in day  Upon our return for check in time our bags were already in the room and we were able to get in an hour early with no additional charge Late check out was also provided with no extra charge for a few hours after  AM There was a guest closet on the hall with an iron and a board and emtpy water bottles and a water dispenser with cold water The rest of the hotel was clean and comfortable  
P => Good business location poor presentation and service Club Quarters is located next to Wall street and is ideally situated for a Wall St business visit especially in winter when even a short walk can be uncomfortable because of the extreme cold it was minus  when I stayedHowever the standard is poor   the hotel is in urgent need of a refresh  Wooden finishes were faded and varnish had either peeled or gone  Rooms needed reorating  Corridors need repainting  ACheating was rusty and noisy  It felt more like a hostel than a hotel I expected a bath in the bathroom but there was only a shower  Bathroom probably as clean as the cleaner could get it without reating it but it was very unappealing I arrived on a Sunday and found no food or drink whatsoever at pm  Only water was available  There are very few alternative options within the next couple of blocks   for restaurants take the subway to mid town  When I arrived  minutes after the published opening time for breakfast Monday morning I was advised with no apology or explanation to return in     minutes Staff seemed slow and well reconciled to the idea that service was just not going to happen  I got out fast and stayed in a more expensive hotel for the remaining week and a half  OK its a  hotel  But for a few dollars more you can do so much better  
P => Above Average Experience For a city consistently ranked among the most expensive in the world Club Quarters is a steal The cost per night is still not cheap but the value is alright We stayed in Room   It was quite spacious with high ceilings  The bed was a queen size as promised and the linen were of good quality  There was a flat sheet in between the bed and the top comforter but putting a blanket in between would have been a nicer touch The bathroom was reated and very well kept  It is tinier than most comparable Asian hotels but bigger than European ones  The lack of a bath tub was a disappointment but certainly not a deal breaker Other positives include a writing table a closet flat panel tv free bottled purified water and an quotoutsidequot room service wherein you can call restaurants in the neighbourhood to deliver up to your room  There is a US  charge though but very useful service after an exhausting day around the city Subway station   Wall Street station with lines  amp  is just around the corner  Farther up the road is Fulton Street station for lines A amp C  Any train from both stations will take you directly to important attractions on the west side such as Columbus CircleCentral Park West Upper West Side Rockerfeller Fifth Avenue Times Square Port Authority Bus Terminal th StreetPenn Station th StreetUnion Square GreenwhichChristopher St Tribeca area Soho City Hall  To the east side attractions you might have to transfer trains at another station but take it from me anyone with two working legs will not find it hard we had a baby stroller with us  From the hotel South Seaport Wall St  World Trade Centre City Hall area and the Brooklyn Bridge are all within walking distance Being downtown means you are far away from all the action but with an efficient transportation system and a can do attitude you can conquer Manhattan too 
P => Great hotel We had a mini suite for three nights  We werent in the room much but there was lots of space to spread out and park our things  Clean and well orated  Theres also a business center with computers wifi and delicious cookies in the afternoon  My husband and I had a queen size bed and the kids shared the pullout couch  It was perfect for our requirements  
P => Fantastic Stay for Anniversary Getaway My husband amp I just got back from our first trip to NYC   an anniversary getaway without the kids  This hotel was fantastic for the two of us  The rooms were small but never claustrophobic  They were well appointed and extremely clean  The bed was so comfy The staff was friendly and helpful  We loved the chilled bottled water offered on each floor  Housekeeping was prompt in getting our room cleaned each day  They always only left one washcloth but we knew from reading others reviews that there was a linen closet available on each floor for extras We always felt secure in this area even on the weekend when there isnt as much foot traffic  Security officers were very visible  The subway stations for the amp train and for the amp trains are very convenient to the hotel  There is also a great place for bagels sandwiches and salads next to Starbucks on Wall St  less than a block away  Also a very convenient easy walk to Battery Park to catch the ferry to Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island  Easy walk to the Brooklyn Bridge as well as to the World Trade Center Site Federal Hall South Street Seaport and other lower Manhattan points of interest We had a fantastic trip and would happily stay here again 
P => Loved CQ proximity to dining places and subwaytrain stations My  year old dhter and I stayed at CQ Wall St for  days and we loved the hotel  It is great for business travel to NY where you stay out during the day  The rooms are small but very efficiently planned out  I loved the laundry room where we can do our own laundry anytime  hotel provides soap etc  Also the hotel had a directory of restaurants where they do free delivery and tickets could be charged to the hotel Overall although the hotel has small rooms it is very convenient to subway stations and dining places  Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church is down the block from the hotel and there is a pharmacy as well as a grocery across the street  Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly  We definitely will stay there again in the future  
P => Tiny rooms CQ Downtown is good only for business  The Financial District is empty after  PM and difficult to find food on Sunday evening  Rooms were tiny and need some refurbishing  Breakfast too expensive  You have in the     bathroom a coffee maker  
P => Club Quarters is a great choice   e we stayed at Club Quarters with my family my wife and me dhter grandmother The hotel is in a very good location just one corner to Wall Street few hundred metres to several subway stations  The building is alike to the surrounding mainly office buildings but it is clubsize so the naming quite fits We had two rooms with queen beds and for request the hotel supplied one with a rolling bed for our dhter  years old free of charge  Both rooms were immaculate daily checked and cleaned The staff was very friendly helpful and professional  We were impressed  Among others they were able even to help and communicate with the grandmother when we left her alone for one night  She had problems with the keys to the rooms and we still wonder how she was helped out as she speaks only Hungarian All in all it was a very good place we would definitely return  We can just recommend it  
P => Fantastic Hotel  This is my second review of this hotel this time with photos The highlights of CQDT include Great location  block from the   amp  lines  Only  block from NYSE amp Federal Hall as well as the Trump Building  Adjacent to the CitiCorp complex  Excellent proximity walking distance to the WTC site Battery Park Statue of Liberty ferry Staten Island Ferry free South Street Seaport City HallMunicipal bldg Brooklyn Bridge entrance China Town and so on  Lots of great eateries in the area must try Water Street Deli a few blocks away VERY clean amp nice rooms  Lots of stuff packed into a relatively small room but it works  Queen room includes an awesome bed desk with comfy chair quot flat screen TV extra sitting chair wardrobe cabinet two nightstands alarm clock  VERY clean bathroom   yes its tiny but it works  Great water pressure and temp hard to find in any hotel much less in nyc nice towels  Self service guest closet on each floor  Here you can get extra pillows amp cases iron amp board coffeetea etc  Chilled water dispenser on each floor next to the closet  These are refreshed throughout the day wnew bottles  great on a summer day on your way out  just grab a bottle fill it up amp go FAST LARGE ELEVATORS    and three of them Front desk VERY helpful even printed directions subway route to Target in Brooklyn for us  Theyll also call a private car for you and its roughly the same  as a taxi to the airport  Large menu binder in the room wlots of local restaurants menus most of which will deliver  Hotel has arranged for restaurants to deliver to the hotel and the hotel staff will bring the food to you and just charge the meal to your room  Nice if you dont really carry cash  Its basically room service without having to stick with the hotels menuThings that could improve or are slight annoyances still not THAT big a deal in the grand scheme  Only one ice machine for  floors  Its located on the rd floor   You must request addtl towelswashcloths  They try to conserve resources quotgoing greenquot so unless you throw your items on the floor they wont be replaced  They also do not provide any extras many places give you an extra towel or two   The TV remotes arent so hot  You have to reeeally press the buttons in order to get it to work almost feels like youre going to break it  Had this twice now so it seems to be the norm   Shower could use another shelf or two for shampoo etc   only one tiny corner shelf in the shower stall Overall this has become our favorite hotel in NYC  Yes its off the beaten path but its very easy to get to all the quottypicalquot parts of the city  Although very quiet at night it still feels safe even around the subway station  All you have to do is tell your driver youre at quotWall St and William Stquot and they should know where that is at the very least just tell them youre a block from the Stock Exchange   everyone in the city knows where that is  One thing to note however is that the Financial District isnt on a grid pattern like the rest of Manhattan so it can be rather confusing when walking around especially due to the numerous  block long streets that seem to go nowhere  Otherwise its a fantastic spot with VERY easy access anywhere else you  want to go take note however subway routes change at midnight so the stops arent as frequent and lines change  Stay here youll love itNo rooms arent huge but lets be serious   ITS NYC for goodness sakes what do you expect  You want large rooms stay at The Plaza or the Ritz  Its a great little hotel with excellent service cleanliness and amenities  
P => Great Stay at Club Quarters Downtown Really enjoyed this hotel  Great location near a variety of subways  Given the heat wave the great ac was much appreciated  Loved the free water and wireless internet  Also liked having a small fridge and micro in the room  Will definitely stay here again  
P => Really good hotel This hotel is really very good and functional  The ubication is perfect if you want to see the Downtown ambient at first time in the morning and if you go early to bed because there is no atmosphere in the zone  Theres no funny but its really good if you want just sleep The rooms are comfortable clean elegant and spacious I had no complaint  
P => Great hotel in quite location This hotel is not the most central hotel in New York as it is in the financial district   however it is clean great quality good rooms nice service and provides good value for money  You get satalitte TV ent sized rooms air con and full en suite  There is free water gym pool and internet access as well as complimentary use of a computer  Once you have worked out the difference between local and express undergrounds there are plenty of stations nearby  The area is really nice and has a really nice vibe   its two mins from the stock exchange and despite the quiter location you can still find food or drink into the small hours  The area is quite on the evening and weekend and you will struggle to find superkets or pharmacies  hours a day  It is easy to get lost though so if you do go into this area ensure you have a map of the area 
P => Great find We stay a this hotel while visiting my nephew at NYU  This hotel is clean and efficient  They have all the basic needs for an overnight in New York  I like the water conservation idea with a dispenser to refill bottles  The hotel desk staff is very polite considering they work in a very small area  Johnny Chung sp checked us in on Saturday around pm major check in time  He was very busy and but remained very friendly with a big smile  As a Hotel Front Office Manager I can certainly understand the challenges involved  Nice job Nice hotel 
P => Great Value Not so Great Location I recently stayed here while attending a conference at the Javits Center Midtown West  Id never heard of this chain or this location but they accepted my Priceline bid  I was quite pleasantly surprised Cons Location  Beware of street closures on the weekends that can make getting here a bit tricky  Also the nearby  train line has service interruptions no uptown trains on the weekends  On the weekdays it is rather congested not a surprise given it is NYC and the Financial District which can make getting to a meeting etc  via cab Hotel staff will say it should take you   min to get locations in W Village and the far West side of Midtown  However count on  min due to street closures and train interruptionsOutlets in room great number of outlets on the desk but no place close to the bed without unplugging the lamp etc   if you want to plug your cell phoneblackberry in and place it on the nightstand  Pros Cabs   surprisingly easy to get either right outside the hotel or a couple blocks up on Broadway  Rooms   I stayed in the Diplomat Suite and it was VERY nice Nice sized room not your typical small NYC hotel room or bathroom  It was very clean and the bed was AMAZING It was so hard to get up in the mornings The bathroom was well lit and had a great ledge for putting your toiletriesmake up bags on  It also had a nice facial mirror  Amenities   free wifi complimentary business center do it yourself bottled water station on your floor Staff   front desk staff is limited in number but it doesnt matter  They are very helpful in showing you how to use the kiosks to check in and out  I requested more washcloths and housekeeping arrived win  min of my request  All in all I found this place to be an EXCELLENT value  I highly recommend it and would consider styaing here again 
P => Big bang for New York City buck Very clean modern room with queen bed two desks and chairs and a little kitchen area  Nice sized bathroom included a full bath  Couldnt ask for more Hotels in New York City are expensive but I have not seen anything this nice comparably priced  I worried a bit about the location at first because it seemed not to be central  But it turned out that all the subways leading to the centre east and west sides of the city converged in one stop Fulton a few minute walk from the Club Quarters  We did not eat in the hotel but found a great place for breakfast one block away turn right outside the main lobby door  We didnt spend much time looking for dinner places as the neighbourhood was definitely quiet on the weekend  We did have one very nice dinner in a historic pub nearby  Absolutely no complaints and would definitely stay again  
P => Small but lovely and in a great location We have stayed at this property before and liked it  The rooms are very compact but well appointed and extremely clean  You check yourself in and out which is a huge time saver  The amenities are nice   bottled water and all They have a deal with a near by garage that offers  parking   cant beat it Quiet location on the weekends  Very near to subways and a short walk to Century    the best store in NYC 
P => Great location good value and ent room Hotel was good value compared to other New York rates  Have stayed in NY four times and was surprised at the comparatively large room size  Only down side is the walls are quite thin so I would recommend keeping ear plugs on standby in case you have noisy neighbours although being a business hotel this only happened a couple of times  Area is quiet at night so no traffic noise but still within easy reach of nightlife  Best part   Wall Street Broadway Nassau and Broad Street subway stations only steps away  It is very easy to connect to anywhere in town from this spot and commuting from the airport is convenient as it is only a short walk to PATH at WTC if youre flying into Newark and isnt far from E train for JFK  Fantastic 
P => Very nice hotel We stayed at the Club Quarters Downtown in mid il  There are many nice extras that we enjoyed  There is a room off the lobby that has magazines newspapers a TV couches and chairs and a couple of computers with printers handy if you want to print out your boarding pass There was also a room with computer and printer on our floor a water dispenser complete with plastic bottles to take with you while you stroll the city and a guest services closet with extra pillows and blankets if you want them  We also noticed that the two desks in the room had  or  plugs each which Im sure would be appreciated by business travelers We were upgraded to a suite at no charge and were very happy with the room  The bathroom was fairly spacious and we had a view of a church out our window  The subway stop is right at the end of the block very convenientThe hotel is close to Battery Park South Street Seaport and the WTC site We had a delicious dinner one evening at the hotels Bull Run Restaurant  The place is hopping on a weeknight but fairly dead on weekends not surprising in the Financial District  However we didnt find the neighborhood dead on the weekend at all  There were LOTS of people walking around it never felt deserted or lonely One caveat we stayed at the hotel because we were visiting NYU and the NYU site directed us here  However the hotel is about a  minute subway ride to the school its not in the same neighborhood Loved the hotel would highly recommend it 
P => Not What I Expected Aside from its great location the hotel lacked any charm or class a far cry from a typical  star hotel as it was advertised  The room was small and cramped with just enough room to squeeze between the bed and your suit case  The closet was conveniently converted into a bathroom while an Ikea style wardrobe substituted for the closet  The bed was sub par and unless you enjoy the feeling of coil springs jutting into your back the floor would provide a more comfortable nights rest Need an extra blanket Dont call the front desk instead a quotGuest Request Closetquot located in the hallway is supposed to have just what you need but did not One feature I did find quite convenient is that you could request an exercise bike be delivered to your room as an alternate to the fitness center  However it would take a miracle of science and engineering to fit a stationary bike in the room I think the overall problem is that a  star hotel is advertised but a  star experience is what you get  
P => GREAT Great Great My dhter and I took our first trip of the year to New York The Club Quarters Rockefeller Center was AWESOME The room was small but great  If youre looking for big its not the place but it is walking distance to everything it sits in the middle of all the attractions  The staff was great they knew where everything was and were very friendly  I will stay there againThanks for everything 
P => Great Great Place  Very nice and clean  Modern business look  You get more than a little hotel room  Our room a standard flat screen TVs fridge great bed sink in room and in bathroom  Also there is a nice room to relax off of the lobby on the first floor with free internet and an attached bar  The location near Wall Street stop is great  We were there Sunday night  It was quiet safe and Monday morning was excitingly busy but not annoying  You are just down the block from Trinity Church and a  minute walk to the WTC site and St  Pauls  
P => Great digs on Wall Street We are fans of Club Quarters having stayed at their Midtown location about five times before  This time however Midtown was booked up so we stayed at their Downtown location right by Wall Street  My husband had stayed here a couple years ago and didnt like the location as much as Midtown because its further away from a lot of the sights of Manhattan and the area can be a bit dead at night  However the Wall Street area is now starting to be a bit more lively at night and there are a few restaurants open in the area  One of the unexpected benefits of the quiet neighborhood is that it really was quiet    Ive had trouble sleeping before in hotels in midtown because of the noise outside and that wasnt a problem down by Wall Street  I think the windows were relatively soundproof in this hotel as well  Anyway the deal with Club Quarters is the front desk isnt really full service    you check in by sticking your credit card in an ATM like machine in the lobby which spits out your room card  You check out the same way  Some people hate this and some people love it    just be aware  Still every time we came in or went out there were still at least two people at the front desk  As in the other Club Quarters the rooms were clean not a given in New York even at chain hotels and relatively spacious for New York  The price is competetive also  Finally this Club Quarters has a restaurant connected to the lobby which was convenient for breakfast  We found the breakfast yummy but be aware that it has quotWall Street pricesquot as the Zagat guide put it  
P => Great hotel subpar service ent location if you want midtown alternative I like this hotel  The subway  and  lines are on the same block just around the corner  Make sure you use the entrance outside on weekends The rooms are pretty spacious compared to the Hudson and Holiday Inn Express  We were able to leave  large suitcases opened on the floor during our stay Its a good location if you want to visit the statue of liberty or brooklyn bridge The service is somewhat subpar There is suppose to be complimentary water but we never saw any  We saw people from other floors coming to take the water from ours  There was also no soap when we arrived  
P => Very good for New York I would strongly recommend the Club Quarter New York  The price  value ratio is very good and since the location is in Manhattan the access to little Italy  Chinatown and the whole city is very good Rooms are Europe size but clean and employees are helpful  For the great price by New York standard we had we were very happy  
P => Another good CQ expierence  This one VERY quiet  Booking for Christmas in NYC is something that should be done months AND months in advance  Having stayed in the Rockefeller Center CQ this fall we were hoping to do the same at Christmas time  Being that Rockefeller center is just about the craziest place in the city that time of year just about everything was jam packed so we had to go ahead and book the downtown location  Location About one full block from the NYSE and sitting amongst the old buildings in the financial district  At night the place is a ghost town but having spent the days in midtown it was kind of nice to come back to peace and quiet  The hotel lobby was bigger  nicer than the Rockefeller center lobby and even had a lounge area as well  It doesnt have a ton of cabs flying by it at night but if you walk five minutes South to Battery Park area you will have no problem hailing one down  Check InOut Check in took all of five minutes via the front desk and check out even less via the kiosk  We checked in early with no fee as well  Room Modern and clean like most CQ flat panels in our room  living room area  Not a lot of places in NYC have reasonable suites to sleep four but this one did very comfortably  All the amenities in the room were very clean and updated although you could tell they needed a new paint on the walls and ceilings  The ACHeating was somewhat loud but the bedside thermostat made it easy for me to fire them up and use the noise to drown out a snoring family member  Complaints Wi fi internet access was basically not usable  I like that it is free and it could be the connection itself but the hotel should encrypt the connection and hand out the code at check in because it was slower than death  Im sure everyone in the surrounding area was leeching off the connection  Unlike the Rockefeller location there was no way to plug in to Ethernet either  The guest amenities closet unlock the Rockefeller center location was almost always empty  No spare towels shampoos coffees etc  It kind of defeats the purpose of do it yourself when you cant well   do it yourself  Overall I would stay here again if need be but only if the midtown locations were booked  I do still enjoy CQ and will seek them out for modernreasonably priced rooms  
P => We loved it Outstanding Gorgeous room free water in the corridors on each floor friendly reception staff  Not too much options for dining around Wall St but lets face it the subway is so close and handy why would you restrict your dining options to one location  We moved here for the last four nights off our visit after staying in midtown and we preferred it here  Bigger room for the price and we actually got a view and some daylight coming in to our room  I am writing this review to highly recommend this hotel to others  The hotel even provides a list of local takeaways that will deliver and there is a lovely jewish shop mins away for food  Do not visit the irish bar down the road 
P => Not bad I think the title of this review says it all   this place isnt bad but its not especially good either  I will try and expand as followsGood points Got it for  which is cheap for NYC Near to subway   amp lines  min walk amp lines about  mins walk  Walking distance to Staten Island ferry and generally easy enough to get a cab if you walk down to Water St nearby   Not as quiet at night as wed feared   which I realise is slightly contrary to the previous reviewer  There are some slightly contrived bars and restaurants at the South Street Seaport which is quite nearby   it also has a few ent shops including Abercrombie and Fitch and a museum etc  Worth a visit if at a loose end  We also had an amusing time one night when we stopped in at a bar on nearby John St which also has a good diner called Andrews on it and got accosted by some drunken wall st types  The area seemed safe and there are certainly quite a few security guards and cops around given the nature of the financial district location  The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable  There was free internet access  There was free bottled water  Its walking distance to Century  and Ground Zero if unlike us you view such a place as a tourist attraction Bad points Location   too far downtown hence a heavy reliance on subway or cabs   not so good late at night if cabs are hard to come by Customer service   reception staff werent great and certainly didnt exactly go out of their way to help you  This wouldve even been pretty apparent if this was a hotel in the UK but I was very surprised at this being the case in the USA anyone who has been to the UK will understand the customer service point Im making here  The place needs a good refurb   the last one was only half completed and some things like wallpaper in the corridors the signage etc  are still surviving from the s   The heatingair con unit in the bedroom looked and sounded like it was from the s   luckily this was okay if you left it on when you went out for dinner and could then switch it off to go to sleep but I wouldnt want to stay here in the summer when its boiling hot and you need the air con on all night  In fact theres no way Id stay here in the summerWould we go backPossibly in winter if we were stuck for somewhere else at a similar price but not in summer as you wouldnt get a wink of sleep with those air con units 
P => A nice modern room at a good buy   coulda done wout the Murder scene My wife and I booked a one night Saturday stay a little less than  weeks before our East Coast trip last y cant wait for another  It has very modern although small rooms complete at least on the third floor with VERY vaulted ceilings   amp a queen bed with a nice built in the wall headboard swing arm mounted quot LCD flatscreen easy WiFi access and nice furniture amenities  Everything is very strategically placed in order to fit into a tiny space but we packed  weeks worth of summertime luggage in there wout tripping on it so it works  The small modernized bathroom had a shower only which was missing the vinyl curtain so the clothe one gets soaked amp sticks to your legs while youre showering Its quite hard to get a room wa ent view but on the weekends this is a quiet area of town dead on Wall St  EXCEPT for the ice machine in constant use ALL night across the hall our door had a full quot gap between it and the floor and mustve been semi hollow  Do yourself a favor and make sure to get a room on a floor wout one Oh that amp the random large caliber gun shot fired in an attempted murder that occurred around AM right outside our window on the street  from our car That was followed by loud shouting all of which woke us up of course amp left a blood trail over  long all over the sidewalk amp on the back of the Wall St Trump building amp Pharmacy  It was really messed up but what was just as sad as the sight was the complete amp total lack of policing of the scene  The entire next day there was no tape off nothing done despite talking with a cop in person and having myself my wife amp two hotel staff report it to  at noon  That was really disappointing to see such a complete lack of care taken by the NYPD  Inside Job I still wonder   Recommendation If youre there on a weekend stay at the one in MidtownTimes Square instead  Much better access to a majority of what makes NY well NY and probably less gun fire  
P => Clean efficient next to subway My husband and I booked a room at Club Quarters at the last minute for night as we were visiting family who live on Wall Street  Its literally less than a minutes walk from the    Wall Street subway stop which conveniently goes direct to the Port Authority Bus Station and a five minute walk from the Wall Street and Broadway subway station  Theres a pharmacy across the road and several kets within easy walking distance The check in staff were friendly and efficient  Somehow the booking had been messed up we booked using booking com but this was quickly taken care of  We didnt try the hotel bar but it looks quite nice Id say it was definitely value for money considering Ive stayed in much less impressive places in NYC for more  While this hotel isnt anything special in terms of the little extras    the rooms are fairly utilitarian clearly designed for business travellers    its perfect if youre just looking for a base and a place to sleep  Our room was somewhat bizarre in that the ceilings were about  feet high but it was clean and the bed was very comfy  There was a microwave in the room as well as an empty fridge rather than a fridge stocked up on overpriced liquor  Free wireless was nice as was the flat screen TV and the spare plug sockets available on the desk instead of being tucked away behind something as is usually the case were well thought out  We will definitely stay here again  
P => Clean quite convenient and the subway station is nearby This is hotel is in a great location if you want to be in the Wall Street area  The hotel is generally quiet and theres big drug store just across the street but I dont think it is hr though  The hotel lobby isnt big and grand but the front desk service is fairly quick and professional  Nothing chirpy like you get in southern states but efficiency and politeness is good enough for me  Theres a lounge just beyond the front desk  It has a TV and couple of Internet PCs that guests can use for free  The rooms have wireless signal so your laptops or phones with WiFi can access the Net too  I wish the rooms have a small electronic safe though  Theres no bottled water in the room you have to go down the hall to a water dispenser to get your own  I like the cordless phone provided in the room though cos it offsets not having a phone in the bathroom  There was no room slippers provided and I sort of missed that  There was nothing in the little fridge under the TV  If you want snacks and drinks stocked you have to order them in the morning and theyll be in by evening  Might as well buy your own  Housekeeping did a great job daily cleaning up and straightening up my mess  All in nothing fancy but clean quite convenient and the subway station is nearby  
P => Great Quiet Stay in NYC We looked for a sat night hotel at the last minute and found this one on Orbitz for about  incl  taxes  I was a bit worried but read the other reviews here and ided to go for it  We were pleasantly suprised  Great clean and stylish room and quiet Since it is in the financial district and nothing much happens down there on weekends so if you are looking for a lot of nightlight youll have jump on the metro which is literally  block away Wall Street  Our only complaint was that a few of the blinds were bent  Would stay there again in a minute  
P => Watch out for Extra Person Charge We stayed here for two nights this weekend using the NYU preferential rate for families of NYU students  The quoted price of night before taxes was good for a New York hotel and the room although by no means luxurious was absolutely satisfactory and included free internet  I requested a room with two beds since I was going with my teenage son  We were given a room with two twins    apparently there are no rooms with two queens  Again not luxurious but very satisfactory  We did the express checkout thing where you run your credit card through and the printer spits out your bill  I did a quick run through before we left the hotel and noticed that we had been charged a night extra person charge  I took the bill over to the front desk and asked what this was for  The guy said that it was because there had been an extra person in my room ie  two people instead of one  To me two people in one room is not a crowd and should not justify a surcharge  I told him I had been quoted  and that no one had mentioned a surcharge as he claimed they had  This must happen a lot because he immediately took my bill and credited me the  two nights worth of surcharge  The experience left a bad taste in my mouth because it felt like theyd just tried to see if they could get away with tacking on an extra charge    if I didnt notice great and if I did notice theyd just remove it  Other than that Club Quarters seemed great    a good price for a ent room in New York City  
P => Excellent Good Value Hotel I agree with previous reviews you shouldnt pay  for this hotel  Im from the Uk and I paid less than  Considering it location price facilities it is an excellent hotel  For me it was a crash pad fairly central Im my view if you came to see all the sites in New York your going to likely take the subway anyway  So taking the subway to the centre is not that much Close to Wall St the hotel is definately not luxury but its a good clean hotel and our room had good facilities  We found the front staff very helpful and stored our luggage safely due to a late flight Would endorse 
P => Best hotel of the  weve stayed at in NYC First of all check different dates before booking I keep reading how people spent  and     we spent  Hotel was great comfortable room was small but not cramped and it was VERY quiet No problem with check incheck out    Location is awesome    we walked to chinatown for dinner and in the morning had a stroll over the Brooklyn Bridge and coffee at the South Street Seaport  Only complaint is due to the fact that it is in the wall streetfinancial district a lot is closed on Saturday nights  The hotel barrestaurant closed VERY early so we couldnt have a nitecap before bed  
P => Clean and Quiet Downtown I was very happy with this hotel  The location is great close to the stock exchange Battery Park and easy subway access  The hotel was clean well maintained and of all things quiet rare for NYC  I felt the rate was quite good for the level of hotel quality and service if you can call the rate for any hotel in New York good  One of the best things was they have these bottled water dispensers in the hall were you can fill a provided water bottle with ice cold water  Kind of silly I know but I had just spent a week camping in the humidity of New York it was a perfect touch Nice lounge downstairs with a large TV and two computers for guest use I will return  
P => Not worth  a night We were given a different room than ordered  We confirmed and ordered a room with two beds yet we were provided with  queen bed  After complaining with the manager and given the run around for  mins  we received a different room with  twin beds  The room was very small  by feet  beds were soft and the room service was slow  The only positive thing was that the room was clean and most attractions were within walking distance or the subway  I would stay here again if the room was only  a night  
P => Great Hotel My two best friends and I booked Club Quarters downtown through expedia for an awesome price We arrived early to the hotel and were able to check in at  in the morning  The hotel was out of bottels for the filtered water so they gave us Fiji water to use  Not bad at all The  and  train were probably  feet away from the hotel  This was really nice late at night when you dont want to wonder around getting lost If you are looking for another train just ask the front desk and they are great at giving good directions Stayed at the hotel for nights with NO problems On the last day our flight did not leave until the evening but check out was at  in the morning  The hotel will hold your bags for you without charge until you come back  WILL STAY HERE AGAIN 
P => Great location very clean hotel I stayed here for  nights in e  This location is fantastic its just off Wall Street and great for shopping and sightseeing  Its easy to get the subway up to midtown for more sights  This is one of the cleanest and most comfortable hotels Ive stayed in on a budget  Everything looks great the room had a flat screen TV and you can help yourself to anything you need from the closets they have on every floor  It gets very very quiet in the evenings and on weekends   we got back at pm and could not find a restaurant anywhere that was open  Had to go to a deli a few blocks away  
P => Basic clean and inexpensive but     I stayed here for one night this past weekend  As others have said it is very clean and the rooms though tiny are well appointed  I was also impressed with the front desk staff  efficient and pleasant The problem was that the hotel was completely sold out for the weekend and I dont think they are up to handling that kind of crowd  The poor bellman was running himself ragged the front desk phone was ringing constantly and they were running out of things like pillows yes pillows and water bottles  Many of this weekends guests were parents moving their kids into the NYU dorms  So lots of families sharing rooms  Hence the pillow shortage Another issue  the bar closed at  p m  on Saturday night  After having dinner in the Village we ided to go back to the hotel for a couple of drinks  Boy were we disappointedMy final complaint was the AC unit in my room  As I said my room was tiny  double bed only  no queen  But the AC unit was incredibly loud  I am not a light sleeper and I wake up all night because every time Id doze off the AC would come on and wake me up  Hmmm    be if I had been able to have those drinks I would have slept more soundly   To sum it up  good and inexpensive hotel  I would try it again on a less busy weekend perhaps in the fall when the AC wouldnt be necessary But kudos to the staff for continuing to be pleasant despite the obvious challenges they were experiencing  
P => super clean very nice ppl very quiet I looked everywhere for a hotel and they were the best deal  Bottled water was awesome  Rooms were very nice for NYC  Everything was super clean  Semi nice view  Two subway stops near by  Quiet at night bc of financial disctrict  Very safe area  The people were nice and helpful  The bathrooms were also very clean  While I was there I tried to look for downfalls and I found zero  
P => CQ Downtown is very nice I stayed at this hotel on ust   for business  I loved it  It was very quiet the room size was great  There was plenty of room for a rollout if I had had a guest with me  Was the room huge No but no rooms in NYC are and Ive stayed in smaller rooms  But these are not rooms that are going to hold two Queen beds either  They have great lighting choices  chairs a great desk chair and a quotdiningquot chair There were some paintchips around the bathroom door on the floor but that was the only negative  I never felt that it was unclean in any way and there was no odor of any kind  I didnt hear anyone or anything while I was there   be it was because I had the AC on  The employees were very nice  The lounge was a nice place to wait for friends with coffeetea in the morning  To go up the elevator you had to use your room key which was a comfort in regards to security The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and I loved the pillows  The air conditioning worked great too  There was no tub just a shower I also loved staying in the Financial District  Ive only visited there before  I would not recommend it for st or nd time tourists who want to stay in Midtown but if you get the hang of using the subway all the lines are very close   just plan your trip and use hopstop com to help you out  There is a great quottutorialquot on Tripadvisor for using the subway  The first time I used the subway I also asked and asked if I was in the right area is this the right subway etc  It just reaffirms everything the tutorial describes  
P => Again one of the best value in Manhattan Second stay at this hotel this time we brought some friends along so we booked a suite through Expedia at a terrific rate especially for Manhattan  a night  As requested the room had a queen size bed an a pull out sofabed  It was large enough for a party of  and was clean as usual  We had a drain problem on the first day but it was fixed right away  Overall we believe that this hotel is under priced for the quality and especially for NYC a place where hotels tend to be expensive   It is located just around the corner from Wall street and the subway station is a good  seconds walk from the doorstep  Needless to say that the neibourghood is very safe and quiet on week end also because not many people live there The Club Quarters downtown caters mostly to businessmens and traders during normal office hours so it gets quiet during the week ends and prices are following the same trend  Its a great place to stay in NYC but be advised that you will have to jump in the subway to get to where it happens  By the way the place is a good  seconds from red line   and    minutes from green line   and    minutes from yellow line R and W  minutes from red line   and    minutes from blue line A and C and  minute from brown line J M and Z  These lines will get you anywhere in Manhattan fast at any time  Typical travel time from hotel to Soho Greenwich Chinatown Little italy and Time square is  minutes  I recommend getting a subway metrocard if you are there for a few days its good value for money at  for  days instead of paying  for every trip you make Staff at the property is polite and efficient but this is not a  stars hotel so you wont find a doorman with white gloves at the door  If you wich to find a doorman at the door wearing such gloves check yourself in at a fancy address midtown and expect to pay  times what you would at the Club Quarters  Otherwise book with confidence at this place and increase your shopping budgetBy the way parking in now hrs  There is no valet you just pull out in the front unload check in and then go leave the vehicule at the parking facilities   minutes walk from the parking to the hotel  Parking is safe and well looked after by the people who run it  They will park the vehicule for you  Dont forget to have your parking ticket stamped when you check out otherwise you wont get the Club Quarters special rate P S for those interested to know we took the subway to Harlem th St on a sunday afternoon and have to say that the place is not really attractive but by all means not dangerous at all  We walked around th St and Lenox safely without being harrassed by anyone  No beggars no homeless no gangsters  
P => Fantastic We spent the Fourth of y Holiday weekend at the Downtown location near Wall street  I read all of the reviews before I booked the hotel on line and I was cautiously optimistic about all of the  and  star reviews the hotel had received  But those who had stayed there before us were right on target  The rooms were clean and comfortable  Staff was helpful and polite  Just two minor issues First the rooms are not supplied with fresh linen and towels on a daily basis  They are supplied every nd day in order to save costs and be quotenvironmentally awarequot unnecessary water usage detergents etc and Second as you are just down the street from Trinity Church the Church bells ring on the hour during daylight hours  kind of tough if you are a light sleeper  especially early on a Sunday morning  An added plus was the hotels proximity to the  and  subway lines which are all within a  to  minute walk from the front door  Additionally there is a drug store right a cross the street should you need something in a pinch  I would DEFINATELY stay at this particular location again  John  Detroit MI 
P => How to stay in Manhattan for low cost My wife and I stayed at this hotel after booking it through hotwire as it is a members only hotel   must have a membership or use one of the discount sites  Got it for  per night inclusive of all taxes I was a bit skeptical but the room was very clean and very modern  It is not a hilton with a lot of frills but still very comfortable  Each room had its own electronic thermostat they have chilled water and bottles available to take with you on your trip into town  Flat screen tv  If you drive they have a deal with a local parking garage where it is a little quotcheaperquot though still expensive to park in the City A little tough to find on your first go around but location is fine Walking distance to southstreet seaport  Cabs are tougher to come by on weekends but walk a couple of blocks and they are all over the place  Subway stop is nearby and an easy train ride to times square one train  So though it is out of the quothappening areasquot a  subway ride or  cab ride is better than  more a night in my opinion  If you want walking distance to late night activity this is not the place for you though since on weekends many of the restaurants are closed down though there are still some choices nearby Rooms are small but that is how NYC is with hotels though this was not uncomfortably small at all I would highly recommend this for someone who was looking to stay in Manhattan without staying at a hostel or scary hotel and one who didnt want to pay  per night  
P => Pleasant but away from the action My husband and I were in NYC attending a family wedding and this was the first time we had stayed at a Club Quarters  We were very pleasantly surprised  We got an unexpected upgrade to the Executive Suite and the room was very nice  The or was definitely masculine which my husband quite liked as a change from the usual floral or we find in hotels  The dark wood granite counters and plasma TVs two of them were quite the hit  The sleeping area of the room was rather compact with a well designed bed with small built in night tables cordless and wired phones and a clock radio that had a jack to play any MP player through The bathroom was also very compact but extremely clean and well equipped  The water pressure was very good  In fact the entire room was extremely clean  I am usually slightly grossed out by hotel rooms but this one was so clean I felt very comfortable  The sheets felt and smelled very clean and were soft with a high thread count  I also enjoyed using the comfy terry bathrobe that was in the room  Alas there was only one to be shared Being the Exectuive Suite there was a rather spacious seating area  The wall dividing the two areas was at the foot of the bed  On the sleeping area side it contained the closet and TV on the seating area side of the wall a desk was mounted The desk was equipped with several tour books as well a couple of business books and a dictionary  There were two comfortable side chairs a sleep sofa and another table and chairs  There was also a small again well designed kitchenette  There was a microwave a cabinet with plates dishes and flatware a small counter with a coffee maker and a fridge  For the sink one had to use the bathroom  In the hallway was an unlocked closet for extra pillows and blankets if needed  There was also a station with empty water bottles and a water dispenser  On the third floor were a couple of vending machines and the selection included mostly chips and candy bars but some breakfast bars as well  A book listed menus from several area restaurants that delivered to the hotel  The hotel restuarant was good on the pricey side but this is NYC of course so not unexpected I didnt come prepared to use the gym but I did check it out and it looked very well equipped with ellipticals treadmills weight machines all the typical equipment one needs  It is also possible to have a portable bike or stepper delivered to ones room We would definitely stay at a Club Quarters again but would perhaps seek a different location  For weekend travelers the Financial District has mostly closed restaurants nearby  Also cabbies seemed to have a lot of trouble finding the hotel  
P => Excellent Hotel for the price clean and great location Great big clean modern comfy rooms  Friendly staff good price and great locationWe chose the hotel mainly because of  reasons first was the hotel rating on the Tripadvisor far better rating than Holdiay Inn and other hotels in NYC and second because it was on the approved list of hotels in my company  Although the website is nothing to be proud of we trusted the reviews and could not agree more We booked  double superior rooms got  superior and one normal size but was acctually a Penthouse  All rooms were very large even the smallest one absolutely clean very comfy beds and pilows nice LCD TVs  The kitchenettes are great the self make coffee machines too the superior rooms even had large sitting areas with sofa and additional LCD  The price was very reasonable   USD per night  The view from the room is not spectacular but you cant expect that since you are surrounded by tall financial buildings  The staff is friendly and on our check out day we even had a guy at the reception who spoke our language Slovenian The restaurant in the hotel is not the best neither for breakfast nor for dinner but if you need a breakfast you have plenty of coffee shops arround the block with real Italian esspresso  Location is definitely great for eveyone who likes to stay downtown  The subway is on the corner of the hotel wall street is a few steps away wtc area is a few blocks off  The area is very quiet over the weekend when the financial district is empty over the week it gets crowded but not noisy at allHigly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a fair priced hotel downtown 
P => Great Hotel Though a Little Expensive My girlfriend and I booked this hotel from Expedia for the night for   it was somewhat last minute so I didnt mind paying a little extra to stay somewhere nice Literally  seconds walk from the Stock Exchange the reception might seem a little unprepossessing due to the small area but the staff were friendly and helpful We had paid for a standard room but then as we searched for our room found it was in fact the executive suite Therefore it makes it very difficult to rate the quality of a standard room as this was a large corner room with great views nice bathroom supremely comfortable bed and large seating area   both with large HD tvs The location is obviously a little distant from Midtown but the Subway is only a minutes walk at most  All in all if you can get a deal its worth coming  
P => Excellent experience This hotel was amazing  The room was impeccably clean and the bed was super comfy with nice expensive sheets and fluffy pillows  I happen to be a germ a phobe and not once did I feel like cleaning a thing the housekeeping is terrific The staff is super nice with utmost professionalism  This has got to be the best hotel stay in NYC we ever had  They have flat screen t vs and since its mainly a business hotel it was super quiet on our weekend stay  Bravo Club quarters 
P => Perfect location friendly staff clean rooms I stayed in this hotel with my father who came to visit me from Sweden  I was a bit hesitant to book a hotel so far away from Times Square and Midtown especially when the reviews I read said everything around is closed on the weekend  However we had a great stay  The rooms are a bit small especially the bathroom but it is after all NYC  The room was very clean and nicely orated  The subway is right around the corner and it was very easy to get to so many different locations all over Manhattan  We could also walk down to Battery Park and take the first ferry to Statue of Liberty in the morning recomended since the lines get very long and book your tickets in advance online  South Street Waterfront is also walking distance and has a variety of restaurants shops great views and entertainment all open all days of the week  We also walked up Broadway to the World Trade Center site and to Century  for some great shopping  There are also a few delis in the area and some are open early and on the weekend  This was a perfect stay and I would recomend it to anyone  
P => Great hotel  My wife and I are from London and just got back from  nights at Club Quarters Downtown and we were really happy with the room service and location The location some might say is a bit out of the way as most people stay midtown near Times Square but for me being not  yards from the NYSE and the spot where George Washington look for his statue on Wall Street and read the plaque underneath it was inerated as the first President of the USA was great  Yes at the weekend it was quiet but in a nice way still lots of tourists and people milling around but on the weekdays it was buzzing with real New Yorkers buying hotdogs and going to work  Getting uptown was  minutes on the  subway from outside the hotel door The room was very nicely orated in a modern style and clean not the biggest for Americans but fine for Europeans the shower room was definately small  but with a double size shower and plenty of hotwater so no problem there  I requested before I left a microwave in my room which was there and all rooms have a an empty fridge which you can stock yourself from the superket right across the road open  days Breakfast in the hotel was  plus tax for continental but we ventured outside and had breakfast in the many cafes all serving loads of hot and cold food especially on Broadway  Try the Variety Cafe just head towards the church at the top of Wall Street you wont miss it and turn left on Broadway the Cafe is up on your right was under some scaffolding so look out for it  Free wireless internet is available in your room so take your laptop  Plus  pcs with printers in the lounge next to reception Staff were fine didnt have much interaction with them  but anything I asked was greeted with a smile and a positive response  Free water bottles and drinking water available on each floor so you could stock up for the day plus each floor had a guest cupboard with stocks of extra stuff like pillows and blankets plus irons and ironing boards just help yourself but return the iron so others can use after you Definately recomend this hotel not sure how much we paid for the hotel as it was a flight and hotel package from Expedia costing   each for four nights flying London to JFK  
P => Very good hotel would go there again Stayed at Club Quarters last year with my mother we really liked it  We booked through Expedia and got a nice room with a queen size bed and flat screen tv  The bed was very comfortable with new linens  The bathroom was large and looked very good  Overall the room was very clean and nicely furnished in a contemporary style for NY standards it was quite spacious We were in an upper floor and didnt hear any noise from our window which faced the street  We got a good rate because the hotel caters to finance professionals during the week so they have vacancies during weekends  The location is great incredibly close to the subway also Battery Park is very close for a nice walk  On the downside there arent too many dining options in the area but we went out for dinner close by a few times and found perfectly good places and the staff at the front desk had a hard time transferring incoming calls  If youre not very fond of the midtown area this is a recommendable area where you can stay on a budget  Overall I thought this hotel was GREAT value for money and would definitely go there again  
P => Solid  star hotel in very convenient location The Club Quarters Hotel Downtown is pretty much what you would expect from this genre of hotel  It would be too far a stretch of the imagination to call it luxurious but on the other hand it isnt down ket either  My room was exactly as the candid pictures indicate though contrary to some of the reviews on this site it was actually fairly spacious  It had all the facilities you would need for the average business trip minus only a room safe and its main selling point   the location   just cannot be beaten  The commute to nearby Water Street was a matter of minutes rather than the standard half hour plus from Midtown on a crowded subway train  On holiday its perhaps not the best place to stay  The hotel and its surrounding area are much quieter at the weekend though never unsafe and although there are restaurants and local stores in the area the best places to eatvisit are definitely further uptown  Having said that subway lines amp stop on Wall St literally  seconds from the hotel and if these are closed as there were over the weekend of my stay then all other lines are within walking distance including the NampR which take you directly to Times Square  In terms of the actual room the furnishings were fairly modern and reliable although my shower did make a very loud groaning sound when on full heat not the nicest wake up call for my neighbours and some mornings it took ten minutes or so to warm up  The air conditioning did not heat the room terribly well either and even though I was ten stories up I could still occasionally hear the subway below  But the bed was comfortable room service was quick with the food and after eight nights having the option to order from five nearby eateries was a blessingOverall if on business then I would recommend this hotel  Its problems are fairly minor and if convenience is what youre looking for then it doesnt get much better  For a holiday try somewhere trendier and better placed in Midtown  
P => LOVE IT This hotel is perfect for couples looking for a weekend getaway or anyone travelling for business The hotel is used for businesses during the week and is open to the public on weekends  We got our room for  a night and let me tell you it was worth a lot moreThe room was contemporary and designed well  There was a flat screen tv loved it that looked to be about inches  The bathroom was immaculate There wasnt a tub instead a shower stall which was perfect for New York because you dont really need to take a bath while youre in the city  We also stayed on the top floor so our ceilings were about  feet high It made the room feel huge I cant say whether the other floors had ceilings that high  They did a great job designing the rooms and made the best of the space they had  You need a room key to use the elevator which  seem annoying but it was actually comforting and I felt safe knowing that you had to be a guest to get around  One of the best features is that each floor has a closet on it with extra blankets pillows irons ironing boards coffee etc  Its perfect because you dont have to annoy housekeeping and wait forever instead you can just get it yourself  Another great feature is that the hotel will deliver food to you from any restaurants near the hotel  We didnt take advantage of this because we were out in the city most of the time  The location of the hotel is perfect for anyone who likes to get away from the tourist areas of NYC  We usually go every year so its nice to stay in downtown  The subway is right around the corner both the red line and green line  The hotel parking offers a discount at a garage two short blocks away for  a day which is great for Manhattan If youre interested in seeing a broadway show there is a ticket discount booth a few blocks away      The ticket booth is actually on the backside of the building to make note  This ticket booth is A LOT less crowded  My boyfriend and I walked up and waited behind only one person  We got   off Chicago tickets for the next day and we were in row G in the orchestraOverall this was a wonderful hotel with a wonderful location and a wonderful staff 
P => Very clean comfortable rooms Booked this through Priceline and we had a great room  Located right near the World Trade Center Site and Statue of LibertyEllis Island ferry and right in the heart of the Wall Street area  Rooms were very clean and up to date  We even had a flat screen television in the room  They only book through Priceline and Hotwire unless you are a quotmemberquot so I guess we got lucky 
P => Great location great servcie and great value On my last trip to NYC I stayed at the W Times Square  To be perfectly honest this Club Quarters compares favorably and its a MUCH better value The rate was  for a single with a queen size bed the W was something like   The hotel is on a quiet side street near the Stock Exchange  The room was small be  sq feet   but my room at the W was the same size   this is Manhattan folks  Still I had an outside window the furniture was new amp high quality the bed was comfortable and the bathroom well appointed with high quality fixtures and a granite countertop  The hotel is around the corner from the  local and the  amp  express trains uptown  The bar is nice and the hotel rate for a garage around the corner on Liberty Street in  for  hours just get your parking ticket stamped when you check inThe clients are mostly Wall Street types and thankfully I saw none of the Euro Trash that I encountered at the W This is now my favorite hotel the Wall Street area 
P => Nice surprise We went for a long weekend to NYC to see a couple of plays and meet some friends  The hotel is wonderfully located in dowtown surrounded by different subway stations being the  and  the closest  The room for two has been recently reated Ikea style  Despite being small it was comfortable  The best deal was to get the reservation for less that  via Expedia  Well definitely go back 
P => As McArther Said I will Return Price cleanliness room size modern conveniences proximity to the subway and a good shower are all priorities with me  This Club Quarters has everything especially an excellent price for Manhattan  This is the th hotel Ive tried and while I prefer the West Village for interesting walking around there are no reasonably priced hotels in that area  This is the hotel NYU recommended and I am happy they did  I will return  
P => Superior front desk nicely appointed room Stayed here   for  per night via Hotwire  Very nice room   clean and nicely orated  We got a room with  twin beds  They were extremely comfortable with warm cozy comforters  I should know I got a  hour flu during my stay and spent a whole day in NYC in my hotel room bed   Great front desk service   extremely helpful and friendly  Am going back to NYC in il and will probably stay there again  
P => Hard to find Tiny Tiny rooms  Friendly staff and excellent bar  Parking  We stayed at the Club Quarters in the Financial District for one night last week  This hotel is hard to find if you are driving Parking is two blocks past the hotel in a private underground lot day no in out   day if you have an SUV  small or large  Be sure to let the parking people know that you are to get the hotel discount or else they will try to jack the price to   The hotel is very clean and secure elevator access to guest floors require swipe of room key in elevator but rooms are super super tiny The bathroom also super small I could not share the mirror wmy hubby could use a little scrubbing around the tub tilescaulking but all in all pretty clean  Flat screen tv that got all the local and cable stations that you  want to see  Comfortable bed Large excercise room and good selection of reasonably priced snacks in the vending machines  We enjoyed the hotels bar   reasonable prices very friendly bartenders who offered tips on good shopping near the Financial District  Short walk to the World Trade Center site and a short subway ride to Canal Street  After checking out the staff graciously held our luggage for a few hours while we completed our walking tour of the area  Booked through Orbitz for night  We would stay again if we could get the same rate or lower rate  
P => Great Hotel AND Reasonably Priced We have just returned from a Saturday and Sunday night stay at the Club Quarters located on the corner of Wall Street amp Williams Street  The hotel quality exceeded my expectations for the rate we received in the middle of ember in New York  Typically hotel rates during the holiday season are outrageously expensive  Im a pretty easy going person I call myself adventurous but particular and a little bit of a Princess when it comes to where I plan to sleep and shower  The location is a key selling point  Right near NYSE and walking distance to Ground Zero  Though we were in the midst of the city the hotel is tucked away on a one way street and therefore contributed to a peaceful and tranquil stay  It is conveniently located near the subway a drug store and a Starbucks These amenties particularly the drug store are a plus in consideration of all the airline carry on restrictions these days We stayed on the th floor not far from the elevator  We did not take advantage of the on site restaurant only because we are in walking distance to other food places  Though the room is small in comparison to Atlanta Southern living the room and bathroom appeared very clean and neat  The room was orated with a modern style including wood paneling as the headboard around the desk and a sleek alarm clock and flat screen TV  Everything was operable  The heat worked well and the hot water lasted as long as I wanted to shower thank goodness  The complimentary coffee wasnt bad either  Guests can access extra pillows blankets an iron and ironing board just a few steps outside your room in a hall closet stocked with these items My interactions with the front desk were pleasant  One couple as we checked in loudly argued over the rate they were promised online and the rate they were about to be charged but we didnt have that problem  In the end it sounded as if the hotel gave the people the lower rate  The team was professional and helpful  They were very knowledgeable and gave us subway directions to various destinations within the city  No wireless access in the rooms but the lobby was equipped with  PCs with printers That was a nice touch  I still had to wait about  to  minutes to get on waiting for others to get off but it was convenient and as I mentioned I really appreciated the printers  For the price and amenties I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in during a holiday weekend in New York  I would definitely want to stay here again during future visits to the city   
P => Was Pleasantly Surprised I stayed at this hotel with three of my girlfriends  They could only offer us two twin beds or one queen bed and a cot for the extra fee of  a night which we were not too happy about I will never again book anything through priceline we were charged additional fees because pricline only accounts for double occupancy when we arrived the staff was very nice  The room was tiny but spotless  Flat screen t v  and private bathroom cofee pot blow dryer  Four girls with all our luggage was a bit of a hassle in such a small room no real closet but we worked it out  The location was great very quiet during the weekend but during the week a lot of hustle and bustle being in the financial district and all  There were two subways near by although the closest one only runs often during the week  Times square was a short subway ride away as were all the other main attractions  Wall Street and The World Trade Center were within a  min  walk  I was extremely happy with the hotel and would consider staying there again 
P => Good place to stay in NYC I stayed here with my dhter and husband for a long weekend in NYC  We booked through Priceline and I think we got a good deal considering the prices in NYC  The room was clean and seemed newly reveated  I was expecting a tiny room since everyone I talked to said the hotel rooms is NYC are small but this was bigger than expected  We had a queen bed and got a rollaway for my  year old dhter  The hotel was close to the subway our main mode of transportation  I also felt like we were in a safe part of town  We werent coming back to the hotel too late be  at night  We didnt spend too much time at the hotel  Everyday we slept got ready and went out  We never came back to later that night  The only thing is that this area of town is pretty quiet on the weekends  If your looking for stuff to do into the wee hours of the morning this isnt the place to be  However if your looking for quiet while you sleep this area is perfect  
P => I love this place I have stayed at Club Quarters multiple times and will continue to stay here when I can  I have stayed in many hotels in the NYC area and I have to admit that for the price this place cant be beat  
P => Nice place convenient and clean After reading several reviews I was hesitant to stay at the Club Quarters but the choice of relatively affordable places to stay over the holiday weekend were limited The room was very nice with a queen size bed and what looked to be a pretty new remodeled room  The room was clean the staff was courteous and friendly  The  and  lines are located one block south just be sure to check the schedules before you go especially on the weekends  There is a fitness center vending machines and ice machines on the rd floor and there are plenty of places nearby that will deliver should you require room service All in all a great place to stay 
P => Pricey but worth it i guess This is the place located at the intersection of william st and wall st  I rented a room for  day around the y th weekend  It was pricey compared to other hotels but the rooms were very clean and nice  I would stay here again but i would look for cheaper options if available  The best thing about this place is the location  Its only  mins subway away from times square and barely  mins walking from the WTC site  
P => Quite pleasant experience My husband stayed in this hotel for  days while I just joined him for a long weekend  Overall we liked the hotel and the room  We stayed in an efficiency room w a kitchenette  It also had great bedding Queen sz bed small table  chairs a desk and another stuffed chair  The room was a nice size not huge but worked just fine for the  of us and a lot of clothing amp luggage The bathroom had a tubshower combo contrary to a webpage I had found about ammenities and rooms   The location is good   near subway stations amazingly close to Wall Street and a great short walk to South Street Seaport  The staff on the other hand was professional but not the most outgoing or helpful  They would give you directions amp basic info but as far recommmending restaurants sites to see and such they had a ways to go  I do give one desk person the credit for friendliness because he gave me several band aids for my blisters on my feet  We would consider staying there again or possibly one of their locations closer to Times Square  
P => Wouldnt go back We stayed here last year I guess before it was open to the public but my company had an account  My husband and I hated it  We stayed at the penthouse and as an another reviewer stated the room wasnt special and actually seemed sub par  Our blinds were broken and the room was overall very shabby  But the real problem was the location  I used to live in NY and thought ok this trip lets give downtown a try  Never again  Its a ghost town on the weekends and really the only time I feel unsafe in NYC is when Im alone on a street which was pretty much a constant around the hotel  It seemed like a  minute walk just to get up to Chinatown  
P => A Solid Choice for Weekend visitors Club Quarters opens its rooms up to non members on weekends  I never stayed before but I will if I can now  My subway   or   from Penn Station let me off across the street  I was checked in quickly effieciently and with a smile even though they were dealing with mobs of pouting Euro types Ive stayed in literally dozens of hotels in NYC over the years and I think my room was fairly spacious it was well appointed internet accesss was fast HDTV on the wall VERY comfortable bed and I LOVE the fact that hallway closets store irons blankets and as many coffee packets as you can drink which is a k of genius I hate being left with af The room and bathrooms were a tiny bit banged up but were spotless  Check out was just as easy with an effiicient clerk illustrating the automated check out Its Wall Street so its not in the tourist areas and is quiet on the weekends except for pouting Euro types  As it is right off Wall Street there was plenty of street lighting and more police than pedestrians at a late hour For  with tax I dont believe I could have done better on Memorial Day weekend with short notice  
P => it was great I had a great time here  VERY CLean and neat and safe  I really enjoyed staying there better than the Ramada New York that I stayed at last time  Loved the fridge and microwave in the room  Very quiet Big room for NY  I will stay here again 
P => LUV C Q  on William Avenue Club Quarters surprised me  I loved the newly remodeled rooms very clean and even though reation construction was going on it was very quiet and peaceful  The staff was polite and helpful  The location is awesome I am glad I chose this hotel and passed Grandmas offer up to stay with her in her roomy brownstone  Please book now before they realize that they could be charging more  
P => Comfortable Nice hotel Club quarters takes overflow from places like the Yale Club Princeton Club etc  and we were booked there by our local club in Hartford when the other associated clubs were full  It was very nice clean comfortable and spacious room with small sink and cabinet and coffee set up two nice wardrobes table several chairs tv and internet connections neither used by us shower instead of bath  There was a small lounge with TV a bar and restaurant which served an ample buffet breakfast for  each  The crowd looked like college or alumni nice looking people  Very convenient to the  and  subways so you can hop on and get uptown easily  We would go again  
P => Good Deal   Safe Location We just returned from a fabulous trip to NYC  The price of this hotel was unbeatable at  per night  Stayed  through   The staff was very helpful  The rooms were clean  When you first walk in to the room   be prepared   they are small  The beds seem to be full size  The bathroom is tiny but functional  There is a desk in the room  TV set and refrig  You might want to bring your own hairdryer  Theirs is a  Volt and got hot often and I had to turn it off and on to keep it working  Quiet room  Very safe location  I loved the ambience of Wall Street although on Sat and Sun   it was very quiet  Not many restaurants or bars in this area cause of    people moved out  We learned the subway system quickly and it was close  Just ask the staff which one to take and they will tell you   very helpful and accurate  It was refreshing to come to this area of town everyday after being in midtown with total chaos and lots or people  Actually really cool in a way  Cops are everywhere   so you feel very very safe in this neighborhood  For what we saved in room rates we were able to go see a Broadway play Wicked Yankees game and took a bus tour with New York Party Shuttle  I would stay here again and would recommend it to those on a budget that want to spend their money seeing NYC not sleeping there  
P => Practical hotel excellent rate Stayed in the hotel for  nights spanning a weekend mid tember  Weekend rate was an unbeatable  per night for a twin room  For value the place was unbeatable  Yes the rooms are functional and practical but for sightseeing trips to NY city how long do you want to spend in the room The bathroom was compact but again everything needed was there shower hairdryer coffee machine   a strange thing to find that in the bathroom  As two females travelling alone we found the hotel safe room cards are needed to operate the elevators so minimises the risk of anyone wandering in off the street someone was behind the desk at all times and quiet  I would recommend the hotel and will certainly use again and rate as above average for sheer value for money safety and location  
P => A budget motel for  a night location is all you get here This hotel is pretty disappointing if you are used to the service and style of a normal business travel hotel riott Wyndham Hyatt Hilton I wouldnt come back here I would walk or take a cab and stay further away next time  
P => Good room great price My fianc  and I were spending the weekend in New York to attend a party  We didnt want to have to run and catch the train so we ided to stay in NYC  In looking for a room everything was either booked or  a night  I went on Hotwire and booked a room at the Club Quarters Downtown for   I was skeptical since the room was so inexpensive but it ended up working perfectly for us  On the up side the hotel itself was very quiet check incheck out was a breeze the room was spacious by NYC standards and though downtown was very close to the  line Wall St  stop and about four blocks from the  line Rector St  stop  Also it appeared to me that several groups of teensyoung adults were using the hotel that weekend for a conference but they were all on another floor different from ours and there was no disruption to us whatsoever  You can only get to your own floor in the elevator with your room key so no one was running around the hotel  On the down side the room really had a college dorm room feel to it  The furniture was very utilitarian and plain the bed was only a full bed not a queen  The layout of the room was a bit awkward and you had to climb around the bottom of the bed to get in the bathroom  The bathroom was also quite cramped and big enough for only one person to get ready at a time  The layout seemed strange to me since there was a spacious sitting area an armoire and an mini fridge  The bed probably should have been resituated  Also the airconditioner was really LOUD to the point that it woke me up and Im a pretty heavy sleeper several times during the night when it kicked on  I dont think there was anything wrong with it it was just an old unit  Consequently I didnt get the best nights sleep of my life  It was unfortunate though since otherwise it was EXTREMELY quiet by NYC standards  The other downside is that this hotel is situated near the  subway lines which are closed for most of the weekend for the time being due to repair work  So for most of the weekend we needed to walk down to Rector Street to pick up the  not an express line  This was really more of an annoyance and had nothing to do with the hotel itself but might be a pain for someone not familiar with the NYC subway system  Its also something to consider if you have heavy bags and want to take the subway  The NYC Subway website probably has more detailed info on the repair work  The Club Quarters is a good place if youre looking for simple serviceable accommodations in New York  The downtown location is really not an inconvenience at all when the  line is running  Plus the price simply cannot be beat for a room with a private bath  Id recommend this hotel for the budget traveler  
P => Great for the Budget Traveler I stayed here for  a night which I obtained through Priceline  The hotel was clean rooms small but very adequate  Bathroom is tiny but served our purpose  The staff were accomodating and I loved the location  The subway was just around the corner as were Wall Street and the financial district  A nice quiet location and only a quick walk to the Staten Island Ferry for a free boat ride by the Statue of Liberty  I would stay here again 
P => Great hotel for the price I visted the club quarters downtown and loved it  We only stayed a few days but for the price and quiet location I could not have asked for a better hotel  The staff was very friendly and quick to please  I loved being in the Financial District on the weekend because my husband and I really dont like alot of people so being here was PERFECT  If I ever go back to New York Club Quartes is were I will be staying  
P => good value two couples stayed here on a thursday night the staff was accomodating   we asked for a room change after we checked in the rooms were big enough with T V  and small fridge and clean  the beds were comfortable for  a good deal  subway right next door  good downtown location we walked to ground zero then over to city hall and over the brooklyn bridge  
P => Spartan but well located Club Quarters is located in the Financial District very close to Wall Street NYSE Trinity Church WTC  Theres a subway entrance around the corner from the hotel as well as a yummy place to get a quick bagel BampCompany next to Starbucks across the street from the Trump building and the subway entrance  Club Quarters downtown or as I heard another guest refer to it quotClose Quartersquot has small rooms especially for two people  but since we didnt spend much time in the room it wasnt an issue  Free wireless internet access in the rooms bring your own wireless equipped computer  they also can loan you or sell you a wireless card at the front desk if necessary  The bathroom is pretty small with only a shower no tub and theres no iron in the room  Each floor has a quotGuest Requestquot closet with one iron ironing board and extra coffee for the room coffee pots which are set up in the bathroom  Checkout is at noon and if you want to have the hotel hold your bags they charge per bag for the entire day  Regular luggage is kept on the second floor conference level and laptops are kept behind the front desk the porter on duty issues you a claim tag for when you return to pick up your baggage  Since he doesnt sit there all of the time allow   minutes to retrieve your stuff especially if the front desk needs to page him  Theres only one ice machine on the rd floor and the k food vending machine was out of order when I was there week of   th  Club Quarters is OK for stays where you dont need amenities and it was a ent starting place for exploring downtown  
P => Clean comfortable room for great value I paid  for an quotexecutivequot room on Saturday night by far the cheapest rate I could find in Manhattan  The hotel is just off Wall Street a  minute walk to the NYSE  The area is very quiet but also very dead during weekends  The room was  x  feet with only  inches between the foot of the double bed and the wall  The room was fine for  person but the quotexecutivequot rooms are NOT meant for  people  The or was like what you would find in a Hampton Inn or newer Holiday Inn  Everything was clean and simple but bland  The bed was quite comfortable  The bathroom was very very small and about the quality of a dorm bathroom  The shower stall had only a curtain but toiletries were provided and there was good water pressure  A clean comfortable place to stay and great deals can be had on Fri Sun nights  Its not a  star hotel but the price simply can not be beat when midtown hotels are packed and demanding full price  
P => Best rate for Easter weekend We ided last minute week before to spend Easter weekend in NYC  So we got the Club Quarters for night on Priceline  About night with taxes  We felt that it was a good rate considering the other rates we were seeing for other comparable hotels on Expedia etc were  and  per nightClub Quarters started out as a quotmembers onlyquot hotel but now they take reservations from anybody  We asked about the quotclub membershipquot and they said that only businesses can quotjoinquot and their members get rooms for as low as night  Hmmmmm   The hotel is in a historic looking  story building  It mustve been an old office building back in the day  But the floors are small and thus the rooms are small  But we read about them on this and other boards so we were not surprised  Our room had a queen bed table with the  in TV and an armoire that held lots of clothes  The bathroom was VERY small with a shower stall after quotsharingquot our st shower together we opted to shower arately the rest of the weekend sink and toilet  But it worked and we had no issues with hot water like other folks here  We had a large window facing north with views of some of the other high rise buildings in the area  There was also a dorm sized refrigerator in the room  great for your water and sodasTHE LOCATION IS AWESOME There is a subway station amp line right underneath the hotel  With the  all day transit pass it made for getting around Manhatten VERY EASY and convenient  We left our car in the garage  blocks away and with the hotel validation it was day  Thats what we would pay at our quototherquot cheap garage that we know about elsewhere in Manhatten      You can check in and out via the front desk folks or use the automated ATM looking machines spread out among the lobby  They also have a quotliving roomquot behind the lobby with a big TV lots of chairs and couches and  PCs with free internet connections for quests  We used them one day to check on a restaurant location which was very handy for usThere is a restaurant on site but its closed on the weekends  There is a Duane Reed store right across the street that was open when we needed it  they are like a mini convenience store  Soda snacks newspaper etc  Starbucks was  block away on Wall Street which was great for coffee each morning  we opted not to use the in room coffee maker for convenience  SUMY   The room was small but we didnt mind as we werent there much except to shower and sleep  The over all look of the hotel was new and clean  Staff seemed pleasant although we did not require much interaction with them  We conveniently checked our bags with the hotel on Sunday after checking out bag until it was time for us to drive home We would stay here again but we are not quotBrand loyalquot to any hotel just as long as we get a good rate and its clean 
P => Boring Budget Beds Well I just checked in and Im surprised that corporations would use this hotel for anything but ior staff     Its like a corp dorm    no HBO or anything but basic channels a full sized bed a desk with a chair that is so low I cant really type    carpet is like sandpaper   so bring slippers or keep your socks on     room is clean and furnishings are dull and minimal    there was plenty of hot water this evening    and the bath is OK in my room Im here for one night   so its OK   but for anyone staying longer consider somewhere else    especially on weekends    there is nothing at all open unless you walk to Broadway for McDonalds I got my room for less than  on priceline    by selecting downtown as a last resort     but wont do that again    whatever you save on the room youll spend on transportation to get somewhere    although you could walk to south street seaport or even chinatown    during the week there is lots open   Subway access is good   Earlier this week I stayed at the new hotel QT on th street   and they know how to do a budget hotel with some class     Club Quarters had me expecting something special since you have to be a member to stay here if youre not booking through one of the online booking sites   but I found a Motel  in the middle of the financial district    Unless NYC is very busy you can probably find better for the same money    Overall not terrible but nothing more than adequate    
P => Never Again You get what you pay for I spent several months at this hotel and was never impressed  On SEVERAL occasions there was no hot water  The room was never as clean as it should have been  Some of my colleagues had trash bags left on their luggage and found used condoms in their room  Service is all but non existent  Room design was very strange and small  It is a cheap hotel in a pretty good location for downtown  You get what you pay for  
P =>  Close  Quarters This is a quotno frills   no anythingquot hotel  But for  per night what do you expect Issues Hot water is something you will miss out on here  There were occassions where there was none or the water temp was quotluke warmquot at best  And if your looking for a bathroom with some room quotfurgettabotitquot  In fact the one room I stayed in had a toilet at such an quotunusualquot angle that the only way one could quotseatquot themselves was sideways  Pillows are another quotitemquot which they seem to miss out on  Their were all quotflatquot as a pancake  As for any sort of chair other than the one they give you for the desk there  or  not be one in your room depending on which one you get Rooms are simple and basic  The quotclosetquot is a small quotardmorequot style piece of furniture which can allow you to put in   pieces of clothing and thats about it  There is only one vending machine for the  floors   its on  and its also where the only ice machine is  If you need an iron and ironing board you have to go to a community closet to see if one is there  If not then you wander up and down floors and hope you find one in a community closet somewhere Want a newspaper Got to go buy one at the store  Rooms have a coffe maker small fridge and a hair dryer  And there is free quotwirelessquot internet but the connection can be a bit shaky and the signal will vary from room to room and floor to floor  In one room having the computer on the floor by the door seemed to give me just enough quotsignalquot strength to actually be used Oh yes housekeeping will gladly leave you quotgiftsquot  I was there for several months and found piles of used towels other bags of garbage and even cleaning supplies guess they wanted me to clean my own room I know what do you expect for the money  But realistically they eliminate most of the staff you do your own quotself checkinquot and quotself checkoutquot and there is no valet or even taxi service  So they could invest in quotbusinessquot amentities that business travelers look for  Afterall they claim to be a hotel for business travelersIf your looking for value and nothing more then you might have found your quothavenquot  If your use to traveling like me and having a bit more amenities available to you then you will be disappointed  
P => Excellent location value and service  After staying for a few days at Fort Lee it was soothing to be at the Club Quarters On top of the service location and value The facilities are just as good as any five stars costing  times more within walking distance  Do not expect big spaces After all you are in New York But the limited space is equipped with top of the line EVERYTHINGIt had become my preferred choice for staying in New York City as you are right in the center of action without suffering the commotion 
P => A great place to stay on a budget Stayed at Club Quarters in     Its right next to Wall St and a very safe area  Its very close to several subway locations  The place is neat and clean looks pretty new hallway carpeting and room or  You cant beat the price for NYC  I would definitely stay there again 
P => good place for WE stayed  WE nights in this hotel beginning of ch  although it is clearly an hotel for businessmen it was very pleasant big room with a queen bed and a microwave Access for internet is provided   computers it is very useful for a quick web search if you havent got your own wifi mobile I recommend this hotel for WE well situated in downtown calm and price are much lower than week days  
P => great value arrived in new york from south africa on the th ember and found the hotel easilyroom was quite small but clean and great for a place to sleepgiven coffee and a newspaper in the morning and free internet accesshotel is right across the road from the subway great benefitlocation is quiet but nice hotel staff friendly the hotel kept my bags on the day of check out till i was ready to leaveall in all a great stay  dont hesitate for the price its brilliant 
P => Great NYC Hotel We stayed at the Club Quarters Downtown over Christmas   The hotel is very clean and spacious for NYC  Staff was helpful and courteous  Centrally located to all subways a block from the NYSE  blocks from Trinity Church  I think its great to support that part of NYC and we will go back again and again  
P => Great Room For The Price Got this hotel stay on Priceline for  tax and service fees which I think is very good for a Sat  nite in NYC one week b Xmas It is very easy to get to via Subway  or  line and easy walking distance to the South Street Seaport Battery Park and the World Financial Center Check in was quick and smooth and I was given a room upgrade The room was spacious and as clean as you can expect from a hotel   There was a small fridge microwave sink countertop cabinets utensils coffeemaker in the quotkitchen area quotThe bed was a full size and there was a very nice sitting chair  One plus is that you can open your windows and there was a cool view of a small church and a huge sculpture in an office Bldg  courtyard  There was a ent workout room also  I didnt use the barrestaurant but I rarely do so anyway  Overall I was very satisfied for the price and recommend the hotel  
P => Wonderful Hotel I needed a hotel and couldnt find one for the life of me that didnt cost me my first born  I found this gem tucked away in the Financial District  Its one block from the subway and about  streets away to find a cab weekends are very very quiet there  The staff was excellent polite accommodating and helpful  I would go back in a New York minute 
P => Great hotel Club Quarters was a great stay for a great Manhattan price  Its tucked away in the Wall Street area so theres plenty of parking on the weekends  The staff is nice the rooms are small but clean and the automated checkout system is really helpful  Theres a club room with free internet access and computer use as well as a fitness center in great condition  Would stay here again in a heartbeat  
P => Loved the Club Quarters Great place to stay downtown  Got a great rate on Hotwire  Room very spacious especially for New York City  Loved the free high speed internet access  Would definitely stay there again  Highly recommended  
P => Comfortable and Clean Very clean and safe  This property was clean as a whistleand felt very safe  The location is very convenient to South Street Seaport Ground Zero and the Staten IsFerry there is a subway stop at the end of the blockand several others within two blocks  I found it very easyto find has a large American flag above the doorway Free wi fi internet access or you can use computersin lobby  I would definately stay here again  Also themattress was very luxurious and comfortable  
P => Awesome for Price Club Quarters Downtown was a pleasant place to stay  Our room was on the th floor and was easily accesible by high speed elevators  of them and  sets of stairs  The room is spacious and clean well worth the cheap price especially for  student travellers  The only complaint would be the size of the bathroom  No bathtub only a shower room but who takes baths these days while travelling anyway Literally you couldnt fit more than  people in the bathroom at once  No locks on the bathroom doors which were like closet doors  The coffee maker was plugged in the bathroom which was bizarre Otherwise the service was great the room was clean there were lots of features available on the TV  computers in the lobby with access to the internet  I didnt use the gym but it looked clean and had lots of equipment CQ Downtown is an awesome find well worth its price

P => Ok value for what you pay Mediocre room  No Bathtub  TV far too small and only basic cabel  But cheap with intenet deal and good location  Breakfest not bad  
P => Great Location worth No Frills My wife and I with friends of ours stayed here for a weekend to catch some sights and some footy the round ball type  I used my companys corporate discount to book the rooms and while my friends room on the th floor had a half ent view our room was on the rd floor and right beside the air conditioning unit for the downstairs lobby and  feet from the dinging elevator  It was loud and uncomfortable but since we didnt spend much time in the room it wasnt enough of a bother to move  Another night though and I wouldve have insisted on changing rooms The service isnt bad but its not great either  Youre encouraged to do everything through self service computer which is fine if it works  Our room keys stopped working on the second day   a little annoying  The elevators are slow and if its busy youll wait a while Otherwise the location is really great  Centrally located to Grand Central Times Square Central Park Empire State Building th Avenue and a very safe neighbourhood  
P => Cant beat the location and price Front desk wasnt anything special  The room was a ent size for NYC the bathroom was quiet small but in perfectly fine condition  For the price and location you cant beat this place The location was right outside Time Square and couldnt have been more perfect for the attractions and events we were in NYC to see  Cafe Manhattan across the street has great coffee and the Perfect Pint is a great place to grab a drink  
P => Great Location   ok room  This place is sort of small but the location is great and the room clean and comfortable  The bathroom was tiny But I dont spend alot of time in the hotel room  It is within walking distance to TimesSquare Broadway Rockafeller Center and transportation  It was a safe secure hotel without a lot off quotextrasquot  
P => Club Quarters Great location at a great price We stayed here for  week from th to th of tember We had booked back in uary and had got a great deal for an executive suite  This consisted of  rooms one was a sitting room with a sofa bed desk TV fridge and microwave  The second room was the bedroom with ensuite bathroom  The bathroom was small but perfectly usable  Good shower and ent proper hairdryer  The bedroom had a king size bed which was very comfortable plus a wardrobe chest of drawers and other spaces to hang clothes  There was also a TV in there  Both rooms had airconditioning We never ate in the hotel but instead had breakfast at Cafe Manhattan opposite which is very nice indeed  For first timers in New York the location of this hotel could not be better   minutes from Time Square and all the broadway theatres close to fifth avenue and Grand Central  It is surprisingly quiet the only noise I ever heard was the aircon If you are looking for a hotel with room service a porter to carry your bags concierge shoe shine etc then this is not the place for you and you will hate it  However if like me you just want somewhere clean and comfortable to sleep and wash then Club Quarters is ideal  I would definitely not hesitate to stay here again  
P => celebrate my birthday It was a good place for businessmen to stay over  Nice environment  There is Continental Breakfast downstairs at    It is usually quiet but when you walk over to Time Square you can feel the heat of NYC 
P => Great location for fun but not so warm service and hospitality  Rooms are microscopic in size and the service is anything but warm  Staff seem robotic    not sure why they are there  The entire hotel could be automated and the experience would be better  Would I stay there again   yes    the location and rate is good despite the poor service  I guess you get what you pay for  Bottom line rooms are clearn adequately appointed bathrooms immaculate and the hotel seems very safe  Not enough safetly deposit boxes  Beds very comfortable  I used the hotel as a good location for my wife who was touring and shopping while I worked downtown in the financial district  Easy access to subway stations to get to work  
P => Would stay there again for sure Great Location   blocks from times sq  East walk to subway  Very Clean and comfortable  the staff was always on the ball  it has onsite dining and a lounge perfect for meetings  The gym could be a bit bigger and have more equipt but it had ice cold water dispenser and that was great  The rooms were small but comfy and the desk workspace was just perfect  I will stay ther again  Great wireless internet for free too  
P => Clean and great location Smaller than expected rooms but we didnt spend too much time in the room  The staff was very helpful and courteous  The hotel was  blocks away from Time Square and  blocks away from Grand Central Station  Simple and worth every penny  
P => Great location clean and comfortable I read some of the reviews of this hotel before we left and frankly was not expecting a good experience    Well Im delighted to say we had a very pleasant stay  The staff were friendly and helpful our standard room was more than adequate and comfortable bathroom very clean and shower efficient  The location is excellent a short walk to th Avenue or Times Square  Only complaint   the lift is rather slow 
P => Great Place to Sleep   not Stay Theres a joke amongst business travelers who stay there that the Club Quarters to them is the Close Quarters  The rooms are so small and cramped we confused the closet door for the room door several times  The Internet didnt work  The location was great service wasnt too good and the rooms are great if you are not in them awake  
P => I Luv New York  Spent  fantastic nights at the Club Quarters Midtown location  I had previously stayed amp really enjoyed their location on Wall Street but wanted to be closer to all the action in Times Square so ided to try their Midtown location  My friend and I had a wonderful experience amp I recommend this hotel highly  First its very very clean including the bathrooms  Also the sitting room is beautiful amp there are  computers with free internet use  They also have a tiny gym with all the free bottled water you can drink  The location is perfectly located close to all the major New York attractions amp amazing restaurants  Dont forget to eat at iors restaurant but make sure to go when youre really really hungry because the portion sizes including a regular cup of coffee are gigantic but the cheesecake some many different kinds to choose from is to die for  I visit New York all the time amp really enjoyed myself on this visit  Also the hotel is very quiet especially at night even though its in the heart of the downtown  Do visit this hotel im sure youll enjoy your stay Thanks Club Quarters 
P => Great Value for Money Got this room on Priceline for a steal in ch   Stayed for  nights  Hotel location on E th Street couldnt be better   minutes from Times Square  minutes from the nearest station Bryant Park station if I recall correctly  Hotel check in was automated    however we had some problems as the credit card name didnt match the booking name  So make sure this is correct when making the booking  We booked a standard room but I believed we were upgraded to the next room category has the room was LARGE with plenty of space  Bathroom is a bit tight and shower was tempermental but nothing serious enough to warrant a bad rating  Tiny window at the back of the room which offered little light  There are also two internet terminals and printer at the lounge for guest use  The lounge also offers free coffee and tea every morning  The cafe directly opposite the hotel is excellent  Although we booked and paid online through Priceline when we checked out the hotel charged us again  We had to email the hotel to reverse the charge    and we lost some money due to forex fluctuation  Unnecessary hassle which should have been avoided If you are using the hotel just as a place to rest your legs after being out the whole day in wonderful NYC you couldnt do any better than this  Location is ace  I would come back to this place again if I can get the wonderful rates I got on Priceline  
P => Poor service   Expected better after reading the reviews Downside I booked a standard room  weeks in advance and confirmed my reservation a week before hand  We arrived at the hotel front desk at noon and was told that no rooms were immediately available as they needed to be cleaned  We left my bags at the hotel and went out for the day  We arrived back at the Hotel at pm and was then told that all the standard rooms were taken and only club rooms were available  Why did they not check me in as soon as a room was available Well they didnt have an answer  People at the front desk were not friendly either  The club room is very small   use this only if youre staying alone Rooms are not well insulated from noise and my neighbours were very noisy  I could hear the entire movie being watched in the adjacent room  Dont get a road facing room its very noisy   lots of hooting  Hotel is old and plumbing is not great  Had a problem with the tiolet not flushing  The plumber was not quick to arrive but he sorted the out the problem quickly after he arrived  Upside Rooms were clean and neat  Location is good   close to th ave rockerfeller and times square   but so are many other hotels VerdictThey had offered a   discount for my next stay at the hotel but I would pay more and stay elsewhere  We stayed at the riott Courtyard on th street on our first visit and we should have paid the extra few  and had a far more pleasant experience  
P => Great quality for great price in the center of NYC Very comfortable room with soft bed table and chair  Free WiFI  Coffeemaker with coffee But its not all that important because its a great value and its located in  minutes of walking from TImes Square  
P => Great value and location in Manhatten Although the room I had on my first night was very small and had a view of a brick wall and a bunch of air conditioning units I moved to a higher floor for the rest of my stay and had a perfectly nice room    large comfortable bed ent desk to work at and a nice modern bathroom  The staff were helpful in giving me directions and arranging for a ride to the airport upon departure  At times the elevators were very busy    many time there was only one working leaving one small elevator in service for the entire hotel  The only unwanted noises I heard were the slamming of guest room doors on the up side there was no risk they were not going to close and lock behind you as you leave your room  There was also a small technical problem with the Internet printing service the hotel had  It didnt work and the lady at the front desk had little clue about it  They have two PCs in the lounge on the first floor and a laser printer so I just brought down my documents on a USB stick and printed them there  A few doors down from the hotel is a great Kosher restaurant the MilkN Honey  It was where I went for breakfast every day httpwww milknhoneykosher com  
P => Clean small biz hotel Good corporate rate  Clean rooms  Okay sized rooms  Free internet  Perfect for crashing at night   dont expect to spend much time in the building  Great midtown location  No soap or shampoo so stop by CVS  
P => Location location location plus service There have been a few reviews here of this property criticizing the conciergedesk personnel for being unfriendly  I didnt find that AT ALL  They were welcoming warm helpful and eager to assist me in any way during my stay  I got a good rate on this hotel through Priceline and I was very pleased with the choice The location is great    walking distance to many places I walked tofrom Times Square Rockefeller Center and Grand Central Terminal among other places and centrally located to uptown buses Madison Ave and downtown buses th Ave as well as subway stations Times Square and Rockefeller Center Housekeeping on my room was great and the room was very quiet larger than I expected and I loved the free internet  I also liked that I could turn on a quotfanquot with the AC system since it was chilly enough even in e during my stay that the AC didnt quotwantquot to turn on    but I wanted the moving air and the fan setting let me have it I loved having the refrigerator and microwave in the room as well I was in something the website calls something like a quotsuitequot or quotminisuitequot or quotior suitequot  I used the hotels shopping service to bring in some sodas so I wouldnt have to haul them around myself and that worked well  This business center and free printing were greatI recommend this place    and I think be because of the reports here at Trip Advisor they are working hard on coming across as more quotfriendlyquot to guests  I was very pleased  
P => Excellent location and friendly staff made this an A experience Stayed at the Club Quarters Midtown     after winning a bid on Shatners website  Hotel is in a prime location between th and th Avenues seconds from th Avenue shopping and just a  minute walk from Broadway  Unlike other reviewers we had nothing but polite and helpful attention from the staff  They walked us through the semi self check in process  Elevators were tiny but we and our luggage fit just fine  Our room was cozy   typical for a NYC hotel room   and we never felt cramped  Plenty of storage for our stuff  Bathroom was small but reminiscent of a cruiseship bathroom   ingenious storage and room for everything  Room had two windows that faced an unattractive inner courtyard   but we were not staying here for the room view  Comfortable bed extra pillows upon request and room was spotlessly clean  Free wifi worked at all hours  Absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel and we would stay here again in a heartbeat  
P => Nice hotel in great location We thoroughly enjoyed a one week stay at the Club Quarters Hotel located in the heart of NY Midtown  th Ave is just around the corner in walking distance to the Empire State Building Times Square and Central Park   not to mention all the fine shops and restaurants Some reviewers seemed to have issues with the hotel staff especially the personel at the front desk  Although the employees didnt appear to be very friendly e g  didnt greet upon entering the lobby their use for the hotel guest is rather limited as all check in and check out procedures are totally computer based  As far as the room service staff we were very satisfied as they were extremly helpful whenever additional items such as towels toilet paper etc  were needed We didnt make any use of the breakfast arrangement as it didnt seem to be worth the price  for a bagel an apple and a bottle of water  Just opposite the hotel is a nice caf  which offers a large variety of whatever your heart desires   quality and pricing are good The only thing rather annoying was the extremly loud air conditiong system located in the back yard of the hotel  The system ran day and night mostly at high speed  Unfortunately all rooms seem to have windows facing that particular part of the building  However as touring NY demands such a great deal of energy from you we fell asleep immediately and didnt notice much of the noice All in all Club Quarters Midtown is a great place to enjoy your stay in New York 
P => Its all about location We took a trip to NYC to catch a couple of Broadway shows and from the hotel it is a short walk to Times Square  For the price the location was excellent  Could we have found better Probably   but we probably would have paid more too  There is a desk by the front door which was always staffed everytime we passed by it but the only time we actually dealt with the staff member there was when she motioned us to the kiosk to check in and out of the hotel  We never saw any other staff in the hotel the entire time we were there  So if you are someone who relies on hotel staff for anything this is probably not the place for you The hotel is old and showing some wear  The elevators are tiny and slow  The lighting in the hallways and in the rooms was a little on the dark side as well  The rooms were small but clean  Ours had a small sofa in it along with a small kitchen type area where there was a sink and a small refrigerator  The bathrooms were clean but it looked like they made a very sloppy repair on the tile on the shower floor  It also looked like they made a repair in the ceiling in the room but used glossy paint instead of flat paint so they ceiling had a few odd paint streaks  See pictures  There is a large room on the first floor just past the elevators that had  computers for public use  We were able to check our e mail from there Overall its a fine no frills hotel with a fantastic location  I would not hesitate to stay here again  
P => Fine hotel in good location This is a good base to explore manhatten  On a side street between th and th avenues is is quiet but central enough that you can walk everywhere in midtown  The rooms were small but functional and the staff were helpful  
P => Great value for the location I had never stayed at a Club Quarters so I wasnt sure what to expect  I got a terrific rate   including all taxes on Hotwire  Turns out that I had a wonderful experience and I would definitely stay at a Club Quarters again  This one is in a terrific location just off of Times Square   very close to everything but not in the immediate gridlock of people traffic and noise so it was a nice reprieve from the chaos outside  The lobby is basic but professional and the rooms are clean and well kept  The only negative commentary that I have is that there are only two very tiny elevators so it  take quite a bit of time to go up and down to your room  Also I had left my bags earlier in the day since I arrived before check in someone was supposed to bring them up in a few minutes   and I had to call a half hour later to tell them that I needed the bags bc I was going out for the evening  All and all though I would encourage people to stay here   its definitely significantly cheaper even at the full price rate than many other hotels in the area and it is just as good if not better than most of them  
P => Good location Stayed at the hotel over the weekend and found it to be a pretty good place  The location is tops about five minute walk to times square and a minute or two to fifth avenue  Reception is pretty basic with just one person to help with a self check type system but it was quick and easy  The room was very comfortable and quiet be a bit small by US standards but not small like main European cities  Overall it was great value for money  
P => Club Quarters MidTown   Great Spot We had a great time in NYC over  days and stayed in the Club Quarters Midtown location     a great spot located near Times Square the theater and movie districts and good restaurant options in areas like the Hells Kitchen section of NYC  Close by Grand Central and Subway spots the room was modestly size but plenty big for the two of us  Staff were very service oriented and the one time we dined in the hotel it was very good and the price most reasonable  We had a few room hiccups but each time they were quickly corrected and the service staff were very cordial and helpful  
P => Great Location in NY Only stayed here for Valentines night but was very glad we chose this hotel on our quick stop  The location is excellent being just a block away from Times Square and within easy walking distance of numerous sites including Grand Central Station Rockefeller Center and slightly further Central Park  Theres a handy Starbucks across the road and the parking garage we used was on the next block  for  hours Booking in was hassle free just a case of entering our names onto a kiosk and printing out our key cards  The room although small was functional and clean  The view was terrible and the bathroom tiny but its all exactly what we expected for the location and price Overall its a ent  star accommodation and ideal for a couple of nights if your staying longer and plan to spend any extended time in your room why would you in New York Id choose somewhere a bit further out with bigger rooms and bigger prices  
P => This hotel is an excellent deal We arrived in New York on    a record setting cold day    degrees Though we arrived at Club Quarters Midtown earlier than  p m  our room was ready and we were able to check in  Having read earlier reviews I was concerned about the staff but everyone was friendly and responsive to our requests  We asked for a rollaway bed which was brought promptly and a problem with hot water was quickly rectified  Yes the elevators are tiny but this is a minor inconvenience Club Quarters Midtown appears to be an older hotel that has been handsomely restored  The rooms are very clean and the space more than adequate for a city in which you are only in your room to sleep and shower  The location couldnt be better within easy walking distance of shopping shows everything you could want  We didnt eat in the hotel restaurants but liked Cafe Manhattan across the street for breakfast and deli items  Nation a few doors down is a relaxed neighborhood bar with good food and knowledgeable servers hi Josh Our experience with Club Quarters Midtown was very positive and I would certainly stay there again  The staff is not effusive but professional and competent  We were very satisfied with this hotel and the entire trip   except for the  degrees Miami Family 
P => Ideal NY location Went to NY to see in the New Year   Stayed at QC Midtown for the week and were quite satisfied with what we got  Standard room although not overly generous size wise was perfectly adequate for the two of us and I believe not uncommonly small by NY standards  Check in and check out extremely efficient but apart from the internet access we didnt use any other hotel facilities  Great Deli right across the road for breakfast and plenty of other eating places nearby  Location was great with just a short walk to many of the areas we wanted to be and being in a room towards the back it was nice and quiet too when we wanted to relax after a hard day doing all the touristy things  We would certainly use QC again when visiting NY  
P => CQ Midtown is simple central not overpriced My family stays here every time they visit and quality has always been high  Rooms are small and basic but completely clean and cozy  Service is spare unpretentious and you wont be pampered but you are well taken care of  There are often good deals for this place online usually at very good prices given the central location and quality of the rooms  
P => Fine for a quick business stay I was in Manhattan on business and stayed one night here by myself  I felt safe here   the hallways are well lit with multiple fire doors  The property is in an excellent Midtown location  Dont expect fancy amenities   you check yourself in at a kiosk   but thats fine for me  The room was nice clean quiet and a fair size for Manhattan standards  Would certainly stay here again  
P => great location and value in overpriced NYC Club Quarters provides a nice base for midtown sightseeing    convenient to subway and buses and easy walking distance to Times Square Rockefeller Center and th Avenue shopping  My room was small well organized with a good bed and bedding flat screen TV and a window facing a wall   quiet but no natural light  The bathroom was also small and well appointed  The whole place reminds me of small European hotels     and of course why stay in the room when all of NYC awaits  The public areas of the hotel are quite nice with a salon with free computers and comfortable seating areas to work or read the paper  There is a dining room with an overpriced breakfast and adequate dinner menu  Food was mediocre and service was good  The hotel endeavors to be somewhat self service but there was always someone available to help and answer questions  Overall I would say a very good value for the money  
P => Good locations reasonable price dont expect too much service A lot has already been said in previous reviews so Ill just sumize my experience with this hotelLocation Good location very centrally in midtown New York  Hotel itself The elevators are small causing congestion on check out moments and people with suitcases Room Good enough for a stay in New York  Rooms arent big but arent too small either  Only problem was the TV which by default turned on with the volume fully blown  Very irritating for your neighbours  In the room there is wireless internet available free of charge Staff They do their job but dont expect them to go out of their way to accomplish you  They do what they need to do and thats it  
P => Super Location If you want an exceptional location in NYC this is the place  The hotel is very clean although the rooms are small  If you are a traveler who needs a huge room The price I paid was great for that area in NYC  It is in a very safe location with lots of businesses around and is about two blocks from Times Square  Many people have commented on the rude staff but when I asked questions and my needs are few I was given directions in a courteous manner  I require very little as a traveler and would stay at this place again and again  
P => Fine stay at the Quarters Ideally located near Times Square the hotel is perfect for a short stay in the Big Apple  The rooms are small but if you re there for a brief visit you won t be spending much time in the room  If you re there for business the hotel boasts all the essential business amenities  
P => Great location very clean friendly staff Had a brilliant stay at club quarters midtown  Step to your right when you leave the hotel for half a block and you are on th avenue step to left for a block and a half and your at times square Very friendly staff upon arrival and throughout the stay  The room was a good size for the two of us    was worried it would be tiny from previous reviews  Very clean cleaned each day with new bed sheet and towels when requested  Nice flat screen tv with very comfortable beds Room key card required to activate elevators so added to the safety factor  Our room was located on the th floor to the back of the hotel and as a result we had absolutely no street noise brilliantOverall a great hotel at a very reasonable price looking to go back to new york as soon as finances allow and will definately stay in club quarters midtown again 
P => Worlds smallest room  The downsideHaving not stayed in a Club Quarters property before I wasnt sure what to expect  What I found was one of the smallest hotel rooms Ive ever stayed in  In fact if I had wanted to I could have washed my face while sitting on the toilet  The room itself was nice  However it was terribly small  Unfortunately the room never cooled down as the air conditioning unit wasnt working properly  Finally at  a m  I called down to the desk and asked what I could do  I was told to quotpull the curtains away from the sensor quot Too little too late  The irony of it all was the view from my room was of the cooling equipment  Im sure the equipment worked for someoneThe upsideGreat location off of th and th  Easy walking to  Rock Time Square Theater District etc  The rate was apparently pretty good for the area  
P => Great price and location We stayed at this hotel in il and as there was three of us this was best value hotel we could find  Its in a great location litterally walk to the end of the road and your on th turn right towards the empire state and turn left towards central park abercrombie nike town trump towers etc  Its not the nicest hotel Ive stayed in but for the price its very good value clean and comfortable  Afterall we were in New York so it as just a base for showering and sleeping  
P => Tiny Room Great location Coming from a terrible hotel in Queens the Club Quarters was a dream come true  We were traveling with out  year old so for  adults and  child the room was WAY tiny but we made the best of it  The room was very clean and well kept and we loved the location close to everything  Overall very satisfied with our value for the money 
P => Very convenient Small rooms NY standard but very good position and price for mid Manhattan  The breakfast offered for  has fruits pastry bagels and cream cheese cereals aso  Rooms equipped with coffee maker and tiny wardrobe  
P => Great Place Area And Staff I have just returned from New York and loved Club Quarters Midtown  It has the perfect location to everything like Times Square and th Ave  The staff was very helpful and polite  Our check in and check out was quick and handle very professionally  They even hold your bags at check out so you can do things if your flight is later in the day Cafe Manhattan across the street is a great and affordable place for breakfast  We went there every morning The room was a nice size and so was the bathroom  We were only in the room  pretty much to sleep and just get dressed so size wasnt that important I will go to this hotel again for my future visits and I hope you will too It was worth it 
P => What a suite deal All I wanted was an inexpensive room for a one night stay so my dhter and I could get a head start on shopping before we joined other relatives for a stay at another hotel  A Priceline bid was accepted and we were the winners of a room in a very clean comfortable hotel in a fantastic location just off th Avenue  the one with all the stores  The very charming Grace checked us in efficiently smiled mysteriously and whispered that she had given us quota little upgradequot  The quotlittle upgradequot was the Diplomat Suite with a sitting room bedroom and   eureka    TWO bathrooms  Need I tell you how nice it is for two women to have two bathrooms The rooms were smallish but clean quiet and very enjoyable  We felt very safe and secure in the hotel and did I mention that we wanted to shop we were just a few blocks from Rockefeller Center Saks the Garment District and Lord and Taylors  The hotel seems to be designed for the frequent business traveler and we didnt have the opportunity to check out all the amenities because we had other plans did I mention shopping but if Im ever fortunate enough to stay at Club Quarters Midtown again Ill do so with delight  Thank you Grace for getting our annual Girls Week off to such a nice start  We hope to see you again    so we can do some more shopping  
P => Great Hotel The hotel was very nice and in a great location  Free coffee and tea in the morning was nice  My only criticism is that the fitness room was a joke  The TV didnt work and there were no weights and they could update the cardio equipment  
P => A good hotel I found the Club Quarters to be clean with friendly staff and good sized rooms  The locations was excellent  The only downsides were an unnattractive view and thin walls an arguing couple kept us up one night 
P => Very Nice My husband and I just came back today from staying in the diplomat suite at Club Quarters  We thought the rooms were very clean and it was nice to have two bathrooms            yes the bathrooms were small but the overall design allows you to move around quite well  I like the contempory design and the flat screen TVS were a plus Tvs could use a little update pic amp sound not to good The only real down fall was PARKING The hotel has no parking so you have to walk about  blocks from the hr parking garage  We would definitley stay here again Location is great to restaurants Broadway shows shop and cocktail lounges  
P => Reallity Check After reviewing the comments on this hotel I ided to give this one a try and abandoned another hotel that we usually frequent  be its just me or people dont truly understand the purpose of this website which is to share information about your experience and not your expectations  These are my top five things I look for when booking a hotel  Cleanliness  Location  Cost  Service  AmenitiesStarting from the bottom this hotel is slim on amenities  They have a fitness room with  pieces of equipment but offer you complimentary bottle water  However Im not going to NY to work out and Ill get enough of that by walking up and down Broadway and th Avenue  There are no doormen bellhops or a concierge desk but they will provide you with information and you can do it find it and get it yourself Service   Automatic check in  You dont even need to speak to the staff to get your room keys and check into your room  Yeah they will hold your luguage after you check out if you have a late flight and they also offer late check out at a small fee  till pm  There is a dining hall that serves breakfast and dinner  Elevators are slow and small  For the health minded there is always the stairs Cost   Very reasonable considering the location and in line with other hotel in its class Location    blocks from Broadway and  block from th Avenueand surrounded by plenty of small stores for breakfast lunch and dinner and a little shopping Most Important   Very Very clean  When I opened to door I was very pleased with the contemporary design and how clean the rooms were  We had a diplomat suite with  adults and we had plenty of room to manuver  The rooms came with plasma tvs a small refrigerator clean and microwave didnt use  No Iron or board was provided but Im sure if asked they would have provided  Bathrooms were on the small size but clean and modern  Im not sure why people are concerned about the size of the bathroom as long it has a toilet sink and shower I dont know what else you need  BTW the doors on the bathroom are sliding doors so you dont have the problem of the door hitting the toilet  With the diplomat suite you get  full bathrooms and  rooms If your trip to NY is strictly to sightsee and do some shopping then the majority of your time not spent inside the room  However when you come back from an exhausting day you want a nice clean room to relax this hotel fits the bill in spades  
P => You Be the Judge    You be the judge According to their website Club Quarters is a  private full service hotel for member organizations   They also accept reservations from the general public  Since my sister and I planned to be in New York the weekend of the New York athon we went online to a travel website and prepaid for a standard room queen bed for two nights at the Club Quarters Midtown near Times Square  When we arrived because hotel management claimed there was nothing else available we were given a room with one twin bed  When we complained it was politely implied that we would have to make the best of it The desk clerk said he would try to move us to a standard room for the next night and by the way providing a roll away bed  wasn t allowed   It was late and the  discussion  was going nowhere   so that at least one of us would be comfortable I let my sister sleep in the twin bed and I slept on the floor  The following day the staff was unapologetic and evasive when we mentioned compensation stating that they had the right to assign rooms according to the  run of the house   So that must include cramming two people into a room clearly designed for one It s been over a month and we have yet to hear from either the Club Quarters Midtown or from corporate headquarters even though a registered letter was sent to both explaining our concerns  Since we are talking ethics  I will say that the travel website offered compensation after they got in touch with hotel management and also found them to be uncooperative   Club Quarters Midtown is described online as part of a  new concept for the hotel industry    No thanks  It s well priced in a good location but there is no way I can recommend this hotel  For those fellow travelers who still want to take a chance   pack an air mattress and sleeping bag just in case    L V  
P => Great Location and Friendly Staff My wife and I just returned from a weekend in New York and we were very pleased with the excellent customer service  We were blocks away from Times Square and Rockefeller Center for the location the price cannot be beat  Our check in was quick and easy without all the hassle unlike the other hotels we have stayed where there are long lines  I would recommend this hotel and cant wait to try out your other locations in New York next year  
P => Good location and staff We managed to fit  people into this tiny room The staff was nice enough to provide us with a cot and extra bedding so that worked out nicely for us  The rooms are clen stylish and small but by NY standards they are fairly average size  However the tiny bathroom reminded me of an airplane lavoratoryThe staff is very helpful as well I would definitely stay here again 
P => Hotel average price and location fantastic Considering that I booked a room at the Club Quarters Midtown A the morning of the day I checked in B at the height of the holiday season ember  and paid less than  a night for two nights I dont have much room to complain My standard room with a queen size bed was not huge but acceptable  It was probably a converted studio apartment   still had a fireplace mantel on one wall  It took me a second to realize that there was no closet but there was a corner with a pole for hanging things and a four prong coat rack on the wall  My floor had a closet by the elevator where you could get an iron ironing board extra coffee blankets etc  The bathroom was as to be expected small but had good counter space for toiletries  The shower looked a little dated and didnt have enough hot water for a long shower but the water pressure was good  The bed was comfortable and well linened  The room also had a well appointed workspace and a sitting chair both of which we had to use for luggage storage  The small flat screen TV made the room look very modern  The biggest issue I encountered   apparently the wiring is not equipped to handle a lot of voltage because using the window unit heater a hair dryer and the bathroom light at the same time caused the power to go out  Overall the room was nicely reated given the space they had to work with The staff was very friendly and helpful upon my check in and check out and when I had to call to get an extra washcloth and to get the power back on My trip was for work but I also had time to enjoy the holiday sights of the city  Times Square is about two avenue blocks west and Rockefeller Center is a quick four blocks up Fifth Avenue  You really cant beat the location if you want to be in the Midtown hustle and bustleI will stay at the CQ Midtown again   but if the price werent so good I might look for other options  
P => I always stay here when in NYC Im a bit surprised to read the poor reviews of this hotel  I always stay here when traveling to NYC for business which is usually about   times a year  Yes the rooms are small    but this is NYC Yes there can be street noise sometimes    but this is NYC What do you expect Are you planning on staying in your room all day So who cares if the rooms are on the small side  And I always travel with earplugs no matter where I go and any potential noise problem is solved This is a hotel for people who want a great location comfortable rooms wireless internet access and a TERRIFIC price for NYC  Im booking another room today for a full week in ember and everything else is coming up in the  range  This hotel is   If you have the money for an expensive hotel then book somewhere else  If you want a great value for the location and accommodations then book here  
P => Excellent Customer Service My Husband and I stayed at Club Quartes MIdtown for the weekend of tember   for my birthday  The receptionist Raquel Dietz was exceptional    She answered all our questions throughout our stay although she was busy assting other guest checking them in and out of the hotel  Our hotel suite was great It was nice and clean and the staff made us feel at home My husband and I will be back in New York in the near future and we will stay at your hotel again   Thank you so much your hospitality   The Williams 
P => Good Hotel     Great Location Stayed from       the staff was friendly      and rooms where good size    great location walking distance to Times Square and Madison Avenue    and Rockefeller Center      Found great cheap Soveneir shop on nd and th   you have to check out      
P => Must give it a bad review I have always been grateful for the concept of Club Quarters in that they give special breaks to non profits on weekends and have enjoyed stays in Pittsburg and Washington immensely  The facilities at the mid town Club Quarters in NYC were perfectly ent and the staff friendly  The room itself was well appointed but for the clock that wasnt turned on  It took me a while to figure out the thermostat    what looked like one when I entered must not have been because while it said  degrees I quickly realized I was freezing and I finally figured out I had to manually work the radiator  When it came to trying to sleep at night it was a bit of a nighte    for one thing every time the heat came on it came on with a huge rush of sound which woke me up every time  Then every time someone uses the bathroom the flush is heard throughout the system  Finally if you are on lower floors I was on the th floor be ready for the garbage trucks that come at odd hours of the night    the windows must not be sealed in a way to cut out the sounds  It is always hard to retrofit an old building and I am usually very tolerant of less than perfect situations in the quest of charm but if you have a big meeting the next day that you really need a good nights sleep for you  want to think twice  
P => Get an Upgraded Room I booked this room through Delta Air LinesHotels com  At first I wished that I had done more research  Our first room had a broken heater  So did the second room  The th floor smells like an ash tray  Then we got our upgrade at no additional cost to us  That room was very acceptable  Great midtown location  The common room is very nice with good use of community computers  The wireless signal in our rooms for my lap top was very weak  We did not eat at the hotel  I would stay here again with the upgraded room  only  
P => Great Location Facilities can be limited Club Quarters Midtown has a great location opposite Rockefeller Center  For business travellers the facilities are a mixed bag  The staff at the front desk are somewhat helpful but they always seemed distracted or busy with someone else  The lobby is tiny and is thus very busy and crowded  They have  computers for internet access if you arent travelling with a computer like I was  The rooms are larger than what you would expect in Midtown and has a large desk a small ish plasma TV a sofa sink and coffee maker  The bed was very comfortable  I was a little disappointed that the bathroom didnt have a tub but the shower was nice and powerful  Overall my stay was quite good but it doesnt live up to a hotel particularly designed with the business traveller in mind  Perhaps this hotel would be better for tourists  
P => You wont regret it As others have mentioned we too were a little anxious once we read a few reviews of this hotel  We must say though that we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived  The staff was friendly and helpful  The rooms were small but the space is used very efficiently  Our bed with down pillows and comforter was very comfortable  Wi fi is apparently free but there are also two public computers that one can use at any time  The hotel is only a couple blocks from Times Square but once inside the street noise is quite unnoticeable  It is also a few short blocks from Grand Central Station Radio City and Rockefeller Center  GREAT LOCATION All in all we had a superb time in NYC and thanks to the Club Quarters the accommodations made our visit even more enjoyable  
P => Great Location Clean Room Loved the Club Quarters My husband and I booked this hotel for a two night stay in NYC  After reading some of the other reviews we were a bit nervous  But I found this hotel to be very nice if a little on the smaller side  The lobby was tiny the elevators were tiny and the room was tiny  However I found the room to be very clean and comfortable  The space in the room was utilized well so we didnt feel as if we were missing any of the typical amenities found in larger rooms  The furnishings were new and comtemporary and in good repair  All the staff we worked with were quite helpfull and polite  And above all the location is FANTASTIC You are very close to several great Irish puba restaurants theaters and Times Square  We loved this hotel and would absolutely stay there again in the future 
P => Good Good Good Read the other reviews go there and have a great time My wife and I stayed here for two nights    amp  we couldnt have had a more enjoyable time  Why Our adventure is not based on the hotel      it is based on the city     and this is an outstanding location  Our room was as quiet as we needed youre in a big city the bed was way comfortable sometimes the beds have ruined our stays elsewhere and the small elevators were as charming as could be  Go ahead and stay here and have a great experience if you choose to or be grumpy and find something to complain about Buy a MetroPass and ride the subways and buses  Sooo easy and we never felt intimated nor threatened     noon or at night  
P => Tight and Tidy Out of town guests for a NYC wedding had rooms here reserved not paid for by the bridal couple  Though the room was reserved for two the rate quoted  was single at check out a  daily extra person surcharge was a disappointing surprise  The tiny elevators delivered us to a small clean Euro sleek room with a very comfortable bed  With two large windows we could view an oversized airshaft  We heard no street noise or any through the walls  The heat and AC system was below average noise  Two phones one cordless was handy  After having to appeal the dress code to management after one of our party was stopped for wearing denim slacks we found our table of twelve to be the only customers in the  seat restaurant which serves only hotel guests and other club members  Sevice was slow and erratic quality also mixed and I had to follow up to get the   discount which had been offerred  We enjoyed the living room with a bar newspapers and free internet  I also found staff mixed in ability and interest  Great location  As for the complaint another posted about coffee at the continental breakfast wait staff delivers it to the table in silver thermal pots  At least they did when we were there  Spacious shower no tub  With only a freestanding wardrobe and one drawer dont plan on unpacking for more than a weekend  I liked the closet in the hall with extra pillows blankets ironing boards  A handy solution to the small room limitation  
P => Great Locale Not So Great People I stayed at the Club Quarters Midtown for five days for training in New York City  My training was located on th Street amp th Ave So the Club Quarters walk was not too far away from th Street  Though in the thick of winter is could be brutal  The locations excellent near Times Square walkable to Rockefeller Center  I even walked to Central Park twice  I saw couple of shows during my free time   Chicago and Hot Feet  There are several Duane Reade stores nearby for quick refreshment or personal care items  Plenty of food places too The rooms very small and simple The only smaller room I was in was in Tokyo Japan  And this was bigger but not by much  The room was clean  The bath area was clean but could use some work  The cleaning staff did a very good job  If you plan to spend a lot of time in your room or there is more than one person   its could be cramped Club Quarters features automatic checkin and checkout using your Credit Card  So there is little interaction with the staff good thing because some of them were not very helpful and not very friendly  I had to wait a bit for my prearranged towncar driver he showed up at the wrong place   hmm    My biggest complaint was my room was near an elevator and it had loudest and most annoying ringing sound whenever it reached a floor  I should have asked to be moved   but it was too tired from walking all over the city after my training class  I actually used some earplugs   so my advice is not be in room near an elevator  I think if you can get a great rate and dont plan to spend much time in your room dont need a lot of assistance then this place is alright because of the location but after several more trips to the City Id know of other places to stay now  
P => Great Location Tiny Elevators My wife and I recently returned from our first anniversary weekend in NYC where we stayed at Club Quarters Midtown  After reading the mixed bag of reviews for this location we were somewhat apprehensive  However we never spend more than sleepingresting time in any hotel we stay in and I think that makes a difference  We arrived well before check in time and had no problems storing our baggage at the hotel while we wandered around the city all morningafternoon  When we finally did check in it was a quick no nonsense process  We were lucky enough to get a penthouse room with a queen bed and a nice view of the street below  Our bags were indeed waiting for us in our room as they promised  This is where I will put in the disclaimer about the staff   if you are looking for big bright smiles and people falling over themselves to help you do not book at this location  They answered our questions and that was it  We barely even got a smirk  Fortunately we arent looking to be pampered   just for a clean air conditioned room to sleep and shower in and that is what we got  The room was in great condition everything was clean and the AC worked wonderfully although it took a little while to cool off when we arrived  The bed was very comfortable and I loved the flat screen LCD tv that was attached to our wall  They do provide ironsironing boards and hair dryers  However they  be located in a closet next to the elevator  I guess this has something to do with the fact that they cater only to employees of member businesses during the week  I will warn you that if you are the least bit claustrophobic in regular sized elevators you  want to take the stairs at this location  They can really only fit  people comfortably and there is no AC so it can get very hot coming down from the th floor  They also stop erratically  It is very odd  All my wife could think of when she rode it was quotwhat if it breaks downquot Overall we had a pleasant stay at this hotel and would most likely stay here again simply because the location on th street is unbeatable  You are three blocks away from all the hustle and bustle of TImes Square theatres and the subway   a great place to have home base  
P => Great location I was at the hotel as a guest of a NYC company  I was very impressed with the quality and cleanliness of the room and the hotel  The location is incredible  It is between th avenue and th avenue on th St  in Manhattan  That is literally two avenues away from Times Sqaure and three avenues from Grand Central Station The room was very comfortable  It was very clean and modern  The air conditioning was superior and the bathroom was very modern and clean  The only problem was that there was no safe in the room and no refrigerator  Ice was available if you traveled down to the basement  No ice machines on each floor as in a typical hotel The hotel lobby is not flashy  It is very simple however there is a beautiful loungeparlor with free internet access and printing and a bar and dining room  Weekend services seemed to be curtailedno coffee in the lobby in the a m  and no meals on the weekends  I had to go across the street for breakfast  However there was a buffetcontinental  fruitjuicebut no COFFEE in the a m on Saturday morning additional  If you go into the parlor you feel like you are in a rich mans club and expect to see gentlemen smoking cigars and reading the Times  It was a good experience with a later than usual checkout and the ability to extend checkout for relatively little extra money  
P => Location is its saving grace Ok   heres the skinny   The Good  Great location   just around the corner from Times Square   ent rooms by NYC standards  Cozy but functional   Machines were a breeze for hotel check in and check out   Wifi worked great  Also two free computers w high speed internet and printer in lobby are a plus   Great beds and pillows   very good sleep after busy days and nights in the city   Cordless phone in the room   Hotel provides microwave and fridge upon request The Bad  Smallest elevator Ive ever seen  If you have a lot of luggage good luck    Workout room is  machines in a cramped dungeon   not very inspiring   Some of the hotel staff were not exactly professional   others were fine   Based on room size be prepared to be creative on where to store luggage and belongings The hotel is ent but not close to the more popular hotels in the area  If youre willing to put up with some inconveniences this  be the place for you   but just remember   while this place is inexpensive you get what you pay for  
P => Did the Job I spent e of  making a few stops around the US and I found out about the Hotel through out internal Company site  I stayed here for  nights and to be honest with no gym or any other   luxuries I wasnt expecting much from this place The plus side  EXCELLENT Location   literally round the corner from Broadway Times Square Central Park Empire State Grand Central Station and its in the shopping district   Good Price  Friendly staff   be not the   treatment but once you get to know them theyre great and very helpful Areas that need improving  Rooms were slightly cramped   but to be honest it IS New York City at the the end of the day  Like I said I wasnt expecting much but overall I was pleasantly suprised  Even my mate who is a total pain and demands only the best when it comes to flights and accomodation was happy with the place  If youre after a cheap and cheerful stay in NY with Location Price and Cleanliness being top on the agenda for choosing a hotel Id recommend Club Quarters MidTown  To wrap things up we also stayed in the Club Quarters in San Fran and it as great 
P => Great Hotel We will go back If you are going to NYC to see a show on Broadway than this is the Hotel for you  Before our trip I looked on several different boards regarding the reviews of this hotel  Clearly there were some good and some not so good so going into our trip I didnt know what to expect  Upon arrival we were greeted in a very efficient manor and were quickly checked into our very comfortable and very clean room  All the rooms were redone a year ago so they are very modern with a flat screen  inch TV with all the normal channels and in room movie entertainment  Some of the concerns of the people who wrote previous reviews were that the room were to small  Not true They are just fine for one or two nights  Bathrooms are small but just fine for one person at a time  What also makes this hotel great is that you are located two blocks from Times Square ABC Good Morning America Studios four blocks from  Rockefeller Center and NBC Today Show Studios and all of the Broadway Theaters with in walking distance  All in all this is a great find for the price and location  Remember when you are in New York as a tourist the only time you are supposed to spend in your room is to sleep and rest up for your next adventure  The Club Quarters Hotel does that just fine 
P => Excellent location friendly staff  We willl go back  Those that say the staff is rude and unattentive at the Club Quaters on th is an outright lie  These people are some of the most friendly hotel staff I have ever experienced and I travel to NYC every month at minimum  My stays have included The Crown Plaza at th and Bdwy The otel Hotel The W at Lexington and now Club Quaters at th Street in Midtown The next person that complains about rooms being too small ought to just stay out of New York City whether it is business or pleasure  What do you folks want a nice big  sq ft palace A hotel room is for ONLY the following Sleeping Showering Shaving     and be    if you are with your significant other  Do you really need that much hotel room Come one folks its New York City Enjoy the town not the room My wife and I stayed in room   Yes the rooms are small perhaps that could be because the building itself is a historic site and when it was built  years ago people had a different perspective on overall design I have only one small gripe and that was the bed was a bit too soft  They do need to firm up the matresses a bit  We will go back 
P => A Clean Quite and comfortable place  My Husband and I stayed for  days at this hotel and find it to be the place we will return to next time in Manhattan  The front desk staff was always friendly professional helpful and courteous  The rooms are small   but very clean  The food across the street at the Manhattan Cafe is delicious A clean place is quotvery importantquot to me and hubby  The small room   who cares   we are in the room to shower dress and sleep  WERE IN NEW YORK CITY   too much to do and it doesnt include sitting in a hotel room  
P => Bad Choice I travel quite a bit for business so I had no choice when my company booked this hotel for me  The rooms are small and quite noisy  There is no conceriege service no room service or any kind of service for that matter  The staff is rude and unattentive  With so many hotels in a city this size why anyone would return to this hotel after one stay is beyond me  
P => We loved this place We stayed at the Club Quarters for four days in mid ch  after reading the reviews on this site  The hotel appears to be the clubhouse of some sort of chemistry society as evidenced by the chemical engineering journals in the lounge  We found the staff at the front desk to be friendly and helpful instructing us on the self service check in and check out procedures  When we arrived our room was not yet ready and we were shown to the small private bar and given free drinks and a comfortable place to sit  The staff enthusiastically gave recommendations for certain nearby restaurants  We were thrilled with the room  When in New York we always stay at mid level hotels and this one was flat out the cleanest and most pleasant we had ever stayed in  Although small the room appeared recently remodeled in a quothigh techquot style with a flat screen TV  We were pleased to have a small kitchenette sink fridge coffee maker  The room was stocked with several books  The free wireless internet worked flawlessly  The location is excellent  Our room seemed quite soundproofed  The only negative was that the toilet in the bathroom was very very loud when flushed  Remember to keep the bathroom door closed when flushing in the middle of the night if you dont want to violently awaken your traveling companion Anyway we will definitely stay there again  
P => Club Quarters Midtown is great value This is one of the good value stays of a trip to NYC  The rooms are smallish but well set out and comfortable   I had a standard room and it was fine but then again I was travelling alone  might be a little cramped for two and they have bigger rooms available for a price  I booked on a negotiated corporate rate of   a night and the price was definitely right     bargain accommodation given the location  It is   for my corporate rate this year but its still geat value in my book Easy walks to essentially anywhere in Manhattan   it really is that central  On Wth street between th and th Avenue is a REALLY handy location The noise wasnt a problem the heating worked fine nice to have fresh air too   you can open the windows if you like  Can be a bit tricky negotiating the halls to rooms   the hallways are narrow Never ate there but am told the dining is quite good  The lounge is a very pleasant area and yes there is internet access to check emails   mind people get a bit stressy if youre there more than a few minutes     so be brief or deal with fellow patrons blowing out at you  Desk Service   a little stiff sometimes  But for the price I was prepared to get over it    other people  find it a bit confronting  Perhaps they should dish out some happy pills to the staff they might smile more    hehehe  They were helpful but If I wanted my butt kissed Ill stay elsehwere All In all Not a bad place to flop at the end of a days sightseeing eating and drinking  It aint the Ritz   if you expect all the trimmings youll be disappointed  If you want a good reasonably priced place to stay Then youll have no problems with this place   I liked it and am going to stay there again this    
P => Worst Experience Dark and Gloomy I had made travel arrangements thur American Express Travel for Business purpose for my company  I was recommended by the agent at American Express and we had a discounted rates for our company in Manhattan New York  I had even looked it up and had a rating of  stars  With that in mine I had canceled my earlier reservation with City Club Hotel  The place I stayed was at Club Quarters on th West th street New York NY   A couple of good points were free Internet and the location was good  Here is the number of problems I had    The people at the front counter was not as friendly as I am used to when going to other hotels    The room size was good but I had early when making my reservation asked for a double bed  I ended up getting a single bed  I went to the front counter and ask for a double bed they told me they dont have double bed but they will send up a quotcotquot    The room was dark and kind of gloomy  The view was to a roof top with Heating and AC units that was running all day  I know because I heard it    The bedding on the first day was kind of dirty  And one of the pillows had blood stains on it  I happen to notice on the bed is that they dont change the bedding only if its requested due to a water conservation issue they have    The toilet seat never stayed up  I had to litteraly had to hold the toilet seat up each time I went to the bathroom    My reservation was from the th thur the th  I ended not being able to stay there I found another hotel  Club Quarters charged me an additional   plus tax for early cancellation since my reservation was for up until the th of uary    I was even bum that it didnt include a complimentary breakfast Just good luck if you plan on staying at this hotel Stan 
P => Great location great facilities not so sure about the staff I stayed here for two weeks in mid uary  I was on business My first impression was not good  The greeting given to me by the desk staff was quotcredit cardquot  It seems that the desk staff do not want to speak to you at all and are happier to direct you to the automated check in and check out machines where you insert your credit card Other than that I liked the place  The free wifi is a great bonus and the desk in the room was great with power sockets on the table top and a flat screen tv mounted on the wall  The bed was exceptionally comfortable  The shower was great with plenty of water and pressure  The rooms were kept clean  Note  dont rely on getting shower gel in the room you only get soap Some might say the rooms are small but I liked the size  There was ample hanger space and drawer space I didnt get any sort of view from my window but I was working during daylight hours so not a problem  Rooms can get cold if the weather is bad outside and it takes a bit of work to figure out how to get the aircon system to warm up in the mornings mostly I didnt bother with it The location is excellent very close to Times Square with subway links to everywhere I recommend this hotel but not for the dismissive desk staff more for the location and facilities  
P => Great hotel just know what to expect I was a little bit concerned by some of the other reviews but already booked on hotwire for  incl tax  Once there though we had few problems and loved the place  Location is perfect only a few blocks from times square one block off th ave  Lets face it New York hotel rooms are notoriously small  This hotel is no exception if you have ever stayed in a European hotel you should expect about that size  If you want a bigger room to have space you wont even use you will either wind up paying night or being in a less convenient location  That having been said you are in NY go out and do something dont stay in the room  Rooms are modern and well appointed and even include complimentary WiFi internet access  This hotel is normally not really a hotel but a membership club that has rooms  Thus there in not the usual front desk set up  Check in and check out is automated which is GREATLY more efficient although there IS someone at the desk  for any problems or questions  Staff we encountered were very friendly and let us know to call on them if there was anything we needed  The ONLY problem we had was having booked for  people on hotwire the hotel tried to saddle me with a  quotextra personquot fee because according to them quotall our room rates are based on single occupancy quot I contacted hotwire and was refunded that amount  Would definitely stay there again though  
P => Great Location Plus GREAT LOCATION Two women walking all over New York City need to feel safe and be in a convenient place  Ive been to New York before and this is about as good as it gets as far as location  Walk  block in either direction and you are on th Ave or Broadway  Walking as far as Central Park is only a  min stroll  We walked from E th St  back to Club Quartersthin an afternoon with shopping along the way  No problem  If you dont walk everywhere you can in New York you dont know what your missing  Club Quarters is clean and has a lovely lobby is quiet and I repeat in a Great location  We stayed   th  in a room with one double bedI had requested  twin but my reservation was not thru the hotel and they dont guarartee room choice  This was irritating but not the end of the world and is my only complaint  Room was very small but adequate clean and a pretty good price  for New York as the only thing we did there was bath and sleep  Front desk was helpful with ideas for lunch and dinner sent us to fabulous Italian place on th St  Cleanliness and Location are by far the most important things to me  Unless you need quotposhquot you will be quite satisfied at Club Quarters Midtown  
P => Loved Club Quarters Club Quarters in midtown NY is in a perfect location  It is quiet and quaint  The elevator and room space is small but the quietness of the room makes up for all that  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Absolutely horrible I Would never stay here again  My husband and I have traveled to New York for the past  years and I have never stayed in hotel as bad as this  The front desk staff was rude the rooms were the size of quotmatchboxesquot the shower floor was full of mildew and finding someone to help you with luggage was impossible  I was told before arrival that they offer double beds in the room in which they dontI complained about this and I was told I could leave and check out after I had already been billed  Please think before you book this hotel that by the way charges   per night or more  
P => Cozy yet comfortable Stayed at Club Quarters ober    Rooms are small but very clean and up to date  We booked the room through hotels com and received a ent rate because we booked early  As typical NYC tourists   we only needed our room for sleeping  The location is very convenient to Times Square and subway stop only  blocks away  
P => Good Value  The hotels location is great just a few blocks to broadway and midtown shopping  Rooms are rather small and there is no place to even put suitcases but its New York so the rooms are not the main focus  Otherwise its clean the furnishing is relatively new and comfortable  Service by the front desk is a little uneven and sometimes bordering on curt but otherwise for what I paid I dont have any major complaints  Other nice touches include the free computer usage and coffee in the morning  
P => Uncaring clueless staff   will not stay here again My wedding is this weekend and I have over  rooms booked at this hotel  various wedding guests and bridal party  as part of a wedding package they offer  The package includes complimentary upgrades for parents of the bride and groom  Well all I can say is stay awayAlthough parents of the groom were suppose to get upgraded to a room with queen bed and enough space for  adults room to place a rollaway bed they were put into a room with a double bed and it was actually SMALLER than the  twin bedsingle rooms that other guests were staying in This just happened tonight so after dinner we complained to the hotel manager at the front desk  First he claimed he couldnt look up the room type they were in uh hello you have the computer right there in front of you and then he tried to say they were in the right room  It was only after we pointed out the wrong bed type lack of space for the rd adult and the fact we were giving them quite a lot of business with our  rooms booked that he agreed to move them  But since it was evening the room change will have to take place tomorrow morning  Lets see what happens In addition our best man has a room reservation until Sunday but they are insisting he needs to check out and check in again on Friday   which is the day of the wedding Again terrible service complete disregard for providing customer care  Its obvious they dont care about their guests so stay away There are plenty of other affordable options in NYC  
P => A Great find in NYC Forget all the negative comments  The hotel room Directors Room was more than adequate size with new linens furniture and slick new modern bathroom  Yes the bathroom is small but very nice it reminded me of a South Beach boutique hotel bathroom  The staff was helpful and friendly  The elevators were fine  never waited more than  minute  and the hotel was sold out   I never use hotel restaurants since they are all a rip off so I cant comment  Stored my bags easily after checkout  I was allowed to check in early pm and given a nice room on the th floor  not great viewwhich didnt bother me at all  I have stayed at the Millenium Broadway around the corner and the hotel room I was given was very comparable at a much cheaper rate   per night on Columbus weekend Booked through express res I consider this hotel a great find This is not a tourist type establishment   Instead I found it to be a slick NYC boutique type hotel at a budget price  In the past I have stayed at the Millenium Broadway Algonquin The Plaza and Sofitel  I definitely will return to the Club Quarters If youre looking to be waited on hand an foot by a huge wait staff with butlers and elevator operators then stay at the Waldorf  Otherwise The Club Quarters is the place to go  
P => Beware continental breakfast ripoff If you stay at the club quarters Manhattan hotel steer clear of their continental breakfast  Unlike the rest of the civilized world they do not offer it for free nor do they make the slightest effort to inform you that it is  per person  To top that off they staff were nowhere to be found for getting some coffee and incredibly rude after I had the front desk get somebody out offer some service  A   tip was automatically slapped on the bill and again they were incredibly rude when I asked for it to be removed Theres lots of way better places to get breakfast for person  The CQ continental breakfast is a rip off  No wonder they dont have any signs or any indication that it isnt free  The setup is misleading and borderline fraud The hotel itself was fine everything in the room worked and was fairly new  
P => Great Hotel This is the third Club Quarters that I have stayed at  The others were Boston and New York Downtown  I just love Club Quarters  When you arrive you put your credit card in a machine and out comes a piece of paper with your room number  Then your pass card comes out  You need this card to activate the elevator as well as to get into your room  There is a reception desk with very friendly and helpful staff if you need assistance  My room was on the th of  floors  Very nice room  Clean quiet and nicely furnished  Fabulous flat TV attached to the wall The dining room has an excellent continental breakfast buffet for  plus tax   inclusive  A full breakfast buffet was available Mon to Friday for about   They also serve lunch and dinner but I did not have a chance to try it Free internet in the lounge and free use of two computers available for guests  Contrary to other reviews these were in use most of the time so if you need regular access to the internet you might want to bring your own laptop The location on th street between th and th Avenue is fantastic Its a great hotel  You feel safe and secure and it is cleanAndrew 
P => Perfect place to stay in Manhattan After several nights of combing the internet for reasonalbe hotels in Manhattan I ided to book CQ again  I have stayed there twice in the past  years  My sister and I had the most wonderful time  The room  have been small but very adequate for  people  The rooms were better than I remember them they  have reated  The bed was the best I have ever slept in and the linen felt like Egyptian cotton  CQ is convenient to all theaters and subway stations  We felt safe walking from the theater to the hotel even past midnight  Front desk staff was friendly and informative  The housekeeping lady was specially nice it felt like my mom was taking care of us during our stay  I definitely recommend this hotel and they deserve an excellent k  
P => Small but quality    My wife and I stayed at Club Qtrs  in Midtown NYC th St  and th Ave  for  nights  Good location  blocks to Grand Central Station or  blocks to Times Square  Our room itself was smaller however one of the better appointed rooms weve stayed in flat screen TV on the wall nice desk area and chair modern bathroom with granitelike counter plush bedding and very nice pillows very clean  And at just under  all taxes and fees included a bargain  Good check in and out system using credit card if you dont need to change card at checkout  Two computers you can use in the lounge that was nice  Wed stay there again especially at that price  We felt secure also as you need room key to use elevator  Friendly staff  
P => Good value We stayed here during the Republican convention ust   We were in a room right by the elevator which I thought would be noisy but in fact we didnt notice any noise  The room was average size for NYC but modern and very well kept  The desk staff were helpful  The elevators are quirky   only two of them and only one goes to the basement where the exercise room and vending machines are located  Also you need your room key to get on the elevator from the lobby which is a nice safety feature for what its worth  There is free internet in the lobby ish area and newspapers  This room was always empty when we were there so no problem using the computers Id recommend the place as clean and reasonably priced  
P => HAPPY Stayed here    Check in done like LAX just swipe your card in this atm like machine your room keycard is ejected from a slot then off you go to your room  The main lobby has a quiet elegance  Free internet access Requested  twin beds  I got a penthouse suite with one queen bed  Staff provided a complimentary rollaway bed  Room is small but not cramped and very very clean Shower not tub in the bathroom  Bring your own travel iron though  Considering that you are in the heart of Midtown Manhattan with Times Square  blocks from your doorstep the night rate is a steal I will stay here again and again  Ill spend the  saved for a adent dinner in SOHO  
P => Very Nice I would have given this place  stars but the shower wouldnt warm up on our second morning  Other then that the hotel was lovely  We stayed there for two nights on New Years Day  The room was small but big enough for two  It had a really nice flat screen tv and the bed was really comfy  I really liked it here  With the location and helpful staff i would recomend this place to anyone wanting a good place to stay in New York  
P => Great Location We stayed at this location from ember  to   We checked the earlier reviews and were mindful of concerns expressed as to room size and staff response  These concerns at least in our experience were groundless  This property has a superb location presuming youre looking for midtown Manhattan  Its a short stroll to fifth avenue shopping or Times square  Staff were very pleasant and helpful on the front desk  Yes the rooms are small but you should be able to get a very favourable rate through one or more of the on line booking services we were  Cdn  a night in the Christmas season  At this price we had a nicely finished room with a good queen size bed small desk area ent bathroom and thats it  Just ask yourself if youre going to be spending any significant time in the room  If youre in NYC to explore the city and just need a room to clean up and sleep in this is a good place to stay  
P => great location and value I do not know why you would stay anywhere else  This hotel is in a great location a  block from th avenue and a block and a half from Times Sqaure  We stayed for  nights and only paid  a night during the holidays  The room was small but had plenty of room for our luggage and for my husband and I  Nothing fancy but it did have a flat screen TV and free wireless internet which we used every night  The staff was accomodating and provided us with everything we needed  The bathroom was small but that would be my only concern  Our room was extremely clean and a great value for the location and what you get  
P => A Little Gem of a Hotel I stayed at CQ over the busy Christmas weekend and I was pleasantly surprised from the moment I walked in  I was struggling a bit with my luggage and someone from the front desk immediately came to my assistance  The staff is super friendly and helpful the facility is lovely and my room was ideal for one person  In addition to being handsome it was sparkling clean and quiet  The location is ideal and I consider this an incredible find 
P => Small room but very efficient use of space   good price Stayed on business and checked in late thanks to LaGuardia  Very well located hotel in NYC  External city street is in a quieter area   with no real noisy businesses around it   a definite plus in NYC  I had not stayed at a CQ before so I found check in to be very cool   they have atm like machines just like at airline check ins think like United or American that spits out your room key  Helpful staff at the front desk oriented me quickly  One strange thing on the way to the room   the hallway off the elevator required me to go through two fire doors to get to my room   felt fire safe but a bit of a hassle to get luggage through The room is small   about the width of two king beds and deep   king beds   with a small bathroom that is really well laid out with a biggish shower no tub  The bed was very comfy and long enough for me quot with good lighting and electric outlets abundant  There was a desk as I walked in that had a inch my estimate LCD TV on a retracting movable tilt mount   that you could aim to wherever you wanted to watch  Very high ceilings for a hotel room gives it more charm and looked to be plaster walls and ceiling  One window looked out on the street and office buildings  The room was very clean and the desk was efficient and stylish black  Nice toiletries and the desk even had books for reading if you needed them  The stand up shower had a nice Grohe shower corded head   very nice touch   you would think more hotels would put in these relatively cheap but nice touches   Whats missing from your typical hotel No closet   just an open hangar rack  The provided fabric covered lounge chair was not comfy so you would not want to sit in it  If I was a large person I dont think I would be comfy in the bathroom since the toilet space was tight for me  If two people were in the bed the one nearest the wall would have problems moving in the narrow space between the bed and wall An excellent value for what we paid negotiated rate on business but small size held it back from a higher rating

P => Best location We stayed from a Monday morning until the Friday evening and had no complaints With th Avenue a few seconds walk away the Rockefeller Plaza and Centre just over the road and Central Park less than ten minutes we couldnt have chosen a better location  We had already read a review telling us that the hotel was good for business or just couples not families because the rooms are small  Who plans to stay in their room much when in New York anyway Check in was quick  The hotel felt new and was really clean  The cleaning service for our room was exceptional  even though we wouldve saved on towels and re used there were clean ones daily along with new bottles of shampoo body lotion mouth wash etc etc  We didnt eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on that  only because we were always out and about though and had other plans    we didnt even ever have breakfast in the hotel   we were drawn to the Concourse level of the Rockefeller for breakfast on several occasions  as such a good variety and brilliant places to sit watching the world go by  We had poured over SO many ideas for a New York hotel but in the end picked one that was ideal  
P => Club Quarters Got a awsome deal at Priceline com only paid half the price  Very good location  Nice and clean rooms  
P => sublime excellent facilities cosy and well maintained  very business like functional  the space is managed very well and the gym was good too 
P => Great location tidy clean and friendly helpful staff  Had a lovely little room on rd floor overlooking st street with views towards the west broadway south rockefeller and west st  patricks church  Bedroom and bathroom were small but seems that is the norm for NY  But we only needed it for sleeping in and it was clean and cleaned well every day Always had  staff on the front desk and they were very helpful and friendly at all times  There is a lovely diningbar on the th floor with a covered outside heated balcony facing over towards Rockefeller Centre   ideal if you want to have a drink and a smoke too not many places left like that aroundJohnny Utahs barclub is next door  Apparently it gets noisy didnt go there and heard nothing from the rd floor just the usual hum of NY Broadway is just  blocks west and a  minute walk fantastic location Seems there is a combination of business and leisure travellers Club Quarters will arrange a taxi to JFK for   Not bad especially as you  end up getting a stretch limo like we did Would go back here again  
P => great location modern and convenient Situated across the street from Rockefeller Center this hotels provides great access to local attractions public transportation and an easy walk to th Ave  stores and Times Square area  Room prices were very reasonable  night and hotel amenities were excellent  Highly recommended and would stay there again without hesitation  
P => Great rooms with excellent customer service Cannot be beaten for comfort customer service and location  
P => Amazing location My boyfriend and I stayed here in ember of  and I could not have been more pleased with our hotel choice The city was orated beautifully for the holiday season and staying at this hotel allowed us to be within walking distance of many wonderful sights  If you step outside the hotel and walk about  steps to the left you can see The Tree at Rockefeller Center you can also look down the street to the left and see St  Patricks Cathedral and the other way to the right and see Radio City Music Hall  In addition the hotel is right across the street from the FDNY Fire Zone Store    my boyfriend a soon to be firefighter was very impressed with this  I on the other hand enjoyed the close proximity to th Ave   The room itself was wonderful for the two of us    plenty of space and a comfy bed We also enjoyed the free water bottles and the staff was always more than willing to give us directionshelp us with anything we needed We would definitely stay here again and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be in the heart of NYC  
P => Great location clean comfortable rooms  Just spent  nights in NYC at Club Quarters Rockefeller Center  Couldnt ask for a more convenient location Radio City Music Hall Rockefeller Center Fifth Ave  Central Park St  Patricks Cathedral  Room was small but well organized clean quiet except for closing doors nearby comfortable bed  Elevators were quirky but not intolerable  First hotel Ive ever stayed at where housekeeping staff left thank you note for tips  Appreciated free computers available for printing boarding passes and checking email  Would definitely stay there again  
P => convenient location great price Yes the rooms are small but Ive stayed in smaller hotel rooms that cost more  Importantly the room was clean bed was comfy AC worked there was good water pressure and the bathroom was unexpectedly large for a NYC hotel  And the price is unbeatable for the location   convenient for the midtown financial center Rockefeller Center and the subway  Check in couldnt have been easier with the self serve kiosks  I missed it until my last day there but theres a cute little lounge and restaurant with roof terrace too  
P => Great Hotel Great Location Clean quiet close to everything   we did mostly walking and subway trips  Our stay there was a total pleasure we had no problems with the check in the staff was curteous and helpful  The price we got for  nights was quite incredible for NYC especially considering the location the cleanliness and the comfort it provided  Added bonus MoMA is just a block away as is Top of the Rock   best view of the city  
P => Use for location and price Stayed for  nights and found this Club Quarters it offers excellent value and perfectly good quality rooms if a little on the small size  The location is hard to beat though the entrance off the street is unimpressive  Dont bother with the barrestuarant New York has plenty of good places except to use the free internet  Try to get an upper floor the higher the better as there can be a bit of street noise if you are facing onto it  
P => Spacious respite for a business traveler well appointed but a little noisy I stayed two nights for business here  I found the room to be unbelievably spacious for a midtown hotel  Ive stayed at other Club Quarters locations before and have always found their rooms to be well appointed  I had a small sink fridge small cupboard and ample desk and living space  Bathroom was clean shower pressure and temperature were excellent  The bed was very comfortable with many pillows some with different firmness I really like this in hotels and I found the best one for me  One of my biggest pet peeves is curtains that dont close all the way allowing too much light in  However it was pitch dark when I woke up at  for work thanks to the curtains I did have some trouble getting to sleep as I believe theres a nightclub right next door  I found to be very annoying as my room was shaking every so often to the beat of the music  I highly recommend you ask for a higher floor  I was on the second floor and it was VERY noisy  Luckily I was dead tired and passed out and it wasnt an issue The lounge on the th floor is very inviting and relaxing  After my meetings I unwound with a cocktail and read the paper in front of their TV they have up there  It was not crowded and the service was very attentive  I didnt eat in the restaurant so I cant comment on that  The only thing I found odd is that I didnt have an iron in my room  I had a dress shirt I needed to iron out and even the more basic hotels ive stayed in midtown manhattan have irons  be its to encourage you to use their laundry service  No bother I improvised and ran the hot water to steam up the bathroom and that got the wrinklkes out of my shirt Also their internet WORKS in the room and its FREEYou can not go wrong with staying here for the location professional service and value  
P => Good Catch for a Great Price Looking for a inexpensive yet good hotel room always seems to be a challenge in NYC However after staying at the Club Quarters in Rockefeller Center I have to say I was very impressed and satified with my stay  Location is great front desk got us in our room very quickly not to mention they were very pleasant  The room was very modern and clean  A bit small and very business like however would still stay here over and over again  
P => Great Location Great Good little hotel  Great location  Good size rooms for NY  Nice terrace bar with views over rockefeller centre radio city and st patricks Menu looked good but only had breakfast which was fine  Would stop again  
P => very good hotel The hotel is very friendly  Has a terrace with a church view and very good cuisine  Computers with internet free water at the corridors and a great staff  I only miss a frigobar  Great location in front the Rockefeller Center and near Times Square  I will be back  
P => Great Location This was a great location for New York City  Just off the hustle and bustle of Times Square but closer enough to be in the thick of it within minutes  The Rockefeller Centre is seconds from the hotel and close to the Subway station too Staff were friendly and seemed helpful enough  Rooms were compact but very comfortable and clean Would definitely consider this hotel again on my return NYC  
P => Great location clean room but not good for a long stay We stayed here for  nights and had never visited New York before  The location was excellent as within walking distance to major attractions  The one drawback was the lack of cupboard space for two of us although we just about managed  This hotel is used by a lot of business travellers so fine for couples but I dont think ideal for children  We stayed on the th floor which was generally quiet but the extractor fan in the bathroom did not switch off  Despite this we were very happy with our choice of hotel and thought it to be very good value  
P => Perfet for Business Travel This hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to many of the main attractions in Midtown  The room was beautiful and clean  The bathroom has a makeup mirror hair dryer and there was a removable shower head with great water pressure  The only complaint would be at the Terrace Club restaurant where the service was very slow and the tip was automatically added to the bill regardless of the number of people in your party This hotel is perfect for single travelers or couples who are looking for a classy hotel without worrying about children or loud room parties bothering them Note Most of the rooms only have one bed  If you would like  beds only singletwin beds are available in rooms with no view on the lower floors of the hotel  
P => Clean good value central position I booked this hotel both through Expedia com and Orbitz com for an average of   a night  It is in the same building of the Rockefeller Center Hotel and they share the lobby and reception excet that the Club Quarters is at the highest floors the plus less noise coming from the street the minuslonger time waiting for the  elevators  I stayed both ate the Rockefeller Center Hotel and at the Club Quarters and my stay was better at the former  In Rockefeller Center Hotel I had microwave and refrigerator in my room and a big LCD TV  In Club quartes the view was better but the TV smaller and no other facilities  The plus is that in Club quarters you have  desktop workstations that you can use  In Rockefeller Center Hotel you have just one  
P => Perfect Location Just spent a one night but it was the perfect place to spend the one night  Room was small   but heh all rooms under  in New York are small  But the room was well appointed clean and comfortable  The bathroom was clean  No tub but a good size shower  And the room was quiet   you didnt know you were in the middle of NY The view from our room   OMG   St  Patricks to the east and the rink at  Rock to the south For the traveler who drives into the city the parking arrangement was perfect   discount parking at a garage  blocks away   two when you walk through the MOMA courtyard and another building The restaurantbar in the hotel was a great place for afternoon cocktails and snack before heading off to dinner and Lincoln Center  And the breakfast the next morning was reasonably priced and good We felt like we found a diamond in the rough with this hotel  
P => Location    but nothing else Stayed here for  nights in ch   in a premium room means larger but just as spartan What was good  As everybody else says locationWhat was bad Room reminded me of Belgrade early s  VERY basic  Not that large rather very high ceiling Very noisy  All premium rooms are in first  floors so street noise and from Cowboy themed restaurant next door is unbearable at times The Terrace might be a great spot in the Summer just tired and sad when I went Altogether poor value for money there is much better for  in low season  
P => GREAT location This small hotel is in midtown Manhattan  We had a view of Rockefeller Skating Rink from our window  We stayed in a standard queen room which was small but clean and comfortable  We requested extra pillows and washcloths and these were delivered within  minutes  No concierge but front desk staff available for questionsrecommendations   Hotel is within walking distance of SO many things Broadway Times Square th Avenue Central Park etc  The location made all the difference in our long NYC weekend  There is a small delicoffee shop next door and we picked up bagels and fruit for breakfast in the AMs  I would highly recommend this hotel on its location alone  Saved us a lot in cab fares 
P => Excellent Location   Excellent Service My husband and I stayed at Club Quarters on a last minute trip to NYC  What a great find  We were on the same block as Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall two blocks from St Patrick Cathedral and six blocks from Central Park  The rooms are small but very well laid out  I didnt feel confined at all we even had a crib in the room Check in was smooth and quick and the staff was incredibly friendly  There is parking  blocks away that is validated for only  for  hours A few blocks away is the Heartland Brewery  An excellent place for dinner  Their selection of handmade beer is great  Overall we really enjoyed this hotel and would definetly stay again 
P => good location Brilliant location for a NY hotel  rooms were small but were comfortable  Flat screen tv and modern or and bathrooms were beautiful  We paid   for one week for the two of us  this was considerably pricey considering breakfast was not included  We went to the restaurant on the middle floor for lunch on the first day  it came to  and we gave  and the waiter took the pleasure of tipping himself the  himself  We didnt eat there again  i have no problem with tipping just i would like to do it myself  Breakfast was an additional   The location is fantastic and we had a fabulous holiday but breakfast should have been included for the price  there was vending machines and free bottoled water as well as room service on demand including every takeaway ou would wish  the hotel was fantastic and i would stay there again but would not eat in the restaurant out of principal  
P => Best Location small bedroom and poor service The best location in NY We went at christmas time so was the best place to stay small room but average for the city don t expect much from service very cold and away  Overall was fair enough  
P => Great   no complaints Great location and service  Comfortable clean quiet room  Would stay there again 
P => Perfect location for a busy trip We stayed here for  nights over New Year I have written a arate review about Bubba Gumps restaurant where we spent NYE and were very impressed  We took a taxi from La Guardia which cost about US but that includes a good tip as the driver was great and also being stuck in traffic as the hotel is as you would expect right next to the Rockefeller Centre and there were huge crowds there to see the tree and skating rink  The hotel arranged a car to take us to JFK when we left as it was a  am start and that was US plus tip The location is perfect easy walking distance from the Top of the Rock th Avenue Broadway Times Square and the south end of Central Park  We took a hop on hop off bus tour picked up at Times Square which took us to all the major sights in south Manhattan including the Statue of Liberty and Wall Street and also did the Uptown loop which took us the entire way round Central Park and through Harlem  US each valid for  hours for the tickets and we could have done more trips but didnt have the time so good value The room was clean and had everything we needed for a nice comfortable stay including free and easy to connect to which was a rarity on our trip wi fi good coffee and a ent shower  There is also access to free drinking water and the hotel provide water bottles next to the water so you can take it to your room which was a really good idea Our room overlooked the skating rink at Rockefeller Plaza too which was a nice touch th floor   room   No real road noise although there were taxi horns going all night but thats the hazard of staying in the centre of the city The staff were pleasant and helpful and unlike other places Ive recently read about didnt always have their hands out for a tip which was good  Makes you feel more like leaving one There is a barrestaurant right next door called Johnny Utahs which at first glance looks like it  be a bit dodgy but I would highly recommend it even for families   theres nothing in there to upset or offend kids and there were families in there  The food was excellent the texas brisket is a must try the staff friendly and helpful and the atmosphere relaxed  Plus the beer was good Both the bar and the hotel were a great place to escape to after a hectic day sightseeing and we would definitely stay there again  
P => Brilliant Location perfect if you dont want masses of facilities I will keep my review to the hotel itself and write a erate review on the holiday We booked this hotel through ebookers and got a ent price they are worth checking out  We never had any issues as I have before with Expedia or having to make sure our reservation was sent through from Expedia which was great I had previously read reviews there arent loads of reviews like there are for other hotels but all the ones there were seemed to give it a good solid thumbs up When we arrived we were early and our room was not ready so we handed in our cases and were told to come back in an hour  We headed off to explore for a little while until the room was ready  First thing that struck me was that the location was absolutely brilliant in the middle of everything just a short walk from Central Park Theatre District and are on Rockefellers doorstep and Radio Citys  There were some good places to eatdrink nearby and a handy bar called Johnny Utahs right next door which if it takes your fancy has a roadeo bull you can have a go onBack at the hotel the room was ready as assured and when we got to the room were pleasantly surprised  I have stayed in NY many times and am used to the shoe box rooms you can pay through the nose for so was very happy with our room which I felt was compact but absolutely fine and very modern and clean  There was a menu in the room which you could order from  and the hotel have it delivered to you this was from outside restaurants  We should mention here that there is a diner called Big Daddys Diner on Lexington downtown which will deliver  hours on Fridays and Saturdays we ate in the Diner and the food was great so can highly recommend it There is a terrace bar on the th floor which is also a small restaurant and whilst we didnt eat there we had a drink  Like all hotel bars it was a tad on the pricey side but we expected that  The menu for breakfastlunchdinner looked ent enough and not too bad price wise but there are FAR cheaper options just around the corner  A good diner nearby was Applebys which if you walk westward on st Street across an avenue on the corner there is Eileens Stardust diner DO NOT GO HERE   ABSOLUTE CRAP bust a right at this corner and walk up this avenue and look to your left and youll see it good food good price There is a fitness room which we didnt really look at but heard people say it was ok nothing amazing but fine and they will even deliver fitness equipment to your room on request free which I thought was great We wanted a late check out and for  you could have the room til pm which suited us great so we did that  Check in and out was an absolute breeze I loved this hotel it was exactly what I needed I was more than happy with their room service menu which I felt was better than most big hotels and I was absolutely chuffed that we found this place  If you are looking for a very clean comfortable and modern place to stay and dont mind not having the big hotel facilities like swimming pools big gyms and big bars and restaurants and are happy with the relatively small barrestaurant facilities the bar was never really busy and small workout room then you will absolutely feel like youve won the lottery here  Again the best part was the location I would only stay here in future that is a promise  
P => Great Location My dhter and I always try to visit NY around the holidays to take in the sites and visit the holiday fairs going on  This year the hotel prices were pretty high so we ided to try the Club Quarters using friends of a business associate  We were pleasantly surprised at the location   directly across from the tree in Rockefeller Center and of course half block from all the great shops on th Ave  The room  was small   but my dhter and I believe that we have stayed in smaller and as it was only for the one night it was not an issue  The bed was small and I know that I had asked for two beds but when I called the desk I was told that was never a guarantee and they supplied a roll a way  Not exactly what I had envisioned but we went with it   no alternative really  The bathroom was small   no bathtub   but what more do you need besides the basic necessities  We did not use but did go to see the Terrace Club and it is a beautiful place with comfortable chairs around a fireplace flat screen TV a beautiful bar and tables on an outdoor enclosed patio for year round dining  We were there on a Sunday and everything closed early    PM   and we were still out shopping so we missed the club  The hotel does have a great deal   they have about  restaurants with different foods that deliver for a nominal charge of    We returned to the hotel at    contacted the deli   ordered food and it was delivered within the  minute time frame  This was a definite perk in our book   and really NOT expensivedelivered hot and very good Also the fitness room was adequate and the free bottled water on the floors is also a great perk I dont know how the rooms would measure up in other cities if they are the same size as this one but for New York   and what we have seen at other chain hotels   this was comfortable clean great location and easy check in and check out all computerized 
P => Fantastic Hotel I stayed at the Club Quarters Hotel for  nights from the th ember with my partner  We both thought the hotel was great it was in the perfect position just a  minute walk from Central Park and a  minute walk to Times Square  The receptionists were very helpfull always suggesting somehwere new to go and they also made restaurant reservations for us Id read some of the other reviews about the rooms but I have to say ours was spacious with plently of cupboard space the bathroom was clean and had everything that we needed could of done with a dust though If we were to visit New York again wed definately stay here compared to some of the other places id stayed in the city this was  times betterIf you see reception they will also provide you with discount ickets to some of the major attractions  
P => best location ever We have just returned from a short break in new york staying at club quarters  This hotel is in a fantastic location the best you can get  It is modren and clean  Rooms are a good size in relation to new york room sizes  Ice stating and radio city accross the road  Staff are very frendly and helpful and will assist you with any questions Stayed on sixth floor you will need your room key to operate the lift  Had breakfast in terrace club was well worth a visit for views of st patricks but food was a little cold  Had dinner in johnny utas two nights  Food fab athmosphere very good  Very busy stop mid week with local office workers  The main attraction of johnny utas was the rodeo which was great fun to watch All the sights of new york within walking distance of club quarters time square empire state building macys  Fifth ave  seconds walk  Mostly did shopping in jearsy gardens outlets fantastic bargins to be had  Just get bus from port athority  street on  ave route  bus   well worth a visit Will def stay in this hotel again  enjoy new york    
P => No better place to stay                My wife and I visited New York City from tember    th for our th anniversary  I ve been to NYC only once before and this was to be my wife s first visit I booked a package deal leaving out of Buffalo on Delta Airlines and staying at the Club Quarters   Rockefeller for three nights  Flight was non eventful however when we touched down at JFK we sat grounded for a half an hour waiting for a spot to park the plane and off load  I booked SuperShuttle for the transfer to the hotel horrible    dont book Super Shuttle   Because it was rush hour and the fact that it was Fashion Week in NYC and the Fashion Rocks show was being held at the Radio City Music Hall directly across the street from our hotel it was tough getting to our hotel We finally pulled up close to the hotel only to see barricades cops and paparazzi all over the place  We managed to navigate ourselves through the crowd and into the lobby immediately asking the hotel receptionist what all the fuss was about  She told us that the stars of the Fashion Rocks show as getting dressed at the hotel  Not more then  minutes later out of the elevator pops Miley Cyrus right past us and into an awaiting Hybrid Escalade for the two minute drive to the red carpet at the Radio City Music Hall After Miley it was celebrity after celebrity   Blondie Debra Harry Pussycat Dolls Naomi Campbell Ashanti etc  We missed Fergie and Carrie Underwood but apparently they were there too Welcome to New YorkWe finally got to our room on the th floor and were pleasantly surprised  The room was relatively small but it was clean and well appointed  The Club Quarters offers free purified water and bottles to enjoy at your leisure machine happened to be just outside our door  We had a queen sized bed which was nice  The sheets were crisp and the bed was comfortable Because the room was small we didnt have alot of space to store the luggage however we had just enough so that we didnt trip over everything each time we came into our room The staff were very accomodating and helpful and when asked to provide directions they often looked it up on the internet and printed information for you right on the spot  They also have maps and umbrellas should you need them The bathroom was nicely orated and big enough for two to get ready in  Shower was good plenty of hot water and good pressure  We wanted to have a drink or a snack on the th floor terrace however the afternoon we tried they were setting up for a wedding reception that evening    we didnt get back again to give it a try We absolutely loved the location of the hotel  Sure the lobby was somewhat small and the hotel was relatively non descript from the outside but you couldnt beat the location in our opinion  There was so much going on in the city the weekend we were there Fashion Week Fashion Rocks show US Open Tennis on and on  Accross the road in the Rockefeller Centre they had a stadium like set up for the tennis tournament taking place just down the road at Flushing Meadows  In the square they had natural grass stadium seating and a huge big screen tv showing the tennis matches  There were many people sitting and watching during the day in the beautiful sunshine and also in the lovely evening under the stars Subways were very close by to take you anywhere in NY you wanted to go  Shopping was just around the corner th ave while others like Macys were just a  minute commute by subway Times Square and Broadway was a few minute walk away and St  Patricks church just around the corner it was amazing I highly recommend this hotel for location price cleanliness and customer service  You wont go wrong it  
P => Club Quarters Rockefeller Center   What a find There s really a lot to like about this little Manhattan hotel  It s not for everyone of course if grandiose spaces and luxe treatment by dedicated staff at every turn are your thing you won t enjoy it  But if you like being in a well designed safe clean quiet practical brilliantly located and excellently priced hotel this is the place for you  Note however that the hotel requires institutional membership and I believe it is not open to the general public  However a large and growing number of companies and other organizations like universities etc  do have memberships that permit employees to book at any Club Quarters for business or personal stays  The building is unassuming from the street and your cab driver will not have heard of Club Quarters look for the small dark awning to identify it right next to Johnny Utah s restaurant no relation to CQ  The hotel is just around the corner from the HampM on th Avenue and West st nestled between Banco Popular and Bank of America  It s also a quarter of a block from Rockefeller Plaza and across from Radio City Music Hall  There s no door man and the lobby and front desk while attractive are functional and far short of pompous  The staff   usually two people behind a tiny desk   are well trained and helpful check in was swift and uneventful the way you want it  There is no concierge the desk staff does their best with  getting there  instructions and will store luggage but I don t believe they make dinner reservations or book tours and the like Mine was a  club room  with one comfy double bed little tables good reading lamps a small open wardrobe like piece of furniture with drawers and shelves a ent sized desk with all kinds of computer hookups a window that opened several inches for fresh air yay and an ergonomic task chair but no easy chair as some of CQ s Website photos  There simply isn t room the footprint is quite small though well laid out and just fine for one or two people for a few nights  There is no mini bar but instead there is a room service menu of extremely reasonably priced mini bar type treats no alcohol though as I recall that will be delivered for just   which is nothing short of amazing for Manhattan  There are the usual coffee maker and packets of lousy coffee and a tea bag on the desk  Climate control is exceptionally effective and the thermostat was within reach of the bed  There are no ironboard in the room but they can be provided on request  TV reception is good channel choices only fair  There are internet options galore including three PCs and two B amp W laser printers for use for free at the Terrace Restaurant  The bathroom is excellent with a large walk in shower could use some fresh grout granite counter and just enough room for one s stuff  Hot water is abundant and comes up right away the hand held shower is terrific  Hair dryer shampoo conditioner and a couple of nice soaps are provided  I found the hotel to be exceptionally quiet the only disturbance was the occasional slam of my neighbors  doors as the auto closers are pretty robust  Otherwise with window closed there s no outside noise and I don t know if it s the arrangement of the rooms on the floors or the particular clientele or what exactly but I never heard voices through the walls or from the halls  There were some especially endearing features about this Club Quarters   There s a shelf over the desk with a couple of books most interestingly  Great Fortune The Epic of Rockefeller Center  by Daniel Orkent  I ended up hanging out at RC a lot as the weather was great and especially all of the magnificent period art orating the buildings really piqued my curiosity and the trip to  The Top of the Rock  was worth every cent of the  ticket for a magnificent view of Manhattan all around and beyond    The room sported one of the nicest hotel clock radios ever  Instructions for setting the alarm were perfectly clear thank you very much and there were pre sets for classical pop news though the radio was fully tunable as well    In the hall on several floors are cold filtered water dispensers and refillable plastic bottles  How fabulous is that The th floor Terrace Room is open for three meals every day  I only had breakfast there which includes a choice of continental fresh fruit and pastries for  or for  you can also get eggs and a couple of other hot choices  Both include juice and coffee  The terrace itself is very nice for al fresco dining with a good view of the spires of St  Patrick s Cathedral a half block away  Note however that the restaurant is run by a concessionaire and for some reason they require a special key card to access the th floor that expires every midnight  You have to go down to the front desk and request a new card every morning which is a tad annoying  But above all the price is absolutely right  I couldn t find anything anywhere in mid town that came within  of what I paid for such perfect lodging at Club Quarters  Id stay there again in a heartbeat 
P => Brilliant Just come back from this lovely hotel Ive been to NY before and the room I had in The Pennsylvania Hotel was shocking but I was so susrprised at the club quarters it was very clean tastefully orated and had nice touches like free bottled water and a nice LCD tv However saying that you wont spend much time at all there as this is New York after all and we just spent our time out exploring The Location is A with Fifth Av around the corner and plenty of subway stations to take you elsewhere  The breakfast at the hotel is fine and is worth a visit to sit outside on the roof top balcony it has free internet in the bar too I will without doubt come back and stay here it exceeded my expectations and I was happy with the service 
P => Absolutely fabulous Absolutely loved the location of this tiny hotel Staff was super friendly and nice  Room was small but perfect for a weekend getaway  Highly recommend 
P => Good location small but clean I stayed in this hotel for  nights with my girlfriend  The location is excellent and while small its nice clean and the reception staff are very helpful  Only downside was that the reception staff booked us a car to take us to Newark airport telling us it would cost  including bridge tolls  When we arrived at the airport the driver asked for an additional  to pay for the tolls  Im not sure whos misunderstanding this was but its worth clarifying when booking a car  Otherwise all excellent  
P => Just OK I stayed at this CQ property for  days  Overall the hotel was just ok  To be honest I expected alot more from a hotel of this sorts Pluses Location location location  Right in front of rockefeller centre and the subway line  The little resto next door Teresas was awesome Very clean  Minuses The beds were aweful the springs were coming up in ours  Poor pillows  Holes in the bed linens the first day  No front desk or concierge to help in planning  
P => Stay Away STAY AWAYSpent  nights on a business trip They try to make this place appear a quotprivatequot club for businessmen  Its instead nothing more than a budget hotel UPs location in front of the rockefeller plazafree wi fi in roomflat tv in room but it s so unexpensive todayDONWS rooms smallsmelly bathrooms drain odorsno pressure in showerno safety box in roomlobby is miserable and super smallgym is a hot closet with poorest equipmentonly  elevators   queueing time sheets with holes although they changed them on request 
P => A great hotel Just left the Club Quarters Rockefeller Center after a  night stay  I wont stay anywhere else in NY now Our party consisted of myself amp my husband and  sons ages  amp   We had booked  rooms a quotqueen loftquot with a kitchenette for  for ourselves and a standard room  double bed for   Both rooms had  foot ceilings making the rooms feel extremely spacious  Our quotqueenquot room actually had a king bed and the standard room had a queen bed  The square footage was more than adequate extremely roomy Very upscale feel to the or     very comfortable beds our king bed came with  down pillows The rooms were very quiet except for the first night when some jackhammering was being done on the front sidewalk  The Terrace Club on the th floor has incredible outdoor views of St  Patricks Cathedral Rockefeller Center and Radio City  The location of this hotel cant be beat The only down side was the lobby    miniscule and non descript     but who cares The lobby did not reflect the quality of the guest rooms at all  There are only  or  quotQueen loftquot rooms it was really nice to have the fridge microwave and bar sink  Highly recommended 
P => What A Location Well what can I say found this place on Orbitz and was a little dubious but pleasantly surprised but both location staff efficiency and friendliness  The room was smaller than average but ideal for my fiance and I to spend a few days in NYC  Location was superb just behind Rockefelleer and between th and th Avenues Radio Ci ty was across the street and during the NFL Draft but noise was minimal and disruption non existant  We didnt eat in the Club such is NYCs variety of restaurants but it did look appealing and clean One slight sour note whjen booking a twon car for our trip back to JFK two hotel front desk employees give us two different prices along with a third different price given to us and charged by the town car driver  Quite frustrating especially when everybody sees it as their right to include a tip  But as for the hotel recommended and would not hesitate to stay there again  
P => Perfect Location my friendi went shopping to new york for a weekendstayed in club quaters rockefeller center it was the perfect hotel for what we wanted its only  minutes walk from th avenueabout  minutes walk or less from times square the staff were very helpful the rooms were very cleanthe linentowels were changed every day definitely will be going back to them again next year lovely restaurant next door with brilliant atmosphere loads of cafesrestaurantsshops either side of the hotel chemist next door for any items you  have forgotten  hour reception a lovely portervery helpful 
P => Our NYC hotel of choice Love this place  My husband comes to NYC at least once a month on business and Ive worked for many years in the city in PRevent planning so the both of us have seen our share of hotel rooms  Here are the reasons that Club Quarters is our hotel of choice  free easy wireless internet access  comfortable ENT sized rooms compared to similar priced hotels in the city  free bottled water vs   bottles of Voss Ive had to pay at other places  convenient location   if youre a shopper this hotel is in the heart of the th Ave shopping district  convenient business services  a great quotterracequot dining room   perfect for meeting up with friends for a quick bite or drinks  rooms are new and clean   my husband likes the masculine look of the room  its got everything you need for an NYC visit who comes to NYC to spend time in their hotel rooms anyway  prompt positive service by the folks downstairs  has all the amenities of a modern hotel but at the cost of a budget hotel the one bad   the headboard had some ks on there that made it look a little dirty but its a minor complaint all the other aspects that we love Its not a lot to ask for but Ive stayed at much quothipper coolerquot places here that dont have in room coffee desks or even a ent place to hang your clothes  If youre visiting NYC on your own dime this is an ideal place for the price  
P => good location Room was not a little small the bed as well and had no view at all but it was clean had a good bathroom and the location was perfect for our  day NY trip  th avenue and central park are around the corner and around the other corner you can walk to times square amp the empire state building  Around the third corner you find Rockefeller center subway with just one stop away from connections to the other lines  Will I stay again in the hotel on another stay    I think I might although I will explicitly ask for a room located at the front so you have a view and a larger bed 
P => Fabulous Location Great Hotel My fiancee and I stayed at this hotel last weekend  This is our first ever trip into the City and the location of this hotel couldnt have been better  Rooms are small but okay for us  Youre not in your rooms too much in NYC  The food at the Terrace Club was great pricey but really tasty  Great Service by the staff of the hotel  Again location was the key and this place was the best  We had great views of the Rockefeller Plaza and watched people ice skate while we were in our hotel room  Great bar located next door as well  This stay was given to us by my mother as a ChristmasBirthday gift for the two of us so Im not sure how much she paid for the rooms nightly but I am sure it was definitely worth every penny  We cannot wait to go back  
P => A Comprehensive Review of the Club Quarters   Rockefeller Center NYC The Club Quarters   Rockefeller Center is geared toward business or solo travelers  The rooms are small the hotel is unassuming  The entrance is just to the left of Johnny Utah s a popular eaterybar on st Street  Except the flags hanging above the entrance you might miss this hotel The lobby is extremely small as far as most lobbies are concerned  About the size of a guestroom it is large enough to fit a check in podium a loveseat with glass coffee table and an armchair  The rooms are also small though most rooms in New York City are  Most rooms if not all at the Club Quarters   Rockefeller Center feature one comfortable double bed with upgraded linens and warm down comforters  A workspace with complimentary Internet access and computer hookups is provided  A small armoire  closet  contains two drawers about  inches of hanging space and a few  inch wide shelves opposite the hanging space  Tiled bathrooms include granite vanities a magnifying makeup mirror and good lighting  Doors to the bathrooms are frosted glass and you can hear everything so if you re sharing a room please keep this in mind  However it s important to note that I could not hear neighbors   so walls between rooms must be well insulated  The bathroom contained a shower only with good water pressure which was arated from the toiletsink area by raised tile and a tastefully designed shower curtain  Complimentary toiletries included a soap bar a combo shampooconditioner and one other thing   be a small bottle of lotion though I can t be certain Windows slide horizontally to open though only open about five inches wide  From my room I could see the ice skating rink and twinkling lights at Rockefeller Center Though the room is small be  x  total including the bathroom the space is used efficiently  The chrome and dark cherrywood finishes give the room a more contemporary feel  I d definitely stay here again especially for the price   it s a steal The location is on st Street sandwiched between th and th avenues  It is central to Rockefeller Center just across the street Fifth Avenue shopping one half block away and St  Patrick s Cathedral one half block away gothic architecture and beautiful  It is also within walking distance of Times Square  TIP  Be sure to take advantage of the complimentary refillable water bottles   available on floors  and   TIP  If you re unfamiliar with New York City pick up one of the complimentary tourist booklets in the lobby  The booklets have several great maps   with one large fold out map   of the city  
P => Club Quarters Rockefeller Centre Rocks I have stayed at the Club Quarters Midtown a couple of times prior to this stay and found it very good   I book at a corporate rate and find it extremely good value On this occasion I departed from the norm having noted this property on my Companys intranet hotel guide   sounded a little nicer than Midtown I booked a studio room which for another  or so bucks offered a room approximating a ent size room in other major cities NYC hotel rooms normally make broom closets look like luxury  It had a little kitchette as well with a fridge for my beer which I liked  It was modern and clean  bed was uber comfy as well Very easy to get anywhere as the subway was at the Rockefella centre   liked that alot  An easy walk to Central Park and Times Square  restaurant row was spitting distance and if you were too tired after a long day of sight seeing you could order from a selection of home delivery meals   the Chinese was awesome worth a try if you need a night in All in all I can highly recommend this property  its handy tidy and staff are rekably helpful something that was lacking in the staff at the Midtown property  Ill be doing myself a favour next time Im in NYC and staying at Club Quarters Rockefeller Centre  First rate digs trust me  
P => Absolutely perfect   REALLY There arent enough superlatives for this hotel PERFECT location very friendly helpful staff rich linens and pillows shiny bathroom that was just the right size     there was nothing I didnt like  Will definitely stay again and it was one third the price of where I stayed a month ago that was  blocks away  
P => Location location location A friend of mine booked this hotel as part of a package for a NYC trip from Christmas to New Years  Having never heard of it I was a bit dubious  The location is right across from Rockefeller Center and Radio Center Music Hall which can be very congested especially at Christmastime but is also a prime spot for jumping off and sight seeing  St  Patricks is right around the corner as is th Avenue  There is a subway station nearby so if youve never been to NYC this is a great location  The rooms were average sized for NYC but the bathrooms were absolutely tiny  The hotel staff was very accommodating and friendly  They offer free bottled water which is a nice bonus  There is a nice desk space in the rooms so it would be convenient for a business traveler  Overall this is a great value for the money  I would recommend it to first time NYC visitors in a heartbeat 
P => Fantastic  definately recommend Having found a great deal  week   incl  flights for New Years thought we might be in for your usual basic New York accomadation however this fantastic find was a great little hotel  Right next to Rockefeller center and opposite St  Patricks Cathedral its location is fantastic  Our room was not big but was suitable for  people  It was clean and tidy with lovely staff members always willing to help whether with local information or hotel issues  A rare thing with a cheaper hotel but all those things you usually have to pay out for were free things like bottled water safety deposit boxes in room alarm clock flat screen TV with cable internet even umbrellas for rainy days  Will definately book again cannot recommend enough 
P => Perfect location congenial staff and reasonable rates  Just steps away from Rockefeller Center and all the wonders of Fifth Avenue at Christmas this was the most perfect location for a couple spending a few days during the holidays Each and every staff member we encountered was courteous and professional  While the room seems a tad small it is really not so for NYC  It was clean with a ent size bath a club chair and work station plus a flat screen TV  Bear in mind though it is not a luxurious property like the Four Seasons There are four computers and printers available for use which is a nice feature  On the seventh floor there is also a restaurant which serves breakfast lunch and dinner  We only had one breakfast there the buffet for   which was allright but coffee was extra which we thought should have been included A good choice at a ent rate for NYC during Christmas  
P => Excellent Value for Money Just back from a long weekend in New York and would definately recommend this hotel  Amazing location clean modern and comfortable  I read reviews beforehand saying that the rooms were on the small side but for I wouldnt agree with that comment at all The front desk staff were very helpful and were always available to answer our questions  As amp when we return to NY we will definately stay here again  
P => Reasonably priced great location I stayed here for the NYC athon and was very impressed  The staff were friendly and the room was pretty spacious and nice  The location is very ideal and it is only a block fromthe Park Avenue HampM I would definately stay here again 
P => Im amazed at how cool this hotel is I was booked into this hotel by a client for whom I was doing work and I think they are members  I was only here for one night originally and I wanted to come in early   I called the hotel directly and asked to add two earlier nights to my stay and they did so at the same rate my clent got as a member  or so  It was terrific The hotels just been reated  Its just across the street from the Rockefeller Ice Rink and just a few feet east of Radio City Music Hall  The lobbys cool crisp and clean  A clerk did hover over me desperately trying to help me with my self check in  At one point I asked if he wanted to do it for me  He asked if I needed him to and I said no  He then backed off  A little too helpful but everyone else was great The room itself was a vel of efficiency with a great bed business desk with easily accessed plugs and lights free wifi even worked with my iPhone and the bed was glorious  I got exactly what I ordered  Televisions a bit sparse on available channels the coffeemaker was working fine  The bathroom was another model of efficiency   it gave me ideas for my second bath at home They offer free chilled filtered water from machines in generic bottles for use in the rooms and to take with you  Excellent  I was on the th floor and it was a bit inconvenient to go all the way down to the nd floor to get to the only icemaker and vending in the building The hotel has the menus for a number of local restaurants that will deliver right to your room for far less than Id have thought   a couple of dollars  Nice touches include a few resource books that look great on the shelf a coat hook bar the digital thermostat right next to the bed and more And its right near a couple of major subway stations   which I took for the first time It was greatI love this hotel  I told my client to book me there every time I come to NYC This review is for the Rockefeller location only not the others  
P => WAY Better Than I Expected I gotta say   when I booked this room through my companys website at     I was pretty certain it was gonna suck room rates these days in NYC are more like   But imagine my surprise when I walked into a clean modern efficient self service hotel with everything you could ever want in a business oriented property and with a PERFECT location just a block from  Rock The th floor Terrace is just this side of breathtaking and the guest room while small typical of NYC was absolutely great I slept soundly and enjoyed every minute of my stay there  Definitely will be back 
P => Great location small room GOOD  great location for shopping and city visits around Rockefeller centrePOOR  experienced endless waiting time in front of elevator  calculate up to  minutes for checking out luggage you store there after your official check out  seems to be a logistical challenge OVERALLgood for a short stay in that specific city area 
P => Love the CQ hate their resturant My husband and I very much like Club Quarters in Rockefeller Center  Clean and modern we have found the service to be very good  We have stayed several times Location is good not the craziness of the Times Square area What to avoid at the CQ would be the Terrace room which I will only call a restaurant because they do  We had dinner for the first time there a week ago we waited  minutes for our appetizers   when the meal finally came shrimp scampi the few shrimp on the plate looked old   and the pasta was just that pasta that looked like it  have been tossed with some butter  It did not smell fresh nor did it look appetizing  I called the waiter back asked him to take the meal away and take if off my bill  I expressed to the waiter my lack of understanding that well after an hour how could this be the best the kitchen could doWe ended up going up going out in search of some ent food  We were successful of course after all were in Manhattan but very put out  
P => Great Location My wife and I stayed at Club Quarters Rockefeller for  nights in ust of   We had room  which is a comfortable small modern room with a quotviewquot of an adjoining building  The room is equiped with a flat panel TV fast internet hook upand an in room thermasat  The elevators were not operating properly our first night which made getting to and from our room a little challenging  The elevators were fixed the next day so it became a non event but it was quite frustrating having to wait so long The self check in and check out computers were easy to use and made the process very quick  Club Quarters has free internet access on the seventh floor along with a barlounge area with a nice patio that overlooks st Street The location of the hotel is great  on st Street between th amp th Ave  You are within walking distance to Time Square Grand Central and Central Park  There are subway stops nearby on th ave that got us to further away destinations  We felt that this is a nice low key hotel in a great location and would stay there again  
P => Perfect Clean great Proximity right price  Club Quarters is located in a perfect place if you want to stay close to Rockefeller Times Square etc  The rooms were designed for   people and they were clean with updated furniture  A flat screen TV was present and the bathroom was nicely updated and orated  The check in process was painless  This place has a nice workout facility  Id recommend having a drink on the balcony of the th floor restaraunt  Great views and atmosphere  This place is close to everything when staying around Rockefeller  Checkout is automatic and painless  The price was right for this place and Ill stay here again on any future trips A few complaints  of the  elevators was not working the entire weekend  This made for long waits and the stairs wasnt an option to get to the rd floor No ironironing board  
P => velous hotel Club Quarters Rockefeller Center was centrally located both to Times Square th Avenue shopping and bus loop areas  For those travelers who wish privacy and quiet this is the hotel for you  The room was spacious for two people ac well lit clean nice view of the cathedral  although the bathroom was small it had a full shower  I was very pleased with the staff courteous and very helpful  My stay in New York City was a hit  
P => Very Clean and Great Location We stayed in room  in il   While the room was a little small for two people it was absolutely immaculate and updated  The location cant be beat as the hotel is literally across the street from Radio City  Rock and down the block from St  Patricks  I would detinitely stay here again  Keep in mind that this is a business oriented hotel so it does not have all the bells and whistles such as a large lobby and concierge but if you know your way around NYC you dont need that stuff  
P => A little piece of heaven My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night over St  Patricks Day weekend  We go to New York on a regular basis for shows and events as we live close by in Philadelphia  Of all the hotels weve stayed in around the same price range this was one of the best  We were at first suprised by the size of the very small lobby but check in was a breeze on their computer check in system  The rooms are small as they often are in NYC but they are nicely orated very clean and modern  The bathroom doors are frosted but you cannot see through them as one of the other reviews suggests  They actually help make the room appear a little larger than it actually is  The greatest part about this hotel is the Terrace Club on the th floor which is a large relaxing space with an indoor and outdoor area with nice views  There are armchairs magazines newspapers internet access and a small eating area and bar  It was great to return to the hotel after a long day and hang out there  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we look forward to returning  
P => Sleek European Modern Style in Rockefeller Center My company is a corporate member of CQ and my boyfriend and I ided to go to New York for Valentines Day  While we were dissapointed that we couldnt get the weekend special the price for one night was still good for the location about  for a standard queen  The lobby is small but what do you expect in the highest rent district in the city Our room was also small but well designed and laid out  The design was european feeling and we just loved it  We have stayed uptown at the riott in Central Park West in a huge suite and by far enjoyed our CQ room better   it was just more our style  The bathroom only has a shower and the door slides open and shut   there isnt much privacy  We didnt have a problem with this but some   The location was awesome   while its not the best place to wander around at night not much to do we enjoyed the proximity to the museums uptown and the subways to downtown  We had a view of Radio City Music Hall and couldnt complain about the noise there didnt seem to be any  The beds were very comfortable and there was a thermostat in the room which was nice  The breakfast was nice but a little pricey    dollars for continental I believe  But   youre probably not going to find any cheaper anywhere else in the neighborhood  You arent really there to enjoy the food though so much as the atmosphere  The dining area is very nice and not outdated like so many hotel restaurants and the patio is closed in for dining during the winter   which was sortof fun  We also liked that the hotel was private and discreet again just a matter of taste  We loved our stay and cant wait to try the CQ downtown 
P => Great Location Very Clean We stayed in this hotel for  nights over the Christmas and New Year period  I was a little concerned as I had read mixed reviews about this hotel The Hotel was great Its in a great location   steps away from th Ave Rockefeller Center Radio City Hall and Times Square and Central park is within walking distance There are plenty of delis around the hotel which serve breakfast and are reasonable too We did take a look at the hotels restraunts menu but it was quite expensive and you had to be formally dressed during the weekYou can order room service from I think it was  different restraunts locally and they bring it up to your room which is good if you have been sightseeing all day and are tired Staff were friendly and always helpful  The airline lost our baggage and as the hotel staff were expecting our cases at some point they sent them straight up to our room during the middle of the night as they knew we were eager to receive them as soon as possible The rooms were very clean we had clean towels and bedding was changed every other day as stated   which I think is fine how many people really change there sheets everydayThe hotel recommended a great india restraunt just round the corner called Bombay Palace very niceThe only couple of things that were slightly disapointing was the Bathroom as it wasnt very private the toilet is right next to the door which is a sliding frosted glass door so everyone who you are sharing your room with can see to on the toiletit was fine though as we were family but if you are sharing with freinds be aware but hey you had a nice shower and as I have said before it was very clean which is a bonus for me There was also a very small lobby we almost walked past it misteaking it for an exit I think this really lets the hotel down as it is a really nice hotel and you just dont get that impression from the small lobby as most manhatten hotels have huge lobbies and that is part of the experience But we had a great stay at this hotel and could only find fault with a couple of minor details   I would recommend staying here and would definetly return if I ever go to New York again  
P => Surprisingly Nice My husband and I ided to take a last minute trip to NYC over the holidays to see friends and family  We found a good deal on this hotel and ided to try it  Overall we were very pleased with our stay at CQ Rockefeller  The room we received on the th floor had a good view of the ice skating rink and tree and we could enjoy seeing the hoards of people skating and clamouring for Rockefeller Plaza each day The hotel is simple and generally nice  We have stayed at many NYC hotels and this one is among the nicer of them  Room was spotless housekeeping was efficient free handy water bottles were a nice touch as walking around NYC its nice to have a bottle of water in hand  The lobby is miniscule but one doesnt come to NYC to hang out in the lobby of the hotel  Bed was comfy aand the flat screen tv was a treat  our room was silent and with the window closed it was completely quiet and relaxing  Our only gripe was really the elevators which are painfully slow  Other than that you could do a lot worse in NYC and the midtown location cant be beat as a jumping off point for sightseing or walking  The subway is a block away and the park and museums are also quite near I can recommend this hotel    for luxury you can always go to the Peninsula or Waldorf Astoria to take tea or a drink in the evening and by staying here you will save your money so you can enjoy those things when you visit  
P => Central Location Weve just come back from a trip to New York and found the hotel to be first class for the money  We had  rooms all on different floors which we all found to be exceptionally clean and functional  The or is very modern and perhaps a little dark hence the descrption that its male oriented but neither of the ladies that I travelled with complained What did stick in my mind is the excellent facilities   flat panel TV cordless telephone coffee maker filtered amp chilled water station individual electronic room thermostat which made the experience enjoyable  We all found the beds exceptionally comfortable   great for weary English travellers  There was a great gym which sadly I didnt have time to use The barrestaurant area looked nice but was not licenced for a quick drink whilst waiting for the ladies to dress  This was a little disappointing although it spared our livers  The bathroom is a little small for  people   one trying to shave whilst the other does her hair means that at time we were tripping over one another  However I am being picky as it wasnt really a problem and the brightly lit clean and modern bathroom area more than made up for the short comings The hotel was excellently positioned  The ladies loved the shopping opportunities in th Avenue we were grateful of the Heartland Brewing Co in the opposite direction The lifts were a little annoying as  had to serve  floors but it was not really a problem unless we forgot something and had to go back to the room  The traffic noise was not an issue nor indeed the ominous looking air conditioning plant  stories below our window  The double glazing works The reception staff were very professional and helpful   a credit to New York and Club Quarters In all   we liked this hotel a lot and would have no hesitation in recommending it or indeed staying there again  
P => Best of the Bunch Having stayed at the other two NYC Club Quarters I can say this is by far the best  The location was great and the room we stayed in with microwave and fridge was large enough that we didnt have to go outside to change our minds  As with the other Club Quarters you have to use your room key to access the upper floors which proved to be really annoying when we were there because they were having trouble with the card readers  The small lobby can feel really crowded when there are more than ten people trying to check in or out  Their guest services are as good as many more expensive hotels and the th floor loungerestaurant is a pleasant place to relax after a hectic day running around the city  The vendingice machines are only on the second floor so you have to use the awkward elevators to get there unless of course youre staying on the second floor 
P => Perfect location modern masculine room We came for a long weekend and the location was excellent for midtown Manhattan  It is located literally right across the street from the Rockefeller centre and at the end of the street to the left is th avenue and to the right is Radio City Music Hall  It seems many of the rooms are corner rooms because of the design of the building  We had a corner room on the top floor  From our window we could see the flags of Rockefeller centre and St  Patricks cathedral on th  Everyday it was very easy to get around to anywhere as we were very close to a subway station as well  Central Park was a short walk north and all the theatres were walking distance as well  There is not much of a lobby to speak of because its a business hotel but the staff is efficient and they have computer stations to check yourself in which is really handy  The room is very clean and was in dark greys blue and green  I thought it looked very crisp and modern and pretty masculine all of which appealed to me  The bathroom was also clean  There was a coffeemaker in the room  Iron and ironing board were available down the hall  It was a great base from which to see the city and I would definitely stay there again if I wanted to be in midtown  
P => perfect for business This is an ideal place to stay for a single occupancy businessperson  The location is ideal for midtown very close to Rockefeller Center  Reservation through AmEx seamless check in very fast  Both high speed wired and wireless Internet worked right away some hotels make this a huge hassle and was included in the price  Coffeemaker delivery service from take out restaurants in the area new furnishings including functional desk  Rooms are small not for couples or entertaining there is a restaurantclub in the hotel  If you want a reasonably priced small but very clean room fast checkin aimed at the professional traveller this is for you  If you want to hang out in the lobby or swim in the pool you would do better in a more traditional hotel  
P => Glad to have the discount Fortunately my company has a contracted agreement with CQ  So when I ided to take advantage of this by booking a nights stay in NYC for my boyfriends birthday I was very pleasantly surprised  This hotel is brand new and in a fantastic location across from Rockefeller Center  Yes its true   CQs are very focused on the business traveler and is not a very service oriented hotel  But our rooms had huge ceilings very clean and modern or a flat screen tv and a small kitchen area  It was so new it even smelled new  Beds were SO comfy and I loved the sliding frosted bathroom door The terrace on the th floor is very nice and peaceful  a great joy to eat out on a terrace looking up the street at Radio City or down at St Pats Cathedral  The only drawbacks is that to access any floor you need a key and if you dont get a quottrainingquot on how to use the key right you could wind up riding the elevators for a bit until someone can help you  The other prob is that if youre not from a big city and arent used to street noise its quite possible you might not sleep well if your room faces st St  I suggest askinf for a room off the street if you know that would bother you  For  a night I truly enjoyed it and will absolutely stay there again  
P => Big Incompetence in the Big Apple  
P => Ideal for Business Traveller Very pleasantly surprised with the hotel  Needed a room at the last minute and couldnt find anything ent available for less than  per night  Its an ideal hotel for a business traveller  The room I stayed in was compact but well appointed very clean comfortable and modern  It had everything I needed   including free wireless Internet access  Great location  Its a very practical establishment so I wouldnt want to stay there for pleasure   not recommended for honeymooners or couples seeking a romantic getaway  Great for one or two nights but not an extended stay  Will definitely return to this hotel when on business though  Good value for money

P => Ahhhh tum in NYC This must be the most perfect time to visit NYC not too hot not too cool bright clear sunny skies and the location of the Doubletree was perfect for our brief  day visit  We were able to quotbar hopquot through Central Park enjoyed a wonderful quotConversationquot at MoMA and did a really touristy thing by taking the Duck Tour which conveniently picks up practically outside the front door of the hotel  If Broadway shows are on your quotgotta dosquot then you are within walking distance of a dozen of the best NY has to offer  Restaurants Wine Bars Shopping All I can say is Go Enjoy 
P => Fantastic stay Love the Doubletree Times Square Ive stayed in this hotel twice in the past year and I have absolutely loved it each time  First of all the location is fantastic   right in the middle of Times Square The rooms are large and spacious especially for NYC standards  Everything was clean and lovely  The views from the room are also amazing  I will continue to stay at the Doubletree Times Square when I visit NYC  I highly recommend this hotel 
P => Great hotel Great location I have been to NYC alot       and have stayed at various hotels   this was by far the BEST  People were great  Location was right in the middle of Times Square and we had a room that overlooked Times Square       I couldnt of asked for a better expereience  
P => Smack dab in the middle of the action yet above it all  My boyfriend and I went on a birthday trip to NYC this past ust  Hed never been to New York and I had wanted to show him the frenzy and lights and endlessly peopled spectacle of TImes Square  The Doubletree Guest Suites is on the corner of th St  amp where Broadway and th Ave split about a half a block away form where the ball drops on New Years so it was a perfect fit for the location plus I got a HELL of a deal on Priceline for the hotel and round trip air so that made the ision super easy  The first thing I want to point out is that the hotel entrance to the street level quotst lobbyquot is right next to a subway station so anytime we were coming from uptown wed just hop out and be right at the entrance to the hotel which was so nice after long days of exploring the Met walking around Central Park etc  The second thing I want to make very clear is that we were treated so well by all of the staff that it really shouldve been the first thing I said  The Concierge was fantastic the staff at the check inout counter were all friendly and helpful and the room was kept beautifully  It was a beautiful place to come back to at night or take a break from the CRUSHING heat and humidity of NYC in late ust I will never do that again but it was fun   just sweaty somewhat irritable fun at times  The AC was pumping the bed was soft and warm and there was a tv in the bedroom as well as the livingroom area  Fridge and microwave the safe worked plenty of closet amp drawer space and the bathroom was really nice with ample room for two people getting ready together  I never felt crowded  Well except for when we left the hotel hahaha   the view from our windows was gorgeous and we could see all the way to Central Park through this small swath of clear space between sky scrapers  I want to say we were on the nd floor and only heard the street if we opened the windows  Which by the way is a really nice feature that many hotels seem to neglect these days windows that open Also the warm cookie at check in was a nice touch  Oh and the free internet in the quotnd lobbyquot you have to get int hrough the street level and then take an elevator to the check in lobby on the rd floor was also helpful   I was kinda bummed that the daily rate for using internet in your room was like  but MEH wed just go to the lobby  
P => Broadway Lights and Good Times Myself Mother Sister and  year old Dhter stayed at the hotel for  nights  Never visiting the BIG city I only prepared for this trip by view of the trip boards and friends reviews  I booked with Double Tree based on the location as I wanted to take in the New York lights and hustle and bustle  this is the hotel for that as well as the suite accomodations and rate  All of these preferences were provided  We arrived at the hotel at  which was around check out time though was greeted by the doorman and directed to check in our luggage and asked to check back within the next two hours which we did and was taken to our room and given a brief review of room accomodation and close by eateries and conveniences  Hotel staff was always accomodating  The room was very clean and toiletries were replenished every day The room was very quiet even though it looked out on Broadway  I cannot wait to go back The only downside was that the front lounge area was small which did not leave any enviroment for lounging which we looked for on two nights as we did have some rainy evenings as well as it did not have a pool  
P => Doubletree is Great Hotel This is my third stay at the Doubletree and I highly recommend it if you are looking for proximity to Times Square the theatre district subways and a large quiet space to get away from it all  We stayed at Doubletree Times Square from      Room was   was fresh appeared to be recently updated and had two extremely comfortable doubles and a pull out couch  Checked in early  Room was quiet and housekeeping service excellent  Refrigerator and microwave excellent addition  Bathroom was spacious and had double sinks  Concierge and security were friendly and helpful  Lack of free internet and absence of flat screen in bedroom was noticed but not missed as we spent so little time in the room  Also as Hilton Honors member we were given free buffet breakfast which I cannot imagine paying   per person for especially since the wait staff could best be described as surly and inattentive  Otherwise the buffet included chef prepared omelets french toast and waffles as well as excellent variety of other breakfast items and was absolutely a great way to start the morning  
P => Wonderful location and hotel We stayed here for  nights at the end of tember  The rooms are lovely and big and its great having a erate lounge area  We were on the st floor and it was incredibly quiet even though it was right on Times Square  We managed to check in early which was handy  The staff were very helpful and the welcome cookie was delicious  Have stayed in quite a few hotels in NY but this was certainly in the best location and had the biggest space  Would not hesitate to stay there again  
P => Loved location of hotel I travelled with two sisters amp two nieces for a long weekend for my first visit to the Big Apple  After being out in the hustle amp bustle of Times Square the hotel is an oasis of calm amp quiet  The staff are all very friendly amp accomodating  Loved the cookies at check in amp the delicious tinis in lobby bar  Our room was on st floor offering a great view of the MampM billboard etc  The rooms are definitely a good size for females getting ready for theatre shopping etc  We had no problem getting taxis whenever we required them  I would stay at hotel on a return visit  
P => Huge rooms in the heart of the City Spent one night here for a quick girls getaway  Couldnt beat the location    directly across the street from the TKTS booth which we definitely utilized  Right in the middle of Times Square so really convenient to Theaters amp restaurants  We stayed on th floor amp had a partial view of Times Square  The rooms were HUGE by NYC standards so well worth the price for both space amp location  Very clean amp modern accommodations  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Amazing Hotel Experience I traveled wsix friends to celebrate our th birthdays and when researching where to stay I relied heavily on the reviews here to make my ision  I was not disappointed We had two suites for the  of us and had some minor problems w one of the rooms ie the refrigerator did not work but the problems were fixed in a timely manner  At check in we asked for adjoining rooms wdouble beds we had king size beds next door to each other and were able to change rooms  days into our trip  Every request we had was promply addressed  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful Diana is a wonderful asset   she deserves a raise for helping me as much as she did We did not use the consierge or eat at the restaurant so I cant comment about them but the location of this hotel is AWESOME Theaters and so many other attractions are so closeby that we were able to drop off packages on our way to the next attraction  TImes Square is a hoot with lots of shops  A subway stop is just steps from the front door and the bus stops close to the door or right across the street depending on direction  Broadway is closed across from the hotel which reases car traffic however the area outside the front door can become congested wfoot traffic   I loved it but its not for everyone  The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable king size more so than the double  Im trying hard to find something negative to say and the only thing I can say is I wish the internet would have been free in the suites there are two places in the hotel to get free access though and free coffee in the lobby also would have been nice   but thats it folks   everything else is A  Oh and did I mention how wonderful Diana is at the front desk Will definitely stay here again 
P => Couldnt ask for more My friend and I spent  nights at this hotel for a fashion week girls trip and were completely satisfied  ProsSuper Comfy BedsGreat Service concierge front desk maid serviceFantastic Location right near the subway station and in Times SquareVery Clean and New Looking RoomsQuiet we were on the th floorBeautiful LobbyExcellent Security they checked for our room key each nightConsLocation is congested but very centralized 
P => Would love to go back Excellent hotel large room with nice new furnishings wonderful location for seeing the sights other guests all very friendly great tinis in lobby bar Concierge was very helpful as was reception staff  
P => best service at double tree metropolitan on lexington avenue Hi I just want to say that the the double tree hotel on lexington ave and st was great  They treated us great  the service was just on point  Their staff bell boys receptionists were very kind and helpful  even the cleaning ladies were friendly and accomodating  When i asked for extra towels they supplied them right away  I def want to recommend this hotel for any future travelers  Their service made our trip more enjoyable  
P => Good staff great location Stayed here while attending the USOpen  Clean and comfortable accommodations with friendly staff  Cant beat the location in the center of Times Square close to everything Looked online for tickets to Wicked for Friday night best seats were so so at  a piece  We saw the hotel Concierge and she used a broker and got us great seats for the same show for just  more  
P => Terrific Large Room I stayed at this hotel with my wife mother in law and two children   ages  amp   The rooms have been reated within the last year and ours was fantastic   very large for a New York hotel  All of the furnishings and surfaces seemed practically new  The beds were great and the fold out sofa bed was even okay  Its the perfect size for a family of  or more  The bedroom is a arate room that can be closed off from the rest of the room and the best part is the bathroom   which had a large double sink and  doors   one connected to the bedroom and one connected to the living room  Plus there is a rd sink in the wetbar Its a great setup The staff and service was great  The business center still needs updating  The location is great for tourist activities   theres a subway access point almost directly outside the front door  The TKTS booth is directly across the street  My only complaint about the location is that its on a very crowded corner in Times Square  So coming and going often involves navigating through a dense crowd of people  If you need a large room in New York this is a great choice 
P => Wonderful hotel perfect location Stayed here for five nights  As first time New York visitors we were thrilled with the location  We were able to walk most anywhere or to take the subway which was right at the corner The suites were perfect for a five night stay nice to have some extra room The hotel was very clean felt very safeand the staff was extremely helpful with everything  Our room was on th floor with a city view  Amazing 
P => Great hotel in NYC Just came back from this years US Open this is our third year staying at the Times Square Doubletree hotel THe location cant be beat for convenience all of the staff were very friendly and helpfull the rooms are spacious and very clean prices are surprisingly reasonable for NYC and such a great location Overall would highly recommend this hotel and we will stay again next year 
P => Again a great stay This was our second stay at the Doubletree  I was in NYC on business and my two teenage dhters went along the hotel is a great base for the kids to explore the city from however I wouldnt recommend turning teenage girls loose in Times Square but mine are well acquainted with the city  The room the staff the check in all were perfect  We always feel safe there the staff in the first floor lobby is discreet however they are very observant of people coming and going  The location of course is perfect  A subway station is literally  steps from the front door I left positive comments on the survey card upon check out and the manager called me the following week to thank me  I have never had that happen at any hotel previously I recommend this hotel highly and will certainly return again  
P => Excellent hotel the staff is incredible This was the second time I stayed at this hotel while in New York and it was great again  The rooms are all nice sized and recently orated  The hotel is exceptionally clean  It is right in the middle of mid town so you are close to everything  If you are going to be going to broadway shows you can walk from the hotel  Everyone there is so nice  My friend got really sick and needed to go to the hospital  I called the front desk they got a cab for us came up to the room to escort us down told the cab where to go  They were great  They called the room several times to check on her  I really appreciated their concern and help  
P => Great room awkward entrance at night We stayed for  nights and had a great time here  Having two rooms helps when traveling with infants   we put the baby and pack and play in the bedroom at night and hung out in the family room  The room was clean check in was easy and all was good  We stayed in Times Square because a conference was nearby  There lot a lot of people on the sidewalks outside with the hotel across from the Tixs Center  One strange thing was that the lobby was on the rd floor that you take elevators to get to  I came in later at night and the secuity people almost did not let me in because my name was not on the reservation  Also could have used more towels though the help was awesome in taking a big bag of birthday party trash  
P => A Place to recommend for any New York visit Stayed in the Doubletree at Times Square for  nights with as a family with  teenage sons in ust   We arrived early but were given a room straight away  We had a suite with a king size bed and a sofa bed for the boys  This provided us with excellent accommadation for any family staying in NYC  The location is in a prime postion in Time Square  I have read previous reviews and have to agree that the sound proofing of the hotel is excellent considering the prime location in the heart of NYC  We recommend the buffet breakfast  Plenty to choose from and the waiters were very friendly  In fact the last day we were given  tins of Doubletree Cookies by Steve a cook we spoke to a few times over breakfast  It was a really nice and that summed up the hotel staff  Every member of staff so helpful and kind  Tip for you   There is free wireless internet at the hotel reception and bar area I recommend this hotel for a family stay in New York  I did look at other hotel but was very happy we choose the Doubletree Guest Suite in Time Square  
P => I loved this place I will not stay anywhere else when I go back but here  Loved the beds pillow and the LOCATION  It was perfect and the door man is so nice  
P => Great All the way around My twenty something dhters and I just spend a week in New York in late ust and had a fantastic time  Staying at the Doubletree was perfect  The location was great   there were crowds of people but the minute we walked through the doors tranquility and cold air hit us like a pleasant breeze  Our room was great   it was clean and quiet and cool  Service was great   the night time cookies were the best ever  
P => Fantastic location suiteprice  We stayed at the doubletree for  nights at the end of ust It was our first trip to NYC with our  month old  Cant say enough good things about the doubletree from the moment we arrived the concierge were very helpful to the cookies at check in which my sugar loving husband appreciated We had a lovely suite on the th floor plenty of space erate living room with a mini kitchenette fridge and microwave  A tip when travelling with babies we brought a kettle with us so we could have cool boiled water for the babys bottles  We had a very nice erate bedroom so its an ideal set up when travelling with children  The location is perfect in the middle of it all but yet nice and quiet in the hotel  We were able to get free wireless on our floor not sure about the higher levels  All the staff were very helpful to us and room was kept very clean  We booked this trip  months beforehand and got a better deal per night so be good to book ahead of time  to sum up we would highly recommend the doubletree whether with children or just if you want an extra bit of space for all those shopping bags 
P => Too Expensive The location of this hotel is perfect  The staff is excellent everyone including Daniel  The rooms are nice  But the cost is way too high given room rate and extra charges for internet  
P => Best location in Midtown We have stayed here several times and this was a special occassion   my wifes th Birthday  Jennie and Diana front desk were great and really came through to give us a special room and treat for the occassion  It has great views of midtown in the heart of Times Square yet quiet when you need a little quotdowntimequot  Staff is great made us feel like quotfamilyquot    so good my wife still thinks shes quotquot 
P => Great Location Super Comfy Beds Great Staff   Great Stay Just returned on Saturday stayed for  nights we have been here before it was over  years ago and ided to book here again as we needed a suite for my family  We had  rooms  Twin bedded suite and  King suite on the th floor I ll keep this as brief as possible We had a fantastic stay and everything went very smoothly I would definitely stay here again if I return to NYC in the future Liked  Checked in at  pm   of our rooms was ready immediately which was a bonus  Warm Cookies on check in Of course also available when needed   Fabulous views   Our room of Broadway   My families of Duffy Square Upper Times Square  Beds were extremely comfy I slept soundly every night which is great for me as I m a light sleeper with a seriously bad back  No noise  Mini Fridge   Essential for a nice cold drink after you return from a hard day of sightseeing  Never saw our maid rooms were sorted by pm every day   Mirrors one in bathroom and one sinkMirror unit outside the bathroom allowed me to get ready whilst my OH showered   Great idea   Breakfast Buffet fabulous but very expensive   Best location   In the heart of Times Square open the door to busy crowds but as soon as you shut the door ahh peace and quiet  Subway Local stop right outside Tours and TKTS also within a matter of feet  Staff were great especially the bar staff   sorry guysgals I cant remember your names  Spacious Suite By NYC standardsDisliked   a few niggles really  We checked in early Second room wasn t ready fair enough when told would it would be ready within an hour it was over  hours   Just be straight and say over  hours I could have done some serious shopping in those  hours   I thought our room was fine my family thought their room was a little dated  Wardrobe Closet Very small and dated not enough hanging space or hangers for  people for  nights   although there were plenty of drawers  Air con a bit noisy amp dated but cooled down the room quicklyInitially I was going to stay at the Affinia Dumont because of the better price and Tripadvisor rating however I m glad I stuck with the Doubletree its just in the thick of it and that s where we wanted to be   Plenty of barseating places nearby  We didn t wait more than  mins for a table and regardless what the locals say we didnt have one bad meal whenever we ate nearby whether it be breakfast lunch snacks or dinner  Also whenever we dined further a field I must addJust to add   the check out letter you get under the door states there are no late check out requests however we were advised to call the front desk at am on our final day and we were given an extra hour on both our rooms which was greatly appreciated   Thanks all 
P => Beautiful people We did this trip more for the kids  Beautiful people Jenny at the front desk what a smile when she welcomed us  Danny and Michael the night Divas I asked for cookies and with no problem we got them along with stories  I cant believe Jimmy the doorman is still there he remember us from a few years ago  Thank god also for Antonio when we checked out he reminded us by saying I hope nothing was left behind in your safe or closet  Thats went I remembered leaving some valuables in the safe  Doubletree home away from home  Thank you guys  
P => Great location superb pricequality ratio We have spent  days in NY in this hotel  Great location and excellent service  The personnel is very friendly and helpful  Daniel in the reception had great idea about the hamburgers   Next time in NY again in Doubletree  
P => Great location The Doubletree in Times Square is in the perfect location  It is right across the street from the new pedestrian only area of Times Square and the TIX location where you can get discounted Broadway tickets  The room we had had a partial times Square view and was in very good condition  All the rooms are two rooms our room had two double beds and a very large pull out couch in the other room a good size bathroom a small kitchen area with a sink microwave fridge and coffee maker  The rooms were very quiet and comfortable which is nice after walking the city all day  The staff were very helpful especially the bellman and the valet for parking the car  Getting to the hotel was a chore due to the traffic in the city but once you get there the staff takes care of the rest  Parking was   a day in the garage across the street  The parking garage was very well run  Everything seemd to cost twice as much as in Florida  Prices did get cheaper the farther away from Times Square that you got and the choices are endless  
P => This hotel has it all We have just returned from our fourth visit to New York City in   years and our third consecutive stay at the Doubletree Times Square  I cannot say enough about how much we have enjoyed our stays there  Everything about the hotel suited our needs perfectly  Accomodations We had a two room suite with two double beds  The room was large enough to comfortably accomodate our family of four adults  The room appeared to be newly reated was very clean and was well maintained by the housekeeping staff Location This hotel is ideally located for shopping diningand especially for the theater and subway access  The theaters are all within a few blocks of the hotel and the subway entrance is just out the door and around the corner Hotel Staff  The staff is as friendly and accomodating as you will find anywhere from the general manager on down  Doris Yaniv and Daniel at the front desk are terrific as are all the others I highly recommend this hotel and will be staying there on our future trips to NYC  
P => Superb New York hotel and great base for everything Syated here in mid ust with my wife and  teenagers  The hotel is on Times Sq many claim to be this one is right in the middle  The entrance from the street looks a bit odd and has a security guard  However the reception is on the rd floor and from that point onwards the hotel looks like part of the Hilton group it belongs to  We were on the th floor which is the lowest guest floor  Our rooms were excellent each with a bedroom with  double beds and a arate lounge with a double sofa bed  We had  of these which were interlinked making it a huge footprint  The rooms were very quiet well equipped and large We were give a free breakfast each day which was buffet style and comprehensive  The staff were superb  The concierge booked trips for us at very reasonable prices and the front desk even offered to print out our boarding cards at the end of our stay Given the location right on Times Square the hotel was very reasonable and provided a great base to see all of the Ney York attrwactions from  
P => Excellent Hotellocation I choose this place after reading reviews this is the first review a have ever written  The Doubletree TS was perfect quiet clean suite type rooms  Peaceful in the room then walk out the door into the most exciting city in the world Never a dull moment  Staff friendly concierge very helpful  If you cant have fun or enjoy yourself here then stay home  
P =>  Stars for Convenience This hotel was a great choice and is perfectly situated for touring the city amp seeing Broadway shows  The rooms are large and comfortable when compared to a typical Times Square hotel but the Doubletree itself felt more secure than some of the obscenely large hotels in the area  This was most evident when the surly night shift doorman checked guests for their room keys before allowing them access to the street level elevators  Throughout our stay I was surprised that I never had to wait much more than  seconds for an elevator after calling for one  The rd level lobby elevators take you to your floor where you will find a mere  guest rooms each a luxury in itself Our rd floor room was very quiet and was what the hotel referred to as an allergy quotPurequot room  These rooms have a large portable HEPA air cleaner and the white noise it generated while powered on only added to a good nights sleep  The Hilton quotSweet Dreamsquot bedding in these rooms also have special mattress and pillow encasements to help reduce dustmite and feather down allergens  All of the allergy pure rooms are located on the rd floor so theyre sure to have great views  One disappointment with our room was that its  flatscreen HDTVs did not receive a HD signal    but who goes to Times Square to watch TVOur room was also one of the quotTimes Square Viewquot rooms that ended with the room number quot quot This room really overlooked Father Duffy Square which is part of what most people refer to as Times Square see photos The best thing about the Duffy Square view room is that it has a   view of the city and is entirely surrounded with a curved wall of windows  The room is slightly smaller as a result of this layout but provides one of the most panoramic and romantic views available in Times Square  This room is perfect for couples or a small family and was very reasonably priced when I booked it JUST LESS than one month in advance through the Doubletree website  I guess they were trying to sell off unused rooms because just a few days after getting my very low rate the hotel was sold out  Dont forget that Doubletree offers a   discount if you have AAA Note The quotrealquot Times Square view rooms end with the room number quotquot but have less windows  For New Years Eve and the ball drop this room cannot be beat We didnt eat at the hotels restaurant but I did stop by after hours to check it out  It was nicely orated and appeared to have a fairly big spread for breakfast  For lunch or dinner I suggest heading west to the  block of th Street just west of th Avenue  There are a couple dozen nice quotrealquot New York City restaurants to choose from  The hotels business center was easy to use and had no waiting line  For a  fee I used the center to print boarding passes prepay checked baggage and upgrade our seats in advance of the flight home    all of which would have cost at least  more at the airport The car service we used to and from the airport provided curbside service at the hotels front door  The doorman assisted us each time even clearing a us path through the crowd to our car when departing  Adjacent the hotels entrance youll find an enclosed Wachovia Bank ATM as well as an entrance to a subway station  Theres a convenience store about  storefronts north of the hotel on th Ave  and the Times Square Information Center is  doors south Overall Id have to say that the front desk staff and lobby baggage handlers were very helpful and friendly  The concierge was just average and who cares if the young man working at the lobbys bar was less than interested in serving beverages  This is one of the few hotels in Times Square that provides an in room refrigerator and microwave and its nice to have a refreshment in your room while enjoying the view  This is NOT one of New Yorks trendiest or most luxurious places to stay but it is clean secure nicely appointed and reasonably priced  If the hotels in Times Square were rewarded stars for convenience this one would surely get   
P => A great view in a comfortable hotel  Good for families with young kids  We went to NYC for a long weekend with our kids ages  and   From experience weve realized that quotsuitesquot hotels work best for us because we can put the kids to bed early in the bedroom close the door and watch TV or read in the quotliving room quot The hotel worked perfectly for our stay  Times Square is hem and it was fun to be in the middle of it  The hotel staff was friendly and the concierge answered our questions about how to get tickets for Broadway shows  The hotel restaurant was empty when we got there but we ate at pm with the kids so perhaps thats no surprise  The food was good and the waiter accommodated our picky eaters  
P => Family friendly hotel in the heart of Times Square We recently returned from a stay at the Doubletree Time Square in New York City  We searched at length to find a hotel that could accomodate a family of   small children in NYC  The Doubletree was one of the few that could  The location in Time Square was central to many attractions so that was good however the streets sidewalks in Time Square were super crowded so that was a drawback  Once you get a bit out of the heart of the madness it is much easier to navigate with small children or a stroller  I had to make my ten year old hold my hand because the crowds were so thick there was no other way to stay together  The hotel was fine  The staff was nice enough but certainly not top notch  They did their job and were polite  One morning at breakfast the manager stopped by our table to inquire as to our satisfaction with the hotel  that was a nice touch  The cookies on check in are DELICIOUS    that is definitely a bonus  The area is safe  I went out walking with my five year old at midnight one night to do a little souvenier shopping when neither of us could sleep  Time Square if full of tourtists well into the wee hours of the morning and all the lights make it seem like mid day even when it is the middle of the night  I get weireded out about places being unsafe VERY easily so going out at midnight with a five year old is not the norm for me    it was THAT safe  The room was okay  again nothing special  This isnt the Ritz or Four Seasons  It was clean    the carpet wasnt gross    the bedsheets were fine  The plug for the tub was broken so it would fill the tub even if you were just taking a shower it was always in the down position so we had to lift it up and lay it on its side for the tub to drain  Certainly the maids would have noticed that and should have had it serviced    but they would just knock it back down in there and wed pull it back up when we got back to the room to shower that night     like I said  not top notch service but this wasnt a deal breaker for us  We had a Time Square view room which was very cool and very entertaining for the little ones  The windows open out about six inches and have no screen    this was a concern to me but the kids were good about not playing with the windows so it turned out fine  we were on the th floor right by the elevator  We heard no elevator noise at all and only once heard some loud guests getting off the elevator on our floor at about am one morning  Other than an occassional siren  we couldnt hear the chaos of Time Square with the windows closed and the curtains drawn  The room was a suite but still small  very small quotliving roomquot area with pull out couch a arate room with a king bed and a small bathroom  All in all I would probably stay here again    it was fine  The price is right for the accomodations and the fact that they will take a party of  in one room  
P => Excellent location This hotel has the best location in NYC  There is even a subway station next to the hotel lobby which made it very easy to stop and drop shopping bags at your room and continue with more shoppingAlso the arate living area with a sleeper sofa is very convenient I would have preferred if the vanity section of the bathroom were arate to allow for more people to get ready at the same time but you cant ask for everything The rates were very affordable and the location in a huge city like NY is   priority  
P => Good hotel  Nice Location We recently stayed at this Doubletree while on our first trip to NYC  We have two teenagers ages  and   The hotel is nice clean with spacious rooms  We were glad to have the extra quotliving areaquot with a pull out sofa so that each child could sleep arately  Toiletries were nice and a small refrigerator and coffee maker are in room as well The staff was very friendly  The concierge staff was just o k  and seemed to know less about some things that were going on than we did  But they were very pleasant  One of the concierge staff was very helpful about the plays currently running and had seen many of them  The location is definitely prime  Close to subways and in the thick of Times Square  We were on the th floor so did not hear any street noise at all  Seemed very safe  During the evening they were fairly good about asking for proof of your key before you could get on the elevator from ground floor to the lobby There is a little delistore around the corner on th street where you can get hot breakfast sandwiches bagels juice etc at all hours  They were very friendly there as well  Nice for budget breakfasts and snacks The Doubletree chocolate chip cookies were great as always  We managed to get a fairly good rate and were very happy with our choice  
P => We will definitely stay here again I researched at least  hotels before choosing this one  It was also recommended by a friend  I am very picky about hotels and this one passed the test  The location is perfect  right in the heart of Times Square  You walk out the door to the hustle and bustle of the city but inside you cant hear a sound  The rooms are clean and spacious and have an additional mirror and sink outside the bathroom for ease of multiple people getting ready at once  There are two refrigerators one stocked and expensive and one empty which is certainly handy  At night you must show your room key to security which is a good idea although I never felt unsafe there  My search for hotels is over when I return to the city  We will definitely stay here again  
P => Our Regular Hotel in NYC We have stayed here three times now and looking forward to staying here many more times in the future now that we will have a son going to college in NYC  This place never disappoints  Great room great friendly service clean safe helpful concierge  What more could you ask for We love the location as it is part of the heartbeat of the city close to theaters subways restaurants coffee shops etc  I have stayed at other places in NYC and now will only stay here  It is like a home away from home  
P => Recent remodel makes this a much better hotel I stayed at the Doubletree Times Square during a recent business trip  I needed to stay in Times Square to be close to my meetings  If you are in the same boat or if you want to experience the hustle of Times Square then this is a great place  If your business is outside of Times Square then you  want to stay away  The recent remodel is a welcome change  The rooms are fresh but the staff is still a bit off putting  I guess you have to consider that this hotel is positioned right in the heart of TS where things move fast  If you want a slow paced atmosphere   this is not it  Arriving at the hotel is now made more hectic thanks to the shut down of traffic on Broadway  While this is great for pedestrians it makes getting to businesses in the area difficult  While the street in front of the hotel is open the increased traffic there because of the Broadway closure tends to clog things up   especially if you are trying to arrive around pm or depart around am  The door men here are great at getting people in and out of cabs  and almost as tough   across the sidewalk full of people  The new workout room is nice with great new machines  but it would be better on a floor with a view outside  Instead you overlook the lobby  which has also been redone in a Jetsons sort of motif  Having stayed at many of the hotels in the area Id rank this one in the Top  thanks to the new rooms and the relative price  
P => A quality hotel and excellent cookie My wife and I stayed in the Doubletree for  days on our recent trip to NYC From the moment you check in to the moment you leave they treat you very well The welcome hot choc chip cookie is amazing Our room was on the nd floor and had amazing views of times square all the way to the hudson river  We watched the th y fireworks through the floor to ceiling windows   excellent vantage point The room is well equipped with a microwave fridge coffe maker mini bar very expensive Plasma tv wi fi  sofa bed and work desk and phone and safe  The bedroom also has a big tv and ample storage space and one of the most comfortable beds ever The bathroom is also a good size As you are so high up there is very little disturbance from below All in a great base for seeing the great sights of NYC  
P => Great Location Great Rooms Great Cookies My husband and I just returned from New York and I would highly recommend this hotel to you The location is perfect Literally in the heart of all the action It was a little daunting getting out of the car with our luggage   but nothing that a little teamwork couldnt get us through  The hotel room is great A proper living roomden with a pull out sofa a mini fridge a TV in the den and bedroom the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was a bathtub style with a shower head and Wolfgang Puck coffeecoffee maker in the room which was very good  The windows actually can open a little bit  The elevators are fast  And DoubleTree cookies are always a great bedtime snack The noise from the street dint bother us in our room The hotel is located directly across from the TKTS booth   but we were really happy that we had bought our tickets ahead of time because the line up were massively long especially in the hot sun  The Diamond street is just up th street MampMs Hersheys ToysRUs are just a few of exciting stores to see in Times Square They say that you have to pay for the internet from your room and you can access their free WIFI in the lobby  We were on the th floor and easily   and happily   received great reception to the WIFI from our room This hotel also happened to be priced better than most of the other options out there  The front desk told me that they are almost always sold out The hotel is on top of a subway station and minutes walk from other subway routes  We found it really easy and SAFE to get around New York by metro  The commuters are happy to help direct you if you need assistance  Although when we asked one transit worker which train to take to somewhere she replied with quotI dont know   I have never been therequot But honestly buy a metro pass and go Someone mentioned to us that they love the spa there  I personally dont have any experience with it There is a huge presence of police and paramedics in Time Square  The hotel is on top of the West Side Story Production and just minutes away from the other theatres  We went to Citi Field the old Shae Stadium to see a Paul McCartney concert  We saw Billy Elliott and God of Carnage Broadway shows We ate at Normas Ruby Foos Basta Pasta Carnegie Deli Stage Deli and Nobu   and we thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend each one of these restaurants  
P => Dont think Ill stay there again if I dont have to  This is a hotel with a superb location if the hustle and bustle of NYC is what youre looking for  Unfortunately the service is very unpredictable and not standardized  I found the lower the person in the rank the more friendly they were  The front desk people or anyone working in the lobby area forget it  They couldnt be more cold and impersonable  The restaurant servers the cleaning ladies were more real and friendly in sincere ways  I was also surprised how bad the internet service was in our room very very low in speed for both downloading and uploading and thats if it was working at all  I had made a complaint the outsourced internet company tried to fix to no avail so I insisted that they reimbursed the charges and they did  Beware of the Business Center it charged usage by the minute and again with the very slow internet connection I ended up paying too much just to purchase a museum ticket online  We stayed for  nights and wished that we couldve checked out much earlier 
P => Great hotel great location great value The hotel is spacious by New York standards  Our family of five including three teenagers slept comfortably on the two double beds and sleeper sofa fitted with Doubletrees comfy bedding and pillows  The rooms have a small refrigerator and microwave but you do not go to NYC to stay in the room  You go to see the sites and the hotel excels here as well  It is smack in the middle of all the action in Times Square steps away from the TKTS booth purchase discounted same day tickets to Broadway shows with several subway stations justs a few feet away  I recommend the Edison Cafe about a block and a half away on th street for breakfast  Since you are in the middle of all the action it tends to be wall to wall people especially on weekends but you do not go to NYC if you do not like crowds  Overall a great value especially if you book well ahead of your trip  Check the hotels website for internet specials  
P => Gem of a location close to everthing After struggling with the travel agent to find a single room in NY for  adults and  kids at a reasonable price we located this hotel  Fantastic location walking distance to everything central park empire state building and of course Broadway Staff very friendly and hotel clean as a whistle  Rooms were a bit on the cramped side when the roll away was out but ended up only sleeping in the room as there was so much to do and see Would recommend joining the Hilton honors rewards program it is free and i earnt enough points in for free night  
P => Large comfortable rooms My wife and I and our ten year old dhter stayed here on   e    My  yr old parents stayed next door  The rooms are large and comfortable and with the adjoining suites our dhter could roam through  rooms  It was quiet despite the Times Square location we were on the th floor  We visited the restaurant for the breakfast buffet each morning  It would have been rather pricey but Hilton Honors provided it for free  The staff there was extremely friendly and our dhter looked forward to her freshly made pancakes each morning  The hotel is adjacent to one subway stop and several more are within a block  The staff was able to provide directions and suggestions on several occassions  We had an excellent visit made more enjoyable by the quality of this Doubletree  
P => Good in all respects We are  English couples and we stayed here for  nights at the end of e at the start of our American holiday Very central location with good security in the ground floor street level entrance lobby The suite comprising bedroom and arate living room was clean and spacious with a nice sized bathroom and the maid service did a good cleaning job each day We didnt eat in the hotel as there are far too many good and cheaper restaurantsdiners within easy walking distance  The location on Broadway cannot be beat but that also means that the pavements outside the hotel get very busy especially in the evening This was our th stay in New York and this was our cheapest hotel so far and gave far better value than the previous hotels that we have stayed in We would stay here again without question  
P => Surprisingly good As with most TA reviewers concur the extremely affordable Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square was a pleasant and welcome stay for part of our honeymoon  WE booked far enough in advance to get below   and received a room on a high floor that was clean and about average size for a midtown Manhattan hotel  arate sleeping quarters with a very comfortable bed that was welcome from all the walking makes the Doubletree a BEST DEAL considering more upscale hotels in the area charging twice our rate  
P => Perfect Central Location Located in the middle of Times Square across from the TKTS bleachers  Ground floor features a very nice sized welcome area with a guard who checks room keys before you proceed to rd floor  rd floor fatures check in bar with tvs etc  We NEVER had to wait for an elevator  Three elevators lead from ground to rd floor then upper floors accessible by at least  elevators  We had th floor with a nice view of times square  We walked to Emipre State BldgMacys to Lion King across the street   HELLO subways are VERY convenient went to WTC and Yankees Stadium walked to FAO th ave Rockefeller Center to Central Park Radio City Music Hall Daisy s BBQ etc The room itself is a bit cramped for  people as the fold out sofa takes up a large chunk of the living room area when opened up  Service personnel VERY friendly and helpful Room seemed either too hot or too cold   hard to find the balance at times  Free wi fi was adequate Very QUIET Never heard the sounds of the city unless you opened the windows  We would stay here again in a heartbeat McDs next door and easy access to stores eateries you name it  
P => Perfect Location I took  teenageers to the city for an overnight  We booked the Doulbletree on hotwire for night  We were very happy with the large room  bedroom suite which had a queen size bed in the bedroom and a queen size sofabed in the living room  The bathroom was huge  We had a great view of Times Square  All in all it was perfect  
P => recommend recommend recommend I bid  on a   star hotel on hotwire com not knowing which hotel would be waiting for me at the other end of the quotsendquot button  This was the hotel I received I am thoroughly impressed with both hotwire and the Doubletree Suites  I had heard a lot about how small Manhattan hotel rooms are since real estate is at such a premium in nyc  The Doubletree Suites are located smack dab in the middle of Times Square and the room is well a suite  We had a very comfortable king size bed and the children slept on the pull out couch in the quotliving roomquot which was in excellent condition  The entire suite had been recently reorated and there were large flat screen tvs in both the sitting area and the bedroom  There was also a mini fridge a bar sink an in room safe and the bathroom was spotless and very modern  We were lucky enough to get a corner suite on the nd floor and we had amazing views from two vantage points  As for the cleanliness this hotel room was immaculate  The sheets were crisp and new and the room was cleaned to spotless condition both days we were there  The front line staff was uber friendly the concierge was likewise and the guys at the baggage counter bellhops watched our bags for the day after we checked out for a nice tip of course I could find absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel  Spacious modern clean awesome location friendly staff the Doubletree had it all Oh the chandelier in the main reception could use dusting  There I found something negative  This was an awesome experience  
P => I love this place If you want to stay in Times Square or Midtown area I highly recommend this hotel  You get a full suite with a completely arate living room    not the traditional quotNY suitequot which is a slight larger room with a two foot mini wall dividing the quotbedroomquot from the quotliving roomquot  Most people would be scared of the noise being right in Times Square but I usually seem to get a high floor and rare hear much street noise if any at all  
P => An okay room The price and lack of amenities make this room hard for me to recommend highly  It is a nice room  It is clean and has a ent amount of room to move about  The sofabed is okay but not that great  The hotel gives out free cookies after lunch  It has wifi but not in the room  If you want it in the room it is   a day  They dont have a complimentary breakfast but Mcdonalds is two stores down  Around the corner is a little shop that does wonderful breakfast sandwiches fresh  It isnt crowded or expensive  when coming out of the hotel make a right around the corner and go about  yards  My family loved the breakfasts from there  The hotels location is excellent and right in the middle of Times Square  
P => GREAT HOTEL GREAT SERVICE This was our first stay at a Doubletree Hotel and it exceeded our expectations  We debarked from our cruise on Monday morning at am and the hotel was a mere  miles from the Manhattan cruise terminal  Since we were early and we didnt call for early check in we had a little wait  As soon as a room was available we were speedily checked in  Ami at the front desk was very professional and courteous  We were offered complimentary breakfast for  for the duration of our stay which we did not expect but a great bonus nonetheless  Breakfast was good with a ent selection  The pastries were delicious The room was spacious clean and comfortable enough for  people  Housekeeping did a great job and there were always enough towels  There is a arate vanityKitchenette with coffeetea maker and refridgerator and microwave and wetbar  The sitting area has a pullout bed arate flat panel TV and desk We did a city tour through Grayline Tours and got our tickets in the hotel  The downtown tour buses pickup are very near the hotel the uptown buses are about  block away not too far  As for restuarants we ate at the Olive Garden which is in Times Square just opposite the hotel  This was the fastest sit down service we ever got The street vendors also sell good food at good prices and portions are large enough for two  One particular vendor sold Lebanese food on nd and th street south of Broadway  Since it can rain at any time its a good idea to have a poncho or umbrella handy  We did a lot of walking so comfortable shoes and a bottle of water were a must  Even if there are no kids in your party go and see the Toys R Us store  We had a great stay in New York City and we will definitely be staying at this hotel again when we plan our next visit to the big apple  
P => Great Hotel  Perfect Location  Stayed here for  nights with girlfriends and we had no complaints  I recommend this hotel to anyone  Hotel is in the center of Times Square which made our stay even better  I definetly would stay here again  The room size was perfect  Beds very comfortable  Nice bathroom size  Thumbs up for Doubletree Times Square Suites  
P => For Times Square I guess you cant beat the rate Overall you are going to pay a lot for a hotel in NYC  Well in perspective this hotel might be a steal considering the prices of other hotels that look over Times Sq Check inThey were very helpful in that we had an extra room and they worked it our without charging us  I think they were over booked so they were happy to do it The checkin was quick in the fact we were doing the room swap thing  RoomNice big rooms  I think they all have a living room area and also the bed room  More then enough room to spread around if you have a few people in the room  I also had a corner room so Im sure it was slightly larger then othersBathroomNo problems here  Hot water was quick and I never ran out  Nothing special and nothing gross which is a plus TVI had a problem with the flat screen in the room and this is where they lost points for me  They wanted to send someone up to look at a TV that wouldnt turn on at  in the morning  The operator was just a jerk about it also  I did leave a note for the manager and never heard anything so I guess they really dont care that much  As for the TVs they were nice flat screens in both rooms InternetThey had free wifi as far as I could tell but the connection sucked  I kept getting disconnected and got slow speeds  Same thing with my co worker on another floor LocationVery good if you need to be in Times Sq  So remember there are always going to be crowds and its going to be loud  I was on the th floor and I could hear street noise sometimes  Also the curtains sucked so they didnt block out all the lights flashing  OverallI think its worth it if you want to be right in the middle of it there  Prices are higher but for the most part everyone was friendly at the desk and helpful except for that one jerk I got on the phone  
P => Good location and room to relax  We stayed at the Doubletree from e  th  As a family with  kids we needed a room with some space  As things turned out our oldest couldnt go with us but the  and  year olds enjoyed themselves  They liked being in the middle of all the action and it was convienent to walk to so many places  We saw  shows while we were in town and all were easily reached from this hotel  There was a subway station right next to the hotel and several others close by  Having the McDonalds a few steps away was nice for when they got the munchies  It was nice having  TVs and  rooms  My dhter and I had arate mirrors in the mornings and my husband and son had arate sinks for shaving  Kept the conflict down  The first day we were there the bedroom TV didnt work but it was quickly replaced and we were given a free in room movie  That night the tub didnt drain very well and we found ourselves standing in several inches of water during our showers  We called on Saturday morning and they spent  minutes on repairs but comped us the Sunday breakfast buffet   per person My husband wondered if he could find anything else that didnt work Ha The maid service was very good and Jimmy downstairs on the door was the best  Got an extra nice ride back to the airport due to Jimmy  so big shout out to him  Mid week we recieved a fruit bowl and a tin of cookies  You dont get luxury but the service is good and the location is great especially with older kids  The crowds might be a little scary for very young children  If I were going back alone with my husband I might choose a hotel a little farther from Times Square and a little more romantic but with kids you cant beat the Doubletree  
P => Great location comfortable bed but a little disappointed My husband and I stayed here e    and were disappointed with several things  The room was much smaller than we anticipated bathtubshower had a lot of rust in it and the furniture was aweful  Now the bed was VERY comfortable and I slept like a baby  We stayed here back in  and we had a fabulous room and it was a great stay  I just think with this being a very busy hotel they are just letting the age of their rooms show  The location is fantastic and the view from our room had a  degree view of time square but I just dont think we would stay here again  The housekeeping was lacking also  Happy Traveling  
P => Excellent location with average amenities This hotel is right in the middle of the action  Times Square and all the hustle and bustle that goes with it is right out the front door The hotel itself is ok  The staff is friendly and the amenities are average  The hotel rooms and common areas are a bit dated  We ate at the hotel restaurant only once during a  night stay  The food was unrekable  If you don t care about such things but want to be close to the action you could do worse than this hotel  
P => doubletree has action all around it doubletree guest suites is one of the finest hotels in NYC  located just about     minutes from JFK airport right in the heart of broadway  the entire locality is hustling and bustling with life and action  everything is like a block or  away from the hotel  shopping from the best brands to the best malls restaurants of all types broadway shows times square    you name it and its there  you get a panoramic view from the room as they are situated high above  the rooms are very spacious with a living room followed by the bed room  they provide in house entertainment like movies video games PS etc  since it is so centrally located you spend your entire day roaming NYC  i would recommend anyone staying in NYC that double tree is the place to be in  superb location most curt staff valet parking service very confortable living since the rooms are located quite high for us it was onthe th floor your right in the middle of action an yet away from the noise when you want to be  
P => Centric hotel This is my favorite hotel in the Times Square area for two reasons  The space and the centric location  It lacks a good service response a nice accessible entrance it is not that quiet unless you book a suite in the higher floors and it is a little expensive but the extra space is worth it  
P => Fantastic view and wonderful room  great hotel When we first pulled up in front on the hotel in our taxi we were a little hesitant to get out as it was a busy Saturday afternoon and wondered what we had gotten ourselves into with the mobs of people everywhere You enter into a small room with a guard at a podium who asks for your name on the check in list and sends you up to the rd floor  at night you have to show your room key to the guard upon entering  When you get off on the rd floor there is a small bar with some snacks and a small lounge area and the check in counter  Everyone we encountered was very nice and helpful  We were told we were upgraded to a Conference Suite and our Times Square view was granted  Our room was fantastic it was on the th floor and a corner suite We had a large bath only negative  one sink nice sized bedroom with the most comfortable king size bed and a great view to look at over the nice desk  We had a dining room with a large wet bar and a coffee maker fridge microwave oven  The view was spectacular but the living room view was to die for  Our boys shared the pull out sofa bed which they said was very comfortable and they slept with the blinds open every night to take in everything  I also have to mention the room was pretty quiet too  As I type this sitting at the dining room table looking into our living room I see the  and ball that drops for New Years Eve   views out of every window and and not into another building  We had paid for the breakfast included pkg which we were so glad we did because there really isnt a ent breakfast place around that serves a full breakfast  The breakfast is a buffet with a large variety of food items Everything is in walking distance great restaurants theaters and the tiks booth across the street where you can stand in line to buy same day  price show tickets which we used twice Also the hop offon tour buses are also within walking distance I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to experience a true NY experience 
P => girlfriend getaway This hotel offers the best location and arrangement for a sisters or girlfriend get away in NYC  We were in the center of it all and had a  room suite to relax and visit in when we werent out and about  We think it is the only suite hotel in Times Square too 
P => Best Times Square view you can get comfy spacious suite This was my th visit to New York  I stayed here th  for  nights and paid  per night including tax in advance to get the cheapest rate  I chose a King suite with a Times Square view  I really liked the room  The bedroom is arate so you can enjoy a quiet night without being disturbed by any noise from guests walking past the room  The sofa bed was fairly comfortable and the fridge was useful  The giant flat screen TV in the living room did not work properly  I am sure if I had reported it I could have got it fixed but we did not spend much time in the room  Check in and out was very quick and easy and the hotel stored our luggage on our last day  The bar in the lobby was small and always very quiet but there are many bars around the hotel for a more lively experience  The best thing about the room was the view  We could see all of Times Square  I don t think any other hotel in the area could give you as great a view   one that is now even more interesting since Broadway has been shut off to traffic and you can sit on chairs right in the middle of Times Square I have stayed at the riott quis in a Times Square view room and it was not as spectacular and cost a lot more  The area is obviously very busy all the time from the moment you step out of the hotel but you only had to go round the side of the hotel and there was space to stand without being disturbed or on the new light up red stairs above the TKTS booth outside the hotel   From my experience the rates at this hotel are usually pretty high but if you can get a great rate like I did I really recommend the Doubletree Times Square  The following weekend I stayed at The Hilton on th Avenue which was also very nice and I have reviewed this hotel too  
P => Greatest location and room size Located in the hub of Times Square the absolute best location Our room was totally quiet with no street noise  Comfortable and roomy accomodations and the staff was so great The cookies are the bomb Not one negative to comment on  Thanks for a great stay  
P => right on times square centre of everything My Wife and year old dhter just spent  days of hem in Manhatten and in all honesty I was dreading it I really hate touristy stuff but my dear wife insisted we go  LOVED IT     Great Place Had an absolute ballAnyway the Doubletree hotel   people in    a night excluding breakfast  Not bad for a room with one of the most iconic views in the world  the one with the tickertape Wall street results and giant TV screens I have paid a lot more for a lot worse Clean quite nice people Really easy to deal with A late check in no problem be  minutes till we were in the lift  The room  was a king suite smoking and had views both onto the square and up Broadway  Nice bedroom lovely bathroom and a fine small lounge  Because we smoke I tended to keep the lounge window open and the noise is amazing  Alarms screams sirens more sirens different sirens music seriously NewYork do you really need emergency vehicles to scream at maximum volume at three in the morning  Did it matter NO if it had I would have shut the window  We slept the sleep of the dead due to extreme New York Exhaustion  If you want peace and quiet try Alaska Breakfast was in a wee diner round the corner We did not eat in the hotel and was supremely New Yorkian in nature with massive portions  I dont think in the whole  days we had cause to talk to any of the hotel staff apart from the concierge on the last day  We got tickets for some shows from their booking people Next to reception and boy were they expensive  If you are able to plan things ahead buy your tickets on the internet a few weeks in advance    much much cheaper  I dont care how good the show is  for   hours of a broadway show is just too much particularily if there are several of you going If you want to see a good broadway show then wait till it comes to a theatre near you     For my wife and dhter the fun was sight seeing and shopping and shows for me it was museums bars archetecture talking to everyone  I think the point is that no matter what you are after You can get it in New York  Everyone had a great time and this hotel is perfectly placed to make it easy Taxis to the door th street Metro The yellow R one in the basement seriously Red and Blue Bus tours across the road  and walking distance from more fun than should or actually is legal yet still safe at three in the morning Well safe ishYou will notice that this review doesnt say much about the hotel  Well thats because unlike many other hotels round the world they did not wreck my trip  They were easy nice simple and lots of other words that dont denote any ultimate highs or terrible lows and frankly in this city thats the best kind of hotel you could ask for  You get the highs and lows out on the street the hotel is for sleeping in and storing your stuff  Other stuffA well stocked if a little pricey fridge and a spare empty fridge for the your own drinks and snacks cool idea  Pun intendedInternet      Who the hell charges for internet these days       No one except apparently cheapscate New York Hotels    a day but totally worth it to find stuff in New York on google  I still think a con is a con though    Good security at night you dont get past the front door without your key after about pm    Excellent idea in this area  Not sure what happens if you lose your key    Easy access to great food great entertainment great shopping Great bars and night clubs  Also available within easy walking distance is crap food rubbish entertainment expensive shopping for stupid people with too much money Drink drugs rock and roll and well an awful awful lot of fun  And the Doubletree guestrooms are perfectly placed for it all  
P => Great location service as usual As a Hilton Platinum VIP I stay in many locations in NYC  I was defaulted to this location due to NYU graduation and was concerned I would be bothered with noise  What a surprise This place is sound proof and has now become my first choice over the Hilton Garden for future trips to NYC  The front desk staff is the best I was treated great  
P => best hotel for kids  I arrived at this hotel to be greeted with warm cookies The staff were wonderful friendly and efficient  I even got my meal free  evening because they were  mins late delivering it to the room they even included more cookies for my  dhters to apologise for delay  the rooms are bright  spacious sound proof v important when staying in times sq I stayed on the th floor as it was a smoking floor but my views were still great and my room was cleaned and polished every day I even received a note from the chambermaid one day to say thank you for the tips I was leaving the area is great tkts booth right outside mcdonalds next door and toysrus  mins walk subway entrance at the door of hotel I would highly recommend this hotel for families but even for single travellers as no noise travels from room to room  I will def stay again I got this hotel on hilton website and it was only  per night if booked few months in advance fab price security is great there as you have to go to the rd floor to get to the reception  great place 
P => Fantastic place to stay with kids I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to families traveling with childrenteens  We have three kids   and  and finding a hotel room with enough space for us all is a real challenge  The Doubletree had plenty of room with two double beds in the arate bedroom and a large comfy pull out sofa  We stayed on the th floor and our room which had a partial view of Times Square was incredibly quiet We found the staff very friendly and helpful  Our requests for extra towels etc were attended to quickly  No request seemed like too much trouble  In fact the front desk staff were very indulgent of my kids helping to fit batteries to their new toys aquired at Toys R Us just down the street The location is great for kids  Everything you need including a subway station is right out your front door  There are loads of great places to eat nearby  My kids favourite was Johns Pizzeria We had a great time in NYC and our stay at Doubletree totally enhanced our experience  
P => Great Rooms Fantastic Location on Times Square Doubletree Guest Suites on Times Square is a great place to stay  At the entrance to the hotel theres a TKTS booth where you can get tickets to shows on and off Broadway Times Square visitors centre you can get show tickets here too Duffys square which is great for people watching the entrance to the th St subway station and the theatre where West Side Story is playing  You can easily walk to Central Park th Ave shops the Empire State Building and much more  We walked to the Winter Garden Theatre showing Mama Mia in less than  minutes  It sure beats staying further away and having to take the subway to all these places especially if you have a group of  to  people saves  per person per ride if you can walk The rooms are spacious and comfortable good shower large LCD TV and sufficient amenities for a comfortable stay  And despite its incredibly busy location the hotel is very quiet  Go ahead stay here 
P => Highly recommended  other women and I stayed here for  nights in   It is a great location and even though very bustling right outside the door the room was very quiet and comfortable  The  room suite was very spacious especially for NYC  The service could not be better from the front desk concierge bell desk to the maids   as good as I have received at  star hotels  The beds were very comfy but the sofa bed was not  The warm cookies were such a welcome treat and the mini bar was very convenient  The location is highly recommended for someone who wants to see the tourist spots  
P => A fantastic stay My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree suites Time square for our annual mothers day trip  Everything about this hotel was excellent  The service at check in was quick and easy  The cookies were to die for  The room was a two room suite  It was nicer than I had expected  The room was clean the bed was excellent to sleep in and the shower had excellent water pressure and tempature control  The location was fantastic right on time square  There a broadway theatre next door playing West Side Story  There loads of restraunts with in a couple of blocks and the subway entrance is right next door too  I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know who headed to NYC  My wife and I will stay there again next time we go to NYC  
P => Excellent Value for money  This hotel is in the ideal location for all sights ie Rockerfella Centre Fifth Ave in walking distance  Macy s Empire State Building only one stop away on subway yellow N Grand Central Station only two stops away on subway Green   Central Park walk in  minutes  Staten Island Ferry  minutes on Subway Red  to South Ferry This hotel is very comfortable rooms are very large Living room with quot Plasma plus arate bedroom with another tv kitchen area with microwave coffee maker with complimentry coffee fridge  Massive king bed I got lost in  
P => Exceptional Our stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites was from     th and was everything and more that we had hoped for  Yes the cookies at check in are warm and delicious Loved the idea of having to show your room key to gain access to the elevators in the evening  The lobby is located on the rd floor and then you must take another set of elevators to your floor but they are so quick there was virtually no wait   There were four of us in the suite and upon arrival we noticed only enough towels for three called their quotcarelinequot and before we knew it a knock came to the door with an ample supply  We also received a call to make sure the towels arrived   such good service The room was very spacious the beds heavenly The kitchenette area has a sink coffee maker safe microwave and mini fridge  Loved having a arate sitting area This hotel is the best choice if you want in Times Square Just across the street is the TKTS booth which has tiered seating above it   these provide a great area to sit eat lunch and watch all the sites of Times Square  The Doubletree Guest Suites is the perfect place to stay expecially is you want to experience Times Square Cant wait to go back  
P => Wonderful Hotel   Great location Stayed here for a long weekend over Mothers Day  This was one of the best places we have stayed in the city  Extremely clean  Staff was more than helpful and friendly  Room was great size for myself husband and  children  Had no problems with noise  We were on the th floor so I am sure that helps  Had room service one evening and it was fast and tasty  The location is what really put this hotel over the top  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do  If we needed to take a cab there were always plenty out front  This will be our hotel of choice from now on  
P => Great Place LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION PLUS  Suite was PERFECT for Mother dhter and aunt get away Location is fantastic for theatres and dining Staff is friendly helpful professional  Furnishings and amentities surpassed our expectations Will definitely return  as we think quottheatre get aways are going to be a part of our quottraditionsquot 
P => Excellent location great room This location is superb  Right in the heart of Times Sq  Walking distance to Rockefeller center and St  Patrick s Cathedral  I did not have any problems with the noise but others  want to bring earplugs to sleep  The view of Times Sq  was awesome from the th floor  The curtains need to be closed at night to shut out all the bright lights  The room was ample and had a safe a fridge a mini bar fridge microwave coffee maker and bar sink  The elevators are fast and I never had to wait more than  seconds  The bar in the lobby is overpriced  for a shot of Patron  for a house Chardonnay There is a security guard on the ground floor before the elevators that take you to the lobby floor  You need to show your key to go up  Cabs are plentiful and there are several subway stations within blocks  They have a ent fitness center The big con is that you have to pay   per  hours for slow internet  That is a real rip off  
P => Good value if you need a suite Stayed here  nights on family trip without kids  Mom stayed on sofabed and complained about thin matress  The second day I told reception and they put an extra matress there  That solved the problem  This meant that the sofabed had to be unfolded the rest of the trip  This was no problem since my brother stayed in another suite down the hall Helpful concierge reception staff etc etc  We did not have the breakfast theres plenty of nice eateries around the block Best hotel bed ever very quiet on the nd floor convenient for three people good coffee included  
P => Great Location   worth the price We just returned from a  night stay  There were  of us so the suite suited us just fine as it has two doubles and a pull out couch  The location in Times Square is awesome Subway is right next door lots to do right when you walk out the front quiet when you need it as well  The room has a fridge and a microwave so we stocked up on drinks and snacks to save a bit  Lots of delis and other restaurants are right there as is the discount theater ticket booth  The staff was very friendly and helpful  
P => Pleasantly Surprised We were pleasantly surprised how great this hotel was Yes  its in a BUSY location  so its not the easiest place to just pull your car up and unload your luggage  However the bellstaff are very helpful and friendly  They do a great job considering the busy entranceWe had a room on the rd floor  It was a quotPurequot room clean air  And I have to say  it does make a difference Room was spacious for our family of  and surprisingly very quiet I never heard a toilet flush from another room never heard a peep from neighbors and couldnt hear any traffic noise from outside  Very comfortable bed And a very clean roomGreat view from windows My son just loved sitting at the window and watching the sightsWe never ate at the hotel so I cant comment on that But overall a great stay I would definitely stay here again 
P => Right in the heart of NYC A great location for our spring break stay  We had tickets to West Side Story and  to  and we were able to walk to all the shows  TKTS is right across the street  The entryway is right off the street and has security after  at night  The lobby is on the rd floor and the registration staff were pleasant and accomodating  The big plus is the warm chocolate chip cookie given to each guest upon arrival The rooms are spacious and clean  Housekeeping was excellent  Our suite had a large sitting room with a big screen TV  The bedroom had two double beds and plenty of big plump pillows  The thermostat was easily adjusted which I find is not the case in most hotel rooms lately  The price is a little higher than some hotels in the city    but thats NYC  Would definitely stay here again  
P => Superb Location   Very ent Hotel This is a standard large hotel perfectly located  The hotel is right on Times Square across the street from the discount ticket office close to a subway line and within walking distance of Broadway theatres and lots of restaurants The staff were uniformly pleasant but be advised that the staff is small for the size of the hotel the lobby is tiny and is actually on the third floor one set of elevators brings you up from the street on th Ave to the rd floor and you must transfer to another set of elevators to get to your room  We stayed in a suite with a king bed the rooms are not large but quite reasonable for New York  The two rooms a bedroom and a sitting room with a pullout couch were clean with a small fridge a pod coffeemaker that can brew two cups at a time you ll get two caf and one af pods a day two TV s a desk plenty of drawer space but there is limited space for hanging clothes  The room was rekably quiet if there is traffic noise check to make sure the windows are tightly closed We ate at the restaurant once and had the breakfast buffet the price was typical for NYC but they do omelettes French toast and pancakes to order which is a nice touch  Service was adequate but not extraordinary There were lots of families many with elementary school aged children and so the elevators were almost always busy and sometimes noisy but not obnoxiously so BOTTOM LINE  stay here for the superb location and because this is a ent hotel  If you are looking for luxury then go elsewhere and pay more  
P => Enjoyed our visit   the best beds weve ever slept on  The location is perfect for enjoying all that Times Square and the Theater District has to offer  Being on the corner of th and th youre literally in the heart of it all  Yes the sidewalks can get quite congested but its Times Square  There are several subway stations in the area  Overall the service was nice  Hot warm cookies at check in were a plus  We had an issue with our safe and it took them only  or  minutes to have a serviceman at our door and the problem fixed  The rooms are all suites so theyre plenty spacious which is really nice after a long day of hitting the sites  The bathroom amenities are top of the line Nutrogena products so no generic stuff  They even provided sunscreen  And theres a television in both the main room and the bedroom  And the beds    wow the beds    Hilton rightly coined them their Sweet Dreams experience  If only all hotels had such wonderful beds and pillows  My wife and I had no trouble sleeping at all  Well have no qualms about booking this place for our next visit  
P => Great Location We visited the Doubletree Guest Suites as part of a New York holiday to celebrate our wedding anniversary and used my husbands Hilton points  This got us a very good breakfast as part of the deal  The hotel is ideally situated for shows etc even though it can be exceptionally busy on the sidewalk beside the hotel making bringing luggage in etc  a bit difficult  However our room was great clean and comfortable  Only issue we had was the fact that during our stay there were weddings on every night which meant there was no access to the restaurant and nowhere in the hotel where you could get a coffee  The bar is pretty lifeless and unattractive but because of the location and all the places to go nearby it was not a major problem  
P => Unexceptional service but beautifully furnished hotel I had a special free breakfast or free parking rate  This very expensive all suite hotel is located in Times Square so its location is ideal but its arguably the busiest place in Manhattan so dont even plan on parking here I tried and it gave me such a headache I parked in New Jersey and took the train to Manhattan  The free breakfast   well the cordial but relatively unfriendly hotel clerk did not even mention it I had forgotten about it  I overslept and it was too late for breakfast anyways  The wireless and connected Internet does not work on high floors  Wireless internet is free in the rd floor lobby and th floor restaurantlounge though there is a hefty fee for quotusing itquot in your suite if you can manage to find a connection in your suite  The suite was beautifully furnished a very comfortable bed and Neutrogena toiletries  Overall definitely too expensive for the price paid but if money is no option the location is ideal  The chocolate chipwalnut warm cookie given at check in was definitely a nice touch though  
P => Best kept secret I took a family group to NYC over Easter weekend and stayed here using Hilton points  The two beds and sleeper sofa easily accommodated our group of five  You could not get a better location for touring nor could you find a nicer more helpful staff  The most comfortable beds ever and good food too  The hotel is not fancy with very modern or but it is quiet despite its proximity to Times Square and was just perfect for our needs  We saw two shows and took a tour with Onboard Tours which was the highlight of our stay  Just wonderful  I will address in a arate review  Stay at the DGS  You will not regret it  
P => great hotel and location for family of four We family of four kids ages  and  just got back from a five day trip to New York City and it was absolutely wonderful The Doubletree Suites are located right on Times Square very busy area but close walking distance to theaters and other sightseeing  Very safe area lots of police all around  We lucked out with a corner hotel room    King size bed in bedroom sleeper sofa in living room and eleven windows looking out on Times Square where there were nine tv screens to watch  The kids loved this and would just sit in front of the windows in awe  Other hotels in the area are the riott quis and Renaissance but the suites at Doubletree are lmuch ower priced  It was great to have a suite so after the kids went to bed the adults could stay up  Having tvs in both rooms was a nice touch early riser kids can watch tv before the rest of the family has to wake up  I knew hotels in this area do not offer free breakfasts so I usually went down to McDonalds or Jamba Juice across the street or next door to pick up something to bring back to the room  Other times we went to delis in side streets and ordered food downstairs at the counter before taking it upstairs to the dining room  We had very good dinners on th Ave and th street at seille Michelin recommended and Nizza italian  Having dinner on BroadwayTimes Square is not advised its just too crowded and hard to keep an eye on your kids while you order at the counter and carry a tray  The hotel was great and we felt very at home  Clean quiet wonderful beds big and soft towels  Requests for extra blankets it was cold and snowed one day were immediately satisfied  Free cookies were a nice touch  Price and value match well  Just dont eat at the hotel or order room service very very expensive even for New York standards but we knew this ahead of time through reviews  
P => Great location in very busy part of the City My wife and I spent a Saturday night here in  to celebrate our anniversary  The hotels location is perfect if you want to spend lots of time in Times SquareTheatre District  It is across street from the new TCKTS booth cool design and next to the theatre playing West Side Story We found the service to be good and the room just awesome  Our room had a great view of the New Years ball  It was just delightful to watch the people and lights in the evening One complaint the couch in the living area was really bad  The cushions were way to small and kept sliding off the couch  Just wasnt very comfortable to sit on while we watched a movie on the big screen TV  I wish we had chosed to watch the movie in bed instead but I thought it would be better on the bigger TV  None the less the hotel was just wonderful  
P => Spamtastic My first time in NY I ided to stay at the Doubletree The location is right in the middle of everything  Walking distance to anything you need while in NY  The theatres are only a few blocks  The rooms were not small  I booked a king bed and they are not lying when they call them quotdream bedsquot I dont even sleep that good at home like I did there The lights are bright but they have black out curtains barely hear any kind of street noice  There are two TVs a mini bar refreshment center micro fridge coffee maker and a safe  The coffee is wolf gang puck I couldnt drink enough of it  Also has tea cups ice bins ice machine on the same floor and mini bottles of shampoo body lotion facial scrub room service gives you more each day The towels are plush unlike other reviews the water pressure is awesome did not turn hot and cold on me All and all its a simple hotel for the busy life of NY  If you like fancy then I dont recommend it but if you like to kick your shoes off and feel at home then doubletree is perfect 
P => If youre in the city for theatre   cannot beat the location This was my first time at the Doubletree Suites Times Square in NYC  To compare Ive stayed at the Waldorf Plaza Sheraton midtownth forget which one   theyre basically interchangeable riott NE side riott quis some I forget   and even the Milford Plaza I was in town for just  days mostly shopping and theatre  I dont really like the Times Square area due to the crowds but I wanted to be able to walk to all my theatres because I hate to try to find a cab after especially if its raining  So   Doubletree had a FABULOUS rate at   I opted for a  rate for a similar room but with a view and on a higher floor  Turns out this was a waste as the view was nothing to speak of  All the hotels were offering great deals during this time  But Doubletree offered the rate location AND a  bedroom suite  I couldnt say no I arrived early in the day and my room wasnt ready  I am a travel agent so I checked the day before to see if they were full knowing Id arrive early and they werent  My assumption is that they wanted to keep their guests on as few floors as possible for housekeeping safety elevator use and the fact that they were reating  No worries  I stopped back and still no room  Thats OK still early  By early afternoon I was exhausted so I checked again no room  I went to the restaurant for tea but was told quotwell have a server bring some out to youquot  The idea was to find a nice comfy place to sit and relax while I waited on my room  I was pretty offended and went to my old standby the riott quis for tea instead  The Doubletree is on the corner of th th and Broadway  just at the corner of the new TKTS location  Bold splashy sign but tiny entrance with doorman and security  Heated lights in the overhang above the entrance are a nice touch  Inside   youre usually asked to show your room key in the evening  Elevators up to rd floor are quick   you never wait more than a few seconds The lobby is small with a few seats check in desk bar never open when I was in the lobby   which was a lot   dont know if its closed for the reation or  BUSY bellmen mostly storing peoples luggage for their room wait or for the day after check out and a concierge desk Restaurant is on another floor with tasteless blood red walls in the hallway   which reminded me of The Shining   Id heard poor reviews of the restaurant  The tea incident didnt help  Then we ordered room service one time and it sealed the deal  Bad  Really bad  If we werent RAVENOUS   Id say definitely inedible  Check in was quick and I was offered the required Doubletree cookie   which I lined  My dhter was joining me later that evening and they said quotonly one of you right nowquot   and were only giving me one anyway so I didnt want her to not have one so I said no  They told me earlier I had a package with an amenity and theyd give me a coupon when my room was ready  I never got that either and forgot to ask again We had a room on the st floor facing   ummm   I have no idea  But you could see the river from the window in the hall near the elevators  The room was huge  HUGE Living room with a pull out sofa the cushions on the sofa are a hot mess   you cant even sit on the sofa without them slipping off desk and chair another chair TV on a huge credenza that housed a mini bar  In this same room was a long kitchen bar with a sink coffee maker with Wolfgang Puck coffee we brought our own tea so I cant comment on the taste of the coffee fridge   probably a microwave but I didnt see one  The fridge was cold too Imagine  Those little fridges never seem to keep drinks cold  The bedroom had  doublequeen  beds and the bedding was very comfortable  Tons of pillows  A large cabinet with an ironing board and iron probably a TV I never looked  The bathroom was very nice  Tub  Toilet  But a long ble vanity with two sinks hairdryer  The trash cans were divided into recyclable and rubbish sides  The windows in the rooms opened  The temperature control was easy and the room cooledheated quickly when asked  There were a lot of families at the hotel very few business people  The size of the rooms and location are of course the reason  But there is a  hour business center and I think  hour workout room  We didnt have time to visit these  Overall Front desk personnel were adequate lobby and bellmen were very nice rude service waiter was extremely rude AND the food was bad location great room great housekeeping was excellent  It happened to be a great deal for this trip  But Id definitely pay a lot more for the hotel if I wanted to be in this area  BUT   Im ALWAYS needing supper after theatre and as I travel with my dhter dont always like to stay out late to do that  We partake of a lot of room service breakfasts and suppers  So I probably wouldnt select the hotel again mostly due to that reason as well as a couple of gruff staffers   Im really big on service   I know this is not a price point where one can expect much   but good service is free  Still   all in all   a perfectly adequate hotel depending on your standards for these things  The room and location are fabulous  
P => Great location comfortable for a family My family of five  adults plus  children spent  nights at the Doubletree Guest Suites  You cant beat the location if you are sightseeing in Manhattan  We saw a couple of Broadway shows and I was so glad that our hotel room was only a short walk away when we got out of the show late at night  The kids loved the impressive view of Times Square from our th floor room  We had a suite with King bed in a bedroom and double sofa bed in a small living room area  The sofa bed wasnt they never are but the King bed was more comfortable than average  We had adequate space and were comfortable in the room  The front desk and bell staff were very helpful and friendly  There was a small mistake on the bill and the front desk clerk cleared it up immediately  Warm chocolate chip cookies upon check in and check out I would definitely stay here again  
P => Great Location if you want to be in the madness Stayed here for  nights with the husband on our first trip to NYC  Check in was quick and we were upgraded to a corner room overlooking times square on the th floor  The room was great and we were pleased we paid a bit more to stay in a hotel with suites as it was good to relax on the sofa at the end of a tiring day seeing the sights  Hotel is in great location if you want to be in the thick of things and right opposite the half price theatre ticket booth which now takes credit cards  We were in easy walking distance of all the main broadway shows th av  central park empire state and Madison square garden etc  Loads of eating options close by but the dismal exchange rate makes everything expensive at the moment  The only negative we had was the concierge not amazingly helpful and quite dismissive despite there being no one at the desk behind us  A minor issue though and we would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends P S  Avenue Q is fantastic 
P => Very average hotel fantastic service My mom and I stayed her for an extended weekend trip to NYC  We are regularly in NYC and have stayed at many hotels in the theater district and around Times Square  This hotel is extremely average in all categories except for service  When we arrived we were upgraded to a conference suite by a very friendly gentleman at the desk  All the staff was incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome in their hotel  The room itself was very dated in or though they have upgraded the beds  The bathroom was large though and the neutrogena ammenties were replaced every day  The windows offered a panoramic view of Times Square and you could shut the lights out with the shades at night  We had a drink in the lobby bar one night    the drinks were good but very pricey   per drink is a little steep even for New York  The lobby bar is beautiful but as a previous poster mentioned its not private or secluded    its right in the middle of the check inout madness and next to the elevators  The elevators were faster than I expected and we rarely had to wait very long for an elevator even though we were on one of the higher floors  The wi fi was TERRIBLE while we were there  It faded in and out and often didnt work at all during half of the stay  At  day I expected better  Overall its a pleasant enough stay at the right price but had I paid the  they were asking for New Years Eve  I would have been severely disappointed  However it is not one of my favourite hotels in the area and I dont know that I would return  The hotel is rather bland  
P => Best hotel in times square I stayed in this hotel ch rd till ch th  I had a corner times square view room and have to say it was a great room with an amazing view   The room was a good size with a living room a arate bedroom and bathroom it was very clean and bed was very comfy  Its in a great area right in Times square lots of food places and shops close by I would stay here again    
P => Perfect for a Theater Stay I was so pleasantly surprised by this property and will stay there again  Quite simplyPros Great room  I had a double suite on the th floor  You pay a little extra for this room but it is totally worth it  Very up to date furnishings  Both rooms the living and bedroom were large  The room was completely quiet and had a great heating cooling system  The bed as others have said was great  Enough plush towels and clean  There is a mini bar ice machines on the floor and two TVs which came in handy with my teenager in tow  I have no complaints The service was very pleasant from the Front Desk to the security at the entrance  No one is allowed to just wander into the hotel from the street  You must show your room key to security on the street level and then take an elevator to the lobby where the room elevators are found  The security guard was very helpful when I asked him how to get to the subway  I honestly didnt expect him to be so nice  Room service was prompt The location was outstanding   right across from the discount Broadway ticket booth and only a few blocks from just about every theater quite a few subway lines and some nice restaurants on  and th AvenuesHells Kitchen for pre theater dinners  They have a concierge at the front desk from  am on  I wish I had known right away because I believe you can also purchase show tickets at her desk  Instead I had my husband order them from home on line and could not pick up the tickets until  hour before the show at the theater  There is wi fi in the room that worked with our i touch Cons Nothing that would prevent me from staying here again  The lobby is nothing to speak of and didnt seem to have any windows  So it is not the place to make a splash if meeting someone  The outside quee is a little over done for my taste but when I was looking for the hotel after a long walk it was a welcome site  Room service charges were a little overdone  This is not a quottrendyquot hotel so if that is your goal dont stay here  This is vanilla ice cream  
P => Great location for New Years party  if that is what you are there for Stayed here many times  We got a very small room this time   but the view of Times Square was incredible  We looked right down to the stage  But get ready  It is crazy   tons of security to get through to get pass baracades  After  pm you had to show a special badge to even get back to the hotel  Once you go out of the area you cant get back in if you are not staying within the cooridor  Many people had to stand for    hours  Saw lots of them with little kids   which was crazy    so if you are going to watch the ball drop   the Doubletree is a great hotel and good value considering the rates at that time in the city  
P => great value for Times Square location This was my second stay at Doubletree  Check in went smoothly and I had a king bed suite on the st floor  Only no looking down upon Times square this time  My  seniors rate only gave me a side view but thats OK  The room was clean as was the bath and the bed was be the most comfortable Ive ever experienced  The sitting room TV was a good size wide screen model  What I dont like though is the menu you have to navigate to get to the TV channels  It would be nice to be able to immediately choose TV when the set comes on but this is a minor quibble  I had asked for extra coffee when I made my reservation  And there was plenty awaiting me  Probably  extra coffee packets and creamers  Wireless Internet access unlike last time worked properly and I had a ent connection every time  On my prior visit I was on the th floor and had to get a gadget from the front desk to get any connection at all  The people at the concierge desk were always helpful and willing to answer questions  When I told the lady I liked British fare she recommended a place just around the corner that served Cottage Pie and such  I tried the Bangers and Mash dish sausages and mashed potatoes and while it was tasty the sausages were American meaning totally wrong flavor  Another day I found a wonderful steak place that was also just around the corner  You were served cafeteria style and got to watch your steak being broiled over an open flame  The meal was very good and was not too expensive I found myself stuck in New York by a major snowstorm that hit just before the day I was to fly home  The reservations desk quickly extended my stay by a day  even moving a new reservation to a different room so I would not have to change rooms  All in all I had a great stay and would book at Doubletree again if I could get a good rate  
P => Birthday Trip To NYC   Great Location This hotel is in a great location   After months of looking and having stayed in DBT and Hiltons before I chose this hotel to spend my th Birthday with my family  As soon as the booking was made via telephone from UK  The problems started  Wrong charges wrong allocation of people to rooms  Overchaging of   It took lots of emails and calls to US to sort out  So on my arrival I was already wary of what could happen  Then I met Doris on the Frount Desk who was the most patronising person in that role that i have ever met  After lots of sorting out we finally moved rooms the next day and thias was down to Dobrina Carrara AFO Manager showing Customer Care and skills that you would execpt from a chain such as Hilton The rooms are large and very clean  Beds were bliss although my dhter had to sleep on sofabed for  nights  Breakfast in Gingers was excellent and this was given FOC because of all the problems  All other staff that we came in contact with were very nice I just wished when boking out that we had had Daniel to book us in  We wre still owed  and he sorted that out  He knew his job and more I would go back if just a couple  
P => Great Spot For First Time Visit Stayed th     nd    First time in New York   of us  my wife and I plus our  sons    Very central easy walking distance to Central Park  th Avenue  Rockerfeller  Macys  Empire State etc   A few steps to the metro for longer trips   Great cookies on arrival and also given to us several other times through our stay  Staff very good and helpful   As it was our sons th they upgraded us to the top rd  floor with a great skyline view  Very nice   Good teacoffee making in room   Microwave and Fridge but no plates cutlery etc   Breakfast expensive at  but we went to the Edison Hotel cafe down the street opposite and paid approx   per person  excellent value   Also have a flight confirmationcheck in machine in the lobby to check in online and print boarding cards which we did for our return journey with British Airways  I think most other airlines are also included   Had a great stay and would visit again 
P => Great for tourists and business travelers I have been pleasantly surprised with this hotel  Having stayed at the Hilton Las Vegas last week this is so much better  The room is big enough for a family and confortable enough for the business traveler  I logged right on my laptop without any internet issues at all  Bathroom amenities include a whole selection of Neutragena products The showertoilet area is a bit small but the fabulous room location and views make it a non issue  Highly recommended  
P => This was a gift for the price I dont think i will ever find this kind of rate in this hotel ever again we paid a AAA rate of   and you are right on Times Square I thought that be it was near Times Square but you are right in front of the big screen tvs Hotel was excellent check in around pm was quick and smooth  The front desk clerk tells you were everything is the welcome cookies were an awesome detail and they tasted really good  The bar is right in front of the front desk rd floor  liked the chandeliers they were sort of different  We had the th floor facing the side but for the price i could see too much I imagine that those facing Times Square will probaby cost an arm and a leg   Our room was one king bed and you also have the small living room as you walk in with a sofa bed desk tv a wet bar which under it has a small fridge a small microwave and a safe  Where the tv was theres one of those expensive snacks and bottles of water that you dont touch unless you really need or have to  The bathroom is nice and very spacious  Room was very nice clean and comfortable you have few lamps and another tv  Two entrances to the bathroom one thru the room and another one thru the living room  Every floor has an ice maker which we used we always bring sodas and snacks especially when you have kids but on this trip they werent with us  Overall experience was outstanding  Ended up going to eat to a Cuban restaurant Havana Central that was awesome It was just around the corner and it was referred by one of the valet guys when we asked for a Spanish restaurant  Theres also a comedy club right next to the restaurant and around the corner from the hotel  Parking was   plus tip since the car gets parked for you there so paying for valet at the hotel is not necessary if you dont mind walking  minutes to the parking garage thats where they park them anyway Internet is   in your room but at the hotel lobby is free they disconnected my internet before check out time so i had to use it at the lobby  I would recommend the hotel any time and feel welcome to bring kids the only thing is that there is not pool but having Times Square in front of you and couple of tvs i dont think its so necessary  You could still hear the sirens from the city but not biggie cause i was exhausted when i went to bed  Bed and pillows were sooo nice and comfortable 
P => Great for families We stayed here in e   Two couples and two young kids  yo amp  month old shared one room and it worked out great  The room was clean and plenty large enough for all of us to feel comfortable  There was an entrance to the bathroom from both the living room and the bedroom which was nice bc the other couple was up earlier than us and didnt have to disturb us to get into the bathroom We are not huge fans of the Times Square and prefer a less quottouristyquot New York experience but with kids you cant beat it  It has two arate rooms in the suite with a door between  And there is plenty to do right outside your door  
P => Big Clean Excellent for Price Travelling to NYC with  kids and wife in   Excellent price to hold  people in the room  The room was big above average for NYC quiet we stayed at th floor the lowest one and clean  It is located in front of the ticket booth in Times Square  If you are in NYC for shows or shopping this is perfect  Just expect to see a lot of people as you step out of the hotel The free internet service is available only at the lobby  
P => Great Location Great Staff We just returned from a four day mini vacation at the Doutbletree Suites Times Square  Good this hotel through company website  Got a great rate  Stayed on the th floor very quite  The kids  and  were greeted by warm cookies  The front desk staff was excellent some of best most helpful customer service I have experienced at a hotel in a long time  The doorman was always pleasant and helpful  This was a two room suite large bathroom great comfortable beds  TV in living area and one in the bedroom area  The engineering staff was great the housekeeping staff was great room cleaned very well every day  They even made sure I had extra coffee  The safe was a nice addition to the room no charge We did not eat at the hotel or in Times Square  block away at th and th Ave  had many excellent well priced non chain type places to eat  Close to everything we need to do  The Tour Bus Subway Grand Central Station Rockerfeller Center TKTS booth right across the street  We have no complaints at all about this hotel  We will return the next time we are in NYC A great place to stay for families  
P => Major problem with lack of internet access in rooms Nice hotel but serious disadvantage was wireless that did not work in the rooms  They disabled the internet connections in the room and yet the wireless network was terrible  It took over  minutes just to pull up one page in the rooms  I was on the phone with the help desk extensively but still no improvement even after they reset the wireless on the floor  We had two computers and both had the same problem  We finally went down to the business center and were able to access the internet  However we stayed for several days and needed the internet connection in our room  We found several business people in the business center complaining about the problems with wireless access in their room  They should either put the internet connection lines back in the rooms or fix their wireless network  Otherwise this hotel does not work for anyone needing internet access  
P => Excellent Trip Rooms are very nicely orated and very clean and large  Actually this is  rooms since this is a suite  Bathroom is large and had entry from both rooms  Flat screen TVs in both rooms  Fridge and microwave in sitting room  Wolfgang Puck coffee maker in room  Although in Times Square right in the middle of everything we found the rooms to be very quiet  Rates are really good for NYC The people that worked there were very pleasant  We went to a play on Broadway and only had to walk  blocks  Never used the restaurant in the hotel but we used the gym which was also very clean and up to date We were very comfortable there and would go back again  
P => Good value quality hotel As per many trip reports we found this hotel very adequate  We drove in to NYC and drove up to the door to be greeted by the valet dropped our cases off before dropping the car off down a few blocks The reception is a bit odd in terms of layout and we found check in very slow although staff were pleasant and helpful  The cookies were very nice on arrival We were on the th floor and enjoyed comp wifi access  The suites were large with flatscreens ent size lounge  The rooms were clean and functional  Shower not very powerful Didnt eat in the hotel but had a look in didnt look very glamoros with no windows and musical theme cannot comment on the standard of food Seems they are reating on the rd floor near the business suite  We printed from the room and went to the suite but it was very clear how to pull the print job  However we called the hotline from within the business suite and they assisted straight away Security on the door checked our key cards after a certain time at night  They were also very helpful calling cabs On the whole I would recommend this hotel for a first time visitor a fantastic location to walk to most sights  
P => Fantastic We stayed at the Doubletree hotel in Times Square for my boyfriends st birthday and it is FANTASTIC the location is out of the world and the rooms of the hotel are gorgeous the beds are HUGE the bath room has to two doors into it it is that big one into the lounge area and  into the bedroom  It really is great hotel with a superb location and the view from the room is great looking over Times square at night with all the lights on really is somethingWe went up the Empire State Building which was an experience took us  and half hours to get up but it something you have got to do you are there so you have got to go up it really is fantasticThe shopping on th Avenue is great everything is just overtop and bloomingdales the sweets and chocolate floor in their is just like wow oh my gosh I would DEFO recommend this hotel you cant beat the location it is just fantastic 
P => Good location Stayed on the st floor and it was very quiet  Could not hear the street noise at all LikesComplimentary internet cos of Gold Hilton Honors MembershipLarge room with sofa bedMini fridge and microwaveWarm cookies every eveningNear subway  St Subway   NRW lineRight in the heart of Times SquareDislikesLousy breakfast policy   all members in the room should get the free breakfast especially if we are Gold Hilton Honors Members  How silly if there are  members in the room and only  get the free breakfasts I think Doubletree need to rethink their breakfast policy Lousy service in the restaurant   understaffed 
P => Absolute bargain Whether you like this hotel or not I guess depends on how much you pay  We got an upper floor one bedroom suite for just over  and I have to say it was an absolute bargain  Its a great location right in Times Square where the subway lines all interconnect so you can go anywhere from outside the door  Our suite on the th floor overlooked the side street and though we could see some of the lights of Times Square it was incredibly quiet  No street noise at all  The bell boys in the street level lobby were really helpful  We got three seriously yummy warm chocolate chip cookies at check in  The room was great for us and our two kids aged  and    the lounge had a pull out sofa and the hotel supplied a cot crib for the little one  The bathroom was functional rather than glamorous and the shower was more of a drip than a downpour but there was plenty of counter space and nice neutrogena toiletries  There was a door into the bathroom from both the bedroom and the lounge  Both rooms had flat screen TVs and there were real coathangers with hooks in the wardrobe  The bed was big and comfy with lots of pillows  When we checked out with our vast quantities of luggage the bell boys were helpful in getting us an oversize taxi  Quite frankly at the price we paid whats not to like 
P => Great location very nice hotel post remodel I ve stayed at this hotel a few times for business and leisure and generally keep coming back for  the location and  the reasonably priced rates  It s a good combination for doing tourist or in my case business activities and generally the rates are in the   per roomnight range which is quite reasonable given that every room is a suite  I am a Hilton Diamond member so get free breakfast and an upgrade of sorts which are welcomed perks  It s nice that the lobby is above the ground floor as you don t need to worry about it being too crowded  Overall I d recommend it as my hotel of choice in the Times Square area especially if traveling with   friends or family members due the extra space  
P => Nice Suite and Great Service A suite was one of our requirements  This fits the bill  Our hours arent always the same so it was a plus to be able to shut the bedroom door and watch TV without waking my wife The service from everyone we encountered was very good  Hanna at the restaurant Alex at the bar AJ at the concierge desk all the people at the reception desk the maid for our room and the two maintenance men that adjusted the temperature on our fridge were all outstanding No request went unanswered No problem ignored We were there     to celebrate our th anniversary and just booked e    to celebrate my wifes birthday  
P => Great Hotel for Family Visit  Book A Conference Suite We stayed at the Doubletree Times Square starting new years day and had a great time We have a family of   kids and had no problem fitting into the conference suite bring sleeping bags for more than  kids  There are two rooms and a large conference table that seats   It is a true suite since there is a door to the bedroom with a arate door from bedroom into the bathroom  We were on the th floor with an amazing view of Times Square  At night it was a great deal for NYC  One night we just had  guests and takeout and ate in the suite at the conference table I agree with other reviewers that the lobby is less than desirable but who cares Just outside the door are dozens of restaurants bars etc  that would charge less anyway for a drink  The location while great is a nighte if you arrive by car  Dont drive if you can avoid it and if you do dont arrive at night when people are going to the theaters  It took almost a hour to travel the last few blocks to the hotel  Also avoid Bond  restaurant on th Street unless you want a very mediocre meal for   
P => OK stay We just returned after a  night stay at Doubletree Times Square We found that the website phots are misleading  The lobby looks absolutely nothing like the pics  Albeit they were working in the lobby but I still dont see it looking anything like the pics posted  We arrived early and was allowed to check in around   When we asked for a room with a view we were told they didnt exist for the double rooms  Ive since found that to be untrue The furnishings in the rooms were not the greatest for the amount we paid per night    I have stayed in much smaller and less clean places in NYC but would stay in the MIlford Plaza over the Doubletree next time Its just as nice and less  if you dont mind not being right on the square I also didnt know anything about breakfast coupons until I read an eariler post  As a Hilton member I feel I should have been told this  The cost at   per breakfast became alot of  for  people We go to NYC every   but am not so sure Ill stay here again  The location is awesome though  I couldnt ask for a better one Also Shannon one of the conceirge staff as exceptionally friendly and helpful  
P => Great suite right in the heart of Times Square Spent a hectic  hours sightseeing in New York with the family whilst visiting the States and used the Guest Suites as a base for our Big Apple stay We hade one suite with two rooms which was plenty for the five of us  Didnt use many of the hotel facilities and lobby was being refurbished whilst we were there but the rooms were good great comfy beds and the location in Times Square was fantastic Took in Central Park Bloomingdales FAO Schwartz The Rockefeller better views than Empire State a Knicks game Staten Island ferry Wall Street Century  etc whilst there   all with a good nights sleep at the guest suites Dont miss the hot cookie on arrival 
P => Unbelievable room in an unbelievable location My wife and I were booked into a room at this hotel by our cousin for one night the Saturday before Christmas  What a room It was a suite with an incredible view out the window looking down onto TImes Square  The staff was friendly efficient and top notch which was especially appreciated because we arrived late in the day and the lobby was under construction in the midst of a huge reation conditions that usually lead to a long wait in line and abrupt service  In this case however everything was perfect  
P => Doubletree Times Square Great Location Ive stayed here twicw with my wife  The location is perfect for shows walking distance to attractions etc  
P => A Great Place to Stay Our family of  stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square ember st   th and loved it  The room accomodated the  of us perfectly and we loved the location  Our kids were visiting New York for the first time and the Times Square location really wowed them  We liked the central location and walked most everywhere  The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating  The rooms were suprisingly quiet  Would highly recommend staying here we felt like it was a good value for the money  
P => Perfect location Just returned from a one night stay at the Doubletree to see a show and NYC at Christmas  We were able to check in early and given a room that overlooked the MampMs store my sons favorite place  We were a  minute walk to everything we wanted to do  Yes the crowds are hard to navigate when you exit the hotel especially when the theaters are starting and letting out but thats the fun of Times Square you just go with the flow The lobby construction looks almost to be done but it wasnt an inconvenience at all  The rooms are huge compared to NYC standards arate bedroom living room big bathroom and wet bar in the living room  We will be staying at this hotel whenever we return its great for families  Also if you are traveling with children s  is a really fun place to go to dinner  The food is so so but the whole experience is quotout of this world quot 
P => This was a great birthday Treat I booked this through quotcheaptickets comquot  What a perfect location I was in NYC to celebrate my birthday with friends    I booked it the day before my birthday for less than  including taxIt faced the lights of Times Square which made me so happy I booked there  I really felt like I was in the middle of it all when I looked out the window  The room was HUGE for NY  Two rooms one queen bed one pullout couch and a bathroom which was bigger than the one I have at home TV s and a mini bar Wow what a good deal for the money Granted it is not a  star hotel but I really considered this a quotscorequot for the money   and it was just a couple blocks from Winter Garden theater where I saw Mama Mia Carolines comedy club was next to the theater so I had a really nice birthday Having the weather be  degrees was a bonus but I cant guarantee that for you I can say the hotel was great   also allowed late check out  
P => Loved the Doubletree Times Square I booked a Hilton Honors stay at the Doubletree Times Square for    and was pleasantly surprised After reading some reviews on check in and potential rude employees I was a little concerned  No need to worry and this place is in the middle of everything you need to get to  Having never been to New York we found it very easy to navigate to our broadway shows and pick up the tour bus across the street Also if you are an Hilton Honors member you receive  breakfast copupons for each night of your stay  At  per breakfast that definitely helps out  If we visit New York again I wouldnt hesitate to book at this Doubletree again  
P => Great Choice We stayed at the hotel from    using Hilton Honors points  We arrived from Los Angeles at  AM and were very pleasantly surprised when they allowed us to check in early  We were given room  which faced Times Square  We were very happy to get a room facing all the lights and sights of Broadway right beneath us There were  of us staying so it really came in handy to have the suite with the family room and the pull out sofa  The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable and I was told that the sofabed was also comfortable  We also liked having a microwave and a fridge in the room for drinks and leftovers We were somewhat low in the hotel on the th floor since I believe the hotel has  floors but the noise below was manageable  We didnt have any problems sleeping  The heater in the room wasnt the type to set by degree and was tricky to find a medium between warm enough and too hot but once we did it was fine  The location of the hotel is the main reason why we chose this hotel and we were not disappointed  It is right across from the TKTS center and we used it one afternoon to get tickets  We saw a couple Brodway shows and it only took  minutes to walk to either of them because of the centralized location  We spent the remainder of our trip at a hotel a few blocks east and missed the location at Times Square  There is a subway entrance right beneath the hotel that we took downtown and the location is great because there is so much within walking distance including Rockefeller Center Central Park th Ave and more  I was worried about the hotel lobby being reated before the trip but it was no problem at all  You need to take an elevator from the ground floor to the lobby on the rd floor but it was no problem at all and added an extra sense of security  Overall we really enjoyed this hotel and location and when we come back to NYC we will stay here again  Its a great place  
P => Perfect Times Square location We are just finishing a one night stay at this hotel which is the ultimate central location if you are visiting Times Square and the theatre distric  Hotels are booked and rates are up in this week before Christmas but we scored a suite with two queen beds and a big pullout sofa in the living room for  including all taxes etc  The accomodations are much bigger better and more comfortable than anything we have experienced in NYC in that price range  We would return here in a minute 
P => Very pleased with Doubletree My wife and I stayed two nights in ember and were very pleased with the entire stay  I asked for a high quiet room and was booked on the st floor at the end of the hall perfect The rooms are true two room suites and are very clean  Could be considered slightly dated but not enough to be a concern especially at the price This hotel is in an ideal location for Times Square and the lower part of mid town  Every staff member we encountered was friendly and seemed interested in our satisfaction  We would definitely return By the way the lobby reation was not bothersome in the least  
P => Spacious rooms in the heart of Times Square When the hotel says they are right in the middle of Times Square they arent kidding  This makes everything you could possibly need well within a short walk be it shopping dining or sightseeing The rooms at this property are true suites not the mini suites you find at something like a Springhill Suites  The living room is significantly larger than the bedroom and I found myself watching the plasma screen TV in that room and reserving the bedroom for sleep  The bathroom has an entrance just inside the front door to the room and as you walk through the large bathroom you can exit through another door into the bedroom  There is a small bar area in the suite   perfect if you are entertaining though I didnt find it particularly useful  I did come in late so the well stocked mini bar provided the usual snacks to take the edge off my hunger until breakfast the next morning My review is only average because there is a lot of construction going on  Breakfast takes place in a big meeting room that can get loud as it fills up  The or is a little dated and the heating in the suite is a wall heater that has dual vents to share the heat between the two rooms so one room is usually hotter than the other Altogether though this hotel usually has the best rates in this part of NYC and is more than adequate for the business traveler  
P => Spacious Rooms  We spent      at the Doubletree and would love to return on our next trip  On the day of arrival we called early in the morning to request an early check in and a room on a high floor if possible  When we arrived around  PM our room was not quite ready so we had the hotel hold our luggage complimentary  The staff at the baggage storage desk were excellent  They helped tag and secure our language all the while smiling and with great patience  Despite the bustle of the hotel I felt reassured that our luggage was safe and well taken care of  At check in we received chocolate chip cookies with warm and gooey centers  Just how I like them We had room  and upon arrival were impressed with how clean and comfy everything looked  Our  room suite one bedroom  one living room was a luxurious amount of space for  adults in NYC  Two slept on the king bed and  more on the pull out couch  There was also a fridge microwave and mini bar    which we promptly locked after reading that the bar could be quottouchyquot and accidentally charge you for items that you bumped  I appreciated having a nd sink in the living room area for drinking water  Also   the in room coffee was surprisingly tasty  The bathroom had  arate entrances so you could enter either from the living room or bedroom  Our room had a partial view of Times Square but the amazing thing was that the room was INCREDIBLY QUIET and we are light sleepers  Dont worry   blackout curtains easily hid the blinking and sometimes blinding lights of Times Square  I also liked that I could crack open a window if I wanted some fresh air since most hotel windows are sealed tight  As for the lobby construction there was zero noise and inconvenience aside from the ladders and workers being in the lobby  The location of the hotel is great  Its close to a subway stop TKTS booth across the street and an array of restaurants within walking distance  Having never stayed in the heart of Times Sq it was a different experience being in such a busy area  You walk out of the revolving door and its a continuous stream of people walking either direction Overall this was a fabulous hotel for the  per night price we paid from Hotwire  The amount of space and location were phenomenal features and I would highly recommend the DoubleTree 
P => Great Location We stayed at the Doubletree on times square for the second time in a year  The location cannot be beat its right across the street from the TKTS outlet  and right in the heart of the theater district  The rooms are nothing to write home about  They are clean roomy for  people they have a microwave and small fridge that never got cold and is equipped with a bedroom bathroom and erate small living room with a pull out bed but the hotel itself is okay  they are going through some kind of reation at this time the lobby area is sort of a mess the hallways look like you are in a  star hotel not at all like a Hilton Hyatt or similar  but you come to NY or enjoy the city not the hotel  So all id like to say is the location cant be beat and the subway is across the street or right under the hotel depending if you are going uptown or downtown  Loved the city and the sites hotel is also very acceptable  
P => Conference Suites are Great We stayed in one of the xx conference suites and had a dinner party with  people  It was perfect  There are two differenct conference suites  The  suites and the  suites  The  suites are bigger and have more windows that face north and west  They also have  full bathrooms with tub and showers one off of the living room  You get a great view up th Ave and can see Central Park and when you look out the west facing windows you see the northern half of Times Square  The  suites face south and west and are smaller because they wrap arround one of the elevator shafts and only have  bathroom and not as many windows  However the south and west windows let you see all of Times Square  If a view of all of Times Square is top priority than go for the  suite  Some of the photos on the Tripadvisor web site are taken from one of the  suites  If space is a top priority plus a second full bathroom go with the  suite  the pictures on the hotel web site are the  suite  We have a lot of family in the area and ided to rent the conference suite because it has a table that seats  and thought it would be nice to invite family and order room service  Eventually we had  but the room has a second table in the bedroom on wheels that fits under the desk so we pulled this out and put it at the end of the conference table  The room service people were great and brought up extra chairs and tablecloths  We ran out and got our own appetizers and wine and beer because the room also has a refrigerator small but held a lot of beer and cheese and dip sink and microwave  Family came at  and had appetizers in the living room a little crowded for  but not uncomfortable and then dinner at  in the dining room  Room service came right on time and the food was very good for room service in a hotel  steak Mahi Mahi Salmon a very large choice for a room service menu  They also have a arate catering department if we had wanted to go that route  What we look for in a hotel is a lot of space in the room  We have also stayed in the regular suites and they are quite comfortable but do not have a dining room table  Our family had a great time because there was no time rush like at most NYC restaurants and we could be as loud as we wanted  the rooms are well soundproofed in this hotel  After dinner some people stayed at the table and some went into the living room and turned on the TV  Very relaxing for dinner in NYC We arent the types that like to be fussed over at hotels so the fact that this hotel has a small lobby that was undergoing repairs didnt bother us  If lobby appearance is important to you this hotel isnt for you  The furniture in the room is very nice but not elegant kind of like our home which is great if you are bringing children  This was a great stay and the staff did a great job  Will have another dinner party again here sometime in the future  For what we wanted it was perfect  If you want an impressive lobby and elegant furniture this is not the place for you  
P => Good Stay I stayed at the Doubletree from ember th through the th  My room was on the nd floor  It was extremely convenient to everything  I travel to NYC about twice a year to see theatre and I usually hunt for a good rate for a ent hotel  My favorite hotel used to be the Rhiga Royal until it was bought out and swanked out of my price bracket to the NYC London  In y I stayed at the Dream Hotel which was trendy but I got a super cheap rate and didnt mind the small room  But I digress The Double Tree is a great location and tons of room  I loved having the arate living area as I have friends who I meet up with and its great having our own living area to chat instead of in a hotel bar restaurant etc  The bedroom section was very comfortable  The bathroom was a little bit dated but it was in fine working condition so it was no big deal that it didnt have the super deluxe new look   It also doesnt have the price tag associated with that look either I found having an empty refrigerator instead of a mini bar a blessing  I loaded up on my favorite beverages for my stay The maid service was very attentive and always prompt with my requests  I frequently asked for more coffee and condiment packets with my room cleaning and I always came back to a clean room and plenty of coffee to make for me and my friends The location can not be beat for seeing the Theatre  Almost everything is within a  to  minute walk except for Lincoln Center which is a bit of a hike  about   minutes walk The hotel lobby was still under construction but aside from a few congested periods during my stay it was barely an issue So the bottom line  would I stay here againAbsolutely as long as the price is what I consider to be reasonable for NYC  I paid around  per night for a  room suite  which I consider high value indeed  Of course the economic downturn could be a part of why the room was so cheap but It was a great deal I never used their restaurants or room service  With some of my favorite restaurants nearby why should I Part of the excitement of NYC is the great choice of restaurants 
P => Heart of TImes Square Fabulous location and great for families  This  room suite was perfect for our family of   You enter from the livingroom which was nicely orated and had a pull out queen sofa sleeper large wall to wall window to view Times Square below  A large counter area with a small regriderator micrwave and small sink and a small table to have meals  A small but adequate bathroom led the way towards the bedroom which had  queen beds a large armoire with  in tv large window to view Times Square and nicele orated as well  The lobby was on something liike the th floor and check in went well  There is little room out front of the busy hotel to park to check in so we had to circle block to unload our bags from the car  We came in from Long Island and after checking in dropped the car at the rental as you do NOT need or want to drive in the city  Public transportation and walking is your best betLots to see and do  You can not do it all in just a few days so dont try to  Read up and pick your favorites   we were here for only  days and chose Double ker bus tour kids loved riding up top New York Yankees game Lion King musical free ferry ride to Staten Island which goes by the Statue of Liberty walking tour of Times Square NBC studios beautiful old cathedralschurches street performers great food and night life The city that never sleeps 
P => What I expected I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites for one night with my two kids ages  and   The hotel was exactly what I expected it to be  a big hotel chain larger sized rooms busy Times Square location and clean  minus a few hairs in the shower  The room consists of two rooms   one has a pullout sofa and the other has two beds  My  year old slept on the sofabed I slept on one bed and my  year old slept in the other bed  I was traveling without my husband which was a good thing because the beds are not that big although they are comfortable  The location is th and th just on the outskirts of Time Square  You step out of the hotel and there are people everywhere and lights lights lights Our room faced the back and was quiet of street noise but the walls are a little thin and the person next door was blasting the tv and I could hear it perfectly  I am very familiar with NYC and I picked this location mainly because I was traveling alone with the kids and we were going to see a show and I wanted a short walk back to the hotel  It was literally two blocks from our theater  If you are looking for a high end hotel this is not it  If you want a comfortable spacious reliable chain hotel in the theater district its a good choice  
P => No Surprises No surprises  Its exactly like every Doubletree out there  Rooms were clean and beds comfortable  Its right in the middle of Times Square so for those that prefer that locale this would be a good option for those that enjoy an authentic experince go to Queens and have a pint in one of the last few remaining Irish bars in Woodside 
P => Definitely stay here again We stayed at this hotel   th to th we are  Irish ladies who went on a shopping trip We booked a quot doubles  room suitequot and we had plenty of space believe me we had lots of bags but never felt like we were tripping over each other There are  sinks and loads of mirror space so no problems getting ready Its smack bang in the middle of Times Square but we couldnt hear ANY noise from our room and the drapes must be blackout because it was so dark at night and the beds were comfortable so a good nights sleep was had by all this is not always easy in NY  Other hotels weve stayed in had a lot of traffic noise  We were there during the reations but it didnt inconvenience us in any way and we didnt hear noise from that either yes it looks a bit unsightly but we dont spend much time hanging around lobbies theres too much else to be doing and we never encountered any queues at the desk Front desk staff are really friendly and oh those cookies    We didnt go to the barrestaurant because why would you theres so much on your doorstep  we saved a fortune in taxi fares because its so central  The quotEvergreenquot diner around the corner is good for breakfast  will get you breakfast and its served late be all day  We will definitely be back to this hotel in fact weve checked rates already for next year the rates are so good at the moment for what you get  We wouldnt hesitate to recommend it     
P => Liked this Hotel I stayed at this hotel with my husband in    Located on Times Square it was like living in two worlds   outside it was like being in a madhouse inside it was peaceful and clean  I am returning to the same hotel in ember  with my Mother as I know my way around from that point and know exactly how to find things without too much stress    it IS completely mad outside but inside its like breathing a sigh of relief  Not the absolute best hotel I have ever stayed in but very good for the money  
P => Great Stay Four of us booked our  night stay    in NY at the Doubletree Suites Times Square and then I read a couple of reviews and got concerned  However we had a terrific stay  Our room was on the nd floor with a great view south  The only time we heard any noise was when we opened the windows  The beds were really comfortable  as were the pillows  The huge counter in the bathroom plus the mirrorsink counter in the living room really worked for our group of   It was very clean We called up for more coffee on our first morning and it was at the door within  minutes  Followed by a phone call from the front desk asking if we had received it yet  GREAT SERVICE  The concierge helped us with show ticket info on several occasions The location really cant be beat  We arrived from the airport at pm  checked in  dumped our luggage in our room went across the street and bought half price tickets to a show and were in our seats at the theater by pm  So that lovely warm chocolate chip cookie they give you on checkin was a life saver as we didnt get to eat until much later Although the lobby is under construction right now  it wasnt a problem at all We will definitely stay there again  
P => Great and quiet view of Times Square Excellent one night stay in ober  On the th Floor with a view of Times Square  All the lights signs and people but none of the noise  I was absolutely amazed at how quiet and dark the room was when we closed the curtains for bed  Room was nice   bed bath and living room with wet bar  Bed was very comfortable but the linens were not fantastic  One note of caution they are doing construction in the lobby and when we were there it looked like a disaster area  You walk straight into a set of scaffolding when the elevator opens into the lobby and there are sheets of black cloth covers the walls by the room elevators  Turned out this didnt impact our short stay but it was pretty jarring as our first exposure to the hotel  
P => Best NYC Hotel IF YOU ARE GOING TO NYC   STAY AT THE TIMES SQUARE DOUBLETREEI am an extremely frequent traveler and stay at hotels across the world approx  nights a month  I was lucky enough to retire early and travel mostly for pleasure  That said I am always looking to get the most bang for my bucks Honestly this is one of the best hotels I ve stayed at and there are three very specific reasons why  The Service was amazing  As soon as I stepped out of my Taxi NY taxi ride is an experience to say the least  I was greeted by a doorman that managed to make me feel welcome and special  Not only was he friendly professional and helpful his unique  New York  approachfeel was unforgettable  I entered the hotel and felt extra safe by the  level lobby and  hour security guard stationed before the elevator  Please read reks below about the  lobby reation  My check in was a perfect     The front desk staff understood my needs and recommended the perfect suite for me  I had read a lot of reviews as usual and wanted to make sure I got the perfect room  All of them were great  Between the front desk and the concierge I feel like I really understood what I was getting into and was able to plan the best possible trip  From that point on everyone I encountered whether I was riding the elevators or having a snack in restaurant was really  genuinely  friendly and helpful  I really felt like they were happy to go out of their way and help with whatever I needed   Physically the space I had in the suite was quite literally twice as large as other NYC hotels for the same price  Let me say that again you get a full bed room AND a full living room for the same price that most other nyc hotels charge for just the bedroom  This was absolutely amazing I can t believe that all these years I have been staying in the  trendy closets  some of hotels call rooms Location Location Location Right across from the half price broadway ticket both the Doubletree is in the best location at the heart of nyc  The only negative is that while I stayed the hotel was under reations in the lobbys and restaurant  This meant that the lobby did not really have any place to sit  The restaurant was fully functioning  To be honest this did not really bother me too much as I was out all day anyway  In the suite I could not hear or sense the reation at all The pictures of the new lobby look great and I am looking forward to seeing it done    Overall this hotel is truly a steal  Enjoy your visit and make sure you stop by the front desk aside for check in  The agents are awesome And a warm cookie is never far behind their great recommendations and their warm smile 
P => Terrible Customer Service overwhelms nice rooms If you like Times Square and want a  room suite this hotel should have a lot to offer I certainly hoped so  But after  nights the terrible way they run the property has overwhelmed any nice feelings I ever had about it I think it is one of these cases where the staff has learnt to have enormous contempt for their customers and it shows  I suspect that this must come from the management down  It manifested itself from the rude and off hand way that we were greeted at the check in desk To the arbritrary and odd way they ided to cancel our room service order as they were too busy and not tell us about it keeping us waiting in our room for  hours  PS Also watch out  We were billed for two items from the minibar even though we did not open it  
P => A pleasant experience despite misgivings This was my rd trip to NYC in three years  The first trip we stayed at the Milford Plaza   nice central location but very noisy at night and the room was tiny  Our next trip in   I chose the Courtyard by riott   Midtown east  Excellent hotel in a quiet business district about   blocks from Times Square  I was planning to stay there again because i feared the noise in Times Square but at the last moment checked rates and switched to the Doubletree because I didnt want to hear our teenager complain about the walking LOL  Also the Doubletrees rates were about  less for the whole trip  nights than the Courtyard The first requirement for us is a king size bed with a pull out sofa for our teenage son  The Courtyard has this as does the DoubleTree  Many hotel rooms in NYC are small old and cramped  We got a two room suite at the Doubletree for  a night  It was perfectThe rooms were very modern large and clean  Down pillows a refrigerator microwave granite counter tops flat screen TVs  We lacked for nothing My second requirement is that the room be quiet  In all the large cities I have visited traffic noise at night has kept me up  Weve also experienced this in Rome London and Sydney  I have learned through experience to stay on a high floor When I booked the Doubletree I had the option of paying a few more dollars for a high floor  We were on the st floor and it was great  The only noise we could hear was the occasional siren Times Square is very central to everything in NYC  The location cant be beat  The down side is it very very crowded at all hours of the day and night and maneuvering the crowds while going in and out of our hotel was a little daunting at times but manageable My only complaint is when we were leaving this am the doorman asked us if we needed a cab to the airport   we did  He then told us it would be  and tried to steer us towards a private car and driver  I said No it was only  from LGA on the way here   knowing that there are a lot of faux taxis out there that dont follow the NY Taxi Commission fare rates  The doorman said well it all works out the same    but he did point us to a yellow cab  The rate to the airport was in fact   I didnt appreciate the doormans fib and the fact that he was steering us towards a private car  He could have explained our choices   private car  or taxi  and let us make that ision upfront Other than that excellent service and visit  
P => It Works     I was staying at the doubletree while on a business trip  The facility lobby entrance and bar is under heavy construction which makes getting around difficult at times  Despite the construction the rooms were in nice shape  This hotel quotworksquot for a business trip but I am not sure I would go there with my family until the construction is complete  
P => Right in the Heart of Times SquareBroadway Theater District This is a great clean hotel right in the center of the action in Times Square and Broadway  Its a perfect stay for visitors with everything right outside your door There are  floors so street noise is not an issue  Instead youll get a SUITE which is a rare thing in the Broadway area  Suites have a small fridge and a microwave and a arate living room from the bedroom plus a TV in the bedroom and one in the living room The lobby is currently undergoing reations but your stay shouldnt be affected  To get to the lobby you enter on the street level and take the elevator to the lobby floor  So there really isnt much to the lobby anyway We didnt eat in the hotel   why would anyone There are tons of restaurants in Times Square and the neighboring Restaurant RowHells Kitchen area  Take your pick If youre looking for an awesome location in the center of Manhattan with a suite plus Doubletrees fantastic chocolate chip cookies upon check in this is the place for you  
P => Nice location and room BUT      My husband and I stayed in a Kings Suite at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square on the nd floor an alleged upgrade  As Hilton Honors Gold members we received complimentary continental breakfast offered daily at the Center Stage Cafe restaurant and wireless internet service in our suite  The hotel is located in the midst of Times Square   great location but like most hotels in Times Square no hotel driveway or great magnificent lobby The hotel is very accessible to subway There were however some kinks associated with our stay  Although the internet service was free the connection was terrible It was intermittent Very frustrating  The king sized bed was very comfortable except that the airconditioning vent blew straight to our heads and could not be repositioned Their minibar system in the room was so sensitive that even if you slightly touched any of the soda cans you will be instantly charged for the item even if you didnt buy it We were charged for  items when we only purchased   Their only restaurant Center Stage Cafe on the th floor was alright   nothing great  Their barlounge next to the restaurant was pathetic We had our cocktails elsewhere   there are many other nearby local bars which were far better and worth the walk  Hotel lobby was being refurbished when we were there Probably would not return to this hotel   too bad because we really liked the size of the suite 
P => great stay The staff at the double tree are welcoming and very helpful from check in to check out  Finding band aids getting extra blankets and easy baggage storage on our last day Room was great worked out with kids in tow  All in all a great stay  
P => Great for Girls Getaway If youre looking for a spacious room for a girls getaway weekend this is it  Two comfortable queen size beds if you dont mind sharing  The sofa bed in the sitting room is not so good for older gals backs  Two sinks on the vanity and one on the wet bar provided each person her own space  Situated right in the heart of things  Memorable 
P => Good location for family stay Stayed for a week with wife and three teenage dhters  Hotel was clean quiet we had an upper level room   I thought it good value for money  One tip  when using the sofa bed follow the instructions exactly and dont remove any of the sofa cushions prior to folding it out or it wont be comfortable Not stayed in any other NY hotels but would guess the rooms were larger than average  
P => Really nice Three of us checked in for  nights on ust   We had  double beds sofa bed in living room wet bar and large bathroom with double sinks  Very clean and good layout  The staff is excellent  Everyone does their best to please you At the corner of th Ave  and th St  you walk out of the hotel and the subway is right next door and that is great 
P => where the action is Comfortable clean hotel with warm choc chip cookies great king size bed and adjoining living space smallish but manageable with sofabed and large screen tv located in the heart of Times Square 
P => Most convenient location We were parents and adult sons staying here for three nights in ust  We recommend this hotel if you want a central location walking distance from many attractions and shopping and literally on top of a subway station  The hotel will work for you if you are happy with a large impersonal but clean and efficient experience at this type of location for a reasonable price  However do not expect any form of personlised service  Do not expect the room staff to respond to written requests to leave enough non aff coffee sachets for the number in the party or to do anything else non standard  Do not expect the concierge to give you any help which doesnt involve selling you something and do not expect to have breakfast in the restaurant without queueing for at least  minutes with an inefficient system  Also be aware that the one downside of the location is that most of the time to enter or leave the building you have to fight your way through the hoards of people queueing for the theatre next door and when you get into the ground floor lobby you will be accosted by security guards before taking the first of two lifts to get to your room  
P => Terrific hotel We stayed at this hotel from ust th until the th of   It is very well located at the heart of Times Square corner of th Avenue and th St   Broadway theaters are within sight less than  minutes walking distance  Nice restaurants are in the vecinity  minutes walking  Also very nice stores close by Swatch Toys R Us th Avenue is just two blocks away The DoubleTree is in very good condition no complaints about the room halls elevators entrance lobby and facilities  The bedrooms are big by New York standards and are equiped with a refrigerator in addition to the minibar a microwave sink coffee maker and a full sofa bed very comfortable  House keeping will bring you the kitchen utensils at your request You can easily accomodate six persons on the two double beds and a sofa bedrooms  These rooms the two double beds ones don t have a view to Times Square but to the adjacent street  If you want to have a nice view of Times Square you need to book a one king bedroom high floor preferable The bath room has double doors so you can conveniently access it from the room or the living room  There is a flat tv in the living room with a game control for the kids nintendo and plenty of games to choose from the menu USD  per  minutes  This keeps the children entertained while in the room so you can get a nap or relax  There is another flat tv in the bedroom while my teenage dhter watched the Jonas Brothers my other two small children were having fun with the video games The service is very good  The staff will really strive to get you what you ordered specially the ones at the front desk the concierge was ok  My praise to the three dominican girls at the frontdesk they were fabulous In spite of the absurd amount of people walking around Times Square it is not hard to enter or leave the hotel  There is no noise at all in the hotel bedrooms or lobby  The restaurant is not that good in fact it is the reason I don t give this hotel  points just  points  It is ridiculously expensive  not worth it at all  
P => Watch Out for Bedbugs My husband dhter and I stayed here in  and had a great time  This year  we booked an  night stay and expected another good experience  Unfortunately nearly half of our stay was ruined by the appearance of bedbugs and the aftermath  changing rooms making reports for Housekeeping Security and Hotel Management cleaning our clothing etc The staff did an admirable job in communicating with us and trying to correct the problem or so we thought and assured us that this was an incredibly rare occurrance  We were given a free night for a future stay as well as other niceties for our trouble   we chalked up the bugs to an unfortunate aberration Our dhter was subsequently invited to audition for a NYC dance company the first of ust so we ided to give the DoubleTree a second chance and book our two night stay with them  MISTAKE  I couldnt believe it when after a difficult day a traveling missed connections and lost baggage my nervous dhter finally settled into bed and cried out quotOh my G   Mom Youre not going to believe thisquot I looked down and there in the sheets was yet another bug Despite the personable and well meaning staff especially ia I will NEVER stay in this hotel again  they obviously have some on going issues they still need to address properly  
P => I second that  Business travelers beware Ok for families though    Our family visited in ust  for a  day stay  While we werent in Manhattan on business we had NO internet connection from our room  For a hotel in the middle of Times Square Very frustrating and an absolute travesty if you were there on business  Luckily we didnt absolutely require internet in our room so it wasnt the end of the world  Otherwise the hotel accommodations were comfortable and the beds were very nicesoft  There was a microwave and a small fridge in our suite which was very helpful with two small children  Our room was pretty small for a family of  but it was doable  We used the pullout bed in the living room so that helped a bit  We had a nice view from the st Floor and the location could not be beat  We were able to see the recently released Broadway show Legally Blonde very funny BTW directly next to the hotel    and youre about a  block walk from Central Park  We did not eat in the hotel restaurant and it appeared that not many others did either as it was a dead zone  However they did provide utensils and plates for meals that you had in your room    also nice for families  
P => Good with Kids I am torn about my review for this hotel  My husband and I stayed here with two kids  and  for four nights at the beginning of ust  We received a rate through the hotel website for   per night which included breakfast for four at the hotel restaurant  For a two bedroom suite in New York this was a great value but the hotel itself was just okay  We received a corner room on the th floor that had a great view of Times Square but the room itself was smaller than the rest of the rooms  There was a small fridge microwave in room safe and sink  We were able to buy drinks and snacks from a nearby Duane Reade which helped save some money since room service and in room snack center were very expensive  The lobby and front desk staff were friendly and we never encountered any long lines   We ate lunch at the hotel restaurant our first day and it was not very good  Like the rest of New York it was pricey  The breakfast buffet which was included in our rate was very good  In addition to hot and cold buffet items they had a cook to order station with eggs waffles pancakes and french toast  The hot and cold buffets had a great variety of fresh fruit oatmeal with a wide variety of mix ins and numerous other items   The reason I am torn about my review is that while I was not impressed with the hotel overall I still felt that it was a good value for New York  Here were the problems The bathroom was not completely clean upon check in  I called and no one ever made it up to finish cleaning  The iron in the room was broken and when we tried to use it water poured out all over the clothes  Again I called about this and it was never replaced  The room itself was just okay very plain and a little run down  The hotel has no rollaway beds available   We did not have any problems with the internet  the hotel website states that there is a per day charge for access however we received the Hilton signal and it did not require a password or code  It was not terribly slow  The workout facility was ent elliptical and treadmills with televisions free weights and machines  It is open  hours which is convenient   Overall it was a good value for the amount of spacealthough get a rate quote INCLUDING taxes as they are very high in NYC  our   rate was much higher once taxes were added  
P => A Great Location and Nice Experience Great Location   GREAT LOCCATIONFriendly StaffDefinitely a great place forwith kids or family Large two room accommodations  
P => business travelers beware This is fine hotel unless you need a speedy internet abysmally slow and their internet provider is atrocious  must have spent  hours to no avail help from the front desk they cant do anything with their computers to print out anything other than one receipt one way for a trip  tough if you need different receipts for different sources reimbursements or a polite doorperson who doesnt yell at you if you dont select the cab he wants even though he is highly enmeshed in a conversation with a friend and doesnt lift a finger to help you with luggage on the way out  On the plus side the rooms are large and good for families  If I wasnt travelling on business and I didnt need the internet I might stay there if I wanted a middle of Times Square experience  
P => Good overall experience The staff is terrific very nice and helpful  The lobby is on the second floor and is not pleasant especially when tour groups are coming or going  There are good features in the rooms   microwave ent size half refrigerator ble counters in bathroom and in the quotkitchenquot area  Kitchen has a small sink  There was enough room for  people  My biggest complaint was the hide a bed  It was a mystery how to open it up    we had to call for help  It also was not very comfortable  But that is not a big deal  The location is great and there are small grocery stores close by  Its quite close to Rockefeller Center  Overall we were pleased and our room was comfortable  The hotel entrance really is right in Times Square the northern end  
P => Best Holiday Ever We arrived at the hotel on th of  a family of  and we stayed for a week  as we arrived at the hotel from our stretch limo the buzz of the streets totally shocked us  All we did all week was SHOP  it is the best place to shop ever specially in  sales as everything is sooooo cheapi would definately stay here again if i ever visit NYC again  Best stay ever 
P => Highly Recommended Hotel in Times Square Searched high and low for several weeks for a reasonably priced hotel for a family of   Having lived in New York City I balked at having to pay an average of  per night for  rooms so finding this option was great  Very clean room plenty of space and everything WORKED  Check incheck out was super fast and being in the middle of Times Square was a bonus  Our room was on the th floor so not particularly high up and did not have a view of Times Square itself but was amazingly quiet  Also there are plenty of eateries nearby to counteract the over priced hotel restaurant I would recommend the Doubletree to anyone and will certainly plan to stay there on future visits  
P => great hotel stayed here for  nights with  teenagers  Front desk was really helpful and friendly thanks  Yanni original suite was not available when we arrived and we were asked if we would take a smaller room for one night then we were upgraded to our original size of suite but this time on the rd floor with  complimentary breakfasts for  days which was great  View of Times Square from the top of the hotel was fantastic  Great location helpful staff would definitely recommend 
P => Clean and Compact Nice and clean suite with good housekeeping service  Great location at the top of times square  Small and dangerous valettaxi pull up space  Small lobby area  Small hallways and suite  Small restaurant on th floor windowless I think  Parking attendant cleaned out my car change  
P => PERFECT with  KIDS My husband  kids and I stayed at the Doubletree Times Square for  nights recently and LOVED IT Have stayed in more quotposhquot hotels in NYC but this was perfect with kids  We requested a Times Square view upon check in which they delivered happily they also explained that corner rooms are smaller   we agreed we could live with that in order to have a view  Rooms ending in quot  or quot face Times Square  Our room was on the th floor  and we hardly heard any street noise other than the occasional siren  Staff was accommodating and friendly The room was clean every day and bed was SO comfy  The kids loved having their quotown roomquot with a TV  Dont know how comfy the sofa bed was   they didnt complain  The refrigerator in the room was convenient   we stocked it with drinks and snacks from Duane Reade pharmacy  On our way out each morning we would just fill our backpack with our drinks and snacks  This kept the kids happy throughout the day and saved us some money  All in all was a great experience and I would definitely stay at this hotel again I also recommend taking the Grayline double ker buses  We bought a  day All Loops Pass online cheaper  It was   for  days  people which breaks down to   day per person   cheap Its an easy and enjoyable way to see everything and get up and down the island  Hop on and off as many times as you want  We never waited more than  minutes for a bus although sometimes pick up locations were a block off  We did the Uptown and Downtown Loops over and over again  When your feet get tired hop on the next bus and ride for awhile  Dont lose the map they give you and youll be in good shape The tour guides vary greatly   some are more informative and interesting than others  The Night Tour guide had us lhing and singing all the way  We did not do the Brooklyn Loop as the Night Loop tours Brooklyn I would urge you to do the Night Loop   great fun  You can take the subway but of course theres no view underground and it can get really hot and crowded  The top of the bus is cool enough and below it is air conditioned  I was concerned that the kids would not get to see everything in  days but with the bus we were able to see it all and have a great time doing it Have fun and enjoy your trip 
P => Perfect location great customer service We only needed  night and got a great rate through AAA  Part of the deal is that you get a room on a higher floor  This is much needed because the hotel is in the middle of Times Square  We loved the location and the customer service was outstanding  The beds were very comfortable  The room was quiet  We would stay there again in a heartbeat 
P => Great Trip My son and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites last week for  nights amp were very happy  The AARP rate was night which seemed like a great rate to me for  rooms amp  TVS The rooms were clean bedding very comfy with plenty of fluffy pillows not flat foam ones amp nice big bath towels  Sofabed was tolerable for my son  Only negative was the slightly dingy shower amp lousy bathroom lighting  We were on the th floor so Times Square noise wasnt an issue  Service was very pleasant though we only dealt with the front desk  Great location for walking to theater amp hopping on a subway got very tired of the mob scene in Times Square after the rd day or so but would definitely stay there again  Loved NYC 
P => Wonderful despite    Were a family of  with small kids and lots of luggage so the hotel room was a bit cramped  The bathroom door wouldnt lock and the pull out bed was not a suprising discomfort  We didnt get the breakfast nor did we eat in the hotels restaurant  We were desperate enough to buy a  soda from the minibar Oh and the coffee bar downstairs had delicious muffins and croissants  The cleaning staff came late on our nd day and wanted to clean while we were there  I guess thats a good thing  The AC was good and cold and the views were outstanding It would be fair to say that we had the best views around on the th floor  It was challenging to locate the hotel by car due to all the one way streets but the concierge was truly a gentlemen and helped us find our way  We didnt have any problems with check in or check out and we were asked for our room key a few times until they began to recognize us  We felt safe and secure and are sure we left with everything we brought  The bell captains were very accomodating even storing and charging our scooter  I hope our tips were enough  Make sure you have enough towels and pillows and always ask for extra coffee cups and sugar All in all with a ent room and price this is the place to stay  Though I heard staying around Wall St  is much cheaper we wanted the action and lights of Times Square   and we got it in full force We should have brought umbrellas our own totebags for souvenirs foldable seats for the fireworks and bought metro cards for the buses and subways the double ker tour bus pass and some groceries  We did bring cash for tips wear comfortable shoes valet park our car and forgot about it for  days while we used every conceivable mode of transportation available in NYC receive from the hotel  great kiddie backpacks filled with toys as well as the yummy cookies Enjoy your vacations 
P => Loved the Doubletree Our family of four stayed here for  days and absolutely loved it  The location is the best  Within walking distance of tons of restaurants and shows and the subway is right next door  The best part is having two rooms and three beds one is the fold out couch  This kept us from being too crowded  With a  and  year old we needed some room  Also two tvs were nice for downtime  One on ESPN and one on Food Network  The fridge came in very handy to keep extra water and cokes on hand  Bathroom is big and you can also use the mini bar area for someone to get ready in as it has a mirror and sink also  Times Square is constantly bustling with cars and people but in the rooms it is very quiet  They have soundproofed very nicely  We had a problem with our tv remotes twice and within  minutes they brought new ones  Towels were brought also with  minutes  Everyone was friendly and very eager to help  They check your key before allowing entry to the hotel which I liked for the added security  We will definitely stay here again when coming back to NYC  It is also central to everything in Manhattan and we were all over the city  Doubletree makes a great home base and is well worth the price  McDonalds is right next door so the kids could go down at midnight and get a snack and it was very convenient for a quick breakfast  Ive heard NY has very small hotel rooms but that is not the case at Doubletree  
P => Trip of a Lifetime Double Tree Times Square  CDN ladies just enjoyed  nights in NYC  Stayed at the Double Tree in Times Square  They did not have the room we booked with  doubles on our arrival so gave us a King   off per night and complimentry buffet breakfast daily for our staythat is   per day Location is perfect you can walk miles to so many attractions  Room was clean great service and the only complaint is the pull out couch  It was NOT comfortable  But the rest of the trip made up for it  Our best day was when walking to Grand Central we made a wrong turn and ended up in Hells Kitchen  We met some elderly locals at coffee shop and that was a highlight of NYC  We did all the tourist spots shopped loved Chinatown and Little Italy and shopped some more  major thunderstorms added to excitement We saw  plays and that too was a highlight  Try the Hop on Hop Off bus  days is enough and then we travelled by cab  Inexpensive  Food was pricey but quantities just too large  One dish of anything will feed  ladies  Beware and dont over order  We felt very safe at all times and did not use the underground  Grab your girlfriends bid adios to the men and fly off to NYC  You will not be sorry             
P => I thought Id get more for  a night This was the most expensive hotel Ive ever stayed in and it wasnt worth the money  Some disappointments included a room service tray with leftovers that sat outside my door for almost  hours even though I called for a pickup  I had to call again before it was removed  Oh and when the room service was delivered the server felt compelled to comment upon how much food we had ordered  Tacky A piece of molding was taped to the wall with masking tape in my  a night room  There was a musty unpleasant smell in the ice machine room  To force their guests to buy cans of soda from the in room minibar at   per can there are no soda vending machines in the hotel  The remote control for the TV in the arate bedroom didnt work and the TV wouldnt work without it  And lastly for the disappointments there was a noticeable lack of security at the entrance which is directly on Times Square and believe you me there are some strange people on the streets in Time Square  I was never asked to show my room key  The good points for this hotel my room was clean and neat with good temperature control  There was a phone in the bathroom in case of emergencies and the shower worked well  The street noise was muffled and wasnt noticeable from the nd floor  Which meant the hotel room was a nice respite from the chaos of a weekend in Times Square Overall this hotel was not worth  a night and I woudnt stay here again  
P => Love Love Loved It I absolutely loved my stay at the Doubletree  I was there for three nights in a one bedroom suite  The bed was extremely comfortable which is very important to me on vacation   The room was clean and well maintained  And the view from the hotel window was amazing it really helps if you love the city like I do  Also the hotel is located in a convenient area for going to shows etc  One of the hotel staff members knew that I was there to celebrate my birthday so when I arrived in my room there was a fruit and cheese tray waiting for me  Overall very pleasant and calm stay in a busy city  
P => Love the Doubletree Times Square When traveling with a family it is the only hotel that I have found that offers a suite in Times Square  We have  teenagers   boy and girl   so our son slept on the sofa bed okay typical sofa bed my dhter had her own fullqueen bed in the bedroom with us Worked fine as we stayed on a few nights yet much longer and the bed gets a little small for the  of us as we are use to a king at home  Nice large bathroom and there is as bar area in the living room which helped having an extra sink when getting ready in the morning  GREAT LOCATION  Staff seemed nice  
P => Acceptable for Broadway If youre going to see a Broadway show and want to be quotright therequot this is a good place to consider  However if youre looking for anything other than your standard hotel stay this is not the place This hotel is very similar to a large convention center hotel   its an assembly line process with too many people and too few staff to devote too much attention to guests  Odd are youll have a ent amount of wait time if you want to check in at a peak time have bags taken to your room etc The rooms themselves are fairly simple  They have quotmodernquot hotel or though its got a very strong Ikea look to it  The bathrooms are adequate though my tub looked like it could have used some a stronger dose of ajax cleaner  Some of the towel were old and a bit tough while others were new and very soft Im sure the views from the room vary but I had a good view of times square and could see down Broadway to Central Park  The hotel had wifi for a nominal fee  I got a strong signal and a good connection Normally I dont eat at a hotel but for some reason or another I had a free breakfast so I ided to give it a shot  It was a breakfast buffet and the food was ok  Its hard to mess up pancakes muffins fruit and cereal  The service left much to be desired but as I mentioned   this is an assembly line hotel If you want to be close to Broadway and wont be doing much but sleeping in your room this hotel will probably work just fine  If you want a nicer hotel Id consider some other choices  
P => Great place to stay We cant say enough about how wonderful our stay here was  From the doorman down on the street level all the way to the housekeepers and maintenance man  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and very helpful  The warm chocolate chip cookies didnt hurt either Our room was on the th floor and a corner room overlooking Times Square  Even though we were directly across the elevators the room was still very quite  The hotel is located where we would could get the subway bus or a taxis without walking far  Walking around this great city is another story We would highly recommend this hotel to everyone  The location is great the employees are outstanding and the hotel itself is tops  Thank you for making our first stay to NYC fantastic  We will definitely be back  
P => Brilliant central location for first visit to New York Have just returned from a  night stay at the Doubletree  As we had been led to expect  hotel right in the heart of Times Square with all the crowds of people so no surprises We were on the nd Floor with great views and virtually no street noise unless we opened the window The suite was perfect for us holidaying with two teenagers  and yrs   TVs in both living area and bedroom so no arguments Doors to bathroom from bedroom and living area   with one child on sofabed in living area this meant less disturbance at night  Hotel location excellent   easy to visit Empire State Building Maceys etc on foot and there is a subway station next door to hotel  Excellent diner round the corner Evergreen and great choice of restaurants in walking distance including Ruby Tuesdays and Joes Broadway Grill on th St  Didnt use hotel restaurant  Pre booked tickets on line beforehand for Lion King superb and also for ESB and for  hour Manhattan island boat tour with Circle Line which we can thoroughly recommend  Also took Gray Line bus tours Uptown and Downtown   both guides on these tours gave interesting and funny commentaries and was great way to get a taste of all the different neighbourhoods  Grand Central Station worth a visit   look at the ceilings  No real problems with hotel   room was clean although some of the wooden furniture was a bit tatty  Only v  minor issues during our stay i e  batteries flat in one TV remote and also reception forgot warm cookies when checking in but both resolved straight away  Would definitely stay here again with family  
P => Another great stay This was our rd stay at the Doubletree Times Square and once again we were very pleased  We booked a Triple A rate for  for the holiday week end which was not that bad I thought  The suites are large with a door erating the living area and bedroom area erate bathroom doors leading to the LR and BR  Microwave and refrigerator  We were on the th floor and only heard one siren in the course of three days not much of a view from our room this time but that was okay  Staff could not be more accommodating Concierge service outstanding  We were assisted in purchasing the Express Pass for the Empire State Bldg and it saved us at least  minutes in line  Hotel location is key here with every theater within walking distance subway station steps away and plenty of eateries and shopping  Small diner called quotEvergreenquot around the corner for a reasonable breakfast  Hotel parking is also around the corner and is  self park and  valet we were able to pull right up front to unload and load  The property is very busy and if there is a down side to the hotel it would be you have to take one elevator from the street to the lobby then another elevator from the lobby to your suite so at busy times there was a short wait  In addition if crowds bother you then this location  be quottoo busyquot because hoards of people are in this area day and way into the night  Hold your childrens hands tightly  
P => Just what I needed after running the Boston athon I ran the Boston athon woke up the next day drove to New York and stayed at the Doubletree for  nights with my  children  It was perfect  Right in the heart of Times Square everything you need within walking distance  or barely walking   as I was recovering from the race Starbucks Greyline Rays Pizza M amp Ms store St  Patricks Cathedral   and much more  It felt safe and easy and it was comfortable with  rooms and  T V s  The best thing was that they allowed  people since it had  beds plus the pull out sofa  Many hotels in New York limit you to  people so then you have to sneak one of your kids in   which is weird when youre paying almost  a night  Would definitely stay there again if I ever take my whole family to NY again   we had a great time  
P => Super location clean room nice staff We were on the st floor in a room that had a double bedroom a bathroom and a lounge area that had a small kitchenette  With double glazed windows and being so high the room was very quiet  The lounge had a sofa that was also a fold away bed  I slept on this during our stay and it was not the most comfortable bed I had ever slept in but bearable for a few days  Both the lounge and bedroom had large wide screen TVs The Kitchenette was simply a small cabinet top with a microwave and a fridge that was the size of a inch television  There was no oven hobb  A slight irritation was caused by the kitchenette not having any crockery or cutley  We made use of the Kitchenette for breakfast in the morning but we had to first go to the local Duane Reade drugstore and buy some plastic cutley and paper plates  The room was orated quite nicely and including the bathroom was clean  The major selling point of this hotel is its location being right on Times Square  Super convenient for the theatres shopping subway and restaurants  We were even able to walk to Port Authority  blocks when the time came to catch the bus to the airport and fly home  The hotel had a restaurant but we found the food quite average but because of its location to so many alternatives this didnt really matter I would be happy to stay at the Doubletree again  You each get a quite delicious cookie when you first check in  
P => Nice Theatre District property Whether you are travelling alone or with kids if you want to be in the heart of Manhattan action look no further A two room suite with a kitchenette at this price in the centre of Manhattan doesnt easily get beaten You are right on Times Square which for some people  not be the ideal place to stay within walking distance of most Broadway theatres and restaurants and within walking distance also of Fifth Avenue shopping the MoMA Time Warner Centre Rockefeller Centre the Empire State Building and Central Park  How do you better thisOur suite on one of the highest floors overlooked Times Square and Manhattan skyscrapers and we loved the view The suite had a bedroom and a sittingliving room with a television in each of them a largish bathroom two sinks a kitchenette with crockery and cutlery available if you wish a Wolfgang Puck coffee maker with unlimited supplies of gourmet tea and coffee Neutrogena toiletries an in room safeiron and ironing board a referigerated mini bar and an additional empty referigerator for guest use  The hotel also has a very efficient laundry service  All the stuff you need to make your Manhattan stay comfortable I would have been happier though had brighter colors been used in the suite interior  Dark colors do tend to make the suite less cheery than it could have been The staff are exceptionally nice to you at every level  Housekeeping could be better though  Use the Concierges desk only for information but stay away from it for theatre bookings  Lots cheaper if you call Ticketmaster If the Times Square action right outside is agreeable to you this is an excellent option  
P => Large space Great Location Four ladies booked this hotel for a New York getaway staying for four days  The location was perfect for walking to most all of the attractions in the city  We appreciated the kitchenette complete with sink and mirror which doubled as a second place for applying makeup and fixing hair The rooms were well appointed and more spacious than most others in other NYC hotels  The bedding was plush pillows soft  The TVs were old style rather than flat screen  We did have a problem with noisey neighbors who had no respect for anyone trying to sleep partying at all times of the night The bath was large with good sound proofing which was good since the pipes in our room clunked when water was on  The towels were large and thick  We did have a problem obtaining a cab one rainy morning  The doorman told us the other doorman who evidently obtains cabs for guests was not there at the moment and he would not help us  We hailed our own cab on a side street in the rain  Dont try to secure a cab yourself from the line of cabs in front of the hotel with an quotOff Dutyquot sign  They will only respond when the doorman from the hotel hires them for a guest The McDonalds next door was handy for a quick breakfast  The best bargain was the  hour Hop On and Off Grayline Tour Bus ticket that we obtained on the internet for    The pick up site is only a block away  
P => Great Location   Good Value If youre looking to be in the hustle and bustle of NYC you have to consider Times Square  This hotel is right in the middle of it and considering the size of most NYC hotel rooms the Doubletree Suites is a great value  The NRW subway line is right next to the hotel entrance so getting around by subway is a breeze  Being in the heart of Times Square guarantees you access to a taxi without much of a wait  There are plenty of restaurants just steps from the entrance of the hotel from high end steak houses to chain restaurants to McDonalds its all right there  Hotel staff were polite and accommodating  Service in the restaurant within the hotel and the hotel bar was slow and food was just okay  French Onion Soup was odd and very salty while the chicken quesadilla was actually quite good  Room was spacious  arate bedroom and living area  Couch unfolds to a bed  Work desk is very nice  Room includes a small fridge which didnt get quite cold enough for dairy products but good enough for what I needed  Theres also a microwave and single cup coffee maker which I bordered on over using  I left a note for housekeeping to leave extra coffee standard is two packs of regular and one of af and I ended up with quite the stash of coffee packsOne error on the bill when I checked out which was quickly taken care of with a smile  I would stay here again if I needed to be in the midtown area  
P => Great Place to stay with the family We have stayed at the Doubletree Suites hotel several times with the kids  There are two rooms so its spacious and a bargain by New York standards  Theres a great breakfast buffet that gets you off to a good start for the day  I love the location and its wonderful to be right at Times Square My husband and I like to stay at the Waldorf when its just us but the Doubletree is great for Theatre and nightlife when taking kids I say kids but they are   and  
P => Losing its Edge I just returned from a  night stay at the Doubletree Times Square  The first  nights I was alone on business and my wife and two kids joined me for the th night  My first  hours at the hotel were miserable   wifi not working and after  minutes on the phone with tech support was told that there was a problem with the local router and I should move to another section of the hotel  Wifi worked fine in room   but when I opened the fridge there was a half eaten nacho plate from the previous occupant  Room service varied from fine cant mess upa club sandwich to lousy cold   not even lukewarm  eggs and bacon  I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past year and each time the service seems to drop a notch  
P => Great location Very nice staff Just returned home from mini vacation with two young children  Doubletree Suites was a perfect spot for all the tourist attraction NYC has to offer especially if traveling with children  At check in Dais our guest service agent was kind helpful and very knowledgable about the city  We arrived at am and our room was ready even though check in isnt until pm  It was nice after a long train ride to get up to our room and relax with our nice warm cookies  We had a corner Times Square view room on the th floor with a view that cant be beat  The room was clean and the bed was comfy  And quite a ent size for a NYC hotel room  One minor complaint would be the smell of smoke from all the guests smoking in the hallways near the elevators though this really isnt the hotels fault  Overall a great stay  
P => Absolutely Fantastic We stayed at this hotel for  days and we absolutely loved it  The staff are very friendly and actually cared  They ALL went out of their way to make the stay enjoyable  There was no question or request that they did not take time for and honor it  They ALL went above and beyond  They view was excellent and the rooms were superb for a city  The breakfast is fantastic in the restaurant and employees were very accomodating there also  Bellhops gave us directions and hints as to what to do for sightseeing  There is a concession at the concieriege for booking play tickets also  We saw Wicked and Young Frankenstein both were sold out but they were able to get tickets  They were expensive for the service but for Wicked we had center stage second row they couldnt have been any better  FANTASTIC and eventhough it is an expensive hotel it is worth it  
P => In the heart of the action We stayed in these suites for  nights with two children aged   The kids loved the location as they could watch the ever changing neon signs especially the MampMs one directly across the street  The accomodation was clean and adequate  The staff were pleasant and our plumbing problem was immediately attended to when pointed out  The hotel is particularly useful if you are interested in the shows as they are right in the heart of the theatre district  Most of the sights are within easy walking distance and you will be spoiled for choice for eating out especially breakfast  Try the Manhattan deli   fabulous selection and very reasonably priced  I cant really fault these suites and yes I would stay there again  
P => Great place to stay with children Stayed there last week with the family two children under  it was a great experience  The staff are friendly and helpful the rooms are clean and serviced every day We had complimentary breakfast included which was ok though the eating area is not very inspiring Over all I think this was exactly what we needed and having the two rooms made a big difference in the evening when the kids went to sleep  
P => Great for families with teenagers  We are a family with two older teenagers girl and boy who stayed for the first week in il  at The Doubletree Guest Suites Times Sq    it was exactly what we needed  The location is so central you can walk if youre fit everywhere We booked directlly through hotel website as I found this much cheaper then Expedia etc  We had a  dble  rm large suite sofabed highflyer because of anticipated noise   you really cant hear much on the th floor   and the views were great  The room were average size with loads of storage  The or was a little tired and worn but perfectly acceptable  The two double beds seemed a little small to us but the kids had them and we stayed on the kingsize sofa bed which was comfy and worked out fine  This is the best solution for teenagers as you can shut the door on their mess as parents are more likely to keep the living area tidy The quotkitchenettequot area was useful for refreshments and snacks  We stocked the fridge with juice milk fruit biscuits and beers etc and didnt need to touch the expensive mini bar although we discovered too late you can ask for crockerycutlery if you wanted to have cerealbread etc  The extra sink is useful as an extra vanity area  The shower was powerful and the room spacious a door to each room was useful for privacy  The room was thoroughly cleaned and beds made daily  The staff were friendly and helpful  The Concierge was not at all pushy as I have read and helpfully booked better helicopter flights for us than I had seen on the internet Manhattan Helicopters only company licenced to fly OVER the city Only thing we had against The Doubletree was the breakfast  This was not included in our tariff but we ided to try it one morning  Expensive and dull  continental and  for cooked  Literally round the corner from the hotel we found the Evergreen Diner  Friendly fast service lots of locals having breakfast loads of choice large portions and it cost an average of   each We became regulars and didnt need to eat again till evening Our whole experience of New York was great and The Doubletree was a welcome haven to come back to at the end of an exhausting day  Even our seemingly world weary teenagers found it all pretty cool especially the free warm cookies which they had the cheek to ask for daily 
P => Great for families My husband  year old and  year old followed up our DC trip with a three night stay in NYC  I was so nervous because of the bed bug epidemic in NY if you dont know what I am talking about check it out on the internet you need to be informed  My husband checked in ahead of us to check everything out and all was well  The room was clean overall although showing its age in little ways that I found to be acceptable  I am picky so I will mention that I noticed that in the hallways you can tell that the vacuum doesnt make it to the edges guess they would need an attachmentso it is a little dirtier there but not horribly so  This was also true around the door jam that led from the bedroom into the bathroom  a little dusty  Otherwise very clean Comfy beds  Slept great  This is NY so no free breakfast buffet was around  or so I believe not sure didnt buy it and parking was  a day with no access to car unless we wanted to pay more but that is to be expected there  One nice security feature is that you walk past a man at a podium when you first go in to the elevators off of the street  who asks to see your key until he becomes familiar with you  The elevator stops at the lobby on the third floor so you need to then walk past the front desks to the next bank of elevators to proceed to the rooms  Great location  About  short blocks from the subway could see the M amp M store from our window kids loved that close walk to the  story Toys R Us Hershey Store etc Expensive but I think worth it  Friendly staff  Great cookies at check in 
P => Great location overall underwhelming Hotel is in a great location  Dead in the middle of Times Square  Easy walks to the theatres and plenty of restaruants  If touring out of the area convenient subway stops and plenty of taxis Had a problem with reservations  Initially three of us going and had a king suite with sofa sleeper with Times Square view  Another dhter ided to go and I checked twice to make sure it was ok and was told it was  The week before the trip I called again to make triple sure and was told that they would not permit  in the room  After speaking to the manager I was able to get reservations for a double with sofa sleeper  It made no sense to me to require the double beds instead of the king  The kids slept on the sofa anyway we just had smaller beds to deal with  Very aggravating Service is ok nothing more  Rooms were cleaned well and were quiet and comfortable  Utilitarian but pretty expensive at  a night with taxes We wanted Times Square and were satisfied  If we come again we will stay elsewhere though  
P => Great Location Service is So so Top notch location you can not beat it  Rooms overlook Times Square so you are in the heart of the action but block out the noise for some peace and quiet  Service is not anything special  They are really pushing certain tickets if you ask for help  Not too helpful about other things  Worth the money but could use some customer service lessons  
P => Beware concierge The concierge is not a real concierge  They are there to sell you their products and tickets at a really high price  You can go across the street and buy Broadway tickets for  price or go tot the box office  
P => Nice rooms Big room nice linens very clean great location and affordable  Michael at the front desk was great From the time we checked in to the time we check out we felt like we were a valued guest  Two Thumbs UpOnly negative and I mean the only     typical problem with some hotels drainage in the tub  They took care of it immediately 
P => Well located great for families Stayed over the weekend with a  year old and a friend so the arate rooms worked out great  We did have to move rooms since the first one had a view of a wall I guess if you use points you dont get a view  Once we moved we were on the th floor with great views  Bed was comfortable rooms were clean and bathroom had been reated  Very well located for any NYC activities  Staff was hit or miss on good service  
P => Great for family group lots of room Directly on Times Square front door adjoins the front door to Legally Blonde  Right in the middle of the action but crowds and pace on the sidewalks  be a bit intense for some and particularly for anybody with a stroller or walking aid Definitely worth upgrading to a package that includes the complimentary breakfast buffet  The buffet included fresh fruit hot oatmeal hot breakfast meats omelettes and eggs made to order pancakes and waffles to order cold meat and cheese selection smoked salmon juices breakfast pastries  Something for everyone and open until  each morning  Our suite had two double beds plus living room and pull out couch  or very pleasant kitchenette was helpful  Extra sink and large mirror in kitchenette area doubled as an extra vanity  Three women and all their stuff fit nicely not crowded very comfortable The fitness center is under construction temporary quarters are crowded but servicable  The business center had three computers and servicable printer all worked well and was convenient No complaints great stay will return if travelling with family  For a romantic holiday go several blocks away from Times Square for a more calm and relaxing experience  
P => Nice place We stayed in a suite with two  month olds and three adults  The rooms were small but very comfortable  The bathroom was huge This location was convenient to restaurants and shopping  The babies loved the Hard Rock Cafe I would stay here again  
P => Fantastic place to stay My husband and myself together with our  year old son stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites on th   for four nights to celebrate my husbands th birthday  Having never been to New York before we wanted to be in the heart of Times Square and the Doubletree certainly is  We had a suite on the th floor and had a great view of Times Square and you couldnt hear any noise at night  My son slept on the double pull out sofa bed in the lounge which was more than adequate  Our bed was huge and very comfortable  The staff at the hotel were very friendly and when we needed more coffee for our room housekeeping delivered it almost immediately  The fresh coffee machine came in very handy as while we were there is was quite cold although on the Monday you didnt need a coat on The Doubletree is within walking distance to Central Park Empire State Building Macys and the Greyline Sightseeing Tour Bus Stop is opposite  There are plenty of places to eat and drink and some people say that eating and drinking in Times Square can be expensive  We found it very reasonable and around the corner there is an BarRestaurant called Lanagans which the locals use and they make you feel very welcome especially our  year old and the food is great there  We booked all our tickets to the Empire State Statue of Liberty Helicopter ride over Manhatten Federal Reserve Bank Hop on hop off bus tour and a Broadway Show on line before we travelled and are glad we did because you then have everything planned before your trip and everything went to plan  You cannot go wrong by staying at the Doubletree and we would definately stay there again  
P => Excellent Excellent Hotel with a great location in Times Square and within walking distance of all main attractions and shops  Perfect for a st time visit to New York Suites were very clean and comfortable   rellay nice to have a lounge area after a longs days shopping and sight seeing  No breakfast at this hotel but there are loads of delis and diners to choose from    we particularly liked Evergreen which was just around the corner The subway stop is right next door to the hotel so perfect when you want to venture a little further All in all I would recommend this hotel and would definitley stay here when I visit New York again  
P => Great Stay We stayed at the doubletree for Valentines Day weekend and loved it  The room was clean and big by NY standards  We live in NY now but thought it might be fun to do a quottourist thing quot All in all it was reasonably priced and had great views of Times Square and the Hudson River I should mention we were on the st floor I would reccomend this hotel highly 
P => Great Hotel in Wonderful City My sister and I took our dream vacation to New York City and ided to stay smack dab in the middle of Times Square  The Doubletree Guest Suites is right in the center of everything  We got a one bedroom suite with a pull out sofa okay the sofa wasnt very comfortable and a fantastic view of Times Square  We arrived at about  AM and check in wasnt until  PM but our room was ready our intention was to have them hold our bags until check in but they sent us right up to a room The employees at the concierge desk were SO FRIENDLY and accomodating  They talked with us and showed an interest in what we were doing in New York and how we were enjoying our stay  They helped us with reservations for dinner last minute Broadway tickets directions for sightseeing etc  I thought the noise from the street would bother me and night but it was actually very quiet  We didnt use the hotel facilities but there is a restaurant gym and cafe that looked great  The doormen were kind and although they say you are required to show your room key when entering they didnt seem to enforce that rule too much The rooms were clean and provided exactly what we needed a place to crash after a day of sightseeing and exploring  
P => Nice Time Square Suite This is a great location and a great choice if you want to have a  room suite  I traveled with my teenage son and this was perfect for us  I used the bedroom and he took the pull out sofa in the living room  The bathroom is off the hallway so we did not disturb each other to use the toilet during the night  We had a Time Square view which was really cool  The only down side is that the sofa bed was really hard to open  Once the houskeeper showed us how to do it no problem  Also the upholstery amp carpet is starting to show some wear amp tear  This hotel is consistently sold out so Im sure these rooms take a beating The front desk amp coffee bar clerks are friendly and the door guy always checks your key  Another down side its pretty hard to get a taxi from here the corner is an awkward spot a couple times a taxi driver asked where I wanted to go then said he was not availble I learned to get in the taxi first then tell them where to go One more point I also stayed at the Hotel Qt and at the Hilton Times Square  Both of those other properties are better for a couple or single person  Hotel Qt is perfect for under  party atmospere  The Hilton is very nice for a couple Would stay again if visiting NYC with children  
P => Great Hotel Great Location If you have never been to NYC then the price of hotels in general  give you cardiac failure  This hotel is no exception  Over  for a room This hotel is on Times Square so if you want to go to the Theater or anyplace else in the city this hotel is well located  There is a subway stop under the hotel to take you anywhere  The hotel is clean and quiet and large for NYC hotel rooms  Staff was helpful  No real complaints  
P => Convenient rooms and location staff unfriendly I travel to New York City one or two times a month with my family and it is very nice to have two rooms for the  of us  The hotel is convenient to many attractions in New York City and does have a restaurant on site  However the breakfast buffet is not very good but edible  The people at the front desk are not friendly bordering on downright nasty sometimes  One women at the front desk was downright rude  When I contacted double tree about it they did nothing so my husband and I stay elsewhere when possible Except for the staff and the breakfast the rest is fine  However when you pay   a night I would like something better than fine  
P => Great location We stayed here from  th  th   A suprise trip for our dhters st birthday  Asked for a room with a good view and got a th floor corner room     not a good one views over times square but tiny room only sofa bed and no armchair very scruffy bedside table on only one side of king bed  Asked to change the next day and staff very accomodating paid a bit more but got a much bigger room on th floor much more comfortable for the three of us  A superb location fell out of bed to get coffee and doughnuts for breakfast from a large selection of places  Right near broadway for shows subway next door staff very helpful and friendly room cleaned everyday and beds made up fresh towels  Very quiet in rooms considering you are right in the hub of things and great blackout curtains We loved itChecked out at  noon and as we idnt have to leave for the airport till pm they stored our luggage for us so we could do lunch and last minute shopping Grabbed bags at   downstairs and doorman grabbed a cab couldnt have been easier 
P => Wonderful Christmas Holiday We stayed here between nd ember  and th uary   We checked in at pm and it was really easy We were given a corner suite overlooking Times Square on the nd floor  I must say I wish we were higher  During the day we could hear street noise and traffic  At night it was quieter we only heard a few sirens or horns  The view was great But the flashing signs in the windows did bug us a little but at night the curtains blocked all of the light so sleeping was easyThe rooms are big for NY hotels  They have  rooms   sitting room with a couch desk chair and TV  Also a sink microwave mini bar fridge and coffee maker  The coffee maker had take away cups like starbucks so we made our morning coffee to go The stay was great housekeeping were wonderful and helpful and the front desk and concierge were great  HOWEVER do not book show tickets with them We used broadwaybox com and got  price tickets for Chicago and Hairspray  We had rd row for Chicago and nd row Mez for Hairspray   Awesome seats at half the price Concierge wanted to charge  per ticket and we got them for  New Years Eve was easier then we thought  We were at TGI Fridays a few doors down and left at am  Took around  hours to get back to our room  The staff were great and it was very well runChristmas in New York is magical Even though it didnt snow it was such a wonderful experience and the Doubletree was great 
P => Excellent service at this Doubletree Mr Flippitti and I stayed here from      Our suite was on the th floor with excellent views  Our dhter flew up from DC to join us halfway through our stay  She slept on the pull out sofa and found it very comfortable  There were extra pillows for the sofabed but we had to call the front desk to get an extra blanket  They delivered it within  minutes  The two room suite also had a small fridge coffeemaker and supplies with styrofoam cups   yuck  a microwave and safe  The bedroom and living rm each had a big flat screen TV and enough drawer space to store your clothes for a long stay  The bathroom was also large with upgraded Neutrogena amenities and big fluffy towels which housekeeping always replenished  Breakfast was included in the rate which was nice because we dont like having to go out and forage for breakfast every morning  Breakfast included made to order eggs or omelets but the line was often pretty long  They also had lots of fresh fruit pancakes cereal and breads  Service was excellent and the restaurant staff was always friendly  We also ordered room service breakfast one morning  It was delivered within  minutes warm and our omelet orders were perfectThe concierge desk was very helpful especially with restaurant recommendations and directions and helping us find our way around the subway system  Housekeeping cleaned our room every day usually knocking at our door by AM  They always did an outstanding job replenishing our coffee supplies and making up the sofa bed  We also got turndown service even the mints  We used the bellman downstairs to help us get a cab twice and both times they delivered  The hotel entrance is on a corner and during the holidays its incredibly busy and congested so catching a cab out front is a lengthy process  We had a late night dinner at the hotel restaurant once when it was pouring rain and cold our feet hurt from sightseeing and we just didnt want to go out and deal with the crowds  The dinner menu is limited and the food is pretty mediocre so Id only eat there as a last resort  
P => Great location  Cant beat the location Rooms are large enough for up to four persons and include not only a convenience bar but also a fridge microwave coffee maker and security safe Concierge service very helpful Business center had only three computers and I did find all three occupied one morning No complaints  
P => Excellent Hotel in Times Square Stayed  nights in the Conference Suite on the th floor Diamond Upgrade from a standard king bed in the middle of Christmas season  Bed was very comfortable and sofa pull out bed easily fit  people  The view of Times Square was amazing The HHonors free breakfast buffet was better than any Hilton hotels Ive been to  The staff was excellent Included turn down service  Cant beat the location walking distance to all of the Broadway shows and right next to the subway entrance  Loved NYC at Christmastime amp the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square gets  thumbs way up 
P => The Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square was FABULOUS We stayed at the Doubletree Guests suites last week and had a wonderful time  It is in the center of everything  Even with kids most sites are an easy walk  The rooms were immaculate and comfortable and extremely large by New York standards  We had a room on the nd floor and had amazing views and actually left the curtains to the main bedroom open all night to enjoy the lights and sights of Times Square  The breakfast buffet was good and all hotle staff was extremly helpful  We would recommend this to anyone staying in Manhattan and definately plan to make this our   choice on our next trip to the City  
P => Big rooms  Slightly tired rooms Great hotel for a family who wants to be right in the heart of the action  For single travellers there are nicer hotels in the area  First room I was given looked like it had been well used second room although smaller was a corner room and in much better oration  Annoys me that you have to pay for Internet access  now staying at the Hilton Garden Express in Chelsea  Smaller room but great neighboorhood and no charge for Internet  Laundry costs in this hotel are also exhorbitant even by NY standards 
P => DOUBLETREE GUEST SUITES   GREAT SERVICE WITH A SMILE The Doubletree was more than we could have hoped for  After making an th hour ision to travel to NYC for Thanksgiving my children ages  and  and I with the help of this forum selected the Doubletree as our home away from home  We booked less than  hours before our arrival at a rate of less than  per night  Check in was a breeze even though we arrived before pm  Our room  had an amazing view of Times Square  The most appealing aspect of the hotel was location location location  The King bed was exceptionally comfortable and large enough for all  of us we accidently fell asleep while watching a movie  The friendliness of the staff was a pleasant surprise  The doorman always greeted us by name and the concierge staff pulled off the unbelievable feat of procuring affordable orchestra level tickets less than  hours before curtain to one of the few Broadway Shows in production at that time I unequivocally recommend this hotel for travelers that love being quotin the midst of it all quot 
P => Great time at Double Tree Times Square My husband and I with our two sons aged  and  stayed here for  nights  Our suite was on the th floor with fantastic views over times square  The rooms were great and spacious very large bathroom which was imaculate and lovely lounge area with a pull out sofa bed that my oldest son slept on  There was plenty of extra bedlinen and pillows available in the room  We did not have any problems with check in very polite and friendly staff great warm chocolate chip cookies on arrival The hotel is in a fantastic location so we never actually dined in the hotel restaurant  There are so many diners restaurants and fast food places nearby that we were spoilt for choice  We went on the open top bus tours  You can buy tickets from right outside the front of the hotel  It was a great way to see all the sights and they pointed out places we would never have found by ourselves We had a great time at the Double Tree Guest Suites in Times Square and while we felt it was expensive we would definatly return and stay here again if we came back to New York  
P => Excellent  Star Suite Hotel in Center of Times Square My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square NYC for two nites on   th amp th  We picked this hotel because we were able to get an AARP rate of   compared to the  or higher rates of comparable nearby hotels such as the riott quis and the Renaissance  We had a king size bed in the bedroom and a sleeper sofa in the other room of the suite  The bed was very comfortable with a warm down comforter in a duvet cover and plenty of pillows and soft sheets  As another reviewer wrote you get what you see on the website  The bathroom has a single sink set in a very long counter so there is plenty of room for all cosmetics etc  and there is a large mirror above  it  There is a tub shower with a shower curtain and the out curving shower rod  The toliet is not in a arate room  There is plenty of hot water and water pressure  Everything was clean and the housekeeping service was perfect  The quotkitchenquot consists of a small refrigerator and a microwave and a quotbar typequot sink and a coffeemaker that dispenses into individual paper cups  We had no problems with leaking refrigerators or quotsmellyquot shower curtains  There was plenty of hot water in the shower  We were on the th floor and heard no noise from outside  The airconditioning heat worked well and was reasonably quiet  Our room did have a view of the Times Square billboards but I understand that some rooms do not  We came in on Sunday at about  pm and our suite was ready but of course that will not always be the case  The people at the desk were courteous and quick  We did not use the concierge or room service  The three elevators run quickly and we had no waits  There is a convential TV in the bedroom and in the other room  We did not use the internet service in the room but did go to the business center where  is the minimum for internet service plus  for each printed page  The buffet breadfast in the Center State restaurant is OK with made to order omelets and pancakes danish some fresh fruit etc  But at New York hotel prices of over  each not a good value unless your room rates includes it or you are a high level of Hilton Honors and get it free  There is a  hour McDonalds next door to the hotel perfect for breakfast to take back to your room  Another downpoint is that like many hotels in New York there are no vending machines and no shop but there are newstands on the streets where you can get the New York Times and sodas at reasonable prices  Of course the quotconvenience centerquot in the room charges   for a soda  The big plus is the wonderful location near all the Broadway theatres so even if it is raining and cold you can easily walk to the theatre  If you like New York Deli   walk to the Stage Deli at rd and th Ave   the hotel is at th st  amp broadway  The quotregular sandwichesquot and dessert portions will each feed two people and we think this is the best corned beef and pastrami anywhere  If you are sure the weather is going to be nice you can get lower rates at hotels such as the riott Courtyards that are farther from Times Square  For comfort cleanliness and especially location this is the place to stay if you are going to go to Broadway shows  We usually get tickets at a discount over the internet by going to the Playbill internet site where you can join the Playbill club for free and get discount tickets to many shows  Also the TKTS booth is across the street from the hotel  
P => Great New York Hotel We just got back from New York and this hotel is an excellent find Yes its pricey but what quotentquot hotel in NY isntFirst of all the location is right on Times Square  The subway is next to the hotel entrance so getting around is a breeze  All guests entering the building must show their room key which means they provide a high level of security  From the main entrance you take an elevator to the third floor lobby to register  We had no delay checking in and the reception agent was friendly and helpful  She even gave us extra home baked chocolate chip cookies which are a standard feature of Doubletree  YUMOur suite was on the th floor  It was an quotupgradedquot suite due to my Hilton Honors points  That means we had complimentary internet access plus upgraded toiletries by Neutregena and a refrigerator and microwave oven  The living room had a sleeper sofa and the bedroom had a king bed Excellent soundproofing    but if you want to open your windows they DO open    a nice option for those who want some quotfreshquot air I know I know its New York air    but its still OUTSIDE air instead of the recycled indoor stuff we breathe in all winter longNice selection of satellite channels over  plus free HBO Overall a terrific hotel for New York visits and I plan to return soon 
P => Nice rooms located RIGHT ON TOP OF Times Square Stayed  nights at this property on business in ember  Definitely a good option in the area  Details   GOOD  Rooms are very nice and very large   suites in fact at least on the th floor   Living room large bathroom nice bedroom  Bed was comfortable had a variety of kinds of pillows  Living space had a nice office chair and modular desk to work at  Staff were all friendly and attentive  Location is as in the title RIGHT ON TOP OF Times Square  Its right there  Walk out the door and you are there BAD  Have to take  elevator trips to the rooms due to their security set up    to enter the hotel lobby area then a erate one to the rooms  Be aware that many of the rooms which face TS will be hard to make dark at night  You can do all the usual tricks but still some of that neon will sneak through  Just be ready for that  The hotel does NOT have true black out shades or anything like that   Avoid the restaurant which was mediocre at best and overpriced like most of the food in that area Overall good choice  Tends to be very pricey even by the standards of the neighborhood   but you get what you pay for  If you need it really dark to sleep you  want to look elsewhere  But otherwise especially if the price is right this is an excellent choice  
P => Saved by the location My Family and I stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites Times Square for  week in ember  The hotel is situated slam in the middle of Times Square so the location is perfect The price we had to pay was exorbitant  US per room per day but it was the New York athon weekend and everything else was fully booked Upon entering the hotel you have to show the security guard your key  His is done for obvious reasons as the entrance is right on Times Square and anyone could just ch in  You then enter the elevator which takes toy directly to the check in floor  After check in you take a different set of elevators that take you to the other floors Check in was smooth and fast and the staff were formally polite  Our rooms were spacious as all rooms of this hotel are  room suites  I understand that for New York this is a big plus  We were in the th floor so we also had great views However the cleanliness of the rooms left a lot to be desired  There were crumbs on the desk surface hairs in the bathtub and a lot of old dust in all corners  The smoke detector was very dirty and on a whole the rooms as well as the entire hotel showed signs of very inadequate cleaning  I am a Diamond Honors member so we were given a floor with free WiFi internet as well as complimentary breakfast but that is where the perks ended Breakfast was awful  The breakfast room is small and we had to wait in line for    to be seated  The whole area stinks of fried oil the tables are dirty the staff were bored and impolite and the food was cold and oily  The only positive thing was that you could order eggs of pancakes to be prepared on the spot  We ate breakfast there only twice as it was terrible The concierge service is also very bad  Firstly they tried to sell us show tickets for  US saying it was sold out and we walked next door to the theater and got them for  US  Anytime we asked for information they pressingly tried to sell us everything even the Metro ticketsOn the last day we asked the concierge to book a taxi to take us to the airport and they replied they could only book a private taxi for  US as opposed to the normal   for a normal taxi On the whole I would not recommend this hotel even though the location is top  
P => Supurb location Great view Location and great views are the draw of this Times Square hotel  I has a corner room room numbers ending in quotquot    e g   on the th floor etc  with stunning views directly down on Times Square to the east and north  What a treat The hotels entrance is at th Avenue and th Street right in the middle of Times Square so you couldnt possibly be in a better location if this scene is your thing  A warning    crowds can be severe in this area as can be traffic  Definitely leave the car at home  Public transit is close by and surprisingly easy to use so you dont really need a car anyway At   a night I cant say this hotel is great value but to be fair this is New York in late fall when all ent hotels anywhere in midtown were similarly expensive  Fortunately for me work was paying  The lobby of this hotel is on the third floor and is not a fun happening place like some hotels  Also their bar and restaurant on the th floor was utterly dead and uninteresting when I briefly checked it out  But this is Times Square so there is no shortage of bars restaurants and entertainment nearby Try the Blue Fin across th Avenue where for one overpriced drink you get to watch Theater goers stream by by the thousands  This is one of the best people watching spots Ive ever found I also love quotSwing quot a barrestaurantswing dancing club with a live band nearly every night on th street between th and th avenues Staff at the Doubletree was friendly if distant  I didnt get quotwarmthquot just competence The room was very clean and well maintained  This is a two room suite layout with a small refrigerator and coffee maker in the outer room but no microwave or other cooking implements  The bedroom was charming and with its view would have been seriously romantic had my wife been able to come on this trip  Bottom Line If you get a competitive rate stay here for the view and location  You wont be disappointed  
P => A Great Family Visit to NYC We recently stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square during MEA weekend  This is when all of the schools close in Minnesota and everyone with kids flees to someplace else  The Doubletree was a great place to bring my kids  First the rooms are all suites and are quite large especially by New York standards  Im a Hilton Hhonors Gold member so breakfast in the hotel was free otherwise it would have been over   day  The location is great for sightseeing as well  The hotel is in the heart of Times Square a  minute walk to Rockefeller Center three blocks from the subway etc  Very close to everything with good transportation options I would recommend this hotel for any tourist in NYC with or without kids  
P => It really depends on what is important to you  Noisy location very pricey no view good sized rooms  Overpriced  
P => Perfect for couple travelling with a teen Having read the reviews before going I was skeptical but we did not encounter any of the negatives I had read in other reviews  No stinky shower curtain no defrosting fridge  The double elevator situation is odd but never posed a problem  My wife and I took our fifteen year old niece on this trip so we were looking for a room like the Doubletree offers We are Hilton Diamond members and were upgraded to a conference suite  It had a king in one room a living area with sleeper sofa  And a conferencedining area with a table for   We tried and tried and could not get the sleeper sofa to unfold  We called for help they said that in the conference suites the sofas dont unfold so they brought up a roll away twin bed which was far more comfy than a sofa bed would have been  Times Square views were great and the black out curtains work perfectly  My wife and I prefer to stay downtown and seldom spend much time in Times Square when we visit the city but we figured since we were taking a teenager why not And it was perfect for her  She enjoyed the bright lights and hustle and bustle she is from the country Breakfast was included for us Diamond Honor I guess but it was not that great  The price is nearly  bucks so if you have to pay for it go somewhere else  If you get it free also you might as well take advantage of it  
P => Great if you love hustle and bustle We just stayed here me my husband and our  year old dhter  Couple of quick points  if you want to be centrally located in the heart of the Times Square action and near subways buses etc  this was a great pick  You step out of a very subdued entrance into the energy of the city right away so dont stay here if you dont want to be in the middle of the action  Roomsuite was wonderful  Our dhter slept on the sofa bed and had her own tv and we had our own bedroom  Both rooms have access to the bathroom  Room was very quiet and clean with nice toiletries   Hotel itself is nothing fancy no grand lobby but has a low key bar and restaurant which we didnt eat at   staff was very helpful  Concieges were able to give us good input and front desk staff were nice even gave us extra cookies when we misplaced the ones we were given at check in  Fellow outside got us a taxi anytime we needed one All in all a wonderful experience  We used Hilton Honors points so I dont know the going rate and how it stacks up against other midtown hotels but if you want to be in this area and want the extra space of a suite I highly recommend the Doubletree Suites  
P => Best Hilton in NYC Over the years we have stayed in most Manhattan Hilton facilities  This one is tops  Very functional suite  Can invite friends over for a drink before going out  Comfortable  Just the right size  Super location for night life and dining  Very quiet considering its location  Friendly competent staff  Safe environment  Will return in the future  
P => Great Location The location is right on th and Broadway  Convenient with the train stops  Walking distance to many theaters  We got the room ending in  and had a nice view  However the  room is a little bit smaller but well worth it for the view of Times Square  Very near MTV studios Toys R Us and ESPN Zone  
P => Fantastic Location Briliant Accomodation Just back from a trip to New York  Stayed at the Doubletree Guest Suites  Room was great size by New York standards very clean and fantastic to have a view over Times Square  The location couldnt have been better for tours right across the street shopping on th Ave and Madison Ave  Would highly recommend the DoubleTree 
P => Great location slow elevators We stayed at the Doubletree for  nights with our teenage children  The bedroom had  double beds and the LR had a sofa bed  Modern clean and location cant be beat if you want to be right in the middle of Times Square  Subway station on the corner  The room had great darkening curtains  We were on an upper floor and we could see the people walking up and down Times Square from the window which was very cool  were country folks Our only problem was that Columbia University Law graduates were doing massive interviews throughout the hotel and the quotblue suitsquot were squeezed into every elevator during the day  Check in was VERY SLOW   we waited in line for about an hour to check in   at least they handed out bottled water to everyone in line 
P => Great hotel great location Loved this hotel  Excellent location very comfortable rooms lots of space perfect for business travel Restaurant was so so but with so many alternatives within walking distance it wasnt a problem Service was great   a bit slow at times but still very good Would highly recommend amp would stay here again  
P => Clean Hotel   No views   Lacks conviences Very expensive hotel at  and not worth it  Other expenses will add up as well  This hotel has no parking in the building and no inout   We were told there was parking so we rented a car  Valet parking per day or  per day for self parking  I tipped the bellman to bring my bags up only to have them brought up to the third floor lobby where I would check in  Another bellman would take your bags to your room from there to for another tip  Forget about bringing the cart with your bags in it up to the room the bellman told me I would have to take it out it is against hotel policy  and unprofitable  Buffet breakfast for three  plus tip  The business lounge is a rip off  for  minutes bring your own laptop  I was told NY had a bed bug problem   not in this hotel it was clean and comfortable  Overall the hotel lacked hospitality and I felt like I was nickle and dimed to death  My suggestion wait for lower rates and stay at the Waldorf for the same price  
P => Great HotelGreat location IF you are looking for a great hotel that is in the middle of everythinglook no further This is an excellent location Restaurantstheatersetc are all in walking distance I found all of the staff to be very friendly and helpful  The room was cleaned everyday and the warm chocolate chip cookie that we got on arrival was a nice surprise  
P => Great location  Some minor disappointments  The location is great  Upon arrival I notified the front desk that the refridgerator was defrosting with water on the bottom and the armoir door hinge was broken  These items were never attended to during our six night stay  The toilet was slow flushing  Shower curtain was smelly Conceirge gave us directions  or  blocks in the wrong direction and we almost missed our day trip  Later I notified the conceirge of the correct location they were unconcerned and did not write down the address  So I wont use them again  Ask a stranger on the street they are more than glad to help  We tipped housekeeping every day and very disappointed that the shower toilet and floor were not cleaned every day in fact be not cleaned at all during our stay  The shower curtain was replaced however  be this is the standard in NY city but not something we are accustomed to in any other place even the bungalows on the beach in Mexico are cleaned every day We are HiltonHonors Gold Members and were offered complimentary buffet breakfast each day of our stay which was adequate to start our day  Egg chef was great  
P => Great Hotel For the price Like many others I booked our group using hotel wars      It was all done by email and the rates and emails used were generic  We only need ten rooms but we still wanted a good rate  The Doubletree was awesome for location and I dont think that I will be lucky enough to get to go back at the price we got  In fairness we did hear about this place from asianinbound com or      which has some reviews for hotels that are quottour friendlyquot this hotel is not that tour friendly as is a hotel for real tourists who want to linger in the downtown hustle and bustle  The hotel was very well run and the front desk agent s and housekeeping almost always said hello each time  which is a great sign  Loved it to the max  
P => Better than a Hotel room if you are a family We are a family of two adults and one child and stayed for  nights in ust   The big plus of this hotel is the location right on the corner of th and Broadway  This area is always busy with people and traffic but once you are in your suite you cant hear the noise  The location allows you to enjoy all the evening delights of Broadway and the theater district without the need to use taxis or walking a few blocks at night  On entry to the hotel the lobby which is actually on the third floor is not overwhelming but it is clean  If you are wanting a contemporary boutique hotel with a wow factor lobby then this isnt the place for you  Check in staff were very efficient and our bags were delivered promptly to our room  Another major point is having two rooms one room had a sofa bed which is ok for kids and a small kitchen area with a sink microwave and fridge  There was also a mini bar in the TV unit  If you dont need to try not to use the mini bar as it is very expensive  Take a  min walk to the corner of th Ave and th to a grocery store and stock up on drinks and snacks and fill up your empty fridge  There was also a safe in the room  In short the suites and well equipped clean and welcoming The bathroom was clean and bright and accessible from both rooms and both bedrooms had a fully working TV with numerous channels You could probably get a better hotel room for the price in the same area but if there is more than two in your party then this is definately the better option I booked a Times Square view room but I would describe it as a partial view at best  The hotel serves breakfast in the restaurant which is either buffet style full or continental which for convenience we had three out of four mornings  The hotel also has a bar but its not what you would describe as a destination bar Once inside our room we found it quiet there was no night noise of people coming and going and we always felt safe The hotel can arrange theatre tickets but beware they quoted us between   per ticket for y Poppins at the New Amsterdam theatre  A quick trip to the box office on nd street and we managed to obtain them for half that price  Try all other options first before using the hotel In sumy a very good quality hotel for tourists who are coming to New York and want to be at the heart of the action  
P => Perfect for families The hotel is fantastic for the price and location  We had two Time Square view connecting rooms for  adults and  children which gave us plenty of room  If I was only traveling with my husband I would stay at a more luxurious hotel around th and Park Ave  I couldnt have picked a better place being with children  We brought our nanny which gave us the flexibility to go out in the evening without the kids  We are platinum Hilton members so we got free breakfast for everyone each morning which was great  Check in was a breeze the concierge was fabulous  We saw Legally Blonde which was playing next door  We took two girls ages  and   If you are conservative which we are this is not the show for girls that age too sexual We enjoyed much better Beauty and the Beast  Across the street at the riott if you go to one of the top floors they have a restaurant which rotates with an absolutly fabulous view we had cocktails up in the sky in the midst of a lightning storm which was amazing  Would stay there again   
P => Great place to travel with teens This was our first trip to the Big Apple  The only thing we knew for sure was that we did NOT want to even attempt to drive in NYC so we needed a location where all of the quotmust seesquot were in walking distance  I scoured dozens of websites and visited TripAdvisor many times to check reviews and kept coming back to this hotel  Initially I booked the room going thru AAA but checked back with the hotel directly from time to time to see what their best direct rates were and once their rate beat the AAA rate I booked right through the hotel reservation desk  The rep was very helpful   she asked if we wanted a low or high room we ended up on the th floor   just right  She also told me that the best views would be a room facing north looking out over the corner of Broadway and th so that is where she placed us I am telling you this hotel is right smack in the middle of Times Square    you walk out the front door and you are in the action We could really experience Times Square this way  We could easily walk to the Empire State Building Rockefeller Center Macys Radio City Music Hall NBC Studios ABC studios all of the Broadway show halls Restaurant Row St  Patricks Cathedral shopping on th Avenue etc  The subway stop was right outside the front door so we navigated this once to go down to Battery park to catch the ferry to the Statue of LIberty and also to see Ground Zero which is still a powerful sight after  years  The beds are FABULOUS if you are like me that alone can make or break a hotel experience and since the rooms are all suites there are  TVs when you have teens who want to watch different shows that is great a microwave a fridge and a safe  Of course the rates are higher than what we are used to paying for up hotels here in North Dakota but this is NYC so we knew that would be the case  If you are worried about safety there are literally police on nearly every block    I never felt unsafe even when my dhter and I ventured out alone  The hotel room was also extremely quiet    none of the noise or lights from the street below were seen or heard once we closed the windows and drapes  I would highly recommend this hotel 
P => Great Location My hysband and  teen aged sons stayed here for  nights  The location was great better than the Hilton Times Square that we stayed at  years ago  The hotel was secure and clean  It was nice to have a suite and  TVs  There was a slight problem with our reservation and the hotel corrected it and threw in free buffet breakfast for the entire stay  We were very happy 
P => Strange hotel   but plenty of room and good location Our family of  stayed ust  th  Strangest most unimposing and unattentive check in desklobby area Ive ever seen for such a large hotel in such a location  Also a very backed up concierge  Fortunately we had done our own research and didnt need their assistanceRooms were certainly spacious  arate bedroom and living room with closing doors was nice  But I agree with several other readers that the rooms were also rather dirty bathrooms especially and showing signs of wear The location cant be beat if you want to be in the center of things with quick subway access and a quothubquot for walking to many of the great places in NYC I also agree with many reviews that the rooms are very soundproof Overall for the price I really think this hotel needs to class it up in the rooms cleanliness and helpfulness  
P => Nicer than I expected The biggest downside of ths hotel is the location  I will qualify that rek by stating that I am not a newbie to the city so the appeal of TImes Square is lost on me  However since the entrance to the hotel is on a very busy corner th and th you often have to fight your way through crowds to get in or out of the hotel  Thats a slight bit annoying  Having said that though the room was clean and large by New York City standards  I was traveling with two teenage girls and we had more than enough room for all of us even after they had been shopping for  consecutive days  I have stayed in no less than ten NYC hotels in roughly the same price range and aside from that entrance issue the Doubletree is one of the better hotels I have stayed in for nt  
P => Great stay in NYC We had a great stay   the suite accomodated our family with plenty of room especially for NYC  Room was clean and in nice condition  Service was quick and responsive  Location in Times Square was excellent  
P => Perfect family lodging for NY Two teen girls and two adults just spent a weekend at the Doubletree and it was fabulous The views from our room overlooking Times Square were just gorgeous and we were centrally located to shopping and access via subway to the city  The proximity to play tickets and theaters couldnt have been any better and the location was simply great for us  No bedbugs in fact   the bedding was as comfortable as any Ive slept on  We had enough sinks for everyone for teeth brushing etc  The security was good and the folks who worked there were really friendly  I would rate this very high as a hotel for families who want nice convenient lodging and dont mind the bustle of Times Square  We felt the hotel was very well priced for Manhattan and provided every courtesy and amenity we needed  
P => Grat but no free internet as they said so I stayed twice in this month and it has been a perfect room and very spacious and it suite looking through times sqaure the first time I stayed I booked the Discover Downtown Package and stayed in room  looking to the screen that are on the Renaissance Hotel and they gave me a gift card for Century  a store and I never used it coupond for a mall and many coupons     I tought the internet was free becuase other people had said so but on my second stay I reserved the same room but as we checked in they asked us if we wanted a view and and if we wanted a high floor I said yes they gave us room  which was a big suite i think it was called Conference suitre and it was bigger  And they gave us free wireless beacse we were in executive floors  Yay 
P => Great Location Helpful Staff The staff was very professional and helpful and the room was adequate for a suite hotel  Nothing special though  
P => Great for the whole family I had a quick trip to NY with  teenagers and the Doubletree was perfect  Two very comfortable double beds and a pull out sofa in a suite so there was enough privacy and space for us all  The hotel was pretty quiet for Times Square and the ac worked great on a hot night  The kids loved being in Times Square  I usually prefer the East side but this was a great location for going to a show at MSG  
P => happy at the Doubletree My husband and two sons stayed here last weekend and thought it was a GREAT oasis in the midst very busy amp convenient TImes Square  They upgraded us when we got there to having a free breakfast buffet  The suite was very clean and comfortable and it was wonderful to have that extra room with children along  A great choice overall for a family trip A reader from Madison Misssissippi 
P => i love doubletree  new york Great suites great staff great location for theatres and shopping and the suites are perfect for families  
P => Worst Experience Ever My family and I traveled to New York for some business and fun  We have stayed in Time Square every year for the past  years but have never stayed at the Double Tree  The morning after the first night my son years old woke up and had about  bites from sleeping on the sofa in the room  When we contacted the hotel staff   they immediatly tried to get us to sign a waiver to release them from liability  They then changed rooms for us  The next day when my son was all swollen from the bites I contacted the hotel to find out what the source of the bites were etc  The accused me of bringing my son to their hotel in this condition  I will never stay at a Hilton Property again I will upload photos of his bites later  
P => 
P => Modern  friendly staff easy walk to Penn Station   but tiny rooms I stayed at this Doubletree hotel several nights in early ember for a combination business  leisure trip  Overall it was very modern clean comfortable and featured all new amenities amp digital TV etc  Our room was on a higher floor had  comfortable double beds was quiet and had a gorgeous view of the Empire state building  Really nice Its an easy walk to Macys and all the shopping the subway and Penn station  So if you are attending a concert at MSG its a great location Breakfast was included with my room and they have a lovely restaurant  Staff was great   incredibly friendly and helpful  Also I did not experience a problem with the elevator and from talking to the staff I understand the weekends or very busy days there can be problems with it       However my main issue was the very very tiny room  I have lived in NYC and often stay in the city but this room was extremely small   even for one person  The bathroom was very tight  I had to keep my cosmetics in the bathtub because there was absolutely no room to keep anything in the bathroom  Believe it or not there was barely space to keep a toothbrush on the sink as the shelf around the sink was almost non existent  The closet was extremely compact and since I had a different event to attend each night I could not keep all of my clothes in it  My recommendation If you are one be two persons and dont have a lot of clothes or bags then you can deal with it  Otherwise stay at a hotel with a larger sized rooms like the doubletree in times square that features suites    or at least try to get a hotel with slightly bigger rooms  I can only hope this hotel will reate amp merge two of their rooms into one  That might solve the size problem 
P => Nice one night stay at the Doubletree We stayed at this hotel for one night in early ember  The hotel is a very short walk to Penn Station which was very convenient  The hotel is located on a boring sidestreet  It is  blocks to Macys and other shops at Herald Square  I enjoyed the fact that it is a newer hotel clean and was in good repair  Our room was one of the smallest that I have stayed in while in New York City  For a short stay it was fine  We never had to wait very long to use the elevators  Service was friendly  My Mom commented that the bed was one of the most comfortable that she had slept in  We had a room on a higher floor with a ent view  I would stay here again if the price was right  
P => Great Deal and Good Location This hotel is great deal for the price and location  The rooms are clean the staff is helpful and Chelsea is a fun area to stay in  The rooms werent huge but thats a given in NYC  My only complaint were the elevators  They take FOREVER  We were on the  something floor and took the stairs a couple times because of the wait  Request a room on a lower floor to avoid that issue  Also its a newer hotel and if you take a taxi make sure your driver knows youre going to Chelsea and not Times Square  
P => nice hotel  friendly staff Stayed here for  nights in ember  Was a bit wary after reading some negative reviews but was pleasantly surprised when we arrived  th st is not much to look at but once inside the hotel you forget about that  The staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them  We had a room on the st floor with  double beds which were extremely comfortable with  pillows each lovely  Bathroom small but spotless with nice fresh towels daily  Hotel is only a short walk to Macys and Times Square so quite central really  We took a yellow cab to Ground Zero about  dollars then went shopping in Syms where my son bought a lovely leather coat for  which was a great bargain as they had the same one in Century   which is also nearby  for   Would return to this hotel again  
P => Please add another elevator We got a reasonably good rate at  per night  The hotel is in kind of an odd area not a ton around there except places selling hats and purses in bulk and some importexport places  The staff was helpful and professional  Every time we bumped into someone they asked how are stay was etc  After our first night we returned to the room and the keys no longer worked  During the  night stay I heard  other people complaining about the same thing so its obviously an issue  The room  was spotless and ently sized for a new york hotel room The real issue is the lack of elevators  There are  for the entire hotel as well as the staff  The wait for the elevator was always a minute or  sometimes up to   If that doesnt sound long to you youve never waited for an elevator that long  When it arrived it was inevitably packed and sometimes also had a maid or room service cart in there taking up  the space  I cant imagine what it would be like on an upper floor probably a  minute commute from your front door to the entrance of the hotel including elevator wait and stopping at every floor  I know the hotel was almost full  rooms open but this is obviously a major problem  I wouldnt stay here again for that reason 
P => Great Hotel We stayed in the hotel on a Friday and Saturday night  Its new modern and clean  We took Amtrak to New York  The hotel was a short  block walk down th avenue and a left on th  When I turned down th I got a little concerned  Its one of those areas of the city that is slowly being gentrified  Its full of old trading companies and hold overs from years past  When I got half way down th street I saw the hotel and felt better  Check in was quick and we were in our room in about  minutes with warm chocolate chip cookies a treat they give you at check in  We were on the nd floor with a king size bed  The rooms are small but for NY standards I would say they are about average  The room felt new and modern with beech furniture a good size flat screen tv and crisp sheets  Our room faced th street and we could see int he Empire State building  The bathroom was small but clean and featured Neutrogena products  I found the hotel to be quiet and comfortable  The location was good we could get everywhere in about  minutes by taxi  Most of our cab fares were  or less  The hotel does have a business center and gym  I didnt use either but I did see them   They were nothing out of the ordinary  The staff was very nice and helpful  I would recommend this hotel especially if your catching a show or a game at the garden  
P => Very mod clean convenient and near to Times Square  We were supposed to be staying at the Affinia Manhattan and between the hotel and our travel agent they mucked up Anyway we were offered this hotel and I must say it was nice  As a girl I would not walk th street on my own in the dark however once you have someone with you it is fine  Great location  Room was lovely  We were in  and it was spacious as New York hotels go and the ensuite was really nice   no bath though but then didnt spend much time in the hotel  
P => Very pleased We stayed for one night after booking the room that morning  The room was small but extremely clean and adequate for the two of us and looked as if it had been recently been refurbished  We paid under   for the night which was a real bargain  I would definitely stay there again especially for the same rate  The only things that were somewhat of a problem was the inadequate elevators during the morning rush  My husband said that he had to wait for at least  minutes and was not pleased since it delayed his arrival to work  I left later but was annoyed at the racket the maids seemed to be making in the hallways  If I had planned on sleeping late I would have definitely been annoyed 
P => Good launching point for NYC adventures Two blocks away from Madison Square Garden and about   blocks from Empire State Building  The actual street location could be better but no real complaints  Rooms are small  people max but new  No real closets in our unit  Comfy beds  Elevators can get busy during the morning checkout  Staff is hospitable and accommodating  
P => Small rooms  Ridiculously small  Yes it is NY and yes rooms can be somewhat small  But this is place was ridiculous  The room was big enough for a bed and a desk and thats about it  Id expect this from a no name local hotel not from a DoubleTree  Also the hotel is  stories  There are only  small elevators which hold be  people at a time  Which means during peak times like at am you wait forever  One day I waited for over  minutes for the elevator  When one finally showed up   too full for me to get into  It was ridiculous  Room Service I ordered a burger and fries  When it arrived the fries were cold and no ketchupmustard was provided  Not the end of the world but still when youre paying  for a burger the least they could do is warm it up before bringing to your room and throw in a bottle of ketchup The hotel is very new so everything looked good it was clean etc  And it is pretty good location if you want to see the sights with several subway stations within a  minute walk  Still I would not stay there again given the room size  
P => Horrendous Service   Not in Chelsea The hotel is much more in the sketchy shoppingflower district than it is in Chelsea  I paid over  for a room and had worse service than  hotels  First it is not in the best neighborhood  Second the Bells just sat there while I unloaded luggage followed by simply pointing to where I can check in    I was in Business Casual attire so it is not as if there was any reason to be snubbed  They do give you a nice cookie at check in  And lastly after literally paying a total one night bill of something right near  they have the audacity to then charge you almost  for wireless service  Are you kidding me I have stayed at the Belnord Hotel on the upper west side for a couple hundred dollars and had better service  I highly recommend staying somewhere else     
P => Really nice  Really  Front Desk Staff Friendly and efficient and they give you those warm cookies  Room Spotless  Bed Very comfy loads of pillows   the good kind  Bathroom Nice tub you can actually take a bath in plenty of hot water and great water pressure full toiletries and a nice strong blowdryer thats not screwed to the wall  TV Great reception AND plenty of channels  Parking Alas no but the garage is just down the street    per night  Check out was a breeze  
P => Not enough room to swing a cat Turned away at  noon and again at  pm as my room wasnt ready  Offered a soda as compensation  I know that the property is expensive in New York but the room and the corridor was so small that you couldnt swing a cat in either place  Walls must be thin too cos I could hear the family talking in the adjacent room  The lobby bar and restaurant were also small and congested  The building is tall and narrow with only  lifts    which used by everyone meaning a long wait  Is the hotel really in Chelsea    be just  Not far to the subway though  
P => Great Value    Very Comfortable We stayed at Doubletree Hotel Chelsea from       This is a small new hotel that is within an easy walk to Times Square and and even shorter walk to Madison Square Garden The Empire State Building and Macys  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the room although small very comfortable with a king size bed desk and wardrobe  The bathroom was very small but adaquite and everything was spotlessly clean and fresh  We paid  for the Sunday night and  for the Monday night stay  A great vaule for NYC We would gladly stay again and recommend this hotel to others  
P => Good hotel My husband and I stayed at the Doubletree Hotel in Chelsea over the weekend of t    It was about a  minute walk at most from Penn Station  Check in was fairly quick and then we were off to our room  The room is small compared to other hotels in other cities but for NY   its normal and actually quite good  We got nervous about noise when we were about to enter our room  We were directly across from the elevator and then there was a lot of noise coming from one of the rooms down the hall  But when we entered the room and closed the door   the combination of the air conditioner and the walls made the hall barely audibleThe reviews on here are true   the elevators are slow  But its completely manageable and we just took the stairs from the th floor when we needed to get out and didnt have baggage  Squeeze in when you get the chanceThe location was great  Chelsea is such a fun area and we were able to walk to a lot of different places  Try Elmo for brunch which is a few blocks awayThe fitness center had updated equipment which is a definite plus and hard to find in hotels I believe it was all Precor I love Doubletree cookies  
P => Good Value Good Location Nice Staff We encountered a few hiccups at check in but they were handled properly by Helen Front Desk Supervisor  Location not the best street but a few blocks down you are right on Madison Square Garden  Hotel is a typical New York Building corridors are narrow and rooms are under  sq ft   Restaurant staff was superb Overall nice hotel they are still trying to get everything up and running as they just open  
P => New hotel with a great price This hotel had recently opened Summer  so everything is new and clean as expected  It is a short walk to Penn Station or the Empire State Building and within walking distance of Times Square  The room was an average size for the location and certainly worth the  rate  I would recommend this hotel over The New Yorker any day The negatives would be the fact that internet access wired or wireless is not free and is over day but the low room rate made up for this negative  There are only two elevators in the building so expect to wait five minutes during normal hours and possibly more during busy days  The walls and floors are thin so expect to hear your neighbors in the rooms next to you and even the flushing of toilets on floors above you The positives would certainly be the price and location  The HDTV with Time Warner HD cable was also nice but the free On Demand features seemed to be disabled and would alway return errors Overall its a great place for the rate I paid night   I have been staying at many hotels in the area and my order of recommendation assuming equal rates would be Hilton Garden Inn  W th St Hampton Inn  W th Street Doubletree Chelea  W th St Wyndham Garden  W th Hilton Garden Inn  W th St Hampton Inn  W st St New Yorker  th Ave 
P => Clean comfortable and affordable Manhattan hotel If youre looking for an affordable clean and comfortable room in Manhattan this Doubletree  along with its sister Hilton brand properties in the neighborhood  cant be beat  Service is top notch   I stayed for one night and then returned for two a couple of days later  The front desk clerk greeted me by name when I arrived for my second stay   very impressive  Otherwise my favorite thing about this hotel is that it offers  channel cable tv complete with an interactive programming guide   that  be the last thing on the mind of most people visiting NYC but I spend  nights a year in hotels  It was a pleasant change from the   channels that you find at most properties On the downside the lifts are terribly slow   it wasnt so bad during my first stay but when I returned it seemed like only one of the two would move at any given time  At one point spent over five minutes waiting while the one lift stayed on floor  the entire time And I agree w previous reviews it does seem quite ridiculous to charge  for internet access especially when the nearby Hampton and Hilton Garden Inn are essentially identical hotels but offer it for free  Finally the surrounding neighborhood isnt all that appealing but at the same time I never felt unsafe   besides its a short walk to more traveler friendly areas  Penn Station is only about a  minute walk away so if youre arriving at either Newark or JFK airport you can save your money on the cab fare and just take the train  
P => Not Enough Elevators Fire Code Violations Clearly the NYC Building Dept  should have never approved plans for this hotel  What were they thinking At  floors there are only TWO small cab not so fast elevators and no service elevator which means long waits in the morning and afternoonevening and sharing elevators with bins of dirty linens garbage bags and luggage  Worse the lack of hallway space on the guest floors means the housekeeping staff have to pile bags and bags of linens in the fire escape stairwells overnight often blocking passage between floors  I used to live in NYC and have lived in high rises my entire adult life and can assure you this is a fire code violation  I showed pictures to the assistant manager who was very nice and apologetic and promised to bring it up at the next staff meeting  Still it makes you wonder what else is going wrong Other issues no minibar nor mini refrigerator no liquor license ice machines on only every third or fourth floor if you can get to them through the bags of linens  Now the good part  The staff are friendly and realize the problems the architects and whoever runs real estate at Hilton left them and their guests  I feel sorry for them that they have to work at such a badly designed facility  Id say OK for tourists with time on their hands would be a disaster for a business trip where you have to be downstairs in  or  minutes Another plus great location at least for me  Convenient to Chelsea where I have many friends mid town Penn Station whatever  Yes the block is a little quotindustrialquot    lots of low end wholesale fabric and fashion accessory showrooms    but Fashion Institute of Technology is down the street and there is some sort of FIT student dorm nearby so energy on the street even late at night OK for tourists would be a disaster for time sensitive business travelers  
P => Fairly priced in quiet neighborhood yet walkable Fully reated older Hilton and typically small rooms for Manhattan yet nicely situated for quiet nights  There was an interesting view of the top floors of the Empire State building from the window  Staff at front desk were accomodating  My only complaint I still dont understand why these major brands still charge for internet   it is almost like charging for a shower in the morning  Perhaps it is about losing revenues by not using the telephones in the room  
P => a diamond in the city After much searching I found the doubletree  It has only been open for a couple of months  It has a nice walk or short cab drive fron Penn Station  The staff is limited but very nice and they offer you cookies all day every day  We first had a King room because they were soldout of doubles  The room was a very nice size with a nice bathroom  Not at all the broom closet you usually think of in NY  The room looked new and the bed was very comfortable  the only downer was that the wireless was not free and the business center stayed full with only  computers and during peak hours the elevators were slow  I would stay here agine in a heart beat  one of the best deals in town 
P => This place has a great staff great location and even great food  This is a pretty new hotel so its extremely clean and modern  Ive now stayed here twice and was impressed both times  I found some great rates on it too so that made it an easy ision  The staff are very friendly and accommodating which is always a plus Rooms arent huge but a bit bigger than average for New York  The corridors are a bit tight but its to be expected when crammed in between so many existing buildings  One thing I do find difficult is the bathrooms have no real counter space so youre hard pressed to leave anything in there  On my last stay I got in late from work each night and ordered room service  The service was great and the food was both reasonable and very good  The hotel is a quick few blocks from Penn Station and right around the corner from the th St stop of the  train so its pretty easy to get anywhere in the city from here  Its also a quick walk to Herald SquareMacys Empire State Building and most mid town attractions  Id definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to be close to everything and stay in a clean and modern hotel with very reasonable rates  
P => Brand New DoubleTree in Midtown   Perfect A brand new DoubleTree right in the heart of midtown   what more can I ask for I booked this room for a leisure trip at a fantastic rate and was happy with everything  Rooms were all brand new with major new amenities  The only downside were that the rooms were small but that is to be expected in NY and I didnt really mind the size of the room  
P => Good new hotel I stayed here with three girlfriends in one of the  double rooms on which we got a great deal  The room was small pretty cramped with our bags but we made it work   we were there only one night  And its NYC people the rooms are small I agree that the elevators take a long time  Everything was new and beautiful in the room and bathroom  Very comfortable beds  Front desk was very nice and tried hard when we were looking for pizza delivery at am  Our extra towel request took about  minutes  They stored our bags after we checked out   very hassle free  The major con is that the neighborhood is a little run down  the garment district was seedier than I thought it would be but a quick walk to Flatiron and Madison Square Park all the major stores around there  All in all I might stay here again with another great deal but might think twice because of the location  
P => Overall an average NYC hotel Rooms are small   sq ft  but well appointed  Comfortable bed Still buggyquot from beig new  Lots of carts garbage bags and confused staff Elevators are too small too slow and too few for a  floor hotelFull service restaurant is a nice amenity for this type of hotel in this areaNo open space or common area anywhereLocation seems safe but many seedy characters roam the streets in the eveningA  minute walk to Penn Station Madison Sq  Gardeerall ent for a solo traveler for a couple days that has business in the area once the service matures  
P => Small rooms long elevator waits not enough staff We stayed here last week and I booked it because I trusted the DoubleTree name and the fact that it appeared to be close to Penn Station Subway should I choose to go around New York with my kids Quick Facts   The rooms are extremely small and so is the bathroom  However since this Hotel is very new everything looks clean and sparkling   It took forever and multiple reminders to get anything from the Service staff   and I am talking about simple things such as refills for the coffeemaker after  days of stay and no refills in between  They appear to be extremely understaffed   The neighborhood is not great to walk around after dark   it is dark and smelly and there is construction on the same street      Unless you get a great deal on the stay   I woudl not recommend this place  
P => Wonderful Stay I came to this hotel after I checked into my room at the Hotel Penn right down the street on th ave  I was desperate for another room at another hotel  The two ladies at the front desk were so nice and gave us a very fair rate  The rooms are small but hello   this is New York And Ive stayed in smaller   Our room was spotless and I dont know why other reviewers had a problem with service   we got amazing service  Every time we saw an employee in the hallway or elevator they said hello and asked us how our stay was going  With a small child we had some extra requests from housekeeping and we always got everything right away The neighborhood is great  An easy walk to Penn Station and the Chelsea galleries I even passed where the film the tha Stewart Show on my walks  Ive walked to Times Square twice and it too is an easy walk from this hotel  Also lots of fashionwholesale stuff around Free internet in the lobby  
P => Tiny dark rooms long wait for lifts tatty area This new hotel  be convenient for those looking to have a rowdy time in Times Square and admittedly can have a view of the Empire State building but for more than one nights stay its is far too cramped with too few facilities on hand for a a family  The rooms were tiny and with very little light breakfast was only ok and not cheap enough for what it was and it took ages to come if you did not have the buffet  Two lifts took ages to come  Its location in the garment district reminded me of the Mile End Road in London with that certain edginess and it smelled   badly   and is not a place I would chose to stay   we were disappointed that Virgin put us here for one of their coach tours so we had to suffer it for three nights at first then another night at the end of the tour  I noticed a couple of school parties were staying there at the same time  I could not wait to leave and did not like walking back to this area after dark When we arrived to check in they had not even got our details   I wish they had been lost for ever so we could have stayed somewhere else  The place also seemed badly short staffed  
P => Clean new and centrally located but understaffed and under equipped The rooms are clean and very comfortable althought small and tight as is common in big cities like New York  The midtown location on the near west side isnt exciting in itself but is centrally located near several subway lines and is easily walkable to Chelsea the fasion district the Brodway theater district Madison Square and more Heres the big problem the hotel lacks the infrastructure capacity to accommodate its size  The two elevators in a hotel of nearly  stories are woefully insufficient  I was on the nd floor and nearly every time I went down to the lobby I not only had to wait way too long for an elevator but it was nearly packed when it arrived  Guests on lower floors often couldnt fit in    either they took the stairs or they waited a very long time  This was particularly gruesome in the morning when people were checking out and carrying baggage on the elevator with them The limited floor space in the small lobby means the front desk and the bell stand cannot accommodate the demand  The hotel doesnt have enough space for all inbound outbound and checked baggage and so the lobby looked like a luggage warehouse with bags strewn all over  Too few bellmen on duty meant long waits either to check or pick up a bag or to be received on the way in or helped into a cab on the way out although the bellmen were friendly and tried their best  Front desk service was friendly and efficient but again the small desk doesnt allow as many desk clerks as the hotel needs during peak times Whats interesting is how this hotel compares with the two other Hilton family hotels on the same block a Hampton and a Hilton Garden immediately behind this Doubletree on W  th Street  Ive stayed in all three  Theyre all built roughly on the same footprint and seem to have been put up at roughly the same time  Perhaps theyre all the same ownership  But the other two dont have the Doubletrees problems with insufficient infrasructure  I never had problems with long elevator waits or poor service in the lobby of the other places  I noticed that both those hotels have fewer floors than the Doubletree so they presumably have fewer rooms and fewer guests with infrastructure more appropriate to their capacity If youre looking for a Hilton family hotel in this neighborhood Id recommend the Hampton or the Hilton Garden over the Doubletree in this cluster of three hotels on the block comparable value but a more pleasant experience    with more time to enjoy New York and less waiting for elevators or bell staff  
P => New hotel  Small rooms  Slow elevator  No free internet  Good attitude from bell service staff  New hotel on th street  We spent  nights here as we could not extend our stay at Blakely Hotel  Doubletree Chelsea was recommended to us by Hilton  When I checked there was no review yet of the hotel  My brother in law who lives in NYC said its not a very good neighborhood but the hotel itself looked nice Check in was a bit chaotic as the hotel seem full when we were checking in y   The men at the bell service were so friendly amp helpful  The ones in the reception were not as accommodating  be teething problems for a newly opened hotel  the hotel just opened for a week when we checked inRooms We tried to book for one of their  suites but it was sold out  The regular room we got was nice  My complaint is the small size of the room and there was no refrigerator  The other thing is there is no free internet  I had to pay  for  hours use of internet My other complaint is the elevator  This is New York  Only  elevators and there is no service elevator so the housekeeping staff takes the main elevators as well The guys from bell service go out of their way to accommodate guests  I forgot to take down the name of the afro american guy who even gave us bottles of water while waiting in the lobby  Dean the guy who helped us with our bags when we were leaving refused my tip saying my brother in law gave him already  Such an honest person The location is accessible to Macys area where you can find Zara Gap HampM nail salons and of course Macys  Eats like Hortons KFC Mrs Fields etc and convenience stores are nearby Turning left from the hotel youll find Reade and some diner  We tried chinese takeout at Ginger House and it was so good  Times Square is a couple of blocks away  th street is very interesting in early morning as florists from NY get their flower requirement from there  I even found a fresh bunch of lilies of the valley for my sisters wedding bouquet Taxi can be had not in front of the hotel but on the street corner  We easily got a taxi on our way to watch Jersey Boys in Arthur Theater If I go back be I would try one of their  suites or one of the  penthouse suites on th floor  
P => Cookies  This hotel is a brand new hotel opened up sometime early y  Its centrally located in Chelsea which includes Fashion Fur and Flower districts  With  stories the hotel offers great views of NYC  We were on the th floor and had a nice view of the Empire State Building From arrival to departure date all of the staff was friendly and very helpful  At check in we were given THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE weve ever eaten  Our room had  king size bed which was so comfortable  Also the room featured flat screen tv coffee maker ironiron board wiredwireless internet and mp radio  The housekeeping staff was friendly every time we saw them and the rooms was very clean  Wed definitely stay again when were back in NYC  
P => Amazing Was a bit skeptical at first since i could not find any reviews about this hotel  Well let me be the first to help others make their isions  This hotel was   weeks old when we book so that explains no reviews  The building i find was well situated from all side of attractions  Parking is not in the building but   block down the street  Well secured and hrs  We do get a discount from the hotel  For a SUV it was with discount   USD for hrs  Our Dodge ram x Larime  was still there after  nights  The attendant spoke well English and french  The main lobby was very clean and modern  One of the door man Micheal greeted us very well with professionalism  At the registration desk io was very courteous and helpful and kind  And dont forget to ask for the warm cookies they offer at check in amazingly good  Couldnt help myself for a second bite that i took from my dhters cookie  The building has  elevators we stayed on the Th floor and i just loved the view  Its not ocean view but being above the buildings was good for me  Our room had  double beds flat screen TV and a bathroom  The room and everything inside was new and clean  we were the first to stay in One comment i would like to make if some one is listening which would help lots more guest  The flat screen TV should be hung on the wall same location but  above the cabinet so it can free up counter space for the coffee machine which was there but was not able to use because had no space  The bathroom can have extra  glass shelves over the toilette for shaving creme soap or tooth paste  Apart from that everything else was perfect  The beds were comfortable and the pillows were nice and soft  To bad my own pillows at home are not like that Every room has Internet access if needed but we used the computer room in the basement which came in pretty handy  The fitness room also is in the basement and has a treadmill step master free weights balls and etc   The house cleaning did a good job  Also Yanick and Joe were great in assisting us and giving us advice Over all i would certainly recommend this Hotel to family and friends I will try to upload photos later if i can Thanks again to io Micheal Joe and Yanick for a pleasant stay  Keep up the good work guysLuigi Albanese Montreal Canada  
P => lequilibrio giusto  
P => 
P => Agreeable hotel terrific location Located nicely in midtown with easy access to the subway  Lots of selection for eating and shopping nearby  Some construction in lobby but this was minimally inconvenient  Room was clean and well proportioned staff was friendly and helpful even for NYC  
P => Staff Wonderful with remodel underway We had a large group of familes with jump ropers in the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade  Staff got us into rooms after long bus trip and always helped with details  While the hotel is undergoing remodeling and it is needed as with many NYC hotels it was clean and comfortable  Internet is free in the lobby and the warm cookies are available all the time as a bonus  It was a very busy time and each person received individual attention and service  Hilton standards realizing construction was going on were maintained  Staff was most helpful and took care of our needs and more  New York hotel rooms are small and that is just a fact of life  Clean is important and our group had no complaints  
P => Location is good   but thats it    I always try and stay in the Hilton chain   This hotel is old and run down  There was construction taking place on   which is probably a good thing Rooms are really small and they are for sure HOT  In NYC most hotels turn off the AC for the winter  You have  choice heat or open the window  This can be very noisy with the horn blowing etc  The staff are excellent but the one thing that was very bad was the breakfast    The chef should consider other career options  Being in the restaurant business I couldnt believe what he put out    Cold and bland      Other wise the location is great     
P => Toilets throw water on buns and on the wall  No kidding  Horrible  Ill never be back   Internet is not free   Secret quotHilton free internetquot didnt work   Under reations and bar area was fugly   Prices for a beer at the bar absurd   Toilet threw water on my bum and if not seated toilet threw water on the WALL    HDTV low quality why buy HDTV for this blocky crap Letterman gets filmed like a half mile away and picture stunk    Shower water pressure and shower head stunk   Minibar was EMPTY no fridge   nothing I hate this place  Its a rip off  I have nothing good to stay about it other than I didnt get mugged or stolen from and the building didnt fall while I was there  I consider myself lucky I guess night  Absurd  
P => Great Hotel for a Good Price The location of this hotel is excellent if you want to be right in the heart of midtown  the staff is extremely helpful and accomodating  The rooms are on the older side and could use some general reorating but they are very clean and extremely spacious by NY standards  This was the st time Ive had a hotel room in NYC with my own large and private terrace I have stayed here before and I will certainly stay here again  
P => Not up to Hilton standards Great location  walking distance to many of Manhattans great tourist attractions  The warm cookies at check in were nice however the service was less than great  Upon entering the lobby with our bags  bellmen stood watching us   no offering to help no greeting   they were discussing something else amongst themselves  The check in was quick and efficient with very little effort or hospitality put in to it by the gal working the desk  The lobby was under construction and their bar was a makeshift portable bar with a few tables and chairs surrounding it  No notification of construction when booking the room  a heads up would have been nice  The room was nice and clean minus some peeling wallpaper in the bathroom  The housekeeping staff was outstanding very friendly and very willing to go above and beyond  I have stayed in Hilton Hotels many times and have never had this poor of service before  I was very disappointed for the price we paid  I firmly believe that the staff of a hotel makes or breaks your experience there and this one left a pretty sour taste in my mouth  
P => Neutrogena bath products AND a warm cookie I travel to NYC frequently and lately Ive been staying at this hotel for two simple reasons   that warm cookie they hand you when you check in is lovely and Im a big fan of the Neutrogena bath products including the face moisturizer so I dont have to bring my own from home  Hotels of a certain classprice level are basically all the same   its the little touches that distinguish one from the others  So these are the two little touches that keep me coming back  Silly but there it isOh my one criticism is that the fitness center is too small for a hotel of its size  Both times when Ive tried to use it there havent been any cardio machines available  
P => Perfect in a less than perfect world Highly recommended if you need a convenient clean respectable place to stay in mid town  All of the amenities you need at your fingertips  Great breakfast for Hhonors Gold members  Very responsive to special requests  Despite construction and small lobby very comfortable  Wi Fi is extra in rooms which explains why so many people park in the lobby and corners to work  
P => Under construction good location mediocre hotel I had a short one night here for business nearby  Check in was quick efficient and friendly with the warm cookie offered  The lobby area was under construction as of ember  so the hallway to the elevators was very constricted  The quotbarquot consisted of a few tables and a portable bar shoved into said hallway congestion was constant in this hallway  Room service amp dining hours were restricted due to the reation none of which was advertised before arrival  My room on the th floor was average size for New York standards but the bathroom was definitely sub par  The ceiling paint was peeling and the tub had been worn down to the base metal in places  The bedding amp furniture were quality and clean  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating  Overall it is fine for a quick trip but should not be near the top of any list  
P => Great Location   Horrible Hotel My family  adults and  children stayed at the hotel for  nights  The condition of our room was significantly well below standard for and Hilton hotel brand  Our room was very dirty and dusty some of the common areas of the hotel were the same we had a broken closet door in our room there was mildew in the shower and of the most serious complaint was a SERIOUS infestation of fleas andor bed bugs  My  young children ages  and  were crying itching and are returning home with bites and welts all over their body  We were all miserable for  days We travel extensively for both business and pleasure and have stayed at many other Hilton hotels from Venice Italy to Napa California to South Florida and never in the past have we been so disappointed in our hotel experience  As a result of this hotel stay in New York City we are seriously considering boycotting ALL future stays at Hilton Hotels  
P => Perfect place for business stay in NY City This is the best place to stay in NY City especially if you go for business  Best location in town with most of the major banks headquarters at walking distance  st St  subway station right beneath the hotel is priceless in cold winters and hot summers  There are plenty of restaurants and cultural attractions in the area  The rooms are comfortable and extremely tidy spacious and well illuminated  The best thing about the place is its magnificent staff  The lobby team leaded by Mr  Dennis Jarr n is always kind efficient and willing to help  
P => Great NYC Getaway  Truly a Hidden Gem As Ive done before I read a lot of reviews of this property both before and after my stay  My friends and I were very pleased with everything about this hotel  It was very centrally located to so many attractions in NYC  particularly shopping districts Central Park and Times Square  Also for places outside of a comfortable walking radius taxicabs are plentiful as this is in a very bustling area or there is also a subway station basically right next door to the property which we also used  The concierge made some amazing restaurant recommendations also very appropriate given what we were looking for particular types of cuisine approximate price ranges etc  The rooms were quite spacious for NYC and substantially larger than others Ive stayed in at comparable NYC properties  Everyone on staff particularly Dennis one of the managers went out their way to ensure that our stay was comfortable and pleasant  I cant say enough positive things about this hotel  We also enjoyed a great buffet breakfast in the hotel on one of the mornings  All in all the staff and atmosphere of this hotel only served to enhance our stay in Manhattan  
P => Excellent location but the Hotel needs to be reated Excellent location good concept but the rooms need to be reated they are just OK for a short stay but nothing is really enjoyable the bed is old as well as the carpet I would not walk barefoot     There are much better in NYC for that price    
P => Very nice hotel excelent localization This is not a cheap hotel however there s no cheap hotels in Manhattan   Very nice hotel close to main attractions and besides a metro station  
P => Great price for a clean quiet comfortable room in this area The Doubletree is a perfectly nice hotel that costs a third or even less than the ritzier hotels that surround it on the Upper East Side  Its definitely not in the same league as say the Waldorf which is down the street but it was really very pleasant  The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was reasonably comfy  It wasnt beautifully orated some odd lamps too many bare walls etc  but it was clean and not at all dingy  It was also very quiet  Plus you gotta love being greeted at check in with a large warm delicious chocolate chip cookie for everyone in your party  If you want to stay in this area and you dont want to spend a fortune this is a good choice  
P => Okay for the Price This Doubletree is centrally located in Midtown East  Overall the rooms were a little small and some of the bathrooms were really small  Very nice front desk staff  Good buffet breakfast each morning  
P => Warm smiles with tasty cookies  I have to say i really enjoyed staying at this hotel  Hotel staffs were very friendly and professional  I shared an one queen bedroom with my friend and we were pleased that it was roomy for both of us  What more do you want if you stay in a room that has a comfortable bed clean bathroom and HDTV with HBO channel I thought nothing but there is a plus  Perhaps you should try their yummy chocolate chip cookies They were like homemade ones that mom would bake  When you check in they hand out cookies with card keys  How great is that Hotel manager Dennis Jarrin was kind enough to pack more cookies for my flight home  I highly recommend Doubletree Metropolitan hotel if you want to stay in Midtown Manhattan 
P => Great value good location very good service I stayed in this hotel for three nights after fleeing the Sheraton Times Square  I had a mini suite on the th floor  The room was spacious for New York with a living area a desk and a wall of windows  The service was very good when I arrived and they checked on me throughout the stay  I used room service once and it was prompt and good  The room was very clean with alot of towels and quality linens  There is free wifi in the lobby a ent bar there as well  The workout room was clean and had an adequate array of equipment  The location is good and it is within walking distance of many attractions including Grand Central  It is a little far from most Broadway theatres but if you dont mind a  to  minute walk you can walk back from the theatre  
P => Would never stay here again We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan t       We were disappointed from the moment we walked in the lobby  I had read online that the hotel had been reated  It must have been back in the s  We were greeted and immediately helped by friendly staff   We went to our room and couldnt believe the or and condition of the room and bathroom  The furnishings orations and carpeting were old  The bathroom was tiny mold on the shower tiles and poorly repaired guages and reations on the cheap  We looked out the window and only saw a brick wall  If my husband sat in the chair at the desk I had to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room  I called down and requested a reated room  I was told all rooms were reated at the same time We were offered a room  floors up with the same configuration but a view of the street which we accepted in a heartbeat The room air conditioner was old  a register along the wall  It didnt kick on at night The only place for free Wi Fi was in the lobby and it was always crowded and loud The  positives are staff was friendly and the location was great It was very noisy from the outside as well as people closing doors in the hallway  It was like the doors were being slammed  I think it is because we were in a area were  rooms converged and the doors were positioned right next to each other We would not stay here again  I used to have a positive image of Doubltree Hotels  
P => Terrible Customer Service I have stayed in this hotel for many times and I didnt have good experience with the hotel staff at all  I always need to wait at the front desk for help not because they are serving other guests but chatting or doing their own business on their front desk  I think many of you know how it felt like after a long haul flight to NY and how desperate to rest on the bed when the room key is not working after check in  I am not asking the staff to attend my need within one second and I understand they have their business to deal with but at least they can ask me to wait for a minute instead of just ignoring me  The second thing is that I hope the house keeping staff can keep their noise level down  I know they cant control the noise from the vacuum machine but please dont yell their voice over the vacuum machine  The last thing that annoys me the most is that one time I try to call a guest in the hotel  I made the call at am eastern time to the ask the operator to connect my call  The operator replied me quotNoquot Then I asked why and she replied quotOkquot then hanged up  I wonder if she is extremely busy for connect a call at am in the morning  If you do have to stay at this hotel I wish everything is smooth  Otherwise good luck if you need their help for fix something or change something  Good luck if you need to rest during daytime  You will wake up every  to  minutes by police car fire truck or other cars honking  
P => Excellent value and great quality This conveniently located hotel is perfect for mid town visitors who will enjoy the comfortably appointed and elegantly orated rooms as well as the pleasant bar area and the breakfast room  Staff are pleasant and friendly including the general manager whose experienced vision of customer service can be felt throughout the hotel  It was a real pleasure staying there and I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Perfect location helpful staff I stayed at the Metropolitan Doubletree several times during the last year because our company had an agreement with the hotel  I never really encountered problems when checking in or out and my colleagues and I adore the warm chocolate chip cookies you get when checking in  The lobby is clean quite modern with free internet access  I experienced different rooms that were different in size too  All in all I cannot complain about the bed it was always clean and good to sleep on  Towels were clean too and the Neutrogena toiletries highly eciated  My AC was always working the only thing missing is a real temperature control Although I have to admit that the bathrooms are not in the best conditions and that some of the rooms need a refurbishment  At least the room has a new nice TV a radio where you can connect your MP and a safe in the closet not all hotels provide one  The gym is quite big and the carpet was lately renewed  But honestly how much time do you spend in your room when staying New York If you want a relaxing or romantic vacation New York is not the best place to go   The most important thing when staying in New York is the location And the location of the Doubletree is excellent  All the major attractions are in walking distance or easily reachable with the metro which is just next to the hotel  My experiences with the staff are good I always encountered corteous friendly and professional staff  Especially Dennis Jarrin was very helpful and gave me good advices I would definitely return to the Doubletree again for a short trip to New York 
P => Dont waste a trip to NYC at this place I used Hilton HHonors points to stay overnight after a function and this is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in    and that is saying something  I would never stay at another Doubletree  I would rate it at around a Motel  or Days Inn but I have stayed in some nice hotels in those chains  The rooms were shabby small and neglected  The heatingcooling unit looks like it was last replaced in the late s and only blew out cool air  I checked in after walking in the rain and couldnt even get the room warm  The bathroom floor was very unclean  The bathroom tub had black pockks in it and I touched more than one handle in the room that was sticky  Dont ask me with whatThe executive lounge is open from  am only and offers a meagre selection fruits and cold cereal  Do not waste your trip to New York here     I am from the area and still had a rotten experience here  Look around for some other locations in the city and enjoy 
P => Great and pleasant stay at the DT Metro bring earplugs just in case    I have to admit I tried rebooking since I was afraid of the bad reviews on the website  Upon walking into the lobby I was pleasantly surprised  The lobby was clean modern narrow something I expect out of a NYC hotel and a Doubletree  I had a great time check in was easy with no hassles or long waits  I got to the hotel after traveling awhile and arrived at the hotel before check in time  All of the hotel staff especially housekeeping amp the bellstaff lt thank you were pleasant and greeted me and my family with smiles and a warm hello  I asked the Concierge Jennifer for several different suggestions which did not disappoint  Britney checked me in and my mother very quickly  I originally booked under a package deal with Expedia normally I book under hilton honors since I am a member I was afraid I would be treated with disdain but the complete opposite happened  I booked a queen size bed but asked if I could get doubles instead  Unfortunetely she was unable to do that but upgraded me to a king room and a corner room which allowed for more space  It turned out to be great since my niece and nephew ended up visiting with us for awhile  I did not have breakfast there but opted for daily breakfast runs at the adjacent Metro cafe  I believe it is not affiliated with the hotel  The elevators ran fine and there was never a problem or a long wait for them  The hotel is diagonally across from the Waldorf Astoria and is next to the subway  I felt very safe especially since there is a fire station and police station on the same block  People complained about the noise but I find that hillarious you would think you would want to be close to such emergency departments just in case especially if you are solo and have to go to the atm at night  I brought my earplugs which I really did not need because if you are in nyc you will be walking all over the place or on your feet most of the time so by the time you get back to the hotel you are knocked out anyway  One negative I did see traces of mold in the shower which I thought was disturbing especially since it was a beautifully remodeled bathroom  In nyc you will see this in many hotels since the buildings are old and there is not adequate air circulation  All in all I would definetely stay here again the hotel was clean lively and happy Thank you for a wonderful stay  
P => Good Value For Money  Clean  Good Location  Stayed here from the th    st   Check in was easy and pleasant  Picked up our complimentary cookies which were lovely and warm  Stayed in room  which is on the th floor looking out to the Staples shop direct and Subway  Had a King size bed which was very comfortable and the linens were very white and clean  The TV was an L G LCD HD quot which was great and had plenty of channels  There was also a desk amp computer chair plus a small sofa in the room  The safe located in the top of the closet worked well but rather small as couldnt fit the laptop in  Plenty of storage for clothes and also empty suitcases  The bathroom sink counter was located in a arate side room to the main bathroom  The bathroom had a bathshower and toilet all of which worked well and water pressure was good also there was always hot water available  Although it might not of been the biggest of bathrooms it was just fine and for NY better than what you could possibly get elsewhere  Our floor had a room with an Ice Machine and Vending Machines in it which was handy  Lifts are quick and never have to wait longer than a minute for one  The Internet you have to pay for but look out for a wireless connection for a local University as you can connect to that for free or you  go down to the lobby to connect for free  We didnt use any of the food services in the hotel so cannot comment on that area but the bar located in the hotel was always full with people so it must be good  Maid service was very efficient always cleaned at suitable times We heard the Fire engines a few times during the night but it didnt bother us as we was so tired from walking around NY that we fell back asleep straight away  Checkout was very quick and easy no added extras on the bill like some hotels try and put on so was very pleased overall  
P => Good location busy and rowdy hotel We stayed here for  nights and were overall pleased with our room Pros  Close to the subway  Comfortable bed lots of pillows  Huge flat screen TV with great choice of channels  Lots of mirrors storage space and desktopscounters  or is modern carpet and bathroom is a bit worn  Front desk and housekeeping staff were friendly and helpfulCons  Very busy hotel lobby is always crammed no system of lining up for front desk assistance I got cut in front of each time I thought I was standing in line elevators are always full and  Our entire floor reeked of ijuana on a Sunday morning  Not very soundproof can hear all activity down hallways and car honking and sirens from the street  Bathroom toilet and tub does not have a fan leaving the room very musty and damp feeling probably the cause of the smell that previous guests have complained about  Sink and vanity are outside of bathroom but there is no towel bar or place to hang a towel leaving the space practically useless if someone is in the bathroom  Very little vanity space  Sink splashes very strongly seems silly but we all ended up with wet shirts on our first try at washing our handsGiven the price we would consider staying here again  Id shop around though first and try and stay out of a less touristy area  
P => Great room great rate great breakfast My husband and I stayed for five days and found the hotel staff pleasant the room clean everything working no problem with bathrooms  We were on the th floor on the back of the hotel and it was very quiet  The rate I booked which was non refundable included the breakfast buffet and that was great Wonderful waffles I would stay again  
P => Very Good choice in Manhattan Very good location  The hotel is a modern construction with comfortable rooms y nice style  The staff is very kind  We stayed in two continuos rooms for  nights and was a excellent experience  A quotMetro Cafequot is in the first floor at side of the principal entrance wich is very good alternative for fast healthty food  
P => NYC   reasonable and comfortable good location Good location  ent rooms   comfortable but small beds  Warm cookie appreciated on arrival  Open lobby was strange  Very good deli next door  Very reasonable room for NYC  
P => Very disapointing hotel go elswhere This hotel is very disapointing  It is very long in the tooth and its location is its only redeeming quality  It was probably ent  years ago but today it is dirty and a hotel to avoid  Checked in to hotel receptionist was very pleasant and welcoming however arrived at room to find dirty carpet old outdated or trash from previous guest in trashcan lock that didnt work and terrible airconditioning  it needs a complete overhaul stay elsewhere  
P => Mold Trash and Bad Attitudes When I arrived my room smelled like a teenage boys locker room  I contacted guest services and was moved and upgraded to a king size room  When I arrived in the new room the bathroom smelled like mold and urine the chest of drawers had been pulled away from the wall and a large pile of trash was behind it the carpet was dirty with crumbs the shower curtain had visible mold on it  The smell was overpowering  This is all in a room that had been cleaned and was quotguest readyquot  I paid the   for the  hour wireless internet access  Worked periodically  Not good for a business trip  I contacted the front desk and a nice man said no problem if it happens again well refund your money  Next morning it continued to happen  I contacted the front desk again the man who answered was very rude and informed me they DO NOT give refunds for internet  He checked my account and apparently the man the night before HAD given me a refund  So they DO give refunds on the internet  The bar is tiny  The lobby is constantly filled with teenagers sitting around using the internet  It smells like smoke with people standing one foot from the front door at the smokers quotpolequot  Get the Guest Relations Managers name Believe me youll need it  
P => OK if youre using it as a crash pad but dont expect luxury Having already read the reviews I knew that we werent in for a  star experience and I would rate this a  star hotel based on the room we were allocated  The room was fairly small   even by European standards   and dated  It could do with a refurb to bring it into the st century  The bathroom similarly was cramped and dated and could use a new bathroom suite  What added to our woes with the room was the fact that you could hear the aircon unit outside the hotel whirring at all hours which wasnt entirely conducive to a good nights rest  The public areas of the hotel were good though the bar is fine the wi fi in the reception was well used by us and everyone else there by the looks of things and the concierge was pleasant and helpful  That said the concierge sent us to an Italian restaurant which were looking to close up at  pm   in a city that never sleeps apparentlyAll in all the hotel is ok if youre looking for somewhere clean to lay your head and freshen up which is all we wanted it for  But a few small changes to the rooms could make it a nicer place to stay  
P => Good Deal for the Cost If you are looking for a reasonable place to stay in the city with a good location quiet ent room and bathroom   then the Double Tree is the place to stay  The only downside is the cost to use the internet   other than that it is a deal for NYC  I would stay again  
P => At that price point you can do better I stayed  nights at the Doubletree in e  The hotel was reasonably priced but you didnt seem to get much  The rooms were tiny worn and smelled  Although the lobby appears to be recently reated the rooms are in need of a face lift  Depending on the side of the hotel you stay on the rooms can be extremely loud due to the street traffic  The location of this hotel was great  Close to the subway and within walking distance to restaurants and bars  Although the hotel was reasonably priced I would think you could pay the same and stay in some place far nicer  
P => No complaints We were guests of the Doubletree Metropolitan y   and it was a very pleasant experience  The staff were helpful and we were allowed to check in early  AM  There is a subway stop right outside the door which was very convenient  Midtown attractions as well as Central Park are easily walkable  Best bagels in the city are just around the corner at Ess a Bagel on Third Ave  Room was small especially the bathroom but still very comfortable  Only drawback was that the local police amp fire stations are on the same block so there was constant siren noise  
P => Right price right size good location What a pleasant surprise to find a quotroomyquot hotel that is clean well lit and well located in New York for the right price  Paid around  for a Thursday night the weekend before y th  Would absolutely stay there again  
P => One Big Complain Nice hotel nice people great location  But twice employees entered my room when I had the quotdo not disturbquot sign hanging on the door  Once when I was out of the room I know because the person accidentally dropped a hotel employee computer form on the floor and the second time when I was in the room getting dressed and maintenance tried to come in to fix a service call from a past guest  For this reason only I would not stay here again  
P => We will stay here again The hotel is about two blocks from the Waldorf  The subway is on the same corner  You are within easy walking distance to Times Square the Theatre Central Park etc  Great location  The service was great the rooms were clean and big enough  For this price you cant go wrong  
P => Old Dirty Rooms The first room we had has a leaking toilet so we were moved to another room which looked the same but much smaller than the first one  We did not bother requesting for another room because it was too hard to move all our big luggages again since the hotel staff just handed us another key and did not offer to send anybody to assist us  It will take more time to call for service so we just did it ourselves  The room was so old and musty and the air conditioning unit had no other setting but fan  The bathroom is my main complain  It was very small we cannot close the door without touching the toilet  The carpeting looked very old  The candies in the room were all dusty and even partially consumed  Its a shame The pillows needed double pillow casing since they looked dirty  Housekeeping at night in th floor was not polite at all  I almost returned home and canceled my vacation because I never had an experience like this from a good hotel chain  I know this hotel is in NY City and I was told not to expect too much  I tried Doubletree many times in the past and I was very satisfied  For a Doubletree Hotel I expect something good from its name  But the room that I had in Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel in NY City is not impressive at all  The hotel rooms need to be reated again to look new and clean and bathroom size must be considered seriously  Some people gave this hotel a good review only based on location and accessibility and I think thats what we paid for  If you care about quality and cleanliness this is not the hotel for you 
P => Great Staff Nice Hotel Stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan over y th weekend after getting a good rate on the Hilton website including breakfast and because of the mid century modern architecture  The staff was very friendly on check in even though we were a couple of hours early they found us an available room  I was also able to get a late check out without any hassle  Unfortunately the bathroom in the first room we were given was in very bad shape so after going back down to the front desk we were moved into a different room  The desk clerk had to speak to athe manager who I saw in the front desk area almost every time I went downstairs  He was very gracious apologized for the bathroom and even followed up with a phone call once we were in the new room The rooms are ent size although Im not a big fan of the sink being exposed and arate from the showertoilet  It was obvious that parts of the hotel had been refurbished and other parts had not as the room and sink area looked new but the shower area didnt The location is great for getting the subway  and a fairly easy walk to Times Square  But if you want to be right in the quotactionquot this probably isnt the best place to stay  The area is very quiet although there is a  hour CVS a couple of blocks down not much else is available at night The lobby is compact and even though its a large hotel I rarely saw anyone having to wait at reception  Every single staff member I encountered was extremely nice and the fresh cookies were an added bonus  The complimentary breakfast buffet was great and the wait staff there was very cordial with no one ever put out that we had coupons for the breakfast  You are charged a minimal gratuity to your room if you book with the complimentary breakfast Would I stay here again If I got a good rate I definitely would  The hotel is clean fairly convenient and the staff is great  
P => This Hotel was ok but used to be wonderful My wife and i stayed at the DoubleTree Metropolitan in late e  for a couple of nights  We chose this hotel priily for two reasons  we stayed at this hotel back in  and had a wonderful experience and  the price was very good Although the price was still good our room was a bit run down  The sheets had stains our shower had bugs on the walls and there were a few cobwebs and dust balls on the walls  We asked for another room and the staff was very accommodating and gave us another  The nd room a little better  But we were only in the room for a short while anyway  The hotel has a nice lobby and happy hour bar  It is about  blocks east and  block snorth from Times Square  Theres plenty of stores located up the street st and Lexington  The quotNew York Lunchenettequot is one of our favorite breakfast places and is around the corner on th and Lexington  Cab ride from hotel to LGA is about  to     and to JFK is  fixed rate  You can also take the subway for a lot less to either airport but will have to take the bus part of the way The staff was very nice and polite  The hotel is close to central park I think their last reation was in  so it was practically a brand new hotel on our first visit  I would definitely stay at this hotel again although im sure my wife wouldnt  I dont think the hotel is bad at all for the price we paid  But just beware that if youre looking for a luxurious hotel with plush accommodations you  not see it at this hotel Hope this helps  
P => mediocre experience at best I would like to begin with the positives which fortunately for us usually involves the people part of the experience   All the staff members we encountered were courteous and helpful  The concierge receives special kudos for not only being helpful and courteous but doing so with humor and aplomb  There alas were several negatives that outweighed the positives of the staff  The air conditioner did not function properly as we needed to have it turned to the full level or the room to be barely tolerableeven at night I t was not really hot yet outside so buyer beware I can not imagine how scorching it  be when it becomes during a heat wave  Perhaps it will be an experience either resembling purgatory or a sample of hell on earth  But alas that b is not why we go on vacation now is it The water never became hot either in the sink or the bath when washing  There was no stopper for the drain in the sink so one had to simply waste all the water down the drain when using the sink  Also the hotel engages in eit to gouge the innocent that would make MADOFF proud There is a tray in the room that appears to have items that are complimentary such as a bottle of water    However one will soon discover that if you touch any item on the tray for  seconds I am not kidding you pay   for each item  Finally if you park in the garage make certain that you have the receipt stamped at the hotel as you will pay the discount rate of    If you forget to have it stamped you will pay the full price  We ended up paying   for  nights which ironically is considered a bargain to some for NYC  We would rather book a quotroomquot in a suite in Central Park rather than pay that price for the value we received  
P => Pleasnat Stay Great Location This hotel was a great value and a great location plus it was a really comfortable clean and pleasant  The rooms were average size  Overall a really nice and pleasant place to stay  It is not over the top service but that is not what is expected at a Doubletree  The staff we encountered were all very accommodating  The woman at check in was very nice and of course we got our cookies  Sometimes I think the people who have trouble with the staff in hotels are just not pleasant people to be around  I rarely have trouble with the staff in a hotel and this Doubletree was no exception  Treat people with respect and you get treated with respect The location at st and Lexington is a great mid town location  For the price in New York City  per night on Hilton website this is a very good hotel  
P => Good value for money I was very anxious about staying here after reading all the comments on tripadvisor  As I was travelling with a bunch of girlfriends from Ireland who had selected this hotel and paid in full up front with Expedia  On first arrival the receptionist was not the most friendliest person in the world but did however upgrade my room to a larger one for no extra cost  During my stay all the staff were very friendly and the concierge s recommendations were excellent  The room or was a little tired but the bed was comfortable and clean  The room had a flat screen TV  I stayed on the rd floor my friends were all on different floors and we all agreed it could be a little noisy both in the corridors and from the street  I think value for money and the location I would stay here again  
P => Great Location and good value The Doubletree Metropolitan is ideally located  We bought a   day unlimited metro card and got about  dollars worth of travel and we felt safe at all times  We pre booked a room on the th to th floor and ended up on the th floor and had no complaints with the room or bathroom and no issues with noise  
P => Small rooms and bathroom was dirty This hotel is not up to Doubeltree standards  It must be one of the most rundown ones in the network  It is average at best stay here for the location only not the rooms The bathtub looked like it was on its nd life and needed to be replaced  
P => Great Location The Doubletree Metropolitan is ideally located for sightseeing  We walked almost everywhere and we felt safe at all times  The cookies that we receieved on arrival were delicious The hotel lobby and bar are both modern and there were lots of staff available to help if it was required  No complaints with the room or bathroom and no issues with noise  For a central hotel in Manhattan it represents value for money  
P => If service and soundproofing are what you are looking for turn away now I stayed in this hotel for six nights over new years with my girlfriend for her birthday  I had a limousine booked from the airport to the hotel with birthday ballons and everything inside  It was a perfect start to what was supposed to be a romantic getaway All that ended when we walked in the door of the hotel  On check in we paid cash as we had gotten an excellent exchange rate  Front desk staff did not welcome us grabbed the money of us and took an extra  of us as a security deposit  When I asked why I couldnt use my credit card for that he would not answer  This meant that we did not have the money for Phantom of the Opera on Broadway  He then threw the cookies down on the desk and broke  The worst thing about this experience was that he ruined the suprise I had for my girlfriend in the room strawberries and chocolate sauceThe room was very big with large but not too comfortable bed on th floor  Location of the hotel was great  Just beside the subway stop  On the first day I rang for extra blankets  These didnt arrive by the next day so on the way out of the hotel to go sightseeing I mentioned it to one of the staff on front desk Jacinta She was not helpful at all and quite rude  I was very taken aback by her attitude  She shouted after me as I walked away  When I came back I complained to a supervisor who was very apologetic and said she would sort everything out  That never happenedThoroughly disatisfied I rang the General Manager who was on holidays great I spent three days trying to reach a manager and then on the last night Miguel rang the room and asked what the trouble was  He was very understanding and apologetic and of all the staff that we dealt with was the only one to actually care about our experience in the hotel  He apologised in person to my girlfriend about the ruined surprise and came to a very generous arrangement with us This hotel is great for getting around the city for shopping and sight seeing  The rooms were good and the cleaner that we had was very nice and polite Front Desk staff let this hotel down very badly and we will not be staying in it again  P S  If you happen to have kids I hope you are lucky enough to not get a room beside a couple that smoke and who like to stay up late in a loud manner  You will be able to hear everything    to the last detail  
P => Good Location  easy acess to subway but nothing special This seems to be a busy place so no time for a smile or a friendly welcome here   As is often the case for Honors members there was confusion at check in about my quotif availablequotroom upgrade  at check in I was told I was upgraded  After seeing my small allocated room I spoke to another girl at the front desk who advised that I was placed in the wrong room it was not an upgrade from what I had booked  given the wrong breakfast voucher etc  The changeover to a larger room was apologetic and graceful but a bungle nevertheless  my overall experience with upgrades at Hilton is query everthing I was on a high floor at the rear facing another building but it was very quiet and comfortable  I had a voucher for a full breakfast in the restaurant and it was standard Doubletree fare  I also saw the Honors floor continental breakfast  very basic disposable plates  designed for a fast on the run experience Location is good  you can get around on the subway and their are lots of non touristy places to eat if you walk to nd Avenue Nice flat screen television updated room or  Free wireless in the lobby 
P => Value for money excellently situated  We recently stayed in this hotel which was well situated for the subway and plenty of attractions within walking distance  After reading some of the reviews I was expecting the worst instead the hotel was pleasantly orated clean in all areas and the staff were helpful  We found the bar area to be comfortable and the staff attentive and cheerful  The only complaint we had was the inconsiderate people who were so noisy clashing there bedroom doors until the early hours of the morning  We had a room on the second floor upgraded from a queen size bed to a king  We were situated along the side road which meant we didnt hear the traffic noise  We experienced a big difference in temperatures during our stay c on arrival peeking at over c by the third day and have got to say the heatingair con worked extremely well  Did not eat in the hotel so cant comment on the food  All in all this was a very comfortable hotel which was what I would expect from a   hotel the beds were very comfortable 
P => Perfect location and big room We stayed in this hotel for  nights and this being my th time to NY it was the best room for money rate I have encountered so far  The location is perfect to see the Rock and have a short trip down to the Times Square and up to the Central Park  The subway lines directly at hand make for fast and easy travel within Manhattan  The check in was fast and friendly and the concierge helpful in all matters  But the place this hotel stood out was the room  We had a kingsize bed and the room was spacious quiet and perfectly clean  Especially the size came a bit as a positive surprise  All in all I can easily recommend this hotel for eople who want to have a nice stay in Manhatten which is not too costly  We did not eat in the hotel just around the corner you have amini ket with lots of offerings and genrally NY is so full of nice places to eat I hardly eat in the hotel  
P => average hotel but good location This hotel is fine if you are just looking for basic accomadations near the subway  As someone who lived in the city the rooms are what would be expected in nyc  small a little street noise and a view of other apartments and roofs  The rooms were clean the bed comfortable a nice flat screen tv and good bath products  I only paid   through priceline so I was happy with this hotel  If you are looking for that special hotel for your vacation you  be disapointed but if you just need a place to sleep while you explore this great city and get a good price it will be fine My only complaint would be with the maids not knocking before they tried to enter to clean very early in the morning  make sure to use the door chain  
P => GOOD TIMES I read the reveiws before going and so i wasnt expecting much from the Doubletree but you dont spend much time in your hotel in NY anyway  I was so please with what i did get  We checked in to be told that wed been up graded and given some cookies which after a  hour flight and min taxi ride was good  The room was big which i didnt think you got in Manhattan and clean with a very comfy king size bed with a quot HD TV the only down side was there were no teacoffee making facility  The staff were helpfull when need which wasnt often i did have a query over the minibar bill i didnt use it but had some iteams billed for but once pointed out to the staff they took them of the bill no questions asked The location is very good especially if your flying from JFK as the metro on rd runs just  blocks up from the hotel also the metro on st which is outside the hotel will get up and down Manhattan  Having said that alot of the attractions are with in walking distance I would stay here again its not the Plaza but if all you want is a nice room comfy bed in a good location the Doubletree is a good chocie for the money 
P => Everything we needed My wife and I booked into this hotel for  nights to celebrate our first Wedding Anniversary last weekend  We were concerned when we read some of the comments but in our opinion they could not be further form the truth This hotel has a fantastic location right at the Metro station from JFK and is orated in a modern and fresh style  We booked a Standard Queen room and were given a Standard King on arrival  The room had absolutely everything needed including an enormous HD TV Bathroom nice and clean with good quality toiletries  The bed was excellent and room of a good standard We chose not to eat in the Hotel as absolutely everything you need is within  minutes walk in any direction You have shopping dining drinking and all the sights within a short stroll One piece of advice is to bring earplugs as it can be quite noisy outside   it is NYC after all and not the fault of the HOtel I would not hesitate in staying here again  
P => Great great location My husband and I have been to NYC a couple of times over the last year and this hotel was definitely in the best location There are tons of shops and places to eat within walking distance of the hotel and Rockefeller Center was so close we could stop by every night to see what was going on  There is also a subway station right next to the hotel to get you where you need to go The rooms were pretty standard clean with nice linens and comfortable bed  We liked the free HBO on the flat screen tv  The elevators in this hotel were great We never had to wait for the elevator and the hotel was pretty full when we were there I recommend Sunday brunch at HK in Hells Kitchen so deliciousSo overall I definitely recommend this hotel 
P => Good Hotel We enjoy our stay at the hotel the staff is very plesant and have a quotcan doquot atitude like they like to say  The location couldnt be better you have the st metro station right at the hotel exit and you can just walk to several places of interest like the Rockfeller center or Grand Central  We just had a problem on the first night they were cleaning the room next to ours on midnight  But we spoked we the reception and never again we hear the same  
P => Great location average hotel Overall this is a perfectly acceptable hotel in a great location right at the heart of midtown Manhattan  With a subway stop literally outside the door it provides an ideal base for exploring the Big Apple Unfortunately the or of the hotel is bland and the rooms basic with perhaps the smallest bathroom Ive ever stayed in Our supposedly quotdeluxequot room on the th floor was really far from deluxe but it was clean and was fine for all the time we spent in it  Staff were friendly and welcoming  Breakfast which was included in our rate was a welcome bonus  If you can get a good rate for this hotel its probably worth taking but there are certainly nicer hotels in the area if youre prepared to spend a bit more  
P => An Average City Hotel Stayed here mid ruary  for a city break in New York  Firstly the location of this hotel is very very good  Easily accessible by subway as  StLexington Ave station which is served by the E Train which runs tofrom JFK Airport is right outside the main entrance  Its also walking distance from The Rockefeller Center and only a little further to Times Square and Broadway The reception area of the hotel is attractive and modern and the reception staff were friendly and efficient in checking us in and out  The signature DoubleTree welcome cookies were an extra treat and very tasty still warm too We were allocated a standard twin room on the sixth floor  The room was an average size for a city hotel and was functional but a little tired in places  Whilst all the surfaces were very clean it was evident that the furniture was quite worn  There was also some evidence of dampness in some patches on the ceiling by peeling paint particularly in the bathroom  A picture above one of the beds in the room also had some very minor graffiti written in biro on it  Another minor issue is that whilst we didnt have a problem with traffic noise our room looked over a quiet side street noise does travel inside the building particularly through the walls from guests in neighbouring rooms or walking past in the corridor Despite these niggles though the beds were very comfortable with clean bed linen and nice soft pillows  A review here reports bed bugs but we never found any during the four nights we stayed there  The bathroom and towels were also clean  The temperature and water pressure in the shower is just right too The large HD TV in the room was a great bonus with a reasonable selection of channels  Also liked the View on Demand feature where you could rent movies using the on screen menus  Only other thing that would have been nice in the room was teacoffee making facilities rather than having to go to the cafe outside the hotel to buy it  One other minor complaint was that house keeping werent very consistant in their timings  They came every day but one day our room wasnt serviced until gone pm in the evening Whilst we didnt have dinner in the hotel restaurant we found that the breakfast buffet was expensive and so only used it on our first morning  However this wasnt a problem as New York is full of small coffee shops and cafes that serve very nice breakfasts so you only have to go for a little walk to find something Lastly the hotel Concierge were extremely helpful in organising some great activities and entertainment during our stay in New York So overall I recommend the DoubleTree Metropolitan for business travellers and the tourist who like to go out and explore most of the time whos just looking for a place to sleep  If you like a bit of luxury this probably isnt for you  Its in a great location and is clean and comfortable  Just needs a lick of paint here and there  
P => Great Location   Good Hotel I stayed here for  nights in early ch   The location is excellent for sightseeing and business  There is a cafeteria next door which is good and adequante  The subway station is almost exactly at the doorstep of the hotel corner of Lexington Av and st Street  Reception staff are efficient and pleasant by NY standards  Internet is free in the lobby and charged at   per day in the room broadband cable there is very fast Rates are quite good at   taxes per night Rooms were of a fair size for Manhattan  Good clean desk and a ent bathroom a large HD LCD screen and plenty of cable channels to choose from I would recommend this hotel without hesitation to the business traveller who is budget conscious and to a leisure traveller in NY for a good time  
P => Older Hotel Great Location I stayed one night here in ch   I had gotten a very good deal  through priceline  Based on that the hotel was absolutely fine  It is older shows its wear but has a great location  The staff were all pleasant  Bag storage is to me a totally reasonable  per bag  The room was small but comfortable and well engineered  Some of the electrical outlets were of an older style and didnt hold onto the plug of my iPhone charger very well  The TV is an HD model and nice  I was on the alley side of the building and thus it was pretty quiet  The AC didnt seem to be on yet and I had to sleep with the window cracked for it to be cool enough I had been concerned about bedbugs because of a recent tripadvisor review  I did a thorough bedbug check upon my arrival to my room on the th floor and there were no bedbugs or signs of bedbugs  
P => Great Location  My partner and I stayed in the Doubletree Metro hotel at the beginning of uary the rooms were spacious and clean the location was great only a couple of blocks to the Rockefeller Center  The only thing that spoilt it for me was one of the reception staff she was quite rude and obnoxious  Apart from that the hotel and location are wonderful and highly recommended  
P => A slightly better then average hotel great location  I arrived earlier then the pm check in and was able to get into a room early  The friendly counter lady moved me from a room on the nd floor that faces the noisy street to one on the th that faces a quiet alley  I went upstairs and ate my delicious warm signature welcome cookie  The room was nice enough  Clean and well situated  I noticed that the chain lock plate on my door was installed backwards ie  ineffective ineffective when installed correctly too  Unfortunately there was this tumbling knocking noise that seemed to be from the room next door but wasnt that began at about am and ended at midnight each day  Laundry chute You will hear every whisperdrunken rant from the hallway  Some guests feel the need to talk loudly at am  Uh  The door also lets in quite a bit of light when closed so plan to use some extra towels if you want a good nights sleep  Even then the rooms are too bright IMO This hotel has been reated but it still shows its age in its doors beds and some carpeted areas  The beds are lumpy but soft and they are the type that you can quotsink intoquot which I like  If you like firm go somewhere else  There are no blankets so turn up your heat on cold nights  Beware the minibar  It actually has a first aid kit for  BYOB bring your own band aids The shower was hot and had great water pressure  Plenty of towels and good quality freebies shampoo soup etc   The toilets have a rocket powered loud flush  The toilet paper is very cheap one ply  The sink is powerful and you will get water all over until you get the hang of it  The closet is large and had enough wooden hangers for two people also a safe that I didnt use  Their is a charge for net access from your room but wifi is free in the lobby  Every hour of everyday youll find folks with their laptops in the lobby clicking away The or is modern but not overly so  Better then average hotel art adorns the walls  The palette of the rooms and hallways are nice on the eyes The tv does not give you listings only channels We MTV etc  To find out what is actually on you have to flip using the worn remote  I had to mash the buttons to get it to work well  Lots of news loud talking head channels I did not eat at the hotel  I did notice that the bar is fairly busy in the evenings you have to walk by it to get to the elevators The location is right at the st street subway exit  A very good and convenient location for midtown travelers  The restaurants around this area are overpriced however bring a good guide book check the local websites and find other eateries elsewhere west s is a good spot  The exception is Ess a bagel which is right around the corner  You must go there and enjoy their large yummy bagels  The doormen are quick for their tips  The hotel will store your luggage for free when you arrive which I didnt have to do but had inquired about before traveling but they charge you  per bag to store and then  per bag to retrieve once you check out  Talk about nickel and diming you  When no one was available to retrieve our bags from the unsecured room we got them ourselves  I noticed a bellhop began a mini sprint to us once he saw us exit with our bags  He stopped short realizing he had missed his chance for   You should tip a min   per bag per handling and I certainly tip but an outright fee is silly  The fee could be due to cheapskate who dont tip  First rule of travelingeating out if you cant afford a tip dont go out This is a good hotel for those who get out of their room and explore getting so much exercise that they can sleep through the noise  That is fairly general for all midtown NYC hotels    if you arent accustomed to urban noise at night  If you are looking for an upscale place this isnt it  If you like to hang out in your room and luxuriate this isnt it  Doubletree Metropolitan is just above average in my opinion and has its pros and cons  I had a nice stay and would consider them again for the right price  
P => Stay here if you like to sleep with bed bugs I am originally from Southern CA but currently live in Texas where most people are genuinely a little nicer  When I checked into my hotel I disregarded the girl at the front desks Tina unfriendly welcome as just the quotNYC attitudequot when she slammed down  bags of warm DoubleTree cookies on the counter  I shrugged it off because I was here on vacation and nothing was going to spoil my optimism to explore this great city Upon entering the room was a bit smaller than expected from the pictures online  Again I overlooked this inconvenience as another NYC characteristic  I noticed automatically that the sink and bathroom countertops were not clean  After several attempts to connect to the internet which is  day for wifi service that is slower than dial up my room was charged every time I signed on regardless of the daily rate  The hotel said it was a quotsystem glitch quotI stayed for a total of  nights  On the nd morning I found one small bug on my pillow  I thought quotHmm be its just a random bug that got lost quot The next morning my friend and I found  more bugs that were significantly larger than the one from the day before  They were roaming on the bed underneath the covers  The manager of the hotel said its a big problem for NYC and it happens everywhere  The Director of Operations blamed it on the European tourists  They shrugged it off like it was not a big deal but Id like to see them roll around with a bunch of bed bugs for a few nights I had higher standards for a DoubleTree hotel  Dont stay here unless you want the bed bugs to bite The only pro was that it was convenient to catch the subway on Lexington  There are plenty of other hotels along Lexington to accommodate this need  
P => Not Great by any means The lobby and hotel exterior are what youd expect from a Hilton the room itself was very poor  The first room we were given was on the first floor and was mouldy damp and smelt musty it also looked like it hadnt been orated for a few ades and I was pretty unhappy  I asked for a switch on the basis of the damp and was switched to a room on the executive floor th by helpful and pleasant staff  This room was exactly the same in layout size and or and far from execituve but this time clean and with a slightly bigger bed  I was just happy I didnt have to put up with dampmould  We ided to live with its average offerings but then got frustrated that you could hear everything from your neighbouring rooms including their wake up calls  I would avoid this hotel at all costs unless the quality of room or noise is not important  On a plus side the staff and location were spot on  
P => Great Location We stayed over the Christmas period with our two teenage children  and  We had  rooms the rooms were tidy and comfortable with nice bathrooms The location was great within walking distance to th Avenue and Broadway The only down side was the inadequate lobby space we were part of a bigger group and the lobby was so small that it got very crowded when waiting to meet up  
P => Good Excellent location right next to subway and Metro Deli  Nice staff adequate room good comfortable bed  Coffee maker in room would have been nice  The big negative was the bathroom   musty moldy smell and cheap thin plastic toilet seat  Evidently some attempt had been made to redo the bathroom areas because there was lovely tile which was in direct contrast to the peeling and chipped paint and a door that had obviously been recylcled  The sink area is arate also new and trendy   but with NO towel rail or hook and nowhere to set makeup toiletries toothbrush etc  Our room was on the rd floor on the corner and while street noise was obvious it didnt bother us  Some  find it too noisy  
P => Good location for shoppingsights Stayed here with my partner th   th   prompt check in and free warm cookies from reception  lifts available up to the floors initially we were upgraded to a King Size room on the nd floor it was on the corner of Lexington Avenue and st Street the room appeared great until we went to bed and realised that the sheets and bedding were from the previous guest  I phoned down to reception and spoke with the manager who promptly sent the head of house keeping up to our room and also arranged for us to be relocated to another room which was on the th floor again the room was spacious and clean see pics  The bed was really big and comfortable in the room there was an iron and ironing board safe free hair dryer and large TV available  In the bathroom there are Neutrogena products shampoo condition soap and moisturiser  Although a refrigerated mini bar and snack bar is available it is at a cost and if you move a product you have between   seconds depending on the settings to replace it otherwise youll be automatically charged There is internet available in the room but it is pricey to combat this if you go to reception and ask for internet access they will give you an access code and you can use the internet in reception and best of all its free ideal as I used it to confirm my flight back home and pick my seats There is a gift shop within the hotel and a restaurant and bar which seemed busy every night we were there  The gym is location on the nd floor A metro is located right next to the hotel  To walk to Times Square took us about   mins depending on how cold it was Rockefeller Centre was about   mins walk th Avenue is about the same for Tiffany s Louis Vuitton Abercrombie etc Overall good hotel and location friendly staff and always helpful  Would I stay here again Yes  
P => Bait and Switch I Wont Be Back While the exterior and lobby suggest a spiffy new image from this hotel its more like a classic bait and switch scam While this hotel previousl offered a full array of services they no longer even offer room service available during the day  Cant even get a pot of coffee sent up to your room And the restaurant is also open every now and then When I called to complain the general manager never returned my call  When I again called to discuss the issue the manager on duty explained to me with great sarchasm that quotlife is full of disappointments quotI wont be back and suggest that there are many many superior hotels in New York within this price range  
P => Good location amenities reasonable price Have stayed here several times before and its gotten better  Rooms are updated if a little smallish but typical of Manhattan with a giant flat screen HDTV comfortable bed clean bathroom  Excellent location in midtown  Good place for breakfast right next door  Staff is pleasant  Free wifi in lobby  in rooms the nickel and diming of which I detest  No coffee maker in rooms but a minibar if you want to pay the prices  Otherwise not a bad choice and you do get a chocolate chip cookie upon check in as is Doubletrees promise  
P => Bed Bugs Abound My wife and I stayed in room  of the DoubleTree Metropolitan     Both of us were bitten several times  We told the hotel and they said they sent their head of Housekeeping to check our claim and they told us they found no bed bugs  They also said they called in an exterminator and they found nothing either There is no other possible way we could have been bitten outside the hotel room  It never really got above freezing outside so we couldnt have picked them up in Central Park  I doubt we picked them up from the subway or from a cab or theater  
P => There are better hotels in New York This must be one off the bad Doubletree Hotels The rooms are very small and stuffy The bathroom is tiny the sink is in the bedroom rather than the bathroom No teaCoffee maker due to the fact quot the guests keep stealing them so they have taken them outquot quote from the front desk  The careline staff are great and very customer focused the front desk staff are ok with the exception of a few who should not be in the service industry lack of interest and rude Breakfast is not great and you will get better in he deli next door for half the price Mostly dried up and greasy left in dishes too long Lots of managers around but no one seems to take charge and hence very bad are getting checked in and out  If you get a good deal you can put up with the faults but they would need to make big changes as there are much much better hotels for the same value  
P => Just a hotel after all  Price wise is the chepest you can get for this class in the downtown core  Staff wise they are friendly enough to upgrade me to a better room after my complain  is clean the location is excellent price is reasonable it got everything with the exception of free wifi Pros  Reasonable Price for the area  excellent location right next to nd st subway station  friendly staffs most of them  room clean and tidyCons  even on th floor where my room was located street traffic can be very loud loud enough to affect sleeping quality  Police Station is right next to it you can hear cops cars go by every hour   I dont know who designed the doors but whenever someone is closing the door it creates a LOUD bang  very annoying   if youre staying at the lower floors rooms are very small  but i wasnt  lobby are often over crowded with people   terrible restaurant they have   lack of parking 
P => Dissapointed   Try another Hotel in NY I just returned from a weekend stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan in NY  I am a Diamond member and stay in hotels over  nights a year  This is an outdated hotel in need of an upgrade  The staff was very rude  I asked for subways maps directions to the airport restaurant recommendations etc on multiple occassions from different people and just got blank stares like quotHow Dare You Ask For Help quot I never once got a response to any of the questions  I called the front desk twice for assistance and both times before I could say anything they would transfer me without even knowing what I wanted  I have stayed at  other Hilton chain hotels in NY  All of them give Diamond members free hot meals and free internet  This place did neither  You got an English Muffin and had to pay day for internet  On the positive side the parking garage was nice  day wasnt bad for the city location is ent if you want to hit th ave shopping very close to the subway  feet from the door and the drinks at the bar were excellent I give this place such a low rating mainly for the poor customer service and no benefits for Diamond members like other Hiltons in the City  If you have a choice go Doubletree Suites Times Square  
P => Great Location Comfortable room On the corner of Lexington and st a subway stop this hotel is in a convenient spot  The staff was very friendly and welcoming  Our queen room on the th floor was at the back of the hotel and very quiet  The room was small but not as small as some weve stayed in New York  A new clean and comfortable bathroom and well appointed room helped to make our  night stay very plesant  Starbucks accross the street and es a bagal around the block   Upon check out the front desk agent without argument removed the  charged to our room due to a faulty in room drink and snack bar I would stay here again 
P => A books cover hides some imperfections We stayed for  night in uary  From the outside and public areas the hotel looks quite gleaming  The lobby area has been redesigned from when I remember it  years ago  Theres a modern feel to it  Staff very friendly  The location is great and there are many places to eat nearby  There is a subway station outside  Parking is at an adjacent lot for  with hotel stamp  The bad part is that you need to leave the car with the valet so you need to move everything out of the car  The standard room was tiny  Adequate for a single traveller but very cramped when theres a small kid  The TV and desks are new but the bed and other furniture seem old  The carpets were quite dirty  Internet costs extra  Wireless was a bit spotty but the ethernet worked well  All in all not bad if you can handle a few imperfections  
P => OK not great Considering how mediocre this place is Im a bit embarassed at having stayed here several times over the years through several incarnations it used to be a Lowes hotel  The room was rather tired with a lousy view of ac units on the roof of an adjacent bldg  Somewhat crumbling mortar in bath adds to the feel  Nice location a few blocks removed from Rockefeller Center and walking distance to some great restaurants eg Rosa Mexicano  Concierge was helpful  Adjacent parking is night with hotel discount ok for the city  Unless I got a great price like  or so Id proably stay in Beekman Towers a few blocks east  
P => Overall good great location but a few glitches I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan on ember  and th with my six year old son  We had stayed there in the past but before it had become a Doubletree  Overall the stay was good  Here are the Pros You cant beat the location  The hotel is just steps from Rockefeller Plaza and St Patricks and is within walking distance to Times Square and Central Park  The room was a good size especially for NYC and the shower pressuer was great The bed was very comfy in room mini bar and gorgeous flat screen HD tv All the staff was very friendly and helpful  Cons   No on site parking  The parking garage theyve arranged with is within a half block but is still a hassle to schlep your luggage  Also when I went to pull in they told me the garage was full until I told them I was with the hotel and only staying one night  Bear in mind I was there just before New Years Eve and the town was packed already  When I did leave however there were several scratches on my rear bumper  Of course I didnt notice until after I got home so check your car before you pull out Also the lobby was very unimpressive and dungeon like  There was no room service until after  pm because theyre doing reations on their restaurants  There was no in room coffee  Also the service in the on site restaurant was very slow  Overall a good deal for NYC because our rate was  compared to most other hotels which were above   Definitely workable 
P => Small and noisy but good location  I could have taken a shotgun to the broken fan that whirred constantly outside our window for our  night stay    That mixed with the half hourly mess of fire engineambulance noise that comes as part of the midtown Manhattan experience meant that my stay here wasnt exactly relaxing That said the actual location is great   its a nice quiet place to get breakfast in the morning with a view of the Chrysler building from the right angles and st and Lexington Metro station literally next door which was hugely convenient as its the right line to get you to the Statue of Liberty    Its on the east of Midtown so its close to Rockefeller Centre NY Public Library and about  blocks North East of Times Square The room itself was a little bit bigger than average but still felt cramped  It had a  inch HDTV which didnt work   we had to call an engineer   and a tiny bathroom Theres a quotBusiness Centrequot downstairs accessible to all guests that has  pcs charging a dollar for  minutes of internet it accepts bills and cards and p per printed page  The bar is dark and foreboding but was always packed out with happy people so I suppose it cant be that bad The cookies were superb here  Very good cookies  Didnt make up for the slightly po faced staff though the bellboy and TV engineer were nice but the desk staff werent Im giving this place  out of  because the central location and subway station  Its a good place because its easy to travel to and from but really   considering the price and if it wasnt so conveniently located   this is a  hotel  Noisy cramped the TV was broken and the staff werent welcoming  
P => Past Its Prime We stayed for three nights starting     in room   The hotel is in a great location but it is definitely past its prime  The lobby and rooms are dingy dirty and worn  The first notable mention would be the dust covering the surfaces through out the room especially the quotfood mini barquot which made it kind of gross  The whole room was old and thread bare with a broken mini fridge cabinet door chipped furniture and tired looking grimy walls   The bathtub faucet leaked the sink drain backed up brown water the hot water disappeared one morning the hall noise was unrelenting along with crashing sounds through the closet and housekeeping showed up VERY late in the day  pm  We had looked at another room   with hopes of finding a better choice but that one too looked similar  The hotel needs major upgrades to keep its Doubletree reputation  We were very disappointed in this hotel  The only redeeming quality was the Doubletree comfy king bed  
P => Great choice Having to travel to New York on short notice to accompany my dhter for a job interview I searched for an affordable hotel in the Midtown area  The Doubletree was a perfect deal and I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel upon arrival  The hotel although not luxurious is very comfortable and clean the staff is very accommodating  The room was large and well appointed  My dhter loved her bed  To me the location of the hotel makes it my hotel of choice for future visits  Let me not forget to mention the warm delicious chocolate chip cookies 
P => Pleasant Clean Hotel We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for two nights ember     We checked in quickly and were pleased with our room king size  PROS The bed is VERY comfy and the room is good size for NYC standards  The bathroom is rather small although the sink is outside the bathroom itself which is a nice feature  The flat screen TV is HUGE and is great There is a great floor to ceiling mirror in the room as well as a great big desk that is nice for storage  Elevators are extrememly fast and the conceirge is quite helpful  Subway is right outside the hotel and so are taxis CONS Be aware that there is a police station across the street so sirens are quite loud throughout the day not bad at night  Sleeping in or taking a quick afternoon cat nap is really not possible if you are a light sleeper  Also bathrooms do not have fan blowers which bothers some people  Walls are very thin and you can hear people passing in the hallways turning air conditioning or heat on high definitely helps with the sirens and hallway noises RECOMMENDATIONS Check out Pax which is a great breakfast spot  It is a block away  on st and rd  and has everything from bagels to yogurtgranola parfait to cereal to hot breakfasts  Upstairs second floor seating is available for people watching or just enjoying the newspaper while overlooking the bustling NYC streets  Also the Metro Cafe which is right next door to the hotel is great It has a salad bar a pasta bar and everything from quick bites to eat like sandwiches and side dishes to munchies nuts fruit salads cookies chips to freshly made sandwiches and paninis  The prices arent too bad for NYC that is and wont blow your budget  The Cornerstone restaurant is a great lunch spot down a few blocks from the hotel on nd Ave  I think  It is a fun little pub style place with a top notch lunch menu  Prices are great too for NYC  Enjoy 
P => Never Again Reserved a double standard room        Room   was very small in major need of repairs due to mold in bathroom grout in shower broken tiles in shower baseboard falling off TV not useable for  days major games missed  heat in room not working  Front lobby hostess lied about TV problems  When asked at AM day  we were told it was still being worked on  When asked again at  PM she informed me that she had just come on duty and could not leave the lobby to check on problem  When informed that I had spoken to her  hrs earlier she denied that she was there  TV was fixed by PM day  with no offer of adjustment on bill This is our th stay at the Metropolitan and will be our lastThe housekeeping staff are the greatest  very polite and accomodating      For what they charge for rates   look at other places    This place is rated  star and deserves   at best   What happened 
P => The Perfect Hotel for Everyone This hotel is simply fantastic I have stayed here twice now and I am glad to say I have booked a third visit for next year The staff are wonderful  We were greeted with a smile and made to feel very welcome in New York  We were even given warm fresh cookies Our room was immaculate everything looked brand new The room was spotless and very big The bathroom was very modern and the shower divine The flat screen TV had all the channels you would want not that you will be watching much TV in New York  The conceierge was very friendly and polite and had a huge knowledge of what to do and see The location of the hotel is amazing A short walk to Time Square Chysler Building and Empire State  There is also a gorgeous deli just down the street which is perfect for a quick snack Also before you go make sure you visit the famous ilyn Monroe subway grate which is located just over the road 
P => Couldnt find a single fault with the hotel I cant say enough good things about this hotel I took my Mum away for Thanksgiving weekend to celebrate her retirement  I had written to the hotel in advance to tell them about this special event  We couldnt believe what was in the room on arrival   a retirement card signed individually by about  members of staff and a platter of cookies  The cookies were replaced everyday by the lovely lady who cleaned our rooms The rooms were so clean and comfortable  The location is fantastic for shopping  Boomingdales is a few blocks north and Saks is a few blocks west  We walked to Times Square on a chilly but crisp evening and it was lovely to soak up the atmosphere of the city We were so well looked after in this hotel  We had a call from the Careline and also from the Accomodation Manager Mr Holmes to check that we were OK  My Mum felt really special and we had a holiday to remember  Ill be telling all my friends to stay here  
P => Awesome stay for this family This was our fifth trip to NYCand this hotel rates in the top  The best for locationa few blocks to Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall A  to  minute walk to times square We took this trip with our two teenage boysand this hotel was perfect for our getawayLoved walking the cityeven on this very cold weekend in ember This hotel was spacious for NYC Our family of four enjoyed our stay We arrived on Friday at  a m  and the front desk staff quickly checked us in Our room was a double with a view of the front street of the hotel Nice warm cookiesThey do have nuts and do have  warnings stated in bold writing on the bagBut the staff does not inform you and as a parent who does not have children that suffer from peanut allergies we were informed only by a previous reviewer The staff were all very friendlywe were always greeted with a warm Hello and housekeeping and the door greeter was outstandingThe room itselfThe negatives were   rugs were a little wornas were the bathroom doornot a wide bathroombut shower was roomyThin wallselevators very slow during  a m and  a m Conciergevery busy in the morningsuse late afternoon or later The positives     Quick elevators besides the times abovesecurity on Saturday nights so be ready with your room key  Friendly and helpful stafflocationcleanliness of hotelAwesome water pressurealmost too much for cold chapped handsunique high quality bath fixturessoapsshampooseven sunscreenTVand the bedding is So comfySome helpful hints  Subway available right out the front door  Enjoyed the corner vendors  hot dogs and Roasted Chesnuts were greatGreat burger spot  blocks away called GOODBURGER Amazing burgersfries and shakes Also one block away tucked away next to Taco bell hard to see the green signand across the street from McDonalds is ESS A Bagel the best bagels I have eaten in NYCmy boys loved the huge muffins too   hour pharmacy across the street and a Staples also Top of the rock and walking Fifth and Madison Avenue was outstandingWe had a great experience in this hotel and in New York Citywish we could have stayed more than two nights  
P => Enjoyed staying at the Doubletree Stayed at the Doubletree   for Christmas parade shopping etc with our  year old granddhter  Nice hotel helpful staff  On East side of Manhattan and good walk to sites but definitely okay  Would stay here again 
P => Great Hotel and location A great hotel in an ideal location  The staff were very friendly and the warm cookie is a nice touch when you check in The room was a good size and clean with everything you need except tea making facilities however the metrocity cafe next door to the hotel seems to be open all hours serving great food and drinks so was not an issue to nip down for teacoffee  The bathroom had a good bathshower and good size soft towels with a arate room for the sink and big vanity mirror  The hotel is next to st subway so was ideal for nipping updown town but the good location meant we walked everywhere most days  There are a few good places around the block turning left for breakfast or metrocity cafe next door with one serving an all you can eat buffet just ask the guys at the doors for details  Catching the Airport Express bus from NewarkLiberty was cheap and quick going from and to the airport and we found NY to be very clean and safe and it is worth getting a city pass for the sites as this can save a lot of queing at certain attractions Statue of Liberty for one  Wrap up warm if you are going in ember as the weather was very cold but dryWould definitely recommend the hotel and would stay there again because of the location and value for money  
P => wicked location lovely staff and fabulous cookies I went with two of my friends to this hotel and we stayed for five nights th    ember   We were really worried after some of the reviews that we had read but i dont think that we could have asked for anything better  This hotel is well kept clean and has a lovely atmosphere  The staff are friendly and helpful i would especially recommend using the concierge service they are really helpful and can arrange anything for you from broadway tickets to helicopter rides  We had a bedroom with two double beds the beds were really comfortable and the room was very clean  The rooms were reasonably sized and modern The location of his hotel was great aswell was within walking distance to everything and if you fancy getting the subway there is one right by the hotel  there is also a great cafe next door to the hotel which does everything from Pancakes to subs and salads would also recommend the oreo cheesecake  I would also recommend Grayline Limos they are a really great company to use for your airport transfers and are far cheeper then most others in the area they even upgraded us for our journey home to a stretch hummer limo it was a awesome surprise and rounded of our trip nicely Overall we had a wicked time in New York and would recommend this hotel to people of all ages  
P => Expensive for standard   great location Great location in midtown NYC but you pay a premium for it  Overseas visitors will feel the price on exchange rate and will no doubt think of what an amazing suite they could get for the same money in Sydney Singapore or Paris Rooms are small as expected dated and not overly clean  Despite being on a non smoking floor there were constant smokers in neighbouring rooms which became overwhelming   although staff did attempt to deal with this quickly Hotel lobby is tiny and too small for the amount of people using it to wait for transport and check in  Bell hops leave no room for discretion in tipping as it paid up front on delivery and retrieval of bags  Had much better experiences at Double Tree Hotels in Chicago and other places  
P => Not too shabby After a very disappointing stay at the Radisson just  blocks down the street I ided to give Doubletree a try and am glad I did  From the moment you enter the lobby the staff is very professional pleasant and helpful  Rooms are very small mine was on the th floor but the room was functional  The heating worked fine and the street noise level was very low  The bed and pillows were comfortable and the room was clean  The TV is small but has good picture however they do not have Comedy Central channel and I missed my obligatory Daily Show and Steven Colbert Report  The Internet is    for  hours which is pretty standard for NY  If you are a Hilton loyalist you get coupons for free breakfast at the th floor lounge  The Bfast is continental style and pretty basic but not bad being free  There is a Subway station right outside the hotel entrance which makes it very convenient if you like to use the train  I think this is a nice hotel and very good value for NY  
P => Nice Hotel Great Location This hotel was very nice for the money  The rooms are reasonable size and they were VERY quiet  The staff was very friendly and helpful  The location was awesome and parking was reasonable at   a day  I also liked the idea that the window opened about  inches  The BEDS were AWESOME I would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P => Great location great price helpful staff We stayed four nights in early ober and paid about  a night  There is not another hotel in that central location for anywhere near that price for the size and comfort of the room  and yes while the bathroom area is small its small in nearly every other similar hotel   thats New YorkThe conceirge staff was friendly and helpful   gave great tips for the best times to see certain sites even can sell you Empire State tickets at the same price as you pay at the site   and you dont have to wait in the long lines once you get there   zip to the front provided great directions and helpful ideas  We used them to confirm our shuttle to the airport even though we booked on line  We did not eat in the hotel other better choices very close to the hotel  As a bonus the first day we were there Sunday there was a street fair stretching along Lexington Avenue as well as a the annual Polish Parade a block over  We would stay here again   especially for the price  
P => Fantastic Location Fantastic for the Budget Minded Traveler The GOOD This hotel is perfectly situated in a beautiful part of Manhattan  Everything you need is basically at your doorstep  The E train will take you downtown for   a trip  The quotquot Train will take you uptown to the Gugenheim Museum and other uptown destinations  Restaurants coffee shops and other locations are right at your fingertips We truly enjoyed our stay at the Double Tree  The staff is utterly courteous and the rooms have nice beds flat screen t v s and all the amenities you need for a nice stay The BAD This hotel is showing a few signs of age if you require a luxurious room  Luxury is not a requirement for my wife and I  We require clean rooms and a comfortable bed  This room had both  Our room featured a little peeling wall paper and a bathroom door that didnt shut properly  That about sums up all of the negatives I can identify The UGLY  No quotugliesquot at this destination  As noted above we had a really nice stay Finally I have to mention that we booked this room directly with the property using our AAA discount for    just over  for the first four nights and  for the last night  I consider that price to be an utter steal for the location  I highly recommend the Double Tree if you are traveling with budget in mind and want a nice place to stay  
P => Just okay We had booked this hotel because it was the best price in this location  At over  a night we expected more for our money  The best thing about the hotel was the location  You could walk almost anywhere and the subway was just out the door  It looks like the hotel and its rooms had upgrades but many things were not updated  The beds were very comfortable there were nice Neutrogena toiletries but the walls and carpet was dirty and old  The bathroom was very small and the bathtub was very uncomfortable for taking baths  
P => Good Location Stayed  nights in ober  Great location for the Metro and main attractions The room was a good size with a large comfortable bed nicely orated and clean  The bathroom again very clean with adequate towels and shower accessories  A room safe a good touch The lobby always appeared busy with coach loads of visitors appeared to be arriving daily  Didnt use the restaurantbut had breakfast next door for less than half the price  A bit surprised when they charged  to store the cases for a few hours after checkout Overall a good hotel and would stay again  Watch out for the mini bar  very pricey and top tray  Items picked up will be charged to your room if not replaced within  seconds  
P => If you want this neighborhood try the W or the riott  blocks south on Lex pretty shabby   peeling wallpaper everywhere   bathroom so small its hard to turn around in and you have to get out of the way of the door to close it    water stains around window and soiled carpet   no coffee in room or lobby   billed for calls that we shouldnt have been billed for   lobby small unattractive and annoying to maneuver throughlocation might be good depending its on the  subway and two short blocks from the E  internet was  day 
P => Worst NY Hotel in years Literally one of the worst hotel experiences in years  The lobby is lovely but as soon as one leaves the lobby one is shocked The hallways are dirty with paint chipping and wallpaper peeling  The room was dirty  There is no way to control the air conditioning in each room   and when we called they said an engineer would come right up and no one ever did We had to call twice for towels  And this for around  Never going there again  
P => OK Property Good Value This property has a great location OK physical property generally above average staff and usually ent rates which make it a good value especially if you are a Hilton Honors loyalist  The location affords plenty of restaurant options including several  hour kets and is close to Radio City Music Hall th Avenue Shopping and Grand Central Terminal  A subway entrance for the st St     trains Lexington Ave E and V trains station is immediately outside the hotel entrance which is great  Cabs are also readily available  The property itself was reated several years ago and the rooms are nice but do show a little wear and tear  The rooms are small even by NYC standards so if you need a large space or are sharing a room with someone to whom you are not related this is not the place for you  Otherwise it is fine as long as the rate is ent  There is a great fitness room with plenty of modern equipment  The business center has several computers but charges for internet access  The restaurant provides a good if expensive breakfast  I didnt use it for other meals  The bars is fun and well populated  The hotel tends to be well patronized but has a significant number of tourists as opposed to business persons and feels crowded as the lobby isnt large if this bothers you dont stay here All in all a good value as long as you are aware of the room size  
P => HUGE room by NYC Standards Lets start off with the rooms   they were HUGE   by NYC standards anyway  The beds were comfortable and the location was superb right next door to the subway and  blocks away from the shopping haven of th and Madison  The lobby was very spacious and modern so perhaps the only gripe of mine is that the furniture in the room is showing its age  
P => Fine location and stay Stayed from       Booked directly on their website and got a rate of  inclusive of tax for a standard king which was the best deal I could find for this area  I was wary about this property because of the negative reviews however we had a positive experience  The location was great  Walking distance to shopping Grand Central Station the Theater District  The  subway line is on your doorstep with the E line to JFK one block away  Our room was very comfortable with plenty of room  The mattress was great as was the pillows  The bathroom was newly remodeled with a new vanity and there was plenty of water pressure and hot water  We were on the th floor facing st and were not bothered by the fire trucks  Elevators were speedy  Two small complaints They did charge us for storing our  pieces of luggage   Never had to pay for that service but oh well  And after reading about charges for the snacks and mini bar on this site we were very careful about not touching or moving any items but found charges on our bill  They were promptly taken off without question  We did not use their workout room  This is not a  star luxury hotel but for the price and especially the location it is a very good value  Would definitely return  
P => Not a place to get any sleep Pros comfy bed modern or couldnt be closer to the  train Cons The housekeepers are relentless in trying to clean the room  the early morning knock on the door if you forget the DND sign  If you do use the DND sign they call the room anyway assuming that you couldnt possibly still be in the room sleeping  They say that too many people leave for the day wo removing the door sign and then are mad that the room isnt made up rd day there they begin changing the carpet in the rooms surrounding me  No advance notice  Slamming doors banging around construction guys yelling to each other from down the hall and their radios playing  Ridiculous  Doubletree said they update rooms daily but dont know which one ahead of time  The bellman was relentless in trying to get me into one of their quotcarsquot instead of the cab i had planned on taking to LGA  I didnt need help w my bags but he grabbed them anyway and then got mad that i didnt give him a tipI too got charged for merely bumping into the items in the mini bar  Very sensitive laser system  No fridge no microwave no coffee maker I will never stay here again  Im going back to the Muse on th  
P => Great location We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel from  to   We paid  per night and booked through the hotels website back in y  I had researched other hotels in the area with  beds and a private bath and this was the cheapest I could find unfortunately  Rooms We stayed in rm   Although I did not like the style of the or in the room it was clean and comfortable  We did not have a nice view but we were only in the room for sleeping  The bathroom was small as expected in any NYC hotel  It was clean and had good water pressure  Location The location is excellent  You are a  min  walk to St  Patricks Cathedral Rockefeller Center and Fifth Ave  shopping  The st Lexington subway stop is right outside of your door  You can access the  Train  The E and V trains are accessible from Lexington and rd Street Internet Access There is free WiFi in the lobby  I was able to surf the net on my cell phone in the hotel room  I believe there is a charge if you actually hook up your laptop to the rooms internet Overall I would definitely stay here again given the location of the hotel  
P => Over rated Id read some good reviews about this hotel but they are totally over rated  The hotel is mediocre  Beds are old and not really comfortable  Overall condition of the hotel rooms floors etc  is not good  Colour scheme is erratic  Good for the location and proximity to the subway but a very high price for what you get  There must be better choices in the area  You also have to pay for leaving the luggage in the storage and guess what you have to pay again when you return in the afternoon to pick it up I wouldnt recommend it to anyone  
P => Great Choice The location cant be beat the subway is only  feet away from the front door  This is essential because you can get where you want fast via the subway  Dont use the hotel for their car service because while we were standing there to set one up two different people were complaining that their car was an hour late and they had to get to the airport  Needless to say we did not use the car service  The staff was nice and the hotel room was clean and had plenty of room  We waited until two days before our trip and the rates went way down  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Great Location Helpful Staff Stayed here for one night in late ust  Location cannot be beat  There is an underground stop ten feet from the front door that provides easy access to Yankee Stadium the WTC site and the Village  Hotel is in a very cool neighborhood to walk around and not too bad of a walk from Central Park and the Met Room was spacious although the bathroom was very small  There are some other similarly priced hotels in the area that I would try first before returning  However wouldnt mind staying here again at all Staff also was very helpful with any questions 
P => Great location great staff This was my first trip to NY and a birthday surprise for my god dhters th birthday I had spent a long time on the internet reviewing comments about a number of NY hotels and ended up booking at the Doubletree  I sent a little note to the manager saying how much we were looking forward to our stay and requesting a quiet room away from the fire station Our room was a very spacious  x double and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in  Yes the view out of the window was a brick wall but the room was quiet and dark at night  The bathroom wasnt that big but the shower was great and who goes to NY to waste too much time in a bathroom A birthday card cake and complimentary breakfast vouchers were also waiting for us which was a wonderful surprise  All the staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel is situated within walking distance of all the main tourist spots We did have a problem with some extra items on the bill from the mini bar the fridge is very sensitive but there was no problem getting the bill ammended Would definately stay their again and I cannot understand some of the other comments that have been made  be some people are just incredibly fussyIf you want to start your trip with a limo from the airport Grayline Limos were great despite our plane being  hours late they were there with the largest white limo I have ever seenAs for helicopters Manhattan Helicpoters might be a bit more expensive but they dont pack you in like sardines and you go at the time you bookedClaire 
P => Id Stay Again We went to New York City in ember just before Christmas for a weekend to do some shopping  We had a free night through out bank at the hotel  We had some reservations trouble while checking in however the desk agent worked hard and was able to help us and compd breakfast the next morning which we were very appreciative of  The hotel is in a great location near the subway and not too far from many attractions  As stated in previous reviews the rooms are pretty small but they are suffiicent  The flatscreen TV was nice and I couldnt hear anything in the hallways the stereotypical NYC sirens however I could hear  The breakfast a person value was a joke  I get free breakfasts at Holiday Inn Express that are similar  But it was free so I dont complain  Parking at the ramp next door wasnt too expensive and overall we had a great say in Manhattan and would stay again  
P => Only Average Only an average experience  Small outdated rooms that have been fixed up several times over the years  I would stay here only if I got a great deal and was planning on spending very little time in the hotel  
P => Great Location rooms not so good     Yes the location is great  But           the halls and carpet look dirty the rooms need to be updated  I only spent  nights here and luckily we spent little time in the room  The warm cookies were nice   dont even touch the mini bar or snacks   You will be charged for touching Probably would not stay again   the price was cheaper then most and now I know why     Needs some attention  
P => Less than a DoubleTree Great location and right accross the street from Police and Fire stations  Asked to be moved from our room and was told they could do that  Never did even after asking twice for this Hilton Honors Diamond member  One day the maids failed to clean our room even when I told her when wed be leaving  Room service closes at pm which seems unusual for a  city Offered breakfast thru their executive lounge each morning and was very very basic and surprisingly sparse food choices  
P => great location and staff My wife and I took a kid free getaway to New York and as soon as we arrived at this hotel I was glad that I selected it  We were greated by smiles and everyone was helpful  We arrived by train around noon and even though check in is pm we got right up to a nice clean room  We were on the th floor facing Lexington and there was no problem with noise  The concierge was helpful both for getting around town and with dinner suggestions  The hotel is  blocks from the E train and  block from the  train so it was super easy getting around anywhere we wanted to go  Its about a  minute train to Yankee stadium and about a   min walk down st St to any theater  Nice area and we felt totally safe even walking around late at night  The warm cookies were a nice plus after a long day of walking around  Would stay again 
P => Solid choice in Manhattan Stayed here  night for a quick one night business trip  My colleague were both Hiltonhonors diamond stayed across the street at the Waldorf and paid over  more than me  I would call this hotel a solid  star  It shows its age a little but the for the things I consider critical it was great such as very fast elevators excellent fitness room new equipment early morning access watertowels available easy ck inout  Good lobby bar also of course Whiskey Blue at the quotWquot is right next door also  I will definitely look to this property again for the next trip  
P => Good stay Stayed over the fourth of y weekend  We had a room with two double beds which by NYC standards was a pretty good size  Plenty of room to move around etc  The bathroom was also fairly ently sized and had counter space which again for NYC is great  This is not a luxury hotel but definitely clean comfortable and has a good location  The  subway stops right next to the hotel which makes it convenient to get anywhere on the upper or lower east side of Manhattan  Rockefeller center is within a few walking blocks and also has a convenient subway  Walking to Times SquareTheater District takes about   minutes  Parking at the garage next to the hotel is  if you get your ticket validated by the hotel no in and out privileges though  The price was really good for NYC particularly if youre trying to find a room with two beds in it  
P => Good Stay Very Good Location My king room was small but perfect for one person but I could imagine it would be a little cramped for two  Very good bathroom  Lobby was cozy and the bar seemed happening on thursday  The subway station in front was just perfect for exploring the city  A lot of little restaurants all around  Also Starbucks Cafe Metro and the W New York one block away the Waldorf a couple of blocks away and  minute walking to Grand Central Station  
P => A great base to explore a great city Loved this hotel  Staff and services were excellent  Everything in the hotel is clean comfortable and relaxing and so it provides a great base to explore a great city  Although not on the same block as any of the main attractions of New York most are within walking distance and can easily be found and those that arent can be reached by subway  
P => Excellent Value Fantastic Location We stayed at the Metropolitan DoubleTree for one night in y to attend a NY Yankee game  In short we were extremely pleased with our stay  Got a ridiculously low rate for NY night for a king smoking via the hotel website and using my AAA membership  BTW   the next best rate for the same night was  more  That alone made up the cost of AAA for the whole year  For for under  in midtown I dont expect much but this was a nice place  The lobby bar and restaurant are all clean and well staffed  Our room was on the small side for other cities but quite large by Manhattan standards  It had a comfortable King bed writing desk quot tv chaise lounge windows that open  and full sized combo bathshower  Neutrogena products in the bath  No trouble with hall noise As others have stated you do have to be careful with the minibar stuff  Housekeeping had placed a notice on the counter that if you removed anything from the minibar for  seconds or more it would be charged to your room  I would love to say that our minibar bill was a mistake since it was quite large but truthfully we couldnt find a liquor store open after pm so we pretty much cleaned the room out of alcohol  What ever happened to the quotcity that never sleepsquot In the end we ided to stay in the room and enjoy beverages because we could smoke there plus it was still cheaper than a NYC bar    and we could wear our pajamas while doing so  The location couldnt be better  There is a metro stop right outside the hotel and it was an easy subway ride to Yankee Stadium or anywhere else throughout Manhattan  This is certainly the cheapest and most efficient way to travel in the city  Midtown is very safe so you can feel comfortable walking alone almost anytime except the very early morning hours  We parked in the garage around the corner from the main entrance for  hours which is a good price for this part of town  The hotel has an agreement with the parking facility and you just have to get your valet ticket stamped at the desk to get the special rate  Our only tiny gripe was that the prices stated on the minibar menu differed from the ones on our bill at checkout  I brought this to the managers attention and he rectified it right then with no problem  We were very pleased and would stay there again  
P => Great Hotel   Great Location This was a very nice place to stay in the center of Manhattan  The hotel staff was very helpful  The rooms were very large compared to most hotels in New York  The subway was right at the hotel which made travel around the city helpful  There is a Metro Cafe right next door which was very nice  I would recommend eating at a place called MiMis which is only  blocks from this hotel  It has great Italian food for a great price  
P => Left something to be desired     Here it is short and sweet Lobby is nice   rooms are mediocre at best Pros ok price good location nice beds ent looking rooms and bathroomsCons Hallways carpet needs replaced at least on the th floor Walls are thin I could hear hall noise the entire time Toilet seat didnt stay up AC wasnt cold Shower head wouldnt was limp Sink and shower had very slow drains Check in kiosk didnt work   for anyone  Oh yeah   and we never got a free cookie at check in  Overall I would probably not stay here again  
P => Great value hotel Great value hotel  Good price night over  nights during y  weekend  Rooms are relatively small not a surprise in NYC  Staff is friendly  Location is good  They have an arrangement with a neighboring monthly parking garage night where you can keep your vehicle for the duration of the stay  You cannot however take your the car until the end of your trip ie  there is not unlimited in out access in the garage They serve delicious cookies when you check in Before checkout they had incorrectly billed us for  worth of mini bar usage which they quickly reversed without questions There is a Metro Grill restaurant right next door which stays open from am to pm  Good food For this rate I would good back to this hotel anytime  
P => A Good Choice Overall we were very pleased with this hotel and would happily stay here again The PositivesWonderful locationExtremely nice staff except for one girl who works in the barLarge quiet room with a very comfortable bed The NegativesAir conditioning in the room was a bit weak Storing luggage for early check in should be provided as a courtesy rather than charging a fee There is no in room coffee maker  
P => Disappointing and overpriced I recently spent  nights at the Doubletree Metropolitan having high expectations from a  star highly recommended and very pricey hotel in Midtown  Overall I was quite disappointed  A warning to all potential customers   the hotel rooms are NOTHING like what you see on the Doubletree website I stayed in an ordinary room which still cost  per night not including breakfast   the room was clean but the or was very shabby   paint peeling off the walls a completely bare stark room bad lighting and absolutely no space  Admittedly it was my first experience of Manhattan hotels but I refuse to believe that this is the best that  dollars can buy  The staff were civil but not in any way warm welcoming or helpful  Staying here youre very aware of staying in a large hotel chain   the general feeling is totally impersonal As for facilities the restaurant is ok   but again very expensive and the food ok but nowhere near  star standard My conclusion   this is a hotel that thinks it can charge  star prices for a  star service just because its in Midtown Manhattan  Shop around before you stay here  
P => Doubletree Metropolitan in NYC is awful  Having a pretty rough experience at the Doubletree in NYC  It was the only open hotel around my office so I ided to give it a shot and I wish I ided on a place farther away  I showed up and the front desk was fine but upon entering my room found that the fire alarm cover was sitting on the bed the bathtub contained some form of matter and there was CANDLE WAX covering the insides of my room drinking glasses I called down to the front desk requesting a room change but they said they were overbooked as it was so I just asked for some new glasses  The gentleman showed up  or  minutes later with a blanket in hand and I had to explain to him I just wanted some new drinking glasses and not a blanket  The gentleman brings back clean glasses and I head to bed around  PM after receiving a call from the front desk regarding my glasses due to a AM meeting on Park Ave The last straw happened when at  I wake up to a shrill ring and its my bedside phone  I pick it up not knowing what to expect and its someone from the quotCareLinequot asking if I received my remote control  Im never rude to hotel staff but was about to lose it at this point  I say its the wrong room I never ordered a remote control and the woman says quotOk   Well do you need anything elsequot I just need a clean place to sleep for under  a night and this will never again be the place The only redeeming quality here is the bedding and the location  
P => Great location   not so great rooms This hotel is in a great location close to shopping NY sites and the subway  The staff was great  The rooms however are in need of updating and the bathroom is so small you have to close the door before you sit down  There is no coffee in the room and they have the strangest mini bar I have ever seen  Items sit in a container on top of the dresser  If you lift an item off its designated area for more than  seconds they charge you for the item  Well the room was so small that we had a small suitcase sitting on the dresser and I guess when we opened it it must have moved some of the items  So we had all of these charges on our bill  Now they took them off but it still took time The free HIlton Honors breakfast was meager and while they had Starbucks coffe in the regular dining room they did not in the HH room The room temperature is controlled by a window unit that can be set to low medium or high   thats it  I would hate to be here when it gets really hot The lobby is drab and also needs some restoration  I did not go into the bar area but it looked lively enough I was meeting my girlfriend there and I had made the reservation  When I realized she would arrive hours before I would I telephoned the hotel direclty to have her name added to the room reservation  When she arrived that had no record of that  Unlike the previous review we had no problem with housekeeping  But this hotel was really not great and I wouldnt stay there again  
P => Perfect Location  Great Stay We stayed at the Metropolitan for two nights during our first visit to NYC  The location was perfect    we walked to so many great places Rockefeller Center Grand Central where there was an amazing ket with the best food every Central Park and so many more locations  The room was generously sized we had a double room and the bathroom was great  No complaints here  We booked online at their website and got a great deal    about  a night  No noise  Perfect service  Great location  Never visited the onsite bar but it was a hot spot on Friday and Saturday night  Staff helped graciously with everything    didnt ever wait for more than  seconds to get a cab  Was absolutely wonderful for the money and for twice the price  We will definitely stay here again    and cht ourselves saying many times during our NYC visit quotour hotel couldnt be better located quot Travelled with our  year old dhter who enjoyed being able to run downstairs and one door down for chocolates from the chocolate shop and for things from the delistore only  steps from the hotels entrance  Close to at least  starbucks  Only caveat which we read many warnings about was that we were charged for   for something from the mini bar which we didnt touch we had been warned about even looking at anything on the mini bar or opening the mini fridge so we didnt touch a thing and yet were still charged  But since it was a small amount we didnt actually ask for a credit    just wasnt worth any hassle since it was a small amount  Thats it though  Otherwise it was perfect for us for our weekend visit  
P => Most Excellent I had a fantastic  day stay here in e  My reservation was made online through hotels com  days before my arrival and I got an excellent rate around  CAD per night Check in was a breeze and was upgraded to a room with a King bed  The room were huge by NYC standards  Every single room is newly remodeled reations are completely finished  Flat screen TVs great bathrooms and clean modern or  Didnt order any room service so cannot comment on that  All in all a great stay and will definitely be staying here again next time in NYC  
P => Lovely stay at the DoubleTree Stayed at the DoubleTree for three nights and had a lovely time  The rooms are average size but quite roomy by NYC standards  The entire staff was pleasant and very helpful  Upon check in you are treated to large cookies that are actually very tasty and shown to your room quickly and kindly  The maids are quick and efficient about their work and very polite  Everything was very clean and many towels were provided  The toiletries are all Neutrogena brand which was a pleasant surprise In room amenities include fridge hair dryer iron and board etc  All that you would expect and the price was very reasonable for NYC  I think it was  a night with AAA   My husband was annoyed that there were no coffee machines in the rooms which as it turns out is a Union issue   as a native New Yorker I understand and sympathize with them on this   that they are struggling with at the moment but they are happy to oblige you with complimentary coffee or tea from either the bar or restaurant at any time which makes up for it The location is great right in the heart of midtown and mere blocks to practically everything Very enjoyable stay 
P => great location We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for  nights and were very satisfied  The bed was comfortable and the shower was powerful  Make note not to touch the mini bar if you dont intend to purchase anything  There is a sensor on it and if you just knick something you will be charged  We had a   charge on our bill for a candy bar that we didnt eat and the front desk was happy to remove the charge  The subway is right outside your door as well as a great metro cafe with healthy food fresh juice fruit salads etc  and fast service  Would definitely recommend breakfast or lunch there  You can walk  minutes either way to Central Park and Broadway  Be sure if you arrive with a vehicle to remove everything you  need out of it  Once they valet park it you do not have quick access to it  It will be stacked on lifts  
P => Very Pleasant Experience We had the pleasure of staying at the Doubletree Metropolitan on Lexington Avenue this past weekend as an anniversary getaway  The room was clean and pleasant the bedding was comfortable and the many pillows on the bed were a definite plus  While we did not have a street view we had a quiet room with no traffic noise  The room was equipped with a pay bar and honor snacks  I would have liked a coffee maker but there was a lovely metro cafe next door  The hotel staff was friendly and courteous  I would stay here again  
P => Fantastic caring hotel What a great hotel The cookies on arrival we had  each and the free bottle of water certainly helped after our flight  The room was a good size bathroom a bit small but who lives in there anyway  Concierge were very helpful and gave great suggestions of places to visit  The hotel is in a great location close to the subway system and in walking distance of many of the shops and places of interest  Didnt eat there so cant say what that was like  Got billed for minibar use which we didnt do but there was no problem correcting this All staff were friendly and eager to help We went to see Legally Blonde   fantastic  If you like the film youll love the musical  Booked a bus tour which was great value with NY Sightseeing  For  we had an uptown and downtown hop onhop off tours a Brooklyn and night tour which both lasted about   which you stayed on the bus and a free  minute cruise to see the Statue of Liberty which we didnt have time for  We did catch the Staten Island Ferry which was free and goes close enough to get great photos  It only took  minutes too As far as shopping is concerned everything is so cheap compared to the UK  Found more clothes to buy in Macys but did have some lovely  For Mankind jeans in Bloomingdales  Bought a bracelet in Tiffanys which was too big but was able to get links taken out for free and could pick it up  hours later I love New York and cant wait to return  Hoping to stay in the Doubletree Met again too  
P => Good choice for Midtown ent size room for the price  Location was good and room was clean  I had a meeting at the Waldorf located across the street  Room rates were half what the Waldorf was charging  I had a couple of minor problems  The TV came on in the middle of the night several times  I solved the problem by unplugging it  Also the room was a bit warm and I couldnt get the AC to work  I opened the window which wasnt too bad because I had an interior room  The staff was very friendly and was able to recommend several restaurants nearby  
P => Doubletree Cookies We have just got back from a  day stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan and would recommend it  Great location but close enough to walk to the majority of the attractions and directly opposite the Grayline tour bus very good value at  dollars per person for a  day all loops tour plus a night tour along with a Statue of Liberty ferry trip  The staff are mostly friendly and especially helpful and knowledgeable was Kimberli the concierge  The guy that checked us in advised on of a very sensitive minibar snacks system and if we needed a fridge to store our own drinks just ask and they would supply us one  Beds in both the rooms we booked for our family we very comfortable clean bathrooms and toiletries  Rooms were well cleaned and serviced daily  No tea or coffee facilities in the room which seems to be the norm for New York  The only downside to this hotel was the Fire Station amp Police station at the end of the block which due to the one way system all emergency vehicle traffic passes your room especially if you have a front or side facing room you will hear a variety of sirens through the night  Book your limo if you want one through the hotel and at all costs avoid Lincoln Limos of New York www lincolnlimousine com unless you are particularly fond of rallying in city traffic in a battered filthy LIMO with only one working seatbelt and a driver who had very successful charisma bypass operation and paying  dollars for the experience  Not exactly the surprise I had hoped for my family when telling them as we walked through arrivals that one of the stly dressed Chauffeurs with name boards will be for us  Ours arrived after several phone calls with a driver who matched the shabby exterior of the car perfectly  Please do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs 
P => Excellent We absolutley loved it here  The staff were so nice and helpful  The rooms were a great size especially for New York  Very modern and up to date  The bed was the most comfortable bed I ever slept in  Will definitley stay here again  Cant Wait 
P => Excellent stay We recently stayed four nights at the Doubletree Metropolitan and had a fantastic stay  We booked a standard double room which was a comfortable size not huge this is NYC after all with enough space to easily spread out a couple of suitcases and still walk around  The bathroom was lovely great shower nice toiletries and the bed was extremely comfy  From a quick skim of the comments here it looks like this hotel has undergone reation recently and we certainly didnt experience any of the issues with cleanliness or faded or that earlier reviewers had  Our room was on the third floor   perhaps it is best to ask for a lower floor room to ensure you get one that is reated Although we didnt see any signs of reation so its possibly completed by now Location is excellent right next door to subway stop and walking distance to Rockefeller Centre th Avenue Central Park etc  On other reviewers recommendations we tried the Metro Cafe next door for breakfast and ended up eating there everyday good for a quick bite before heading off to see the city  What else Staff arent always a barrel of lhs but that isnt really an issue if the rest of your stay goes well  Only disappointment was that we missed out on the fabled check in cookie but made up for it at Elenis Bakery at Chelsea ket  We hadnt heard of the ket before we arrived but did a tour of it with a Foods of New York walking tour and can fully recommended for any foodie visitor to the Big Apple 
P => Great location great hotel great cookies When we were looking for a hotel in NYC we based it on three things   location we wanted Midtown ratings on Trip Advisor and ratings from Expedia users  The Doubletree scored high on all three   and when we arrived tired after our long flight from Heathrow we werent disappointed  The location is fantastic   a few blocks from the Chrysler building and close to Central Park  Theres also a Subway station nearby  The service was excellent warm friendly and helpful  The room itself was great   spacious warm and welcoming with a great big bed and powerful shower  Best of all were the complimentary Doubletree cookies   absolutely delicious Overall this is a great hotel which I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone visiting New York   out of  P S  If youre tired after a hard days sightseeing pay a visit to the hotel restaurant on the lower ground floor   The Met Grill  Fantastic burgers superb Argentinian Merlot and excellent service   at a good price Just dont be put off by the slightly faded s or 
P => Not user friendly This hotel in well placed in Lexington Avenue within walking distance of most of the attractions in Manhattan The room was reasonable although far from completely comfortable  The facilities were sparse with no shelf in the bathroom for any make up or a toothbrush no mirror on the dressing table and the bed was a bit lumpy albeit with clean sheets The reception staff were cold and impersonal   during the check in process the girl behind the desk could hardly be bothered and didnt actually look up once We never ever open mini bars in any of the hotels we stay in but I still received a bill on the day of checkout for imaginary drinks we had supposedly consumed   this charge was only grudgingly removed at my insistence and the cashier made her disbelief in my protest quite obvious  We stayed for three nights and on two nights we were woken up at am by the hotel telephonist trying to contact a person with a different name   when I told her shed got the wrong room the phone was put down both times with no apology for waking us in the middle of the night The previous hotel we stayed in was the riott in Times Square and compared to this place I would go back there like a shot   this one is to be avoided in my view  
P => Graet Metropolitan Lexinton Fantastic Good location  Great Hotel Ask for a king bigger room  Loved it Breakfast is great worth every penny  Ask for very hot water for your tea  Loved it loved it loved it  
P => Good Value Just returned from two night stay at this hotel  As others reviewers posted the rooms are a bit on the small side but doable even for a family of four  The bathrooms are small but not as small as I feared  The water pressure in the shower was very good  The location is handy I walked with my two children to Rockefeller Center American Girl store and even Times Square  blocks  The Metro Cafe down by the lobby is good for quick meals  Theres an Ess a bagel one block away and a Starbucks on the corner as well The hotel rooms could have been a little cleaner  The first room we got faced an adjacent building only about  feet away  No view at all  That was on the third floor  Requested a change got a room on the th floor overlooking st St  Not really a view but something to look at rather than a wall  This room had a bit of an odor so I cracked the window and that took care of it  The beds were comfortable but small  Double sized not queens  So not a lot of room for two Beware of the cookies if you or your kids have nut allegries  They have walnuts in them  The front desk should tell you this when they hand them out  After being on the road for  hours my kids eagerly took a bite only to have me tell them to spit it out because of the walnuts Finally after checking out of the hotel we asked them to hold our bags as we werent leaving until later that evening  be this is typical in NY but we were charged  for this convenience  Also no valet parking available here  Overall for the price a little over  per night a very good deal  
P => OK for NYC Ive stayed in the Doubletree a few times and am Diamond Preferred at Hilton so am treated well  That said this hotel must be under reation as rooms on lower levels seem nice while higher floors smell like an old hotel definitely have not been reated recently The executive lounge is only open for breakfast not all day and is of a lower quality than most  The rooms are cheap at times for NYC and wireless internet is fairly consistent but I recommend getting a room on a lower floor away from the elevators as you can hear the elevators moving up and down all night if you are near them Hotel does not provide coffee in the rooms which is not convenient and even worse if you cant go to the th floor executive lounge for a cup  
P => Very pleased overall This hotel was just what I was looking for in NY  Good midtown location within walking distance of th Ave with a subway stop literally on the corner that made getting up and down the city very easy  The staff were very friendly and helpful  Everything seemed freshly orated  Our twin room was nicer than I expected to be honest   the beds were comfortable and a good distance apart there was a flat screen TV a minibar a hairdryer internet access a safe and still room for a desk small chest of drawers and closet  This being NY I was prepared for a small hotel room but it was actually bigger than I expected  The bathroom is a bit cramped but adequate with nice water pressure  And the room was pretty quiet though no where in Manhattan is safe from the sound of sirens I thought it was good value for the price  Midtown isnt for everyone   it is a bit of a restaurant desert compared to other areas   but if thats the location youre looking for Id recommend this  
P => Comfy beds great location We were in Ney York for  days and this was a perfect hotel for our stay  The subway is right outside the door there are great restauraunts and bars within a  block radius  The rooms were clean and big  The beds were very comfortable and we got a very good night sleep  The bathroom was good and in general the space in the room was larger compared to other NY hotels in that price range  The carpets in the common areas look a little worn otherwise it has a Double Tree feel Staff were very helpful and informative on suggestions  I would definetly stay here again  We did not eat at the hotel but the bar downstairs is great for a quick drink or a night cap  
P => Nice but Nondescript Midtown Hotel We stayed at the Doubletree last weekend  The location is close to a subway stop with connections on East and West sides but otherwise in the middle of an office district in Manhattan which means walking several blocks to most restaurants and nighlife  The staff was friendly the room was large for Mahattan standards but bland with a very small bathroom  I would say it is fine for business travel especially but I wouldnt look to stay again for a weekend getaway  Parking is  at the garage around the corner  
P => Nice safe option for Midtown A group of friends were coming to NYC for a Yankees game and we wanted to stay in Midtown for good proximity to the game and to nightlife    in the other direction  This place is well located about half a mile walk from Time Square  Getting to the game and Greenwich Village via subway were both pretty easy The hotel has little local flavor though the hotel bar isnt bad but clean and has nice appointments TV shower bed and the price is not crazy high  
P => Small but Comfortable in New York I recently stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan in New York City for  nights on business  I really havent picked a favorite hotel in New York and because of the wide range of rates I havent been able to establish a favorite rather a list that I prefer and book based on who has the best rate when I am in town  I have to say that this hotel is definitely going on that list  While I have never found my quotperfectquot hotel in New York the Doubletree Metropolitan definitely beats out most I have stayed in here including such  star favorites such as the Waldorf Astoria  The hotel has apparently undergone a reation because everything is very clean and new  I enjoyed the theme the hotel was going with  On check in the staff were very friendly and helpful and continued throughout my entire stay  The staff at this hotel is some of the best I have experienced at any hotel in New York  The room while small is amazingly functional  For those of you who have never been in New York hotel rooms in the city are generally smaller then most cities   sq ft on average  Good hotels make good use of the space and this hotel is one of them  I had a king bed small sofa desk and stool in my room and felt completely comfortable  The only time you notice the size is when you stare at the walls which for frequent travelers happens from time to time  The rooms furnishings all appear new and in very good shape  The bathroom is a nice size for New York with great pressure and hot water  The room had a plasma TV which you could swivel at the desk or in bed  Speaking of the bed it was very nice one of my favorites this year  The climate control in the room worked very well for those of you who like a cold room to sleep in you will like this one  You can also crack the window for fresh air which I always appreciate when I start to feel hotel claustrophobic The fitness center has plenty of equipment both cardio and free weights and all are in good shape Overall I would definitely stay here again  I was comfortable in the room and the staff were wonderful  I still havent found my favorite New York hotel yet but this one makes the list of return visits  
P => Good Location We arrived at the Hotel and checked in at  pm the receptionist said they had no Executive King Rooms ready at this time so we said that we would leave our bags and check in latershe then said she had one available on the th floor The Expedia website states these Executive King Rooms are on the  th floor We went to the room and it was a small queen room Back in reception I complained about this and was told this was an executive king so I showed the rececptionist the picture on her counter the room I had just viewed and it was a queen room We were advised to leave our bags in the room and not touch anything and come back at pm to guarantee a larger room on the th or  floor  At pm I saw a different receptionist I explained this problem to her and she immediately called for Tony pressumeably her manager who tried to tell me that was what I paid for  Once again after the rd time of explaining he offered me  rooms to view on the th and th floor  We took the room  on the th floor this room had a king bed and was much larger than the original room This room was greatcleantidy and lots of toileteries Tony later phoned to see if the room was ok and my wife spoke to him and said it was great Dont let them fob you of with a smaller room than you have paid for The picture of the Executive King is larger than the real thing The location is greatsubway station on the corner of st  Central Park min walk  times square mins walk If you have time go shopping to Woodbury Commons its approx  hr from the Port Authority Bus Terminal great prices on original designer gear  
P => Doubly disappointed Stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan on Lexington for  nights from il  and was extremely disappointed  Hotel room was shabby wardrobe tiny and clearly built in in the s   smelled so old we just could not bring ourselves to hang our clothes in it  Bathroom tiny and again be was state of the art in the early s when the hotel opened but is now dated and missing any sign of luxury  No bath sheets or bathshower gels just tiny bath tiny towels and basic toiletries  During our  night stay our room was not tidied once   only the beds were made  or drab and dated  Staff were pleasant enough and location is excellent but no way is this hotel worth the money and for value and comfort it fell way behind any other New York hotel I have stayed in   not a dive but certainly nothing special  
P => Really nothing that positive about the stay Stayed here for  nights and really had nothing positive to write about the hotel perhaps the complimentary cookies at check in  Was visiting NYC for work and having lived in the city for a while was looking for a clean room that would give me a quiet night of sleep  On the first day at am on a Saturday I was shocked to hear loud drilling sawing and construction taking place in the adjoining room  Sawdust also seeped through the connecting door into my room which started smelling like a wood shop  Called the front desk who politely apologized and said that there was nothing they could do as it was mission critical work   which I refuse to believe as this was evidently planned for a while given the scale of work  My request to have them wait an hour before I left the room was also denied though was offered a new room  Spoke to the manager as well who was apologetic and polite but also concluded that there was nothing that could be done  I was offered a new room but had to wait till the afternoon when one become available   inconveniencing some meetings I had in the afternoon  So clearly day  started on the wrong foot  A security guard also had the nerve to tell me quotwe take tips here by the wayquot  Unreal  The rest of the trip was average   room was clean bathrooms shower curtain was old and didnt smell good walls were thin so neighboring TVs could be heard    basically am sure there are a lot other hotels in the area and the city for the same price and I struggle to see why I should recommend this place  
P => There are better hotels just around the corner at a better price As mentioned in other reviews the hotel staff are all very friendly and professional  The room was pretty shabby though  The paint in the bathroom was peeling off the cieling and everything just looks dingy  And this is really small and really picky but they dont offer room service until  a m  and I need to have coffee as soon as I wake up which was much earlier Ive been to NY a few times on business and I know not to expect what you would get in other cities as far as space and value for the money  But I think this place is a little overpriced as far as quality  The location is great though  
P => All around good bargain I was pleasently surprised with this place  We stayed for four nights and had a very good stay  We were placed on a high floor away from the elevator and without much noise from either neighboring guests or the street  I requested all of these things when we checked in and they delivered  The room was a bit small but had all the necessary furniture including desk and chair mini bar and ample storage for clothing and luggage  Everything was clean and well maintained  The bed was very comfortable and soft  Sheets were clean and soft and the bed had plenty of blankets and pillows which was nice as I like lots of pillows  Cookies at check in were a nice surprise and all of the staff were accommodating I would stay here again I feel it is a good value to stay in NYC has a premier location in midtown is clean and spacious enough it is NYC after all and has comfortable beds  
P => ent Internet Price and a walk away from Grand Central Fiance and I stayed here for  nights over a weekend and thought it was one of the best prices out of all the midtown hotels   a night clean room nice flat screen TV amp a busy lobby bar We loved the warm chocolate chip cookies on arrival We didnt spend much time in the hotel room as there is so much to do in NYC so it was perfect for that reason and at that price  
P => Great location and value We stayed at thie hotel with another couple and all of us thought it was great for the price and the location couldnt have been better for shopping and seeing most of the sites  The warm cookie Id heard about at check in is true  and deliciousIt seems like certain parts of the hotel have been modernised such as the bedrooms and restaurantreception area  Our room was spacious and had a massive really comfortable bed with white sheets and was very clean  The hallway was a bit shabby but that didnt matter A few negatives you get charged for the mini bar even if you pick something up for more than  seconds You also get charged to store your suitcases if you have a later flight  Only  but Ive never come across that before  Tips for NYC in general Great restaurants   Balthazar McCormick amp Schmicks Nero and Empire Diner in Chelsea is great for breakfast Also the Boathouse restaurant in Central Park is definitely worth a visit  
P => Great location nice hotel Weve just come home after staying in the Doubletree for  nights and id say it was what i expected  Id read some of the reviews and was a little nervous upon arrival being honest im quite fussy   but not in a snobbish way  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a nice welcoming smile from a porter good start who directed us to the check in desk  The lady who dealt with us had a face that looked like it was made of stone and was quite rude  The warm cookie was placed on the counter without saying a word not even quotENJOY YOUR STAYquot  But then why should i expect that when she didnt even smile or say hello Silly as this  sound she has actually put me off from staying there again I absolutely hate bad manners That was my main gripe about the hotel really the rooms were modern and more importantly   clean The mini bar prices were silly as they are in most hotels and the hotel bar was pricey but the or and surroundings were nice  Nice location not too close and not too far from the main attractions  I personally wouldnt have liked to have stayed right in the middle of time square its too hectic for me and im still young Its around the corner from the Rockerfeller Centre and SAKS and theres a metro station almost next door which is very handy  Its my second time in NYC and while i had no major problems with the hotel i would probably try another next time but in the same location  
P => Great Service Even better location A girlfriend and I took a trip to NYC this past uary and had a fabulous time  Staying at the Doubletree Metro Hotel was perfect  This classy hotel was in an impecable location literally only steps from the Metro Station  It seemed like we could want anywhere from this hotel  The service was great  The bar tenders were fun and friendly although the prices in the bar were astoundingly expensive  There were many restaurants in the surrounding area and always a cab available when we needed on  There was no problem with sound and no need to complain  If you have the opportunity I would highly reccomend staying at this hotel  
P => Was not impressed I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan on       I booked the hotel based on reviews which I will never do again  First the highlights of the hotel The location and the warm cookie upon arrival  The following are a list of things that made me come to the conclusion that I will never stay at this hotel again    The king bedroom was very small   floor  The toilet seat was small and plastic  The bathroom was so small when you sat on the toilet one knee touched the door and the other was on the bath tub   The shower was not arate from the tub and when you took a shower the water in the tub raised to the top of the tub  For   for two nights the hotel should have had a stand up shower   The restaurant inside the hotel prices were ridiculous A bowel of cold cereal with a banana was   Three buttermilk pancakes wno sides costed    The room contain a cold wet bar and a small snack bar  Check this out the products all had sensors on them and if you picked the product up for more then  seconds to actually determine if you wanted to purchase it or not the hotel charges it to your room    Upon arrival there was a card on the bed from the hotel it stated quotWe only clean the bed linen every three days and when you check out if you would like your linen cleaned before then to let us know quot For   I would like my bed linen washed everyday without making a request   Motels have HBO the Doubletree only had basic cable and wanted you to pay for movies For less money the hotel would have been fine however I expected more for my money  I would not recommend this hotel for the price  I saw another review on this site from a person who stayed during the same dates and he only paid  per night  Thats a good price for the hotel thats all it is worth  
P => Nice and good value I stayed on Fri   at the doubletree on lexingtonst in a room with one king bed  Good location by the subway  It was v  clean and comfortable  Clean is always key  and it was  Neutrogena products were available in the bathroom incl  showercap facial moisturizer with SPF body lotion shampoo conditioner and shower gel  I was in a room on the th floor and it was fine  Check in was fast and they give you a warm cookie when you get there  Overall I liked it and thought it was a terrific value  Somehow I got a great rate of   nite  A few minor things I observedThe pillows were too stiff and I recommend if you can to bring your own pillow  The carpet in the hallway seemed a little worn ever so slight and you could hear a few doors open and close at night  Note The nd floor is under reation where they have the gym   but its not too bad  The gym had no  or  or  pound weights which was a bummer  but they had plenty of heavier weights for people who like heavy free weights  They had a lot of treadmills and ellipticals etc  
P => Great location good value I usually try to stay at Hilton properties since Im a Gold member and get the quotfreebiesquot like complementary breakfast use of gym etc This Doubletree was the best priced of all the Hilton group of hotels in NYC and the location right off the subway made it a great location especially since the subway is the one that takes you to the Air Train and JFK which at   for a ride its one of the best values in NY The hotel basically lived up to its other reviews  Staff was attentive and cordial  Room was small which is typical of NYC  Everything was clean and the towels were especially plush  Yes it was noisy outside but we are in New York which as an ex New Yorker I can attest that virtually anywhere in town will be noisy  And yes you couldnt adjust the heat but I can recall that no matter where I lived in NY you couldnt do that either  And if it was too warm I simply opened the window when I got back to my room aired the room out closed the window and was comfortable for the rest of the night Id definitely come back again  
P => Great Customer Service I have stayed at the Doubletree on Lexington Avenue a number of times and have always had a good experience  This time however the experience was excellent  The customer service was outstanding the staff could not have been more helpful  They answered questions provided us with more toiletries and upgraded our room on check in The room was extremely quiet we were on the th floor and very clean  I like the fact that rather than bedspreads they have comforters covered with a sheet that can be cleaned after each visit  The bath products were excellend and included face cream and face wash I like the location because it is within walking distance of Times Square but is away from the crowds  The hotel is right across from the Waldorf Astoria which has a great bar  There are wonderful neighborhood restaurants nearby on nd and rd Avenues One of the best things about the Doubletree hotel is that you get free warm chocolate chip cookies every day  
P => Fantastic Hotel This hotel is a fantastic find in New York  Located within walking distance of all the big attractions in Manhattan shopping amp restaurants it makes a perfect hub whilst staying in the city  There are two subway stations across the street and Grand Central is within a ten minute walk away and from there its easy to get all over  The staff are so friendly and will do anything that they can to help make your stay as comfortable and easy as possible and provided valuable information about getting around and where to go  The rooms are a fair size and clean We will certainly be returning here when we go back 
P => great value and location Just count us as another set of very satisfied customers  Rooms very simple but clean and comfy and they serve their purpose well i e  eight hour breaks between meals shows shopping walking etc   Warm welcome nice bar perfect spot to reach just about anything in Manhattan via walkcabsubway  Value for dollar simply cant be beat and we know having stayed at around  different hotels in Manhattan on various deals over the past six years only one we liked more   Sofitel  Will certainly go back and advocate the Doubletree for anyone that would rather spend their money on fooddrinkscabsmuseums then on a hotel room  Only recommended addition would be coffeemaker in the room but the cart on th had the perfect bagelcoffee deal anyways  Only quotissuequot was the noise factor   rooms are small and close you can hear doors opening and closing all the time   but in the big picture it wasnt a big deal  Thanks to all the other reviewers for leading us here we appreciate it 
P => Fabulous Deal for Manhattan Every time Ive stayed here Ive had a great experience and the last visit was even better  They upgraded me to a higher floor and the room was so quietThe room was a little small for two double beds but youre not in the room much so thats fine  The location is perfect walking distance to the Theatre District and next to a subway stop All of the employees there were very friendly and always helpful  
P => great midtown location great hotel We stayed  nights   and  for a weekend in NYC  VERY EFFICIENT check in  We arrived at noon and a room was ready  The rooms are small but clean and comfortable  And really how much time do you want to spend in your room when you have NYC outside to explore We booked on the hotel website with an AAA rate for less than  per night  Parking is only  a night good rate for Midtown and the website driving directions get you right to the garage  The hotel has a cool retro s or and it works   the lobby and bar are great looking spaces  A subway stop right on the corner good take out sandwiches also on the corner and Belgian chocolates Neuhaus between the corner and hotel entrance  NYC is a great walking city and the Doubletree is centrally located  For an interesting walking tour of the East Village try     com  Anecdotal historical facts about NYC punkrock moments and entertaining host 
P => Nearly Perfect We were very pleased with our stay at the Doubletree  We arrived there after a long International flight and were very tired  The front desk checked us in quickly and efficiently  For some unknown reason we were upgraded to a mini suite  Nice surprise  The warm cookies at check in were a plus  Our room was comfortable and clean  When we checked out we mentioned the good cookies and we were given two more quotfor the roadquot  Excellent service from the front desk  The location of the hotel is excellent  There is a subway station practically outside the front door  I only have one complaint  We were charge per bag to store our luggage for two hours the next day  I have never been charged to store luggage in any hotel Ive ever stayed in  Usually a tip is all that is expected  Here they charge per bag and also expect a tip  I would have scored this hotel quotexcellentquot if it werent for their baggage storage policy  
P => Great Value Very Nice Rooms The building itself is an interesting piece of architecture  Since the hotel was reated some of the furniture was chosen to reflect the s atmosphere The rooms are clean and nicely orated  This is an above average doubletree I felt the reception did lack some cosiness it felt like a train station passageway at times  Heads up for the warm cookies offered upon arrival  
P => Great location good value This hotel was great value for the location   it was very central and within walking distance of many attractions  Our room was clean with good or and comfy beds although some small details were a little shabby and the bathroom could do with some updating  The reception area and bar looked great with a brilliant contemporary design  Overall a good stay and excellent value 
P => Not Bad My friend and I stayed here for a quick weekend trip and didnt expect much what with the incredibly low rate we got through AAA  But we were both really surprised by the hotels appearance we expected a dump and it was anything but and staff incredibly friendly and very helpful  Of course getting delicious cookies whenever we asked for them    and it was often    made the stay even more enjoyable  Not to mention the really comfortable beds and the incredible location  The only downsides were the food which wasnt great but truly okay and the bathrooms pretty small and not so updated  But if you actually want to feel like youre actually getting something for your money in NYC Than Id recommend this hotel  
P => Laptop Stolen From Bellhop Cart Crazy Minibar Otherwise Nice I drove to the Doubletree Hotel in New York City for work  I unloaded my bags onto the bellhop cart and then left the items with the bellhop as I parked my car in the parking lot affiliated with the hotel  There are several quotticket trapsquot on the streets surrounding the hotel in NYC they station the police at certain corners and make that corner quotno right turnquot for no particular reason except to hand out  tickets  So I had to take a round about route back to the parking lot which is only a half block away from the hotel but I had to go five blocks out of my way to avoid all the traps  By the time I got back to the lobby I saw the bellhop had left my stuff in an insecure location in the lobby and my laptop was stolen off the cart The security guard was very nice and reviewed the security tapes with me but suspiciously the cart was left in the one spot in the lobby where the security cameras cannot see anything  He did offer to file an insurance claim for replacement of the laptop but its my work on the laptop that no one can replace I also had a bad experience with the minibar at this hotel  Anytime you even touch the top of the minbar it records another charge  In a room this small its ent size by NYC standards but still not that big its hard not to touch one of the larger objects in the room  Otherwise this hotel was actually quite nice  The beds were fluffy and the warm cookie they greet you with is great  The price was also quite reasonable for the comfort and quothip quotientquot of the hotel  I think if I hadnt had my laptop stolen from the lobby I would stay at this hotel again  
P => Great location I stayed in the Doubletree for  weeks on business  The rooms were clean the staff were friendly and gave me cookies and everything worked The bar downstairs was greatThe food in the on site restaurant wasnt as great as some of the restaurants in NYC but it was definitely above average for a hotel restaurant The location was fab with the subway near by and Times Square a good  minute walk away  
P => Dont Beleive The Bad Reviews My Fiance and I and My Parents stayed at this hotel over the New Year   After reading mixed reviews I was a little anxious about staying here but the feeling disapeared as soon as we stepped into the hotel  After a long flight and a very long trip from the airport to the hotel we were exausted and relieved that the check   in was quick and easy and the staff were more than happy to help with the luggage and not forgetting the yummy cookies we had on arrival  After seeing our room we were very pleased with the size from what I hear hotel rooms can be small in New York the bed was enormous and very comfy As my birthday was on New Years Eve the waiter even got  rounds of drinks on the house Yes the hotel is next door to the Fire Department but with air con in the room you didnt need the window open therefore never heared them  During the stay we were waited for on hand and foot by the staff  Checking out was also fast and they even gave us more yummy cookies as I kept on about them throughout the whole trip  So dont beleive the bad reviews the hotel is really nice and situated nicely in the city  I would recommend it to anyone would definetly stay here again 
P => Great Stay Will go back again Room was clean quiet and comfortable  Exactly what I needed after shopping and walking around NYC The staff was very helpful and I loved the cookies at night  Subway entrance is conveniently located nearby  Rooms are on the small side OK for just the  of us  The mini bar has sensors in it and will charge you for an item if not returned to its slot within  seconds I found that out when I checked out and saw  charge on my bill  I had taken out their items and put my own in to keep them cool  The front desk removed the charge but they should put a sign in the room or inform you at check in what the deal is  I liked that they stored our luggage after we checked out so we could have a few more hours in the city  We returned picked up our luggage and took the subway to the train station  
P => Just Had A Good Stay Here We got this hotel for a ridiculously cheap price  a queensize room for three nights for  USD for the three nights  a bargain Still after reading some reviews here we were abit wary of what to expect when we arrived  We were pleasantly surprised  hotel was in a super location in a very nice area of Manhattan and so close to everything Lovely staff let us check in at AM  couldnt believe they had a room ready for us at that time  we were very impressed Room was very small but very clean  Good selection of channels on the television and the safe was really handy to have in the room  The hotel restaurant was very expensive so we didnt eat there  the cafe next door does a very resonably priced breakfast which was deliciousOverall we felt we really got value for money staying here however the room was very small and I think if we had paid any more for our stay we would have been disappointed  Also a quick note  the hotel website says hotel has had a very expensive reation however our room was obviously a old room that had received a lick of paint and some new furniture the bathroom tiles were broken in places and the paint chipped off the door and doorframes  Plus the halls leading to the rooms were grubby with large patches of wallpaper missing in places  i think whoever did the reation didnt do a very high quality job of it and as a regular Hilton hotels visitor there was no comparision between this and other Hiltons I have stayed at  
P => Only if the price is right Hotels in NYC are never cheap and are often way over priced  Although the Doubletree Metropolitan is a ent hotel with an excellent location I would not recommend spending more than  a night  The hotels positive attributes did not influence me to think it was more than your standard hotel  The room was clean and the staff was accomodating helpful and friendly  A major plus is the loaction on Lexington Ave and the proximity to major attractions and a subway stop  Unfortunately the TV in my room didnt work but I didnt bother to address this issue since I was only staying for one night  Aside from the TV I had no problems with my accomodations and enjoyed my stay  
P => Not worth even the discounted Christmas Eve rate There were so many mixed reviews on this hotel   either people loved or hated it  I ided to cross my fingers and went ahead and booked a room for Christmas Eve as they were running extremely low rates for that night  Needless to say by the following day I felt sorry for any traveler who paid a penny more than me  The Front Desk Representative who checked me in was not the least bit friendly  In fact she seemed bothered by my inquiry to upgrade my room for a fee I didnt mind paying but she had an attitude over having to go through the trouble of looking it up on her system  When that didnt work out I asked to switch my room from a King to two doubles and that set off more sighs from the Rep  I dont even think she finished looking it up in the system she just told me that she was going to give me the room I booked King  When I asked for a roll away bed she told me they charge  for it  By that time I had it with her negative attitude and snapped back at her  She then left the front desk and when she returned she told me that her Manager was going to waive the  charge but that I should know in the future there would definitely be a charge like I would consider going back there after the way she represented the Doubletree  I checked in at  PM and assumed that they would be bringing the roll away bed at some point  My family and I hit the town and came back at  PM  Still no bed so I placed a phone call to the Front Desk who told me they dont handle roll away beds I needed to call Housekeeping  I called the Housekeeping Extension and Housekeeping told me I would have to call the Customer Care desk  The Customer Care desk stated they would send Housekeeping right up with it  In the meantime I ventured over to the Concierge s desk to see if they could help make a dinner reservation for me  The Rep  was very short with me and said that all places in the area were booked  I would have to chance a walk in  Not much help there just more of the Doubletree unfriendly attitude An hour later I went back to my room and still no bed  Called a nd time to the Customer Care desk and same Rep  answered the phone  She apologized and stated she would contact Housekeeping again and have the bed sent right away  I knew we were planning on being out late and wanted to have the bed set up so my son could go right to sleep  We left for dinner assuming the bed would be delivered as promised after all it had been  hours since we were first told it would be delivered right away  We came back from dinner at  PM and par for the course the bed still had not arrived  Yet there was a message on our phone from the same Customer Care Rep  stating she hoped by the time we received the message our bed would have arrived  I called back down to her but her shift had ended and I had to start all over with a new Customer Care Rep  who didnt know I was waiting for anything  She too promised to contact Housekeeping and get the bed to me right away  That quotright awayquot ended up taking another  minutes  Besides all of the Customer Service issues we experienced the room itself had an odor to it  I lhed when I looked at the bathtub area and noticed exactly what was mentioned in another Tripadvisor review the black mold was simply painted over in many spots throughout the stall and the ceiling  We opted not to even shower at the hotel which is rare for hygiene conscious people like us and wait until we got back home that morning  Whats sad is that on our way to the Doubletree we walked past our favorite chain hotel riott and my husband asked me why I didnt book there  I told him the rate at the Doubletree was too good to not try out  Unfortunately I learned the hard way that quotyou get what you paid for quot Despite the dismal hotel experience NYC was fabulous and if you go there is a fantastic Italian Restaurant called quotSan tinquot on th Street that we ate at  They were reasonably priced especially for NYC the food was delicious and the staff were all so hospitable Not a single one seemed to mind that heshe had to work on Christmas Eve 
P => Great Location   Good size room for NYC If you ever stayed in a hotel in NYC you know that size matters  Most hotel rooms are based on the closest principle If it fits than whats your problem  The room we got was specious modern and spotless  Nice flat screen TV and simple but functional bathroom with over sized shower head Cons No view from window other than the windows of some other hotel or dormitory Price is always to high in NYCpros Very sound proof  It wasnt until I opened the window that I heard what I was NOT hearing GreatLocation 
P => No complaints here I found out at the very last possible minute before leaving for my trip that I needed to book a hotel room for two nights  I was able to get this hotel for  the first night and  the second night by going through Hilton com  For that price I wasnt expecting much  I come to the city on a regular basis and I have stayed in many fantastic hotels and none of them were anywhere near that price point  The location is excellent with a subway stop right outside the door  It is an easy walk to shopping Rockefeller Center Central Park etc  It was nice to be a little further away from all the hub bub around RFC but still able to get to it easily  I was given a corner room on the th floor which was a ent size by NYC standards  The bathroom was tiny but the water pressure in the shower was excellent  I did not have any problems using the safe and I found it very convenient  The staff was very friendly and accommodating and I had no trouble with them letting me keep my room when I needed to extend my stay  There were vending machines with drinks on every floor which was also convenient  I would definitely stay here again  
P => okay but a bit tired on the whole this hotel is fab for location  it is though looking a bit tired beds and pillows were lovely and comfortable  bathrooms are tiny and needing work plaster peeling off the walls and such like  in fact the toilet flooded the second night we were there so had to be moved to another room   with no help from staff to carry luggage   this other room being at the other end of the hotel where the painter and orators were stripping the walls the safe was not unlocked on arrival so we could not use it and so reported it at the desk and told that it would be sorted straight away it wasn t so had to again report it the following morning and insist that security came immediately so that we did not have to carry passports and money around with us all day  security did then arrive about  minutes later and was unlocked within  seconds check in was painless as was the express checking out staff were polite and helpful with all this said i would probably stay here again if only for the location it was an okay stay as long as you don t expect too much  
P => Good Hotel Great Loaction  The Doubletree Metropolitan is a good hotel in a great location  I have stayed at this hotel on and off for over  years  I used to live in Manhattan and always stay at the Metropolitan when my husband and I go back to visit  We always get a AAA rate thru the hotel website  Well worth it  We stayed right before Christmas for only  a night including taxes  You cant beat it The rooms are less than average size but you dont go to NYC to spend time in your room  The rooms are always clean the bedding is very comfortable and the staff has always been very friendly and helpful  The location is what is key  Only a   minute walk from Times Square  But the hotel is also located right on the subway line for the EV and  lines  Perfect for heading to Little Italy Chinatown Soho or the Village  I have never eaten at the hotel restaurant or the coffee shop attached  I do think the restaurant is overpriced  For anyone staying here do yourself a favor and either walk over to rd or nd Ave  There are other more reasonable delis coffee shops pubs and restaurants  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  Its a great deal for Manhattan  
P => Great Location We travelled to the Doubletree in ember   We have stayed at this hotel before many times on visits to NYC  This time was no different and again we had no problems at all with our stay here Check in was very quick especially for a busy time of the yearThe free Cookies are always a bonus and appreciated after a  hour flight and plane food The location is great we only took one cab during our  night stay apart from airport runsThe rooms are always clean and tidy and are a generous size for NYC For location and price I would always recommend someone to stay at this hotel  I know we will be staying here again when we come back  
P => great staff normal size rooms Booked on lastminute com we got a great rate for the week before Christmas  The staff of the Dobuletree were extremely friendly and helpful    more so than normal at any large city hotel  The room wasnt huge but was plenty big enough  Great location   walking distance to everything and a subway stop on the corner  
P => Locationpricestaff   Enjoyable stay Going to NYC for a short family vacation this hotel lived up to our expectations and in many cases exceeded them  We spent four nights and the price was great with the AAA discount right at night for two doubles  The bathroom was clean as well as the linens although the carpet was a little worse for wear  The beds were very comfortable  The room met our expectations overall The location was great  st and Lexington subway stop less than  feet away and the hotel provided those great cookies whenever we asked  A short walk to Rockefeller Center or Central Park without all the hem that is Times Square  There is also a police substation right down the street on st which was nice since there were plenty of cops on the block  A Cafe Metro chain right next door and many restaurants a couple of blocks over on rd and nd streets  The first day we were there they had forgotten to clean the room and provide new towels  The staff at the front desk was very apologetic and proceeded to provide us with a couple of days free breakfast buffet for the three of us  We had no issues after that  The staff was very attentive and friendly  The concierge was somewhat effective  It appears that is a concierge service contracted out by the hotel  When asked about restaurants they got on the internet and looked for what was around the hotel  Not as helpful as I would have expected  Overall an enjoyable stay and I would definitely stay there again  
P => It was great At check in the staff were very nice and offered us a free upgrade of our room the warm chocolate cookies were delicious The bellman who helped us to our room was kind and helpful The doorman offered us a pleasant smile everytime we came in or left the hotel  This vacation was a dream come true for us and the Doubletree made it even more special  
P => Expected better   in bad need of a reation Stayed on  rd and th  Location was great  Nearby to everything without being right in the heat of the craziness  About a twelve   fifteen minute hike or so to Times Square  Staff was phenomenal made sure that we were taken of  Gave us extra hot cookies when we asked a DoubleTree special  Price was great huge AAA discount The bad the room and hallways  We stayed on the sixth floor  The trim was falling off the hallways smelled the carpets were visibly stained and just about every single door looked like it had been through a college dorm party  The inside wasnt much better ceiling was peeling and the paint was falling off  The carpet in the room needed a steam clean  The lighting was poor the window shade wouldnt go down all the way  Most of these complaints youve seen on other responses as well  If youre really not picky or youre used to motel type rooms you can definitely manage here  All in all I was pleased but bottom line   the place is in bad need of a reation  If I HAD to I would stay here again but why bother when its NYC  Go for the much better located and nicer Hyatt  Better value too  I dont have photos because other reviews have accurate photos showing the damage  
P => Nice room great staff I selected the Doubletree for a one night business trip for which I needed to be in the area  There was a choice of rooms and rates available on the website with a higher rate for a room with a  hour cancellation policy    I believe their regular requirement was seven day cancellation The doorman was immediately attentive to my arrival even though he was busy welcomed me and handed my bag off to a bellman  There was a hostess for lack of a better term in the lobby who also welcomed me and pointed me to an available front desk person for check in which was friendly and efficient The bellman who accompanied me with my bag was friendly as well and covered the hotel facilities in detail for me  The room was somewhat larger than I expected for New York City clean with a flat screen TV  There was a sort of mini sofa in addition to the king bed and sufficient room to set my suitcase up as well  The bathroom was adequate with enough counter size for my shaving kit tubshower and toilet were in a arate room  The shower head was high enough    I hate the hotel shower head aimed at my chest    and produced plenty of hot water with little wait  The view was of the buildings across Lexington There was a minibar with snacks and a couple of mystery boxes    I picked one up it was a sewing kit label side down spotted the sensor and put it right back down    not quickly enough apparently  You supposedly have  seconds on this one    theyve apparently been devalued too  More later about this I had to get a cab at PM almost impossible in New York and the bellman found something for me    he didnt just stand and whistle but went out in the middle of the intersection to grab one  Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was fine good selection excellent service  There was a coffee shop as well full of New Yorkers grabbing a cup en route to the office  I dont usually fix coffee in my room so I didnt really miss a coffeemaker Im sure others will Checkout was efficient again the quothostessquot asked me if the bill slipped under my door was sufficient it wasnt and directed me to an open position  Friendly service again    I had been charged   plus taxes twice for the minibar  OK once for the sewing kit but I have no idea what the second could have been  Both were removed from my bill    apparently this isnt uncommon  Id wanted a hotel where I could check in quickly get to my dinner have a good sleep hot shower and good breakfast and quick check out  The Doubletree gave me all of that with the plus of a uniformly friendly staff  Just watch out for the hair trigger minibar  
P => Phenomenal Service at the Doubletree The service at this hotel was unbelievable comparable to a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons  The room was very nice the shower was outstanding and of course the warm Doubletree cookie is always welcome  The street sounds were relatively muted I had asked for the quietest room possible  The location is very nice as well  The room service was prompt and hot and reasonably good  But it was the personal attention and prompt responsiveness that sold me on the Doubletree  
P => A Perfect Stay We stayed at the Doubletree for a weekend getaway  From the moment we arrived we were very happy  The service is incredible  The location cannot be beat  Easy walking distance to Rockefeller Center and shopping along th Avenue  Theres also a subway station right out frontThe room was spacious and clean We have no complaints at all  Well be staying there again  
P => great location Had read mixed reports on the Doubletree Metropolitan but have to say we found the Hotel and staff excellent If you are looking for a great location for the sightsshopping and entertainment then look no further The rooms are not the biggest but are very well serviced clean and the comfort of the beds outstanding This was our th trip tp NYC and we would not hestiate to use the Doubletree again  
P => Not My Favorite But Okay I love NYC and I ventured from my favorite dive   The Milford Plaza   and splurged for this hotel at  a night THE GOODComfy BedGreat Staffent LocationNice Mini Bar  Room ServiceTHE BADDesk Crammed up Against BedOverpricedNot as spotless as it could beLocation quite expensive even for NYCWould I stay again I doubt it  I am a lover of Broadway and I think I would have rather spent  less per night and stayed at the Milford which is in my opinion smaller dirtier and the very best location to be in   Times Square 
P => This is my favorite NYC hotel I travel for work all of the time and I have to say that this is my favorite hotel to stay in while in New York  It is spotless  The location is definitely amazing  The beds are comfortable flat screen tvs are awesome and its just basically a really slick hotel  
P => Fantastic My family and I spent  nights at the Doubletree Metropolitan on st amp Lexington for the Thanksgiving holiday  This place is terrific  We booked a ior suite on the th floor  The hotel was very accomodating and fulfilled our request for a room with a private terrace  The room was clean  The bed was super comfortable  The ior suite was very large and suited a family of three nicely  Bathroom a bit quottightquot but not a deal breaker  If anyone is considering this hotel   dont hesitate  Youll love it  
P => New York New York Stayed for seven nights with my girlfriend check in was fast and friendly when we got to our room it was really nice quite spacious with a desk flat screen tv and chair  Every day our room was cleaned and our bed made up perfectly  The hotel staff were always helpful and polite the bar was pretty pricey but I found that about most bars in New York  We stayed on the fith floor and it was quite noisy but we still slept ok  When we checked out there were a few items on our mini bar bill I was unsure about so I asked reception about them and they knocked them off without question  Will stay there again but be on a higher floor  There is a handy gift shop inside the hotel for any gifts you need papers sweets etc  We didnt eat once from the hotel as there are so much places to eat nearby  
P => ent   some good and some bad Stayed at the Doubletree for one night The good Room is spacious   rather large for New York standards  Had a comfortable bed nice desk nice loung chair and a flat screen TV  The shower was wonderful lots of pressure and hot water The bad Room was noisy  I could hear everything going on on my floor  Could hear doors slamming down the hall  So sound proofing is a big issue here  Secondly the shades on the windows are bad  They do not completely block light coming into the window   there is a nice gap in between the shades  Thus you cant get total privacy and block out light Other bads service was pretty terrible  Didnt get my wake up call  Unenthusiastic check in Overall if you need a clean bed and a hot shower stay there but otherwise look around 
P => An example to all other hotels My dhter and I stayed in this hotel for  nights  The rooms were spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable  We stayed on the th floor and could barely hear any traffic noise  It is wonderful to be allowed a good nights sleep each night  The hotels Metropolitan Grill offered a fabulous buffet breakfast for  dollars per person  This has got to be the tastiest breakfast I have ever eaten  The location of the hotel is excellent  Located at Lexington Avenue and st Street on the fashionable East Side right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan  Between  and minute walk from Park Ave Rockefeller Centre and Broadway One of the most memorable things about this hotel is the quality of service throughout  From the front desk to the concierge the waiting staff in the grill bar to the maids servicing the rooms  The service is of an extremely high standard  A standard which I would expect with the AAA Diamond Rating it advertises  Well done to all its staff and I will definitely recommend you to all my friends  
P => wonderful We had a great time the location is good close to the subway right across the street  Would stay here again amp again  
P => Pretty sweet place My wife and I stayed here to celebrate our th Anniversary  We were not disappointed by the quality of this hotel  This has to be the nicest Doubletree around  We loved the quotretroquot design of the hotel  It had a very tasteful and sohphisticated flair  The rooms were ent sized by New York standards but the sink could have used more room for all the crap my wife takes with her on trips  Fantastic location with two metro lines right by the hotel  Staff were very friendly and attentive  
P => Loved the DoubleTree Metropolitan NYC This hotel is great  Perfectly situated in the heart of Manhattan The staff are excellent  A real jem  Our room was big by NY standards and everything was perfect  
P => Loved the Doubletree   would definitely stay again Myself and my husband stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for  nights in late ust  The warm cookies on check in were a God send Just what we needed  We were in room  which is in the back of the hotel but we werent bothered   there was very little street noise   only heard a fire engine once  The staff were extremely friendly  The room was big  Bathroom was small but the Neutrogena products made up for that  Bed was extra comfy  Really liked this hotel and would definitely stay there again  Its just up a block and around a corner from the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue where there is a stop for the Hop On Hop Off Buses   way better than the subway   you get to see so much more of New York  The Metro Cafe beside hotel was great aswell and the food good  All in all had a great trip   so much so had to buy an extra suitcase going home but there was a suitcase shop just down the street so how handy was that  
P => Would stay again Great central location very friendly staff and well maintained clean rooms  Especially liked the complementary cookie on arrival  Can get a little noisy with the fire station so close but overall a very enjoyable stay in NYC  
P => Great value and location    would stay again My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in late ust   After reading some of the other negative reviews I was a little weary of the quality of the hotel and went into my prebooked stay with low expectations  That said I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the hotel throughout our time at the hotel  Understanding that NYC hotel rates are high overall I think that given the location and general quality of the hotel if you are looking for a ent quality hotel that is centrally located I would definetly recommend this place to others  What we liked about the hotel is as follows Attentive management made us feel as though they went out of their way to handle our needs  We stayed in a queen room and specifically requested by telephone and on check in that we be on a street that did not face st St  that was not near the elevator and was on a higher floor  All of our needs were met  Our room was reated and was very clean  The bed was very comfortable  We also appreciated the warm cookies on check in and really appreciated the complimentary cookies that the front staff were gracious to provide us as a favour   we must have looked very tired a few days after  We also liked the kiosks at the front of the hotel which enabled us to check in to our airline Air Canada even though it was not a domestic flight the day before departure  We would have otherwise checked in online through an internet cafe so it was nice that this feature was available for free in the hotel lobby  The location was also great  safe neighbourhood near the  V and E trains and good selection of cafes nearby for an affordable and healthy breakfast  We ate at the Au Bon Pain at nd and Lexington and Cafe Metro right next to the hotel for breakfast and quite enjoyed it  The luggage check in people were very helpful  The maids were very sweet Where we felt the hotel could improve is as follows I felt that the concierges could have been a little more sincere about recommending things in the city  On two different occasions we respectively asked for the concierges opinion on tours and transfers to the airport  On both occasions the different concierges seemed to be pushing us to only one option for the tour and dissuading us from alternate forms of transportation to the airport  We couldnt help but feel that they were working on commission which didnt feel right  We instead relied on our tour book Doring and Kindersley  available in the gift shop but you can pick one up at Costco for  the price  Also we thought there could be better soundproofing as we could hear doors closing from our neighbours  This could be easily fixed Overall however it was a fantastic stay in a friendly city  If we were to return to NYC we would stay at this hotel in a heartbeat  
P => Rooms need updating and attitudes are poor  This hotel is in a great location The common areas look like they have been recently reated but the rooms are about   years behind schedule I am Hilton Honors Gold and booked my reservation through the Hilton reservation line  Booked a king with a roll away and was told that the roll away would be  for the trip not per night and my email confirmation stated this also Upon arrival reminded them about the roll away and was told that the roll away was night  I showed them my email confirmation and they said that was incorrect  I asked to speak to the manager on duty and his attitude was the worst  Acted like he was doing us a favor by speaking to us so I called Hilton from my cell phone and explained the situation  Soon enough the manager was taking a call from corporate and we were comped the roll away and breakfast each morning There are s of hotels in NYC so to have a poor attitude only turns people away from returning  I will stay at Hilton properties again but not this particular property  
P => Basic hote but Great Location I stayed in this hotel on a short city break with my husband  The hotel was on lexington ave and ideally located for all the major attractions  The Chrysler Building and Empire State building were only a few blocks away along with th ave with all the designer shops including Tiffany amp Co and Bloomindales Times square was also only a few blocks away all within walking distance once you have worked out how the blocks are set out the city is very easy to negotiate We used the subway to get to the Financial District to see ground zero and wall street  This way really easy and much quicker than a taxi as the roads are gridlock We went to see Chicago which was fantastic Melanie Griffiths was playing Roxy and we really enjoyed it  New York is such a vibrant city with lots to do and see   We loved it and are going back in  this year to take my son The hotel was quite basic but to be honest it was clean amp modern and was going through some kind of refurbishment at the time but this did not disrupt our stay  I would recommend visting a shop called century  opp ground zero has lots of great designer goods DampG  Tommy Hilfiger  Guess etc as really cheap prices  
P => In need of a major overhaul My travel agent booked me in here again  I reviewed it last time and was not polite but here was a chance to be surpised Sadly I wasnt  The good things are the location which is excellent and right next to my office which is why I get booked here and the rooms are reasonably spacious for New York  But this place is so tired  To give you a flavour   the bathroom has a tin sink set in a white plastic worktop  There are rawlplugs sticking out of the tiles where previous fixtures have fallen out of the walls  The tap is barely hanging on to the wall  The bedroom was OK   clean and all the usual facilities but very tired  And this Doubletree idea of presenting you with a warm cookie as you arrive   it feels so out of date  Here I am after a long flight checking in late   what I really want from a receptionist is to give me a warm soggy cookie   I dont even open the bag before it goes into the trash  And all yours for    its not as if its budget  
P => Great Stay for Super Bowl  The people at the front desk were awesome extremely friendly  The bar was all set up for the Super Bowl and they gave us extra food for free when we ordered our appetizer  The room had an awesome view   the room was very nice the bed was the bestParking was simple and easy  My husband and I would definitely stay there again with or without the kids Ps  Gene Simmons stayed their too   
P => Very pleasant stay My boyfriend and I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitian from for  week in y  I have no real complaints about the hotel  The staff was nice and willing to help out they acknowledged you everytime you passed by them  The hotel is clean the lobby is clean and inviting and the rooms are clean  The bathroom was quite small could only fit one person but this is New York and what would you expect from an already crowded city The hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and considering my boyfriend and I are athletic we chose to foot it and use the subway system for most of our stay  For those who do not like to walk there are  subway stations right outside the door of the hotel and plenty of taxis pass by on the street  We enjoyed our stay and would use this hotel again if when we revisit the city 
P => Great Stay If you are looking for a great place to stay close to everything this is it Overall my husband and I stayed for  nights and we had no real complaints  Pricey  yes but I did a whole lot of research and for the price range the Doubletree is one of the better options  the Ritz no but its DEFINATELY NOT a dump for the money Where the rooms large no but most New York hotels have the same problem the room was cleanthe bed comfortable and the service was good  The staff made every effort to make us feel welcome The location is excellent  you are in walking distance of everything and your options for shopping and meals are endless For a cheap breakfast the Oxford Cafe on nd is great For a nice quick lunch the Metro Cafe just outiside of the hotel is an excellent choice We simply loved it this is our new spot to stay when we are in the city  
P => Does exactly as it says on the tin This hotel provided us with a clean and comfortable base in the heart of a nice part of new york city  Previous experiences of quothotelsquot in this city had tht us that we could take nothing for granted in terms of cleanliness or basic standards Thankfully the Doubletree staff were always polite and welcoming and rates were reasonable for the location   There is little glitz or glamour here although it must be said that the lobby is impressive  The room was very clean and very comfortable and for that I was very relieved and very happy  
P => Not worth the price and watch your bill At over  a night for the week I expected a pretty nice hotel  I was embarassed at the conditions of the hallways to the rooms  It made me feel a little uncomfortable re safe just walking the hall to the room  Once in the room I couldnt believe how small the king room was  And there was no view   even for the th floor There is a dresserworkdeskTV stand unit on one side the bed on the other and a chair between them that you had to turn sideways to get into  The bathroom was so small you could almost use the toilet and shower at the same time  Dont have high expectations when you stay at this hotel and youll do fine  However watch the menu bar as they will charge you every day if you or the maid bumps the tray  It automatically hits your bill whether you take anything or not  Its supposed to allow you to pick up something and look at it for  seconds before billing you  I didnt use the mini bar at all and got charges everyday  Anyway try to get a completed bill when you leave  The clerk refused to give me one when I checked out and indeed they hit my CC for some more menu bar charges after I left  I wont be back at this hotel and will think twice about Doubletree since the clerk said it was corporate policy not to provide a completed bill  If Doubletree cares the clerk was working  at AM and should be fired for his rudeness  
P => No Frills Great location pleasent stay but nothing to write home about    The location is excellent for with lots of nice more up ket hotels near by and convenient for restaurants snacks and other essentials  We were given a room on a higher floor with a good view of Lexington Avenue  Rooms are small to average size comfortable enough for a couple who travels lightly  Bathroom was small but bed very comfortable king Very busy hotel lobby with lots of airline crews but still managed to check in and check out in under mins which isnt bad  Bar was good and the staff very friendly  Room service is not recommended as food came cold and under cooked  Overall pleasant for the money we paid and you could pay more for such a good location  Would stay again and not eat in 
P => BEDBUGS AT DOUBLETREE ROOM   After one night in the Doubletree room   I was covered in bedbug bites  I stopped counting after  bites which have now turned red and oozing with pus  They did upgrade my room and brought hydrocortisone cream but that did little to provide relief from the itching  Do not stay at this hotel without inquiring about their treatment for this problem  They had the nerve to suggest that I had brought the critters with me  I would seriously contact the NY health department if you are considering staying at this hotel to make sure the problem has been taken care of  They said they inspected the room and didnt find any but that provides me with little solace after the biting and scratching ordeal I have endured this past weekend 
P => Comfortable hotel good location This hotel has a fantastic location  Really close to th Avenue shopping and just a short walk to central park or down to the Empire State Building The rooms are clean and fairly spacious  Very comfy bed I was staying by myself in a double room so it worked out fairly expensive for what it was  If you were sharing the room and the cost it would work fairly good value for money  
P => Great Value Great location next to subway and on convenient Lexington Ave  The room was ok size for two people clean and good amenitites  It could use some cosmetic upgrades  The best experience while there Our booking agent had booked us for incorrect dates and we didnt catch the problem  When checking in they had no reservation for us on that date however they quickly worked to accommodate us with the same rates as promised by agent and gave us warm cookies  Convenient to breakfast and lunch restaurants and walking distance to many more great restaurants  
P => Very convenient   no frills but worth considering The location is excellent for Midtown and convenient for restaurants snacks and other essentials I checked in at the computerised terminal in the lobby which was great untilit failed to print out my room number but the desk staff were helpful then and throughout my two night stay  Room service even brought me a single fork at my request when I got a take out and had nothing to eat it withUnfortunately I was given a smoking room but this was bearable with the AC on and some airfreshener bought from the local pharmacy  To compensate they gave me vouchers for a free breakfasts for me and even for my brother in law who popped by the next day The breakfast buffet was quite well stocked The king bed room was fine for one person and would have been OK for two but the bathroom is small   although the bath itself is big and the shower was hot and powerful Lots of airline crew seem to stay and the lobby is fairly frenetic but as others have said for the price this is a good enough base for those not spending too much time in the room  
P => wonderful experience we stayed at this Doubletree last night and I was so impressed with the hotel that I wanted to write the review before we even left  We were greeted at the door by several hospitality people welcoming us to the hotel we were checked in immediately and given our warm welcome cookies  Upon finding out that I have an alergy to nuts the check in clerk went away and came back with a box of  delicious chocolates for me instead  Our room was on the th floor which had a great view and also a free continental breakfast for hilton honors members  The breakfast was excellent and manned by very happy and helpful staff  We requested a late checkout which was no problem   our room was modern comfortable quiet and immaculately clean  The bed and pillows the ulitmate in comfort the bathroom was small but had a wonderful shower and neutrogena bath products  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and this will probably convince me to search for Doubletrees again  It is an oasis in New York to find anything like this for the same price as a lot of much lesser hotels LesPortland Oregon 
P => lots to like lots to dislike Stayed for  nights mid   for a business trip  Convenient to Grand Central and there is a subway station right at the corner  Staff and service were very helpful  My room was on the th floor on the Lexington Avenue side  I was concerned that the street noise at that level would be unbearable as Id experienced several years earlier at the nearby riott East Side  This hotel was much quieter than that one which was a pleasant surprise  The room was surprisingly quiet  it was also about night cheaper  However the rooms are clearly dated despite reation attempts  The bathroom is tiny and feels cramped when showering  Water flow is good however  The bed was very comfortable Circulation for AC and heat is poor so the best way to ventilate was keep the window open As a business traveler I was frustrated by the lousy electrical sockets  They are not well situated in the room and over half of them were so loose and rickety that PC and Blackberry power plugs would slide out and not stay plugged in  The TV also seemed to reset itself and turn on at midnight each night  Another co workers TV would turn on but not display video  It took the hotel  days to correct the issue which ended up being a simple matter of correctly programming the TV remote Not a great hotel if youll spend a lot of time in the room  However if you want a reasonably priced convenient place to sleep in midtown this one might be worth a try  
P => Perfect location Stayed at the Doubletree Hotel for  week in il  Very nice brilliant location  Just min walk down the road to bloomingdales and a further  mins to central park   Pleasent and situated in a great area  
P => Loved it Im not sure if we just got lucky or if some of the reviewers on here have much higher standards that us but we kicked off our last trip to the States with  nights here and we were really impressed Our room was spacious immaculate and the bed was extremely conformatble  The staff were courteous and friendly especially the doorman and the bar downstairs was great The location is great for mid town shopping and restaurants and only  mins walk from the green line for travelling into Lower Manhattan My only reasons for not giving the hotel an quotexcellentquot rating are as follows  Our room was on the st Street side of the hotel and there was some noise from the Fire station in the night   The blind in our room broke and we had to notify the front desk twice before it was fixed   The dinner menu in the restaurant was a bit limited  
P => Good for a night I stayed at this hotel for a night  The entrance is very funky and colorful  Warm cookie during check in was nice  Hotel room size was good for NYC  The room and and the bathroom were nice and clean  I thought  was OK for NYC hotel but I think it is a bit pricey for this doubletree  Overall if you are not going to stay in the room it was an average hotel with a good location  
P => Enjoyable NYC Hotel Experience I did a LOT of research online Travelocity Expedia Hotels com etc  on this hotel and I am glad I did  I think I booked a good hotel because I am very happy with my experience  When I first got there they were able to check us in quite early  Check in is usually around  but we were able to get into the room around   We took the red eye from San Diego and they  have been sympathetic The room was good size   nothing like the quotshoe boxquot descriptions of other hotels  I was thinking about booking a room at the W but after seeing the size of the rooms I am glad I opted for the DoubleTree  The front desk was always very helpful with any requests we had  We asked for extra towels had them delivered within  hour and then received a follow up call to make sure we got them  Nice touch  The concierge was great he had a lot of great suggestions  The room was always clean upon our arrival back from a long day on the town  One draw back that didnt relate to us their computer system was down one afternoon and there were some angry people checking in Everyone got an apology letter from the management but I am sure there were some unhappy travelers arriving  The best thing about the hotel great location  We talked a ton and there were subway stations right next to the hotel which was perfect  So all in all I am really happy with the hotel  
P => Overpriced and Shabby After paying an outrageous price for a room with  double beds  for a last minute reservation my mother in law and I were appalled by the peeling wallpaper in our room the tiny bathroom the uncomfortable beds and the  room service steak with a potato diced vegetables and a glass of water  Overall the service was quite friendly but it couldnt make up for the usurious price  
P => Just OK    but good location The hotel is in a great location  If you arent going to be spending much time in your room the Doubletree is fine  I found the hotel to be a bit run down and extremely basic  We stayed for a weekend following a week of business in Washington DC  The room was adequate  
P =>  Affordable  hotel in Manhattan All hotels in Manhattan especially Midtown are expensive  Thats a fact This hotel was a value for the price  Good location and proximity to Rockafeller Time Square and Central Park  Rooms were clean and comfortable and no suprises  What you would expect from a Hilton property  A few things I would NOT recommend The restaurant  Our group had dinner there and the service was mediocre and the food       well McDonalds can do better  I had a filet mignon and was quite surpised when it arrived covered in what looked like instant brown gravy and water from the overcooked vegetables  Also the bar is fun and can get crowded at night  Go to the bar to get a drink though the waitress was lazy and seemed irritated with our presence Go accross the street to Mr  Ks for Chinese expensive but awesome 
P => Very happy at the Doubletree Metropolitan Stayed here one night for business  The location is wonderful  We ate yummy Indian food right down the street at a place called Indigo had a celeb in the restaurant too  in all my visits to NY that was my first celeb sighting  The bed was the most comfortable Ive ever slept in at a hotel  The staff was very friendly the room was very clean  Id definitely stay here again  I think the   price we each paid was very reasonable for the area and the ammenities  
P => Loved it  Just back from this hotel and thought it was lovely WE were able to check in early and the cookies were lovely The staff cant do enough for you The Room was big well bigger than other hotels ive stayed in in ny the room was spotless the cleaners were in everyday to change towels and bedclothes Beds were very comfy The bathroom was a ent size too and the shower was goodLocation is very good short walk to th ave Time Square Macys everything is walkin distanceIf i was to go back to new york again i WOULD stay here again i dont no why so many reviews have classed it as a bad hotel THere is nothing wrong with it and im a very fussy person The pictures on the website is exactly wat i got 
P => A quick stay    I stayed here for  night in late ch  The hotel is not as nice as the Doubletree in Times Square but then again it is at least     nt  cheaper  Well located if you have business on the east side  Not a whole lot going on at the hotel   bar was dead on a Thu  night   but there are plenty of options in the area  The W is  block south and has great bar Staff was VERY courteous and room was clean with nice amenities  There are definitely some worn patches but overall its pretty good for a mid priced hotel in Manhattan  
P => No luxury no complaints up to expectations I was there with my wife for the Easter Holiday  nights  I was warmly welcomed got a cookie and found the room spotless  I would return there anytime with the corporate rate I got The electronic safe was locked I asked for a maintenance person to unlock it this was solved in the next  minutes by a friendly employee  The bathroom ceiling is indeed peeling off as mentioned in many other reviews since there are no bathroom fan which is weird but that is the only downside I found That said the bed and pillows are great the shower has good pressure the location is perfect next to the subway It is not a top class hotel rooms are small but it is in Manhattan so it met my expectations  
P => My PROs and CONs PROS No doubt that the hotel is in a very safe area and close to everything  Subway near by tons of bars and restaurants  My wife loves Starbucks so there is one in evey corner  The staff is very friendly  CONS It costs too much for the size of the room  I happened to have a relative who could get a good rate  But again NYC Manhattan is very expensive  Breakfast is not included  
P => ok for a short stay we have just returned from a weekend break in the doubletree and though it was OK it was not great  Hotel is in a great location couple of blocks from th ave most places within walking distance  We stayed in a room on the th floor rooms where a good size but not very clean when we arrived there were hairs in the bath the bathroom overall was not very clean could have been a lot better and apart from making the bed I dont know what the housekeeper done  The bed was very comfortable but the air condition was quite noisey and could not be altered or turned off it didnt seem to do anything but make a noise the staff on the front desk were not very helpfulfriendly but I found the staff in the restaurant very polite and helpful  I have stayed in many  star hotels in the US and never come across the system the Doubletree had in place for the mini bar if you picked something up from the tray to see if you might want it but you ided not to so put it back if it had been out of the tray for more then  seconds you where charged for it also which I have done in the past and not been told I cant is put other stuff in the mini bar fridge this again caused a charge which when mentioned at the front desk I was told quotwell its not a fridge its a mini barquot in quite an unfriendly manner you are notified of the charge on a small note placed in the tray which at first just looks like a price list stuck between the goods on the tray  
P => Nice Hotel Stayed here for three nights and overall the stay was good  The bed was very comfortable and the room was nice  I found the restaurant to be a bit lacking  The first night I visited it everything I asked for from the menu I couldnt get for some reason I ended up settling for something I didnt really want because I was hungry but didnt each much of it because it wasnt great  The waiting staff were very friendly but seemed to be in a constant state of confusion and flurry even when the place was near empty I had breakfast one morning and would never do it again   it was awful and over priced The bar was nice unusual for a hotel bar and I really enjoyed the atmosphere  The cocktails were tasty but I order the same one three times and got a different version of it three times  The cocktail waitress couldve been a bit friendlier   or friendly at all might have helped The hotel itself and the room were nice and most of the staff were too just not very organised  although check in was a breeze and the receptionist very nice  The day we were leaving we checked out and left our bags with the concierge and asked to get a taxi booked for our flight for later that day he was very friendly and took the details professionally  We arrived back at the hotel later retrieved our bags tipped him and sat awaiting our taxi as we were half an hour early   minutes later stil no taxi  A different conceirge came over and asked us what we were waiting on and so ensued a process where we realised that the previous guy had obviously forgotten to book the taxi and was ringing to get one now  He told us  minutes   minutes later and no taxi   with bad traffic we knew we were pushing it for the flight and asked him if he could just flag one   something he probably should have done from the beginning  We ended up paying more for the taxi and although we made our flight I would suggest if staying here do not leave your airport transportation in the hands of this hotel 
P => Loved It  Spent  nights in the Doubletree Metropolitan and I absolutely LOVED IT I was upgraded to a suite on the top floor at no additional charge based on my hilton diamond status  The room was clean very large compared to other rooms in manhatten hotels with cool furniture flat panel tv and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in at a hotel  Great location nice staff good restaurant on site funky bar and a really good gym  AND it was cheaper than the Hampton Inn I stayed at last year in the same area if I paid in advance for my room when I made the reservation which I did  I would definitely stay here again  
P => great i booked a room on hotels com for the riott east  it was  of us total  riott said that a room with two beds was not available even though we had reserved them online  they said the quotreservation was not a guaranteequot then what is it then we called hotels com and had to wait about  minutes on hold  they eventually did find us a room at the Doubletree luckily it was two blocks away  and cost  less per night about  total i must say we were impressed by doubletree  great staff great location ent rooms  the lobby was neat and modern not pretentious like the riott they think theyre the trump or something  the doubletree staff were friendly and helpful  the riott staff by contrast looked like saying hello required a tip  our room was ent and clean  the bathroom was modern even though there were some waterspots on the ceiling I never understood why NY hotel bathrooms always look so bad  it looked clean at least  good soapshampoo  the housekeeping staff were also very nice  the beds were fine  clean sheets  small flat screen tv with wireless internet keyboard didnt use  window opens yay modern blinds  not much of a view office building accross street but who cares the best thing about the hotel is its location  there are nice restaurants all around especially rd ave  go down to Azure for breakfast  great food cheap prices at this deli  come out of the front of the hotel make a right on th and walk down  blocks   for an omlette if you want room service   pershaw its about a  cab ride to chinatown with traffic The hotel bar was pretty trendy  drink prices were average  for a beer to  for a chocolate tini  the wait staff there were also nice  lots of people hanging out saturday night so great for meeting people like most of manhattan parking prices suck  at least the lot is right around the corner on th so you dont have to valettip   a night and make sure you get the car out exactly before the hr day ends or else you pay a huge fee  
P => Satisfactory The rooms at the Doubletree Metro are very petite in size  The or of the room was plain and simple lacking charisma  The lobby was also small and many left guests where left standing where chairs were lacking  The bar right next to the lobby does provide additional seating and has good aesthetics The hotel was able to accommodate an early check in around noon however dont expect it as it is rare  The staff members of the Doubletee Metropolitan were friendly and knowledgeable The room was suitable for two adults  It would be a little cramped if you planned on bringing a third guest or a child along  The storage space was minimal and only four hangers are provided for your convenience  If you plan on spending most of your time outside of the hotel seeing the city then youll be fine  However I think the hotel is a little on the pricey side for what you pay There are plenty of late night snacking and dining options around the hotel as well as a subway stop is less than  feet away from the entrance Upon departure a staff member booked a car service for me to the airport  It was  to JFK  for La Guardia at a special hotel rate  Its much easier to do this than to take the SuperShuttle from the airport HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED Enjoy New York 
P => Exactly Right I stayed  nights at the Doubletree last month and was very very pleased  As I searched the web for Manhattan hotels I was hoping to find something cheaper than the night I paid for the Doubletree but lots of negative reviews on TripAdvisor for cheaper properties scared me away The Doubletree was comparable to their best properties elsewhere with a room thats definitely large by NYC standards  Very clean very comfortable and a helpful staff  If you can manage the price and want a mid town location Id say you cant go wrong here Location is excellent   subway stop at the corner and a different subway line just one block up Lex  Short walk to MoMA  short blocks to Grand Central Station  I took shuttle bus from the airport to GC and just walked to the hotel from there Finally A couple of tips for good cheap breakfasts in the neighborhood I splurged on dinners The Oxford Cafe at Lex amp nd and Ess a Bagel on rd Ave between th amp st  Enjoy 
P => Great Location The hotel is pretty basic however our room was spacious for the centre of NY  The hotel itself was okay and the staff were very helpful particularly the concierge  The standard of or within the room however was pretty poor ie there was a chunk missing from the door in the top right hand corner After having read other reviews re safety only after having booked it we kept the chain on and a chair up against the door but never had any problems  The bathroom is very small but the shower was great powerful which is what we like  The bed was comfortable and there wasnt a great deal of noise     outside our window  The noise from other guests was a different matter however very noisy On the whole not bad  Would use it again on the basis that I wasnt looking for luxury by no means but location was great very convenient and for the price cant complain  
P => great location I visited New York with my wife and  yr old dhter recently and stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel on Lexington Ave  The hotel was great with very helpful and friendly staff  We had a triple room with  x double beds which was average size and very clean with very little street noise  There was a gym at the hotel but we didnt have time to use it though  The bar was very lively and comfortable  Breakfast in the hotel was quite expensive  about  dollars each but there were  cafes next door which did breakfasts at a fraction  The location was great about  mins walk to the Empire State Times Square Grand Cenral Station and about mile from Greenwich Village  Will definately stay here on the next visit  
P => Excellent location great hotel A friend and I went for a girlie weekend and stayed in the Doubletree for  nights  We were upgraded on check in great staff at the desk and the room was big by NY standards small by European standards and clean  The bathroom was very small but well designed and functional  The location is fantastic its a stroll from th Avenue shopping and there is a subway station literally outside the door  Id certainly go back  
P => Too small too expensive This hotel is vastly overpriced for what it delivers even by New York standards  The room was so small that I felt claustrophobic  The internet didnt work but I got charged for it anyway  
P => Excellent Location The three most important features of this hotel are location location location We were in NY just for a quick vacation and the central location of this hotel was excellent  Subway stations the Park SoHo etc  are all a quick cab ride or enjoyable walk from the hotel  The staff was very nice and professional  As you have probably read they give you a nice warm chocolate cookie when you check in  Actually we would ask for a cookie every morning when we left the hotel and they happily obliged  The barlounge area in the lobby is a nice place to have a drink and wait  The concierge was helpful the one time I asked him a couple of questions  The rooms were nice kind of like an IKEA sample room  There is a small flatscreen TV and a little love seat sofa  The rooms were clean and ours had a very nice view  If I really want to find something to complain about I could say the bathrooms are a bit small but you are in Manhattan with some of the most expensive real estate in the world so dont expect a luxury bathroom unless you pay a premium for it  For a middle of the road hotel I think the Doubletree Metropolitan really has a lot to offer  Again the location is what makes this hotel a great value  
P => Convenient comfortable   and cramped I booked this hotel on Quikbook for a  night stay associated with a business trip  The rate varied with each night from a low of  to a high of   Oddly Quikbook offered the four different rates for my stay whereas the Hilton website only offered the highest rate for all  nights i e   x   When I called to see if I could book directly with the hotel at the rates of    and  I was told no although I guess I could have achieved the same result by making  arate bookings     Overall I was happy with our stay  The location was perfect for my business trip meetings mostly in midtown east and for shopping  I much prefer this area which is near where I used to live to the Times Square area where Id stayed a few weeks ago   at the Westin  There is a subway stop right beside the hotel and Grand Central is a short walk away  Our room was clean the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was of a reasonable size and had good water pressure and reliable hot water levels  Housekeeping was friendly and efficient the woman who cleaned our room each day did a great job of accommodating our needs we had to spend a lot of the time in the room working andor studying and cleaned around us when we had to stay in  There is a ent choice of nearby cafes Au Bon Pain is one of the best  As I recalled from when I lived in this neighbourhood there seem to be relatively few restaurants on Lexington or Third Avenue just to the East  Youll have much more choice if you walk one more block further east to Second Avenue There were a number of irritating aspects of our visit though  First most of the front desk staff we dealt with were brusque and unhelpful the exception was the supervisor who dealt with some problems with our bill on check out he was very service oriented and professional  As others have mentioned there is no minibar or coffee maker in the room  At this price a free cup of in room coffee in the morning would seem appropriate  Of course the room was so tiny there was practically no room for either appliance  The room is so tiny there was only enough space for a small armchair jammed up between the bedside table and the window  There was so little space it was impossible to sit in the chair  Internet was   a day better than some hotels but not cheap frustratingly the box and wire connection for the internet had such a short cord that it was impossible to sit on the bed adjacent to the tiny desk   and only quot away from the boxwire contraption on the desk and use ones laptop  Note There is a FedexKinkos about  blocks north   a better value if you only need the internet for a short period of time or if you need to print something  It costs  per bag to store a bag   perhaps I would have tipped that much but I think this sort of thing should be in the customers discretion not a fixed fee Would I stay here again Yes because of the location and because the hotel is clean and the beds are comfortable   but I wish the hotel wouldnt nickel and dime its customers   and if I could afford the larger rooms Id pay for upgrade  
P => Good Stuff Location ideal  mins to Grand Central  mins to Times Square  Directly by a Subway station  Surrounded by other glamorous hotels also making you feel your really n the top area  No problems with the staff and the rooms though smaller than most US rooms not bad for NYC  Bed was cracking very comfortable  The cookie s a nice touch also No problems at all and close to it all  
P => High recommended I stayed here for  nights in ember  and couldnt fault the hotel  Staff were friendly and helpful and the room and spacious nicely orated quiet and very clean We didnt eat here but I did order room service which was delicious and beautifully served  There is also a good hotel bar The location was perfect for us  Id recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere central to stay in Manhattan as I was absolutely delighted with it  
P => Great Location Spent  nights in New York  The hotel is in a great location  blocks from fifth ave and a further  from broadway  New York is a city that is easy to travel in  The hotel as per previous reviews is good for those that dont need to spend much time there ie just for a bath and for sleeping in  The rooms were big but the bathrooms were very small  The beds were very comfy  The only downside is make sure that the do not disturb sign is put outside and that the privacy lock is on otherwise the cleaners are constantly trying to get in and is quite disconcerting  The sound proofing needs to be better but overall the place is what you pay for in this city  
P => doubletree great stayed here   thought the hotel was great and in a great location  the desk staff were very friendly and helpfull  the rooms were cleaned every day and are agood size wich is rare in new york i have travelled here from ireland quite a few times and this is the best hotel yet and great value ideal location and hotel for a trip to new york the only downside is the price of the drinks in the bar have a good stay 
P => Definitely Recommend My wife and I stayed there for  days over new years and had a great experience to ring in   We arrived early p and we were checked in complete with our warm cookies in about  minutes even though the lobby was mobbed with people checking in on a Friday afternoon of the holiday weekend  Rooms are small but very efficient and with newer furniture flat screen TV nice comforter but above all else they were clean  Only odd thing as some have noted in their reviews no vent fan in the bathroom so paint is peeling off the ceiling  We didnt care really to be honest  Nice bar off lobby ent sized gift shop too but we were too busy seeing the sites to use either  Soda machines on the floors but buy locally at all the drug stores right in the neighborhood and save a  per bottle  I should also point out the hotels perfect location on Lexington Av  to so many sites in Manhattan   minute walk to Rockefeller Plaza and  minute walk to Times Square and  minutes to Central Park  My wife and I didnt really know where to stay other than being close to Times Square for new years  this is a great place to see so much of NYC  For food we wanted basic and quick   the metro cafe right next door to the hotel can give you a   breakfast to start your day  has sandwiches and sodas  Down the street is a Red Stone Pizzeria for good NY style pizza salads etc  Tons of nicer places too all over and neighborhood is safe   lots of commercial and retail all around you  Well definitely go back  
P => Fantastic Stayed here in ember  on our third visit to New York  Wins hands down over the other places weve stayed and both of them have been pretty good  Maid service daily clean towels etc  minute walk to Central Park and Times Square  Chrysler building around  blocks down Lexington One thing I would say give the restaurant in the hotel a miss not the best by any means 
P => Possibly average but watch the details Stayed for  nights over Christmas    adults and  teenagers in one room room   Tried to charge us  for the childrens breakfasts as max for room package was   Manager sorted this out but lots of problems every day re missing vouchers etc  Breakfast very mediocre and actually unnecessary as the hotel is surrounded by lots of sandwich bars which are very cheap and excellent quality  Toilet blocked room  on  nd day bath outflow room  very slow  Noisy lovers in next door room on  rd day necessitated us all moving to another room at  am  New room was bigger but had sink in bedroom as bathroom was too small room   Internet was free in lobby   just as well as cable in room was broken   they fixed it with cable across room Bathroom ceiling in  was peeling as in your photos and also mould at bath edge  Also bar cost   for two gin and tonics Finally the concierges were really only interested in selling trips and restaurants for their fee  Example Q Where can we eat on Christmas Day A quotvery hit and miss mostly closed can get reservation at  eachquot Theatre tickets offers had   kup  Actually virtually everything was open  We ate in Planet Hollywood excellent and cheap and went to Radio City Show  min in line excellent seats both on Christmas Day  Hot Tip Must get New York City Pass   saved hundreds of dollars for the four of us The good news the management addressed all our problems quickly and even returned our passports which I left in the lobby as we were leaving The location of the hotel is excellent and across the road to the Waldorf where President Bush stays  
P => Good value hotel in a very convenient location We stayed at the Doubletree a couple days before Christmas father mother and  small children  I was suspicious of the hotel because of the extreme quotgood or badquot reviews here on TripAdvisor but a friend recommended it its in a great location and I found a price under night   so I booked our stay here  It turns out we had a good experience  Ive stayed many times in Manhattan and Ive paid much more for much less  I found the hotel to be a solid  star to   star  The room was stylish clean and in great shape   small but large enough for the  of us and the staff was courteous and professional  The location is wonderful for a mixture of Manhattan activities  Its within walking distance of Rockefeller Center Broadway and Central Park  For going downtown or uptown to museums the subway is just outside the door  We didnt use any of the hotel restaurants but the lobby bar seemed to be a popular spot   it had great modern or and was full most of the night   it could have been mistaken for the W Hotel bar down the street Two disappointing experiences were the frequent long lines at the concierge and the storage fees for luggage after room check out bag to check into storage and another bag to check out     absurd   Ive never experienced this anywhere else  But overall I will definitely consider staying at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel again  
P => Good accommodation great location My son amp I stayed  nights in this hotel to celebrate his st birthday  Had a room with two double beds on the th floor  Good size room clean beds really comfortable  Great location for Manhattan  We didnt really use the hotel apart from sleeping and showering All hotel staff were pleasant amp courteous  There was some discolouration on the bathroon ceiling but apart from that the room was fine  The location was fantastic all the main attractions were within  minutes walk  It is a great base for sightseeing and shopping  I dont understand why anyone would give it a negative review unless they were expecting total luxury It is just like it looks on their website I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to friends and family  
P => Fantastic hotel in a great location We visited New York and booked the Doubletree as it seemed a ent standard for the price  We were very pleased  The room Standard King was large and the bed was mega comfy Yes there was a bit of peeling paint on the bathroom ceiling but the hotel was clean tidy and everyone from the bell boy to the desk staff were friendly and helpful  The location was fantastic with th avenue  blocks away in one direction and bloomingdales  blocks away in the other  Would highly recommend this hotel to people on a budget who need a ent midtown location  
P => Great NY hotel for the price I travel to New York on business several times each year and always stay at the Doubletree  In NY most hotel rooms are small and well worn but the Doubletree has more space and is recently remodeled  Very comfortable beds The location is great making it convenient to get to meetings anywhere in the city  The restaurant is good for meetings they let you stay as long as you need although a bit overpriced for the quality  The Metro Cafe next door is perfect for quick meals  I have found the concierge and front desk staff to be adequate but when traveling on business I dont need my hand held  
P => New York Shopping Trip My best friend from school and I have just returned from the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel in New York from a  night stay  We booked this trip late and did not have a clue what we were going to after reading the reviews they were either really bad or good At the beginning of the year we stayed in a  star hotel in New York and it was excellent so after booking this we had mixed feelings about booking this hotel On arriving at the hotel we was an hour earlier at check in but was greeted with our cookie and given our room number without any problem  When I asked if we had two double beds the lady said that the travel company had booked us a small room with only one double bed  When I asked if we could have a room with two double beds she said that because of Thanksgiving Day the hotel was very busy but she looked on her computer and then gave us a bigger room on the th Floor with two double beds The room was of a nice size and had two double beds a small but very clean bathroom  The only think that we missed was not having a kettle in the room which was the only downfall  Our room was not noisy but it was at the back of the hotel and I dont know if it would of made any difference if we had been at the front of the hotel The hotel is in a great location walking distance to Fifth Avenue Shops Central Park Grand Central Station Madison Avenue Shops Bloomingdales and Times Square The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful and cannot say a bad work about the people or the hotel all in all a good trip to New York with lots and lots of shopping done and food ate 
P => Getting Better Still a Ways to Go I stayed here in mid ember   It was my first visit in over a year when the property had just converted from an independent to a Doubletree  The function of the hotel has definitely improved  Access to the Executive Lounge is now clear   before the staff werent sure if you could get in if you were a Gold or Diamond HHonors member now you can only get in if you are Gold or Diamond  The check in process has also improved especially if you are GoldDiamond and check in on the web ahead of time  My room was cleaned and ready to go  The cosmetic issues that other reviews mention are definitely still an issue   wall paper arating stains on carpets scuffs on walls  Overall though the price is great the location is great and the restaurant  bar are perfect for rainy nights when you dont want to go out The photos below are of a ior suite with a king bed  
P => Weak Weak hotel   it is NOT NEWLY REATED at least it doesnt look that way  Old and tired hotel  No AC on warm days in the fall hotel switchs to heat throughout   you sweat  Dingy and dirty  Cheap furnishings  Very disappointing  On my quotbad hotelquot list of places to avoid  
P => I loved this hotel I stayed at this hotel on the recommendation of my employer who had also stayed here in tember I thought it was lovely and every single staff member that I spoke to made me fell like I was the only guest at the hotel I was travelling alone and I didnt need to worry about any details they took care of everything I would certainly stay here again I missed so much of my trip to New York because I keep falling asleep in the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in  
P => Not So Nice Room smallish which was expected  Was also very warm upon entry   tried AC for cooling but couldnt get it to work turned off late ober  Wallpaper peeling in both bathroom and sleeping area  Carpet stained  Location of room was on th floor facing corner of st and Lexington  At am the parking garage across the street starts moving cars via their elevator and all sleeping stops  Very very noisy  If you dont require rest and are impartial to peeling walls and crappy workmanship this place will do ya  
P => Very Dissapointed My initial reaction was quotWow   what a tiny roomquot Then I noticed the wall paper that was arating from the wall  Not a pleasant site  When I saw the bathroom I almost threw up the ceiling had a lot of water damage and it looked like it would cave in any moment  The bathroom was also very tiny I would not stay there again nor would I recommend this hotel to ANYONE  What a great dissappointment considering Ive always stayed at Doubletree  
P => Modern Hotel Great or Great Bedding Booked through there own website and was very impressed I have stayed in some very poor hotels in NY but this was very nice  Modern funky or in the rooms and the lobby some hotels only spend money on the lobby Room was standard NYC size i e small but was ent  Clean and no problems MUST comment on the bed it was the most comfortable EVER They sell the bedding downstairs and I know why it is so soft and lovelyAlso wired internet is available in the room at a charge but what isnt advertised is that there is wireless internet available in the lobby you need to get the passcode from the check in staff each day Finally the concierge was great and he really helped us with his suggestions and gave us some good discount cards too 
P => Excellent Hotel excellent Location I stayed with my wife  nights on this hotel and it was an excellent experience  The location is absolutely great  On the side of the hotel it s the Metro Cafe where you can eat excellent salads you choose the ingredients at a good price and you can bring them to your room  There is a subway station just on the corner of  st with lexington and other on  st with lexington Starbucks is just some seconds away  
P => Keep looking    Room type King non smoking  Received room on a higher floor th far away from the elevator as requested  Reserved thru website and got best internet rate   nights stay during nd weekend of tember  Pros Excellent midtown location within a block of subway station and several food options nearby  Super comfy bed and the cookie was a nice touch  AC worked well for unseasonably warm late summer  Friendly and efficient service from concierge and bellhop although the reception service was not so good  Cons Although the d cor looked as if it were updated recently the carpet in the room amp especially in the hallways had seen better days and reeked of smoke  Had an interior facing room which probably cut down on the street noise a bit but unfortunately gave us a lovely view of the building next door s broom closet Didn t try the restaurant as it seemed a bit expensive but there was a very good deli next door and the W s restaurant just a block away  Average size bedroom area but very small bathroom  I m a small person at    and lbs but I could sit on the loo wash my hands use the towel rack and turn on the shower all at the same time  Impossible to do any of the prior mentioned while keeping the door open  No bathroom ventilation whatsoever so even with the door wide open while bathing the steam collected on the ceiling and condensed huge droplets even several hours later  The bathroom or shower curtain consistently smelled musty and even the paint wallpaper was peeling from the excessive moisture  The in room internet via television was circa  I think  It would be faster amp more legible to check your emails from your phone  The keyboard failed so we called a tech who came immediately but who could not fix the problem even with a new keyboard  Charges for the in room internet were credited although we had to ask twice  The President and some very important foreign dignitaries were staying in hotel across the street which made getting a cab impossible due to the street closures and high security  The registration staff seemed familiar with the President s security measures while visiting but failed to warn us that we d have trouble leavingentering the area when asked about getting a cab later that day  When the time came to leave for our international flight the bellhop was as helpful as he could be under the circumstances but ultimately had to walk  blocks with luggage to finally find a car for a heftier fee than regular taxis to take us to the airport   very stressful  Unless they lower the cost to stay significantly I can t imagine why I d return to this hotel  Especially when there are so  other options   the W one block away was only  more per night 
P => Great Location Hotel just OK The hotel is older and the room we stayed in needs to be updated  It resembled the picture somewhat but I expecting something a little nicer  The beds were very comfortable and the room was spacious enough  The location was fantastic  We walked everywhere except the Battery Park area and for that we only had to jump on the subway right outside our door  I would stay here again if I got a really good deal otherwise I would probably try something a little less worn  There is a Metro Cafe right next door that has great food is open early and late and is very reasonable  I definitely recommend eating there  
P => Great Location Clean Rooms While the Doubletree Metropolitan has a fairly generic chain hotel feel it is very centrally located for a tourist trip to New York  I was there on business in midtown and it was great to be able to walk everywhere  You have the  train st St stop right next to the hotel and Grand Central station not too far  The Plaza FAO Schwartz and fancy stores on Fifth Avenue are close by  I will say that the EXACT area the hotel is in is rather bland and business y  If you want a real quotNew Yorkquot atmosphere Lexington Avenue in the s is not what Id recommend  be try Times Square th Avenue Union Square Upper West Side or SoHo I stayed on the th floor room  which had lots of natural light and was not noisy at all  The rooms seem to be organized with evens on one side and odds on the other so I would recommend booking an even numbered room  The people in the room next to mine were watching TV pretty loudly I heard it when I was in the hallway but the sound did not come through the wall The room was clean with a comfy king bed GREAT velvet chaise lounge and smallish flat screen TV  The bathroom had Nutregena products and was VERY clean  Great mirror over the sink the sink is in a little alcove outside of the bathroom My only complaint There is only free wireless internet in the downstairs lobby and bar  You can buy it in your room but I ended up just going downstairs and sitting in the lobby  The bar seemed kind of weird with a sort of airportchain feeling even though it gets pretty crowded at night  
P => very nice would stay again very nice stay the staff was very friendly rooms clean bed was very comfortable   this hotel is within walking distance of a lot of places  would definately stay again  
P => Glad I picked this hotel I was very pleased with the Doubletree Metropolitan when I stayed in NYC  This is a very nice place  The or is fun Also this is an ideal location  The beds are very comfortable  I would recommend it to anyone  The staff is friendly  The facility is clean  I am not a very good traveler moslty because I am not fond of hotels in general but I am glad I picked this place  
P => 
P => A very trendy and cool hotel right in the heart on Manhatten  The hotel is in excellent location just a couple of blocks away from Broadway Time SquareI choose this hotel because of the cool pictures on their website  Altough it was not as cool as on the website the hotel still is very modern and stylish As I just used the hotel to sleep I can only give my opinions regarding my room and my impressions  I did not use any of the their facilities and also did not have the chance to experience either the restaurant and bar The room I booked was a standard room  It was very clean and stylish but a little small for my taste The bathroom is pretty ent and provides branded toiletries from LOccitaine As I almost never were in the hotel I cannot express myself to much about the staff  But the guy that brought my bags to my room was very friendly and helpful  The same guy escorted me when I departed  So my only interaction with the staff was basically just him As I mentioned earlier the location is just excellent you can reach anywhere in NY midtown by foot  There is also an undergorund station just outside the hotels entrance In my opinion the hotel is most suitable for younger crowd  Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Dream  
P => Stylish and perfectly located Very nice hotel modern stylish clean and friendly  The best is the location from our room we could look down Broadway to Times Square  There is a small wellness area and a cool bar on the top floor with a great view  
P => Total Rip Off Go Elsewhere I stayed there for one weekend and the experience was terrible  I couldnt sleep at night because there was so much noise coming from the AC the street outside and the paper thin walls  I woke up on both nights from hearing other guests fighting in the middle of the night  Says something about the type of people that stay there too The final blow was check out time when they charged me  extra on top of my bill for less than  min of phone calls i had made to friends in NYC Apparently they add a  connection fee WHICH IS NOT WRITTEN ANYWHERE  My talk time was only  min total  short conversations and then some voicemail messages i left This is not how to treat customers  Trashy place and poor value for money  I advise you stay elsewhere  
P => The Dream Hotel I loved the dream hotel but it wasnt a cozy type of hotel it was more like a modren hi tech sorta thing  
P => Totally satisfied I have absolutely no complaints regarding my stay at the Dream Hotel  We had a large room with a ent sized bathroom including large shower area lovely Loccitane products and an extremely comfortable bed that I can only describe as like sleeping on a shmallow Reception staff were friendly the bar was funky and the location just in between Times Square and Central Park  
P => Location Location Perfect location to Times Sq Central Park etc  Near a NYC Sightseeing bus stop  Clean and well appointed rooms  Helpful staff and a very good Italian restaurant on site  
P => Great location and roof bar This hotel is placed in the heart of Manhatten with a great bar on the roof but try and get a room at least  floors from the top because it gets noisy at night Great value for money and very trendy rooms with excellent interior orations The young receptionist we encountered was not very helpfull but the rest of the staff was great  
P => Hotel for Under  Clubbers My wife and I stayed there this past weekend  The positive ends with the location  This hotel has  clubs one on the lobby level and one in the penthouse  Room doors slam all night long with the club set going up and down to the party scene  If you under  and in NYC to party this is the hotel for you  If you plan on sleeping at night the Dream is a Nighte  
P => Great hotel I stayed here for  nights this month after reading some negative reviews i was a little worried but should not have been  On arrival the staff at the front desk were lovey they upgraded me to a larger room with  beds room  which was really nice  The hotel lobby is amazing with a massive tropical fish tank as a centre piece it really looks totally different from other hotels  The room itself was lovely  The beds were so comfortable it was actually like sleeping on a cloud The bathroom was great too and complimentary toiletries from Loccitane were a nice touch  Unlike other reviews I have read I heard no noise at all and had no problems with the lifts either  The lobby can get fairly busy with people waiting for lifts to the bar but it isnt enough to bother you The concierge was also great really helpful and very polite as were all the staff I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay somewhere with some personality and not just another chain hotel 
P => Great location great hotel I stayed at the Dream for five nights having booked through Priceline    per night  The room was a ent size but then I was travelling alone  New York City hotel rooms are small in any case and this was just fine  It was clean quiet my room looked out on rooftops of shops on th Avenue and wonderfully located with the subway on the doorstep Times Square a  minute walk and Central Park a couple of blocks away There was also free wireless internet service in the lobby although not in the room The only downside was that the lift could be slow at times   but otherwise it was fine Staff were friendly and helpful  
P => My bedroom closet is bigger than the room I had at Dream I enjoyed the stay at this hip property  Overall worked out fine with a caveat for room size   my bedroom closet is indeed bigger  
P => Better than expected       My teenaged dhter amp I booked  nights at Dream through Priceline  After doing so I became concerned after reading the reviews   especially about bed size  Sharing a double bed  be a little close for comfort unless its a newlywed couple I requested through email a different room configuration  twins or a queen sized bed and they would only do so for more cash   which sort of peeved me off  Anyhow we thought we would tough it out and give it a try Our first impression of the hotel was the friendly staff which is always nice after a long day of travelling and delayed flights etc  We were given room    which made me wonder if we were getting the quotPriceline Punishmentquot  I had read reviews about the street noise and noise from the main floor night club and wondered if this would be a nighte Turns out   we didnt hear a thing   other than a garbage truck one morning  The room was very quiet however if any staff are reading this   room  has a very big running toilet problem   after flushing it just keeps going    and going    The beds are very comfortable   and we were tired every day after a long day of sightseeing and walking   so we surprised ourselves by our ability to adapt to the small bed The rooms are tiny   but we were rarely there so that didnt matter We did not ask to have our towels cleaned every day   but they did them anyway  The location is outstanding   out of the crowded tacky over priced Times Square area by only a few blocks   very close to Central Park Columbas Circle and the Carnegie Deli We ate dinner at the Serafina twice and enjoyed it immensely Our  night experience was positive afterall  
P => the Dream was almost Great A spotlessly clean hotel in the middle of Manhattan  Two blocks south of Central Park near Carnegie Hall  Times Square is less than  blocks south  We got a great rate on Hotwire which gives it a  star rating a little high perhaps but very good value    We stayed  nites and could have used another small dresser  What the room lacked in size it made up for in quality The beds and linens are good quality and are very comfortable Ours was a double and a queen mattress would have been appreciated There is a mini bar and safe in the room  The bathroom is small but well stocked  There is a large HD television on the wall but an analogue converter so the picture quality could have been much better  In addition a digital HD converter allows the hotel to keep you updated and to sell additional PPV services they comped us a couple of drinks on arrival and then a breakfast when the AC acted up on the first nite  The staff were all helpful and courteous  The rooftop bar was a fun but expensive place  This is a boutique hotel with an understated Buddhist motif  It has a bluish white palate throughout the hotel  A large Buddhist sculpture at the back of the lobby provides a restful quiet place to relax  I understand that there is a spa at the hotel but did not see it  In the room a bible provides insight into the religion  Although I read a little and learned a little I did not achieve Enlightenment  That takes a lifetime Im writing this review more as a critique for the owners who are obviously trying very hard to make this a great hotel  i would not hesitate to recommend it  
P => Sweet Dreams at the Dream I stayed at the DREAM hotel in New York for two nights and highly recommend it  Its not always easy to find a ent hotel that isnt overly expensive  Dream is in a good location it has a friendly staff the rooms are clean and comfortable check in and check out were quick and overall Id say its a great value in NYC  I used Hotels com to make the reservation and went with their small room as I was by myself  It wasnt big but it was clean comfortable and had everything I needed e g  iron ironing board hair dryer and all the little bottles of shampoo etc  The AC worked great and I had absolutely no issues and I felt safe  Give it a try I think youll be pleased  
P => Accessible hip We recently held a meeting at the Dream for some clients and they were incredibly easy to deal with  When the cab pulled up and I saw a bunch of hipsters smoking outside I was a little worried but all my fears of having to deal with a lot of attitude were unfounded  You can tell this is an older hotel with a recent facelift but theyve focused on comfort and convenience  The bed was amazing with a fluffy duvet on a pillowtop mattress  Yes the room was small but its New York  The staff is exceedingly friendly and energetic if a bit green  We loved the  story fishtank in the lobby  Warning dont stay here if you cant tolerate incense  Also Internet access is wireless only which caused a problem for one member of our party  
P => Boutique chich but pricey Stayed her after a few days work in NY in     great location couple of blocks from Central Park and times square  chich bar   very NY and rooms were cute but VERY small                           so if you want a hotel for a base only to see the sights then you could pay a third of hte price and probably get a bigger room but more blocks back in manhattan  ideal for sight seeing reception efficient and polite very clean nice big red rosey apples on your pillow and fab french tioletries but the bathroom     no bath just showersinkloo no bigger than my home downstairs loobar upstairs played good music with dj   pricey drinks cira us per jd and coke                        and lots of freaky dancers but good atmosphere                     recommend if you can afford   per night and you liek a bit of ambience                 and somethign a bit different               as I say ideal location  
P => Ideal Location I too got this hotel stay from Priceline and was very concerned after reading all the reviews prior to coming for our stay  The location of this hotel is very ideal  We never had to take a taxi or subway the whole time we were here because we were within blocks of Times Square and Central Park  Make sure you park in a parking garage that has an agreement with the hotel in order to get their  daily rate  We could have sworn the bell hop told us that we could park in the garage up the street and the front desk even put a sticker on our parking garage ticket  However the next morning when we went to get our car the gentleman at the garage said they didnt have an agreement with the hotel and we had to pay  instead  We knew we wouldnt get a very large room or bed from the posts we had read so we had already prepared ourselves  We did get a handicapped room on the th floor which was a little larger we were told and was rather quiet  The beds are really comfortable  Our bathroom wasnt the cleanest  There was hair on the floor and I did see a few small insects of some sort  We really liked their sample of shower gel  Oh and they have robes for you to wear while you are there  Also we received  complimentary beverage coupons from their bar when we checked in  Just a little bonus   always nice We never had to wait very long for the elevators  Everyone was very nice to us the whole time we were there  I think alot of it has to do with what you go there expecting    I felt that I definitely got what I paid for  There are hotels that you can pay  times what I paid and still not get all your looking for so I feel we definitely got a bargain and I would definitely go backwith spending what I did and getting as much as I did out of it  I would definitely go back 
P => Pleasantly Surprised First time Ive stayed here  And Im always a little leary of the cool NYC hotel The elevators are small and old  Considering that I would suggest staying on the st floor      although its really the nd floor  Why So that after youve taken luggage up you can use the stairs and bypass the elevators until check out Beds are incredible  Bathroom nice and livable  Not big by any means but no complaints here  quot plasma on the wall adequate space around one side of the bed Didnt eat here     but then its NYC why would IBlue neon affect lighting and a  degree temperature room greeted me  NICE Ill be back  
P => Most comfortable bed Ive ever slept in I just returned from a weekend trip to NY  I was traveling with my son and his girlfriend  We booked our room on priceline and was quite suprised at the room we got  The Dream hotel is in a perfect location  We were able to convienantly travel around the city from here  We were given a room on the th floor with  double beds  It was a large room by NY standards  The bedding was white and the softest Ive ever slept in  The room was emaculant  I dont think Ive ever stayed in a cleaner hotel room  We all slept very well  The room was so quiet that it was hard to believe you were in the city that never sleeps  The staff was excellent and very accomidatingI will absolutely stay here again 
P => Really Noise I stay in this hotel for  days    The room is really small and the bathroom is really really old e poor  I stay in the Th Floor and the noise is unbearable    there was a big AC machine close to the windows Is you stay there make sure you are above th floor  
P => Dreamy Went to NYC for a show romantic weekend and to celebrate our birthdays  At check in we were upgraded to a suite  Two bathrooms large bedroom and quotliving roomquot  Corner room with great views  Bed was wonderful  Apples on our pillows were a nice touch in the Big Apple Blue lights were fun and different  The aquarium in the lobby was amazing Enjoyed the rooftop bar very much  Yana was a great little waitress and Heather events manager was very nice  Who would have thought you could get a  hamburger or hot dog in NYC at a roof top bar Or have comped drinks Featured drink made with cucumber amp TyKu was very refreshing and light for a warm afternoon before going to dinner amp show  We stayed on the th floor and the bar was quite busy Saturday night as evidenced by the line for the elevators one reserved for hotel guests only so this was not a problem and noise was not an issue  Location was very good Central Park restaurants theater all close by   short walk or short taxi ride  Front desk and bellman very helpful and friendly  All in all a wonderful place to stay in the city and would return  
P => Better than expected Based on the rather mixed reviews on Tripadvisor and other forums I have been quite sceptical about this hotel but as we made a good deal through our travel agent we hoped for the best   and find it better than expected  Lucky us we get a quotlargerquot room in the th floor on the backside of the hotel which means no street noise and no sound from the bar and the rooftop which is a good place with a nice view in the evening  Comfortable queen bed solid bathroom space to store our luggage incl  a wheelchair good flatscreen and Bose radio   nothing to complain about  The blue lighting of the room   well   if you liked Miami Vice  years ago you might find this enjoyable  Friendly and quick responding doormen and reception crew had a little issue with the safe which took only  min between first call and problem solving  In addition they warned us about the sensible sensor of the minibar which might lead to charges even without taking anything   nice move Onsite Italian restaurant Serafina is ok ish  Downsides Not that many   except the wireless fee which is ridiculous these days when you get access anywhere else for free If you like Central Park Columbus Circle and the uptown museums like the NAD this place is to be recommend if you get a good deal  If not check for some of the standard tourist hotels in midtown which are a better bargain  
P => Chic  downtown  feel in midtown Stayed here for one night with friends for my th birthday  Hotel was clean staff was friendly and attentive  The or is modern and sophisticated  Bathrooms are small but clean and updated  We had  rooms and everyone loved the beds   super comfortable  Because we only stayed for one night we didnt require a lot of storage however if you are staying for more than one night you  find that there isnt enough dresser space  All in all a great birthday 
P => A Dream come true This trip was a birthday present for my husband  and it was a dream for me  this hotel is a dream come true  the room is amazing  service amazing  staff excellent    i must thank all the staff for helping on the surprise i made for my husband    i defenatly recommendthis hotel to a friend or famaly  actualy i already did it    
P => Cool place good location The location of this hotel is quite good you are very close to Central Park and Columbus Circus right next to a subway station with fast trains to Down Town and Time Square is not far either for the newest shows in town Staff is young and friendly  The room service quite different they focus on Pizza which is a nice change and it probably reflects the fact that rather young people would stay in this hotel  The lobby reminds almost of a night club with an aquarium right in the middle  The whole hotel is quite dark too  There are  bars perfect for quota last onequot before going to bed  The rooms are rather small but comfortable   and after all you are not in New York to spend much time in your hotel room  The room rates for ok too so good value for money here 
P => Stay away I just dont understand the other reviews on this place  Ive stayed in hotels in NYC for  years easily over a dozen different places and I cant remember one this bad  The hotel employees were not especially the issue some were great and others obviously had no direction or initiative  It was the building and it was mainly form over function  The AC units in each room and I had five rooms were all individual units and were entirely enclosed within each room  they were loud  We all opened our windows and had to turn off the AC  Luckily the evenings were cool  And there was no full length mirror in any room  Furthermore for families please be forwarnd that there is erotic art on the walls and statues in the hallways  Its by no means obscene however its specific and from what I could see is advertising this hotel as a sex hotel for couples and very short stays  We were all there for four nights and the price was right with priceline however I would never chose this on my own  
P => A real dream much more than could be expected This was the most pleasant stay in a New York hotel in more than  years of yearly visits far better than its place in the popularity index would suggest  There is something there for everyone on every type of stay  So much has been said about it that I shall restrict myself to a few pointers  If you come for more than four days or are on a New York stopover in a long journey you must take the largest room available otherwise there is not enough room to store your luggage  You can ask for the minibar to be emptied this gives you a fridge for your needs  Also if the very soft mattress is too soft you can ask room service to remove the top layer what remains is a firm mattress still very comfortable  The hotel provides breakfast however if you like to start lightly in the morning on Broadway there is a Starbucks just a few steps away many guests do carry trays to their rooms  More nourishing fare is available at the Caf  Europa two blocks up Seventh Avenue right opposite Carnegie Hall  And for daily snacks in the room there is a superket on the corner of th Street and Broadway  Read what other correspondents have said about the noise but if you like the clubbing and dancing scene there is plenty of action on the roof during weekends with careful screening and ID checking by security guards downstairs to prevent minors and undesirables from entering  For relaxation there is a Spa based mainly on ancient Indian remedies  So we wish all of you as good a time as we had    Amosh Jerusalem 
P => Totally Dreamy What a beautiful sexy hotel From the minute you walk in you know you are some place special  The staff is over the top friendly and helpful  The rooms are amazing we had a suite and it was huge by Manhattan standards  The ethereal glow of the place made for very sweet dreams  I highly recommend this hotel for a special time in NY  If you are looking for something unique look no further  
P => A bargain in the right location with a great staff and a very nice hotel The Dream Hotel is on the corner of th and Broadway  It has a restaurant with street side dinning on Broadway  The address is  West th  From here you are a short walk to th Avenue shopping or Time Square madness There is a bar on the th floor as well as rooftop k with a great view that gets pretty lively and a club like lounge off the lobby that heats up late  Beer at any of the three was  Every staff member I encountered was friendly helpful and sincere  The hotel is well kept clean modern and everything worked  I had the smallest room available  There was a large LCD TV and a built in desk  WiFi is  per day and worked reliably  This is a well reated older building and as such the rooms are small  The bathrooms are very small  If you are looking for a large room and spacious bath look elsewhere  I thought the rate was very fair for a hotel of this caliber in this location  I stayed during a holiday weekend  The rate for Friday was  plus tax and Saturday was  The spa was great  I had a very good Ayurvedic massage  
P => Small SMALL rooms and lots of NOISE Pretty hotel in nice location but rooms are very small and the windows do not keep the noise out of the rooms  I stayed in  rooms first room on th floor had LOUD turbine noise from the AC system on the ground floor  They moved me to the quotquietquot side on the th floor but I still heard the turbine plus new noises from the ground floor and the bar on the th floor  I dont mind small rooms in NY as I work in NY about  times a year but these rooms are smaller than most other hotels you can barely walk around the bed One positive is Serafina restaurant off lobby  Excellent breakfast not cheap but outstanding and be the best pizza outside Naples  
P => Loved the Dream I spent  nights at The Dream hotel  I got a fantastic deal through price line night but was worried about the negative reviews  Here are some random observations and thoughts I arrived in NY at  am and called to see if I could check in early  They said they were full but I could drop off my luggage and pre register  I didnt end up doing that but got there at  and was able to check in then  I had leis shipped for a graduation I was attending and they were delivered before I arrived  I asked if there was a refrigerator I could use overnight  The woman at the desk said there was a minibar in the room and that they could empty that for me so I could have room for the leis  I thought that was great The room was very small  It was fine for just me but If my husband were with me it would have been too small  The bed was a full size there was a dresser with two drawers and a small refrigerator a closet with iron and ironing board and a small desk with an outlet on top Loved that convenience  The bathroom was also small be tiny with a half tub The TV is a flat screen mounted to the wall  There was about  inches between the end of the bed and the wall  I peeked in a few other rooms in passing and Im pretty confident mine was the smallest  The bed is tall enough that I was able to slide my suitcase under it to save space There was no view just a building  There was a privacy blind that did bring in some natural light  I think the lighting was a bit dark  The bathroom had a magnified mirror but still the light wasnt very good The bed was heaven  That alone will make be go back It had a feather top pad and fluffy pillows with a soft comforter  Loved itService was outstanding I forgot toothpaste and they brought some up right away  I started my period early and wasnt prepared  I called down and supplies were delivered  I wanted a glass of wine and the two bars were super crowded and LOUD and a gentleman at the desk got a glass for me and I was able to drink it in the lobby while talking on the phone  The housekeepers were very nice  Im not sure if it was because I was expecting rudeness but the service was just superb  Plus they emptied the minibar The hotel is very trendy and has a few popular clubs but even though I am pushing  It wasnt obnoxious  This hotel would be perfect for young people who partyThe location was fantastic  Wireless internet is about day  Next time I visit NYC I hoe to take my children so I dont think I would stay here unless they have suites but If I happen to visit again I would stay here  The bed was a dream 
P => Great Location This hotel is in the midst of it all  I booked it as part of a sexy weekend out with my boyfriend  We dined at Amalia and then spent the night dancing in the Ava Lounge  The hotel was beautiful and trendy and we were able to sneak a peek into the gorgeous Chopra Center located downstairs  The staff was very friendly a house keeper actually helped me sow myself into my dress when it broke as I was on my way out to eat dinner There is so much to do at the Dream Hotel Yes Ill admit the rooms arent perfect but with all the things you can do outside why would you sit in the room 
P => Excellent Hotel  Freindly Staff Im suprised by the nagative comments regarding the staff at the Dream Hotel  They couldnt have been nicer to my girllfriend and I  We arrived at  am on a Saturday and inquired about dropping off our bags so we could walk around Central Park  The staff let us know that are room was already ready for check in  She also gave us drink tickets for the bar next door  Very good location  Two blocks to the park and right at the Northern edge of the Theatre District  From my second floor view I could see the Ed Sullivan Theatre  While the room was on the small side I would definitely stay here again  Excellent or and penthouse lounge also 
P => Great Hotel to Sleep In We stayed for one night at this hotel and I can only say positive things about it  The Front Desk was actually very nice to us and didnt mind us checking in early so we could drop off some bags in our room and begin exploring New York  This location is great for that  The rooms were very clean and the beds sheets and towels were all soft and comfortable  The rooms basically consisted of just a bed and desk but it did have a nice flat screen tv  All we basically used our room for was just to sleep and shower so if thats all you need it for then its perfect  If you plan on staying in your room all day then it could make you feel a little claustrophobic  For us though wed rather see whats outside than stay inside  
P => Dream   Nice Concept Uneven Execution I used Priceline for a  star hotel for two adults and got the Dream at a very good price  per night  Unfortunately the Dream has rooms with only full sized beds and the Priceline room is assigned to these  I am at elite levels in several programs and at no time in all my travels except at National Parks have I ever seen full sized beds deemed adequate for two adults as I had requested from Priceline  The Dream front desk staff was among the most rude that I have experienced especially at at a hotel of this level  I have used Priceline before and have been treated as a valuesd customer  The Dream front desk staff treated me like as someone not deserving  Eventually I was able to quotupgradequot to a queen room for two adults at  additional per night  The rooms were funky like a W Hotel and the fresh apple with turn down service was a nice touch  LOccitane amenties are nice also  The location couldnt be better     on Broadway only two blocks from Times Square and a few blocks from Central Park and a subway stop only a few steps to the east  The concierge staff were friendly and helpful in contrast with the front desk For a single traveler this hotel is tremendous and with Priceline a tremendous value  
P => Great location Great location hotel very good service but   little expensive 
P => Great location fantastic bed customer service wasnt the best We stayed for  nights at Dream I will list the pros and cons belowPros Concierge was very good The bed in the room was really soft and large  Location is superb nice and close to Times square but not too noisy  There were some nice quirly design touches in the hotel that made it interesting the lighting was cool also Cons Reception staff were a bit rude on our departure the rooms are slightly on the small side but probably average for NYC  The maids did not obey the do not disturb sign Overall I would reccomend especially for a romantic getaway  
P => Sooo Nice  This hotel is in a great location in Manhattan  You are right in the center of everything  The rooms are very cool and I would definately get a suite if you could afford it  Overall I loved the hotel and I would definately recommend it  Dana New York 
P => Great location Had just a quick business trip for  nights and loved the Dream  Had stayed several years before it changed to Dream and I have to say that the upgrades are fab  Very good location and great service  I d return in a minute  
P => Cool Hotel Cool hotel  Great location  Nice roof top bar with great cocktails  
P => Great Location Great Location the location is on th Avenue rd Street a perfect location for everything  The room booked was quite small with a small bed  Modern with great amenities  You can see Times Square from the end of the road and the Top Bar  Central park short walk away The staff were helpful everything was very clean  It was not cheap but this is Manhattan Book if you want a great location walking distance to Times Square amp the Park  Also a subway at the end of the block  
P => Just the perfect Hotel in Manhattan After reading the reviews I was in a mixed mind whether to book  In the end I just did and stayed between th and th ember   The location is on th Avenue rd Street a perfect location for everything  The room booked was a large room which was fantastic modern with great amenities and great toiletries  Starbucks right on the corner and right round the corner from the famous carnegie hall and carnegie deli  You can see Times Square from the end of the road and central park to the north  The staff where very helpful the bar cool and everything just great It was not cheap but this is Manhattan and that is what is expected I gather  Book this hotel if you want a great location walking distance to Macys Saks Times Square all the favourites with a subway literally across the road  Just brilliant 
P => Excellent Location The Dream Hotel is ideally located in New York City  The staff are excellentit is spotless and we will certainly return  
P => Artsy Boutique Hotel My Fiance booked two rooms at the Dream one for ourselves and another for my friend and her husband  When I looked through the travelers photos on tripadvisor I was discouraged and wanted to change the reservations but I am glad we did not  If your looking for a boring hotel with no appeal there are many to be found Dream is trendy sort of South Beach Miami style the small rooms are tiny clean great bathroom lighting for applying makeupnot florescent and super comfortable soft duvet and bed  If your going to NY to spend a lot of time in your room dont rent a small one it is cozy for two without a lot of space for luggage  We left our suitcases with the bellman downstairs and left NY without one of our bags  I called a few hours later and the bag was tagged this was on Sunday I received my bag by Monday morning in Houston free of charge  I commend the Dream for great customer service and you cant beat the location  We also had breakfast at Serafina and the food was very good  
P => Hated my dreams I should have taken the recommendation from my co worker to stay at the Tribeca Grand Hotel  Well I had the honor to pay  a night wo tax for a room on the th floor  The good   when I brushed my teeth it wasnt a far walk from the corner of the bed to the sink in the bathroom  I just wish the bathroom door wouldnt have hit the sink when opened  My other coworkers bathroom door hit the toilet when opened so I should feel lucky  The front desk and concierge staff were not very polite  They did do their job though The bad  I was placed on the th floor which is below the nightclub and the dance floor  I got to hear the bass beat and the floor shake all night  In addition the elevators sounded as they were going to plummet to the center of the earth  I might have had a better night sleep snuggling with Lucifer actually that my wifes name and I was on a work trip  Am I exaggerating No this is all this true and I am happy to be home  I would recommend the Drake or Weston at Times Square over the Dream  
P => Great location nice hotel We stayed ember     in Dream Hotel  The location is perfect close to Time Square and Central Park Nice hotel with nice rooms  We stayed in a Kingbed room wich was not really King but ok Concierge is a really good help for any questions  I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is in the city to discover NYC 
P => Not what it seems After staying at the Dream this past weekend it is difficult to understand where the  star reviews have come from  Do not mistake yourself into thinking that this is a good value alternative to the Hudson or W hotels  You want to spend time in these hotels this one you do not  The overall standard just simply isnt there from the dark tired lobby to the understaffed and poorly trained front desk  This general feeling seemed to exist with other guests in the elevator we had two unsolicited conversations calling the hotel quota dumpquot and quotseedyquot which is be a bit harsh  On the positive side the bed is comfortable shower good and the Chopra spa which is arate from the hotel has unique and great treatments  The location is convenient but you are not going to feel too special walking through that poky lobby and squeaky front door each morning  There are better alternatives in the same neighbourhood  
P => Fantastic Weekend Base in NYC I stayed at the Dream Hotel with my boyfriend for a weekend back in ruary We spent ages trying to find an affordable stylish hotel and eventually found a great deal at the Dream hotel on ebookers  Even without this deal I would highly recommend the hotel  The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly  It was raining one day and reception lent me an umbrella  We wanted a quick burger on our last day before we went to the airport and the girl behind the reception desk recommended an amazing place just around the corner from the hotel The reception area is really beautiful with big gold thrones fish tanks and statues   its OTT but cool and stylish  Our room was a standard room and pretty compact but more than big enough for our needs  Amazingly comfy bed big flat screen TV with a variety of channels cool radio fluffy bathrobes and plenty of storage space  I love the way the beds are lit from underneath very coolThe location was fantastic we could wander to central park in about  minutes and theres a jazz club not far away in the Lincoln Center which everyone should go to   Dizzys Coca Cola Club  Its so easy to get a taxi outside and then just a short hop to anywhere youd want to go All in all a really fantastic base for an amazing weekend in NYC 
P => Dream a big dream at Dream Stayed at Dream for a weekend  Loved the service eye for detail and location  Staff was extremely helpful  Lunch at Serafina facial at spa drinks at Ava lounge  Stellar weekend  Room was comfy clean and the bed was a cloud  Highly recommend staying there and will go back  
P => Great Hotel Just returned from a  night stay in the Dream Hotel NYC  Couldnt fault anything  Stayed in a large room with  double beds  Room was big and airy  Location of hotel is excellent  First time to NYC and wouldnt hesitate returning and staying in this hotel  Unfortunatelly terrace bar was shut but enjoyed the views of the city from the Penthhouse bar  Staff were friendly and helpful  
P => Good Location Great location and cool hotel  I found the staff to be nice at the desk and I liked the apples at turndown  The rooms are very small even for New York however I wasnt in it for very long so didnt really make a difference to me  I would stay here again  
P => Great location and Clean This hotel was so close to everything and if it wasnt the subway was about  blocks away  Time Square is right there  To walk out of the hotel and to the corner and see it is amazing The room we stayed in was very big  It was so quiet and so clean The bed was great The bathroom was big  We only had a shower which was fine for us  There is a nightclub on the top level but we stayed on the rd floor and heard nothing  Some reviews mentioned the elevator wait we took the stairs  There is another place to have drinks off the main lobby  They do not offer a cont  breakfast but across the street is a diner  Went there every morning  I dont have one bad thing to say about our experience at this hotel  I would stay again and again   The aquarium in the lobby is soo cool 
P => sweet dreams The only bad think about this hotel are the rooms on the first floor the noise polloution was horrendous from our first room they changed our room as soon as we asked and the rest of our stay was spot on The beds are so comfortable and we only stayed in a basic double bed  The location is the best   min walk toTimes Square and Broadway which is a good idea to be just out side so you can escape the hustle and bustle  The rooms are small but they have everything you need they are clean and modern  Girls be warned GHD Straighteners dont work in the states But the very best think about this hotel is the rooftop bar  The cocktails dont come cheap i suppose youre paying for the fantstic view  I would deffinetly recomed this hotel for couples friends etc probably not for families  
P => dream hotel   not quite a dream So let me start with the pros of the dream hotel    overall I would call this a   star hotel for NYC   Really nice large flat panel TVs in the rooms  Great to watch and a good space saver since the rooms are tiny  Very clean especially rhe bathrooms  Excellent location at th and Broadway   so a great jumping off spot for both central park and times square  Fun and hip feel on the inside  Apples on the pillows   nice  Great toiletries   soaps etc all great qualityCons  Slightly snotty staff  The tiniest room you can image   even small for NYC  Even the elevator is so small my luggage could barely fit in the door   Is built around a huge air duct which is running all the time and is noisy  I got a room on the second floor and it was unbearable  I didnt sleep a wink  I had to change rooms  Most hotels would be apologetic  They acted like they were doing me a favor  Moved to the th floor and was still slightly noisy   Uncomfortable beds   and smaller than a normal queen for sure  I am quot and I was hitting the end  Just hard beds   Way overpriced hotel hotel bar and spa   even for NYC   Housekeeping knocked on my door all the time for no reason    Weird NYC crowd at the roof bar Overall   it was too small too snotty and not that nice for how much I paid  There are SO many hotels in new york   pick another one like the westin times square the W etc  
P => Good location average room price This hotel is close to Central Park Rockefeller Center and the exclusive designer stores  The hotel has an attempt to be a luxury hotel with reasonable prices  They have a spa gym and restaurant  Our room was comfortable and clean  Yes there is a blue neon light under the glass desk and under the bed edge  I guess thats their chic touch personally I didnt like it much  Our room had a quot LCD TV hanged on the wall and a Bose radio  The bathroom was clean but to compliment hotel image they should replace the shower tiles and accessories as they were rusted  They also offered bathrobes turned over your bed and instead of chocolates a sweet healthy delicious red apple We stayed on room  right above Serafina Restaurant on Broadway  It was a little noisy due to the traffic and restaurant but we were so tired that we slept thru the night  Staff is very helpful and nice Front desk concierge bellboy housekeeper everyone The restaurant is expensive though  For  ravioli dishes  glasses of sangria and complimentary focaccia bread we paid   The next morning we had breakfast at Apple Jacks across the street on Broadway like a Dennys restaurant  Hearty cheaper breakfast I loved their soap and shower gel from LOccitane Overall the service was good and considering other hotel prices in midtown Manhattan I would stay here again but I would ask for a room above the th floor  
P => Very hip Ive been to New York a couple of times and most of the hotels were very expensive and of very poor quality  This one was a pleasant surprise   the rooms were well made with nice lighting wonderful bed and great shower the location is right next to central park and metro station  They even give you apples every evening  On the downside it is quite expensive and room service has a thing for waking you up at    am  I tried to find a Dont disturb sign somewhere but without much luck Overall this is a great hotel especially for business stay as it has high speed internet in the room for free  
P => Dream More like a Nighte Do NOT stay at the Dream Booked a room on Quickbook for  Pros On checking in front desk staff was very nice  Same on checking out  Bed was very comfortable Cons NOISE  I stayed on the th Street side of the hotel  All night long there was a huge amount of construction garbage collection and road noise  Right outside the hotel there is a sewer cover on the road that doesnt fit right so it makes a loud noise every time a car goes over it which in NYC is about ever two seconds  Also lots of noise in the hall   doors slamming maids talking and wandering every little thing can be heard through the thin doors  And every half hour or so the air conditioning made a really loud noise for no apparent reason since it didnt really cool the room for the first  hours SIZE The room was tiny barely bigger than the bed  Seriously  Like a bed surrounded by a one foot moat of old dirty carpet QUALITY Form the elevators ot the bathroom to the desk to the closet this is clearly a really old hotel that has been superficially spruced up to look cool at first glance  Unlike the W chain and other boutiques this is more like a coat of paint and some neon lights than it is a true quality upgrade SERVICE Other than checking in and out front desk staff was unresponsive unknowledgeable and generally unhelpful  When I asked to change rooms I was denied  When I asked to leave after two hours of no sleep I was told the noise would go away it did not in fact it got worse around  am and that I would be charged if I left  I almost left anyway btu fell for the promise of more quiet which didnt come through PARKING We gave the hotel the key to our car to valet which costs  by the way and the car stayed on the street half double parked for more than  minutes  Each time we asked why we were told it would be parked safely within minutes FINAL DETAILS The htoel is right near a couple of clubs so the street can be loud and busy but at least goof people watchingIve stayed in be  NY hotels other than a Best Western when i was in college that doesnt even exist anymore this was my least favorite by a mile  
P => Dream   more like a nighte Good Stuff  Location   very near Central park great for early morning jogsRooms   ok size for NYBad stuff  No limo picked us up at airport as request promised free limo on way backOnly  rooms available out of the three booked and with booking reference numbers eventually sorted another one out Blue light in room couldnt be switched off so couldnt sleep properlyAir con constantly blowing out cold air again couldnt switch offEventually with all the hassle and complaint we got upgraded to suite for the last couple of nights which was nice Rooftop bar   friday  saturday nights so busy it was a hassle getting an elevator   attitude from staff    so busy it wasnt worth staying for Everyone in the concierge seems to be called Sean so whenever something went wrong it was always another Sean quotthat we must have spoken to  quotBuilding work on building across the road all night long apparently allowed in NY because of traffic issues Limo arrived to take us back to airport for  people and  big suitcases which we had repeatedly told them about but still needed  cars  Argued with them for  hour until eventually they agreed to pay for two cars Various other issues and problems and attitude from staff but qutie a while ago so memory not great  All in all a dreadful experience  AVOID at all costs  
P => Rooms like a nightclub  Got your collar poppedThe Dream is in a good location but it seems overpriced for what it is  The Good Highly stylizedThe Bad Local well to do kids taking over the rooftop bar and sneaking in the under aged ones with them Money speaks here  If you are a guest you do not get a seat on the roof if a local with a new haircut arrives with cash I was blinded by the fact that the Chopra Spa was here  Thinking if a center for meditation is here it should be a bit spa  like but it is not It is like an overpriced nightclub that you can sleep in  Interesting experience though  
P => Great Experience It s safe to say that we no bad experiences during a recent  night stay at Dream over the y th holiday   The reservation process was easy and friendly  The operator was full suggestions but obviously this function is outsourced so the operator knew little of the small details about the hotel or the room  But he was very friendly and helpful overall  We booked an extra extra large suite and the reservation was ready and accurate when we arrived around pm  I mentioned our anniversary when making the reservation and they noted that during check in no champagne or flowers though LOL  We also asked for a suite away from the top floors because of the rooftop bar and they complied TIP You can pull up right in front of the hotel  Someone will assist with bags and then deliver your car to a parking garage on Fifth Avenue or so they said  Parking fee is added right to the bill   You can t get the car out without paying but why would you want to Public transportation is abundant and convenient The location of the hotel is perfect  blocks north to Columbus Circle and Central Park four blocks south to Times Square and lots of stuff to the west and east  The subway is confusing but the grid pattern of the city is easy to get used to  Prepare to walk a lot  Right down the street Broadway is an excellent little caf    Europa  Good for morning tea and lunch nibbles  There s also a Starbucks two doors down  At no time did we feel unsafe in NYC no matter where we ventured within Manhattan  I m sure there are places you shouldn t go but we stayed to the busy populated areas The room was exactly as described th floor  Immaculate clean nice soft robes arate bathrooms excellent shampoo and soaps The blue neon lights really make the room a different experience  And what they say about the bed is true   it s SUPER comfortable  Outside noise imposed on us just one night but the next nights were relatively quiet  There s no bleed over from room to room as far as we could tell TIP Careful with the mini bar  If so much as remove a bottle or snack to look at it the bar code automatically charges the item to your room  A slight complaint   no fridge room for water and there s no ice or vending machines in the hotel   you need to call room service   which means at least a tip Each room has two flat screen TVs and two Bose radios  The water pressure in the shower was excellent and there was never a shortage of hot water  Air conditioning worked fine and was quiet for the most part The concierge was always helpful and had maps and recommendations  The staff was friendly and unobtrusive  The housekeepers were pretty much invisible and did a good job  Checkout went smoothly and we called about  minutes in advance to have the car delivered to the front door The hotel was generally clean and well kept and we didn t notice any of the ks and dirt that other reviewers have noted  Perhaps it depends on the room you get It sounds like the smaller rooms on the lower floors need some attention but I can t verify or comment The elevators are not as slow as others have noted but they are a bit busier at night  The rooftop bar is a great experience  The first floor bar is very trendy and seems to turn into a dance club later in the evening  We only had breakfast from the restaurant outside and it was good but slightly cold because of the outdoors   a small trade off for the view TIP Drinks are expensive  We were paying  for a bottle of beer and   for an Absolut and cranberry  This  be normal depending on where you came from but for us it was expensive  The drinks are ample and well made but compared to home they were expensive  Didn t stop us though Although it  be expensive to stay at Dream rounds out to about  per night for the ex ex large suite  parking it was worth every cent  
P => Just Ok My husband and I were looking to stay in NY after a business function of his  We wanted a room less than   Lobby is great looks relatively swanky like many other boutique hotels  As soon as i got into the elevator I could tell the upkeep on the rest of the hotel wouldnt be so nice  Our room on the st floor looked ok upon opening the door but once the light was on i could see the dingy carpeting extremely nicked up walls and floorboards and kinda skeevy bathroom  the bed was nice and the rest of the furniture ok  with the exception of the pleather chair with green pen ks all over it  Staff was nice didnt check out the bars but it wasnt too noisy so we slept fine  I wouldnt stay here to have a lavish upscale hotel experience but it was fine for our  night stay  NYC hotels are overpriced but for  this one was just ok  
P => Not very impressed i was not very impressed with the dream hotel especially in light of its hefty price tag  I was treated very poorly by the desk check in with multiple problems arising from my booking through hotels com  Although my payment went through and credit card was charged the Dream hotel claimed that my receipt served to only reserve the room entirely ludicrous  After over an hour with the manager i was finally able to stay  The hotel has a modern look however the oration is entirely limited to the lobby area and a well placed saltwater aquarium  The rest of the hotel floor to floor has a very cheap modern theme that disappoints  The rooms are very small as expected in new york but are additionally very old which becomes very apparent in the bathroom  The room itself is relatively ok with an LCD TV and a comfortable bed however the neon lighting under the bed and desk simply destroys the atmosphere i usually am not one to write reviews but i was particularly disappointed with this facility especially given their higher price tag  They essentially have oversold a product albeit very efficiently through their well designed website and extensive lobby  A riot would be a cheaper and frankly more satisfying choice  
P => Mod Chic and a Bit Tiny If you would like to stay mid town near the theatre district and you like mod trendy little hotels this might be all right for you  The rooms are tiny but modly appointed  Everything is dimly lit and sleek looking  I would not recommend this for business travellers necessarily or for families at all but this could be good for someone just looking for a hip little place to stay  The bed was comfortable and there was just one huuuge picture on the wall but everything was definitely tidy and white  Expensive but then so are most places mid town  Also   not exactly a quiet area but thats mid town 
P => Great rooftop bar Great big statue of Buddha in the lobby and an ayuvedic spa in the basement this is a hotel with added extras  The rooms have been reated but to be honest some of the finishing is a bit lacking  The lifts were constantly going on the blinkBut the rooftop bar is very cool with a great view down Broadway and as a resident they gave us a table immediately despite all the Friday evening crowd  
P => Never again  Arrived in NY late and found Dream with no problem  Couldnt pull up to the door for Valet so we parked down the strret and my husband went to find the valet who said just leave it there and he will get it   Lugged our luggage to the desk and checked in that went pretty smoothly got to our room on the th floor right by the elevator which I asked not to be by and the room was the size of a postage stamp with no window  Called the desk and they said sorry nothing until Friday  days away  Went to bed since it was late and the next morning talked with a manager who said she could move us to a room with a window th floor by the elevator  Came back after broadway show and because of the bar on the th floor could not get in any of the three elevators due the crowd waiting to go up  My husband and I climbed  floors of stairs to get to our room around  pm  All night long you could hear people stuck in the elevators ringing the bell  The elevators broke down through out our trip  med  elevator and two small ones  At  am that same night a bell man knocked on our door and said he had our ash trays I explained I didnt call for ash trays and this was a non smoking hotel manager claims hotel just turned non smoking and he must of been confused that same morning at  am the cleaning lady didnt even knock and barged in  Bathroom was dirty   mold in grout  I couldnt wait to get home so I could rest    Great location but for a preferred hotel it needs a lot of help    sorry hotel dream   
P => No CHANCE of dreaming over all the noise I have got a little good and a lot of bad    Stayed in a small room for one night  The room and bathroom were incredibly tiny even by new york standards at the price point it was at about   This aside the location is great the pizza from room service was yummy the bed was super comfy the blue light thing was mildly amusing and the tv and bose sound system was great  Unfortunately this is all the positives I have to say about the hotel  I was placed on the th floor heard on here from other reviewers about similar experiences and was told the lounge is upstairs and there might be some slight noise  This was the BIGGEST under statement I have ever heard  Not only was the music blaring to the point where you could make out the words clearly the picture on the wall was shaking i kid you not and the sound of footsteps on the upstairs k was booming  Look Im in my twenties go to bed pretty late and noise generally does not bother me but this was ridiculous  It was impossible to sleep until around  AM when the noise stopped  There obviously is a soundproofing issue and I just am baffled how they have rooms on this level  Staff was ok    upon my arrival the doorman whos job was presumably to open the door was standing there chatting with another staff member and made no attempt to open the door even as I arrived with my bags this happened each time I entered the hotel and while I am more than capable of entering a building on my own this left a pretty bad first impression  As I went up to my room the tiny tiny hallway was blocked by the housekeeping cart as two of the housekeeping staff chatted in the open door to the room next to mine cleaning nothing and made no attempt to move the cart as I barely squeezed by into my room  Just was not what I would expect from the type of hotel Dream says itself to be  Parts of the room were worn down and needed revamping ex the side tables had large chips of veneer missing and the window shades were stained   yucky The hallways and elevators were in similar states and certainly need revamping  Another slightly irritating thing is I checked on dreams hotel site through reservations and saw that there were small and medium rooms available    ish  I generally like to call and talk to an agent directly so I called reservations to reserve one of those types of rooms  Upon calling the reservation agent insisted that the only room they had available was a suite at around   I hung up thinking wow those rooms go fast and for some reason checked on the website again immediately after getting off the phone and found the small and med rooms still available booked this online    and what do you know the room was there for me and available when I arrived  Just an odd thing that should have warned me before I even got there  While not terrible I put this experience just slightly above terrible and will not return to this hotel again  
P => Dream ing I stayed elsewhere Dream is beautifully outfitted and everytime the elevator opens you get treated to some artful nude photography  I had a suite consisting of living room br and  full baths  Turn lights out for blue neon illumination and it looks pretty but to be honest the staff NEVER smiled and looked like they were just irritated  the concierge had limitedunoriginal restaurant suggestions despite this the rooftop terrace bar was very nice and dj was playing good music the bedbathrobes were also very nice  Didnt really care for the horrible deepak chopra toiletries  average  stay at the chambers or gansevoort next time for a more artfulbetter service experience  
P => Wake Up This hotel is NO Dream This is a classic run down hotel that gives itself a face lift in the lobby area adds neon blue lighting everywhere and gets to call itself a quotboutiquequot hotel Here is what i got for  a night Room  Great location close to Broadway and Central Park Very small enterancelobby area  A hip guy wearing a Simbad the Sailorquot outfit checks you in  Nice aquarium set up in the lobby with neon blue lighting everywhere and a large Buddah type statue dominating  Elevators are tiny suffed up and dented everywhere  Hallways very narrow and very scuffed up with chipped walls and scuffed ks all over Room Tiny with queen size bed one flat screen TV on wall more blue neon lighting one cheap looking but wanting to be hip frame poster on the wall Bathroom Tiny no place to put shaver plug is away from the mirror or toilletry bag except on the toilet itself  Rust in many corners bath fixtures coming apart from the wall some mildew residue on the blue bath tiles Bed Small but comfortable pillow top pad has been added to the bed making it very comfortabel View Non existent other than the side of other run down buildings Noise level load vent noises coming from the rooftops of the other lower building next to this hoel Overall Something must be working for this hotel becasue they are able to charge similar prices to other much better NY hotels and yet have no interest in fixing details such as scuff ks and rust everywhere I hope this review helps in your search for a hotel in NY Personally I would look elsewhere  
P => Very nice boutique hotel I stayed at Dream  nights from  to  il we were two  I had spent quite some time looking for accommodation prior to going and I had read a huge amount of reviews of this and other hotels  To put it short I really liked the hotel  If what you look for is something really luxurious overly romantic or otherwise it  not be your first choice  But for a general stay where you spend your day around in the city and the night plus a few hours during the day at the hotel it is a very pleasant accommodation alternative  It has kept some of that old style charm and feeling  The staff were very friendly and forthcoming be it carry luggage borrow quick internet connection order air shuttle to airport or general inquiries  The entrance houses a huge aquarium in a cylinder like shape  It is very beautiful to watch  If you are killing time waiting for someone you don t have to stare at the walls at least  the room on th floor I dont think all floors are real floors so be it would be more right to call it th or th was not very big but sufficient for regular travelers  The bed was wonderful and the room and bathroom were clean  There was hot water in the shower and not luke warm  There was not much noise from traffic on th ave  The air condition worked well  When I arrived and every day after cleaning there was an apple on each pillow on the bed  Big juicy red apple  There was an iron and ironing board in the cupboard  There was a big flat screen on the wall with loads of channels and there was a bos  radio on the table with good sound not the regular squeaky hotel radio sound  The hotel is ideally placed  It was only twothree blocks from Central Park and from the hotel entrance it was a mere  meters to the metro line that takes you straight down to Greenwich Village and around  There were breakfastdiners on every corner of the hotel  David Letterman s show is also just around the corner down on Broadway  By the way there is a French restaurant down at st somewhat to the west called Tout Va Bien it was incredibly charming in its French and messy style  Well worth a visit  I would definitely stay there again  
P => OMIGOD i LOVED this hotel This was a wicked sick hotel i came with my friend her mom and my mom we had a blast  the hotel was sleek and hip i would totally recommend it and you can listen to me because i  be young but i no some pretty good things about hotels  what can i say I LOVED ITAlso this is just a little NYC Broadway show tip go see Legally Blonde it is amazing 
P => Okay   good location but small bathroom Of the hotels we looked into Dream seemed to be the best one in terms of price location and interior for us  We ended up staying  nights  The room was clean but I agree with the other reviewers   lighting is poor and sometimes its too dark to see during the day The bathroom is very small but okay  Our room was supposed to be a Queen   I doubt it The bed felt smaller than a double My partner and I had poor sleep due to that  Also when we checked in they gave us wrong pricings each night to what we originally had booked for which they corrected on their end thankfully Overall the hotel is OKAY  Not so good for people who like bed space bathroom space or people who are sensitive to noise at night if so do not book higher level apartments as there is a penthouse bar  
P =>  Style  over Substance    Myself and a friend stayed at the Dream for four nights recently  The location was very close to Times Square  minute walk  The hotel was modern and clean  The room had nice fixtures and fittings and an amazingly comfortable bed but it was TINY  I have stayed in many other hotels in NYC and this was by far the smallest  I realize that rooms here are small but this one was beyond a joke  The bed took up most of the room with only a small patch of carpet to walk on  Also this was the medium sized room we have booked   I would hate to see the smaller option I phoned down to reception to ask if a bigger room was available and the guy on the other end had a really bad attitude   at the end of the day I was a paying guest and I was not happy with the room I was given for the price I had paid Another point would be the elevators   as another person pointed out they are SO SLOW  Because the hotel has a popular penthouse bar this made the wait even longer as members of the public and staff members also used the same elevators  I always believed that when you are staying in a hotel you should be treated in a courteous and respectful manner by the staff   after all you are keeping the hotel in business  This attitude seems to be lacking somewhat at the Dream and the feeling seems to be that because the hotel is somewhat quottrendyquot that guests should feel privileged to be staying there and just quotput upquot with any complaints    in my opinion the hotel is actually not that quottrendyquot more pretentious  Overall my stay at the hotel was just OK  I would be more inclined to stay there again if the rooms were bigger staff friendlier and elevators quicker  
P => As dreamy as expected I originally found this hotel because someone had recommended the Ava lounge  on the rooftop of the hotel  to me which incidentally is very nice  This hotel was pretty much as I thought it would be after seeing their website  I thought the pictures on the site might have been exaggerated or that be they only photographed the best rooms like many hotels do  However my little room was all quotdreamed outquot just like Id hoped  I booked the cheapest room they had and as youd expect it was a tiny shoebox  Despite this it was comfy and clean and didnt feel cramped  Somehow because of all the white or and linens and the ethereal blue light I suspect it actually felt airy  Everything was modern very nice to have a fat screen TV hung out of the way on the wall and in fine working order  The quality of everything from the robes to the comforter to the bathroom fixtures was superb  The hotel staff was courteous and helpful  After ordering a DVD player for my room which was hooked up promptly by the very nice maintenance man I inadvertently left my movie in the player when I left  I called them and they tracked it down and mailed it to me with no problems at all The price was reasonable for NYC If I had to make one complaint it would be that the view from my room was hideous a grungy alleyway  
P => Very Odd and Construction noise First off construction  Across the way from our room  Reating a building   NYC all hours permit to do construction  Which meant all night dumpster noises HORRIBLE  Strange blue lights beneath bed and on the desk  CREEPY picture of a little girl on the wall  The room is on the small side as well  Beds were really comfy and clean  Other than that ok  Good location for shows and times square  restaurant to eat at but we didnt outside the hotel  
P => Ok if you are a smoker This hotel is funky and cool  I also got it for a reasonable NYC rate  The room was small but comfortable  These are the good parts  The bad part is that my non smoking room might as well have been a bowling alley  The smell was passable when I checked in due to the bathroom window being cracked  When I closed this and came back after dinner the smoke smell was awful  When I complained the front desk repeatedly insisted that it was a non smoking room and finally offered to have housekeeping bring me a filter fan to help with the smell  They never showed up  I know I was not the only person because earlier in the night a housekeeping staffer had mistakingly stopped by because a fellow guest had the same complaint  Additionally the clean linens in my room smelled very strongly of smoke  That was the first night of a  night business trip and all my clothes have absorbed that awful smell  With riott and Sheraton now completely smoke free I had forgotten that some hotels are still in the dark ages  
P => A Night Out I took my girlfriend out on a date night and surprised her with getting a room at the Dream Hotel  Justin at the front desk was very helpful figuring out a great room which ended up being the ior suite on the th floor  The rate was reasonable and the room was wonderful  Room  is listed at  Sq Feet and has a private balcony that looks right down onto Times Square  If youre a newbie to the city its a perfect view  Ive lived here now for  years and I still somehow get excited looking down onto the city  The blue lighting and or inside the room was fun and the bed is amazing  They even leave you fresh fruit on your pillows  The catch however the room is right below the Ava Lounge their hotel bar  WARNING for room  If youre a heavy sleeper or plan on being up late   then no big deal  But if youre looking to find your dream state earlier in the night   the bar doesnt stop until am  And its a more than a soft hum you can sometimes make out the words if you know the song  Since were on the topic of the bar its located on the th floor PH and is stocked with a good variety of liquor and fancy drinks  Of course youre looking at spending  a cocktail  A Woodford was    eesh  But the view is great both outside and inside  They also have an upstairs tent like extension incase you dont want to be near the bar  Overall the stay was fun and my lady was very happy  I could have done with less bass coming from upstairs around am but we were up anyhow  Oh and if you sign up with www iprefer com free   you can request a late checkout at pm rather than the typical am   which I highly suggest  
P => Great hotel excellent location  My boyfriend took me to the Dream for my st birthday and i loved it  The room was a good size and very clean the bed was huge and so comfortable  I loved the blue lights it gave the room a really modern and trendy feel  The staff were extremely helpful and poilte although when we got there we had to secure the room with a credit card and neither me or my partner hadone with us and they wouldnt except debit card so my partners dad had to fax over a photocopy of his credit card and passport which was a pain The hotel was in an excellent location turn left and walk a few minutes and we were at Times Square and turn right and walk for a few minutes and we were on th ave We had breakfast at the Serafina resturant for  you get scrambled eggs croissant toast a corn muffin which was so nice potatoes jam and tea or coffee  I wasnt sure on the scrambled egg as it was more like an omlett but everything else was great  Across the street for the hotel is a place called Applejacks which also does great breakfasts  The view from the roof bar was amazing but the only night we went up there there was a private party so most of it was shut off so we went to the bar on the ground floor which was just as nice the cocktails were delicious and the bar staff were very friendly I loved that every morning we had a copy of the New york times delivered to our rooms also the toiletries were stocked up daily  The bathroom was exceptionaly clean and it had a great shower I loved everything about this hotel it was modern clean and i would definatly stay here again also i would recomend a trip to the stardust diner on Broadway the food is great and the staff all sing we wanted to see a Broadway show but alot of them were cancled due to the writers strike  
P => Amazing hotel gem in NYC We had a really wonderful stay at this gemstone of a hotel in NYC  We had never heard of Dream before until it was recommended by a friend  The location is excellent   just two blocks from Timesquare and th Avenue Expecting the usual small NYC rooms we were very pleasantly surprised about the big corner suite on the th floor which had its own large walk in closet and multiple windows throughout the room  The bed was heavenly with multiple pillows and full duvet in front of a large plasma TV  The double blinds on the windows worked very well to keep the room bright without risking peaks from inhabitants in surrounding buidings and yes there was a view and we did see the sky The fluorescent blue light that fills the room when you enter gives it a somewhat futuristic and cool affect but at night it is indeed very calming if you choose to keep it on We also loved the chic Ava Lounge on top of the hotel which is a great place to end an eventful NYC evening with a good cocktail The beautiful DOr restaurant and bar was closed at the time of our visit but we were allowed to walk through and well be sure to dine and wine there during our next visit in NYC  
P => Tiny room Hotel lobby nice along with staff but room size very small  Bed size smaller than British standard double bed  Hotel great location  Restaurant food good with good atmosphere  Very disappointed in room size lots of extras Plasma TV and excellnt sound system and lighting  
P => Great Location Great Staff Mediocre Facility The location is perfect for a sight seeing trip to NYC  Steps from the Subway many restaraunts from inexpensive diners to fine dining within a very short walk th Avenue shopping is a ten minute walk and Times Square an easy and safe stroll down the street this hotel could not be better located  The rooms are small and trying too hard to be stylish  We couldnt figure out how to turn off the strange lights under the beds despite calls to the front desk and the toilet overflowed through no fault of ours  The worst part was they put us on the second floor    just over the nightclub    and the loud thumping music lasted into the early morning  We asked to be moved but they were unaccomodating even though we prepaid for our  night stay and had a  year old child with us  The best part was the concierge was very helpful arranging for a dor to examine my wife when she experienced a minor medical emergency  Overall I wont stay there again due to the noise  Next time Ill pop for the extra money to stay in a quotname brandquot hotel near Times Square  
P => Not Such A Dream Overall I find this hotel to be losing its lustre  I can understand why it was particularly attractive when it first opened but the building is getting older and the chipped furniture and tiles in the bathroom suggest this hotel is past its prime Also the staff are not particularly friendly and do not compare in terms of customer service to the staff at the W for instance Having said that the concierge Kevin is brilliant and made my stay in NYC enjoyable  he was quotin the knowquot with regard to trendy bars clubs and restaurants and always willing to help The rooms are tiny and the carpets need a good cleaning  The beds are however incredibly comfortable I booked this hotel from the website and paid quite a bit of money  I dont feel that the experience was worth it  Also as an IPreferred member I was supposed to obtain a room upgrade as there was availability  The surly staff attendant at the front desk reassured me I had received a room upgrade but I clearly had not and got what I paid for In short I am not that particular and believe I would have had a better experience had the staff at the front desk been friendlier  if you got this hotel on a bargain I would recommend it  If you are paying standard prices for this room however I would suggest elsewhere  
P => Comfy beds good bar The Lobby is gorgeous with a cylinder fish tank  The Front Desk Agents werent overly friendly they did their job and checked you in and out not related to the hotel but their uniforms are mustard yellow and very unappealing    On the plus side we asked for a ice bucket and they bought it within minutes  The rooms are a ent size with a very comfy bed  On the strange side there was a very creepy picture of a girl in our room   the artwork is sort of creepy  Good stay good location Tip Do not take anything out of the mini bar if you do not want to pay for it it is on sensors and anything you move or take out even if you put it back in you are charged  
P => Great hotel in a great location This hotel was pricey but worth it  The room was quite small but not bad for New York  It was clean and modern and the plasma TV was great  The blue lights in the desk and under the bed were an unusual touch   shame it took us ages to work out how to switch them off The location of the hotel couldnt have been better  There is a subway station around the corner and it is just a couple of blocks to Time Square  We didnt eat at the hotel but we did go for a drink at the roof top bar   fantastic but get there early as it gets busy  
P => As good as advertised I was very attracted to this hotels style and despite the mixed reviews here ided to risk it as I got ent  rates well in advance  I was not disappointed  Room was roomy enough for two people stylish and a great bathroom amp shower which was the perfect antidote to a weary day of walking around Manhattan  Huge flat screen TV with loads of channels easy internet connection for laptop etc  Each morning amp evening someone would tidy up the room and leave an apple on the pillow and a weather forecast for the coming day  Found the staff perfectly polite and helpful  The Penthouse lounge and hotel restaurant were a bit too noisy for us though so we never ate there I would definitely stay there again  Its a really convenient location and quiet  
P => Anniversary Trip to NYC My wife and I just celebrated our nd wedding anniversary in NYC  I usually stay at the Sheraton New York when I am in the city  I thought it would be fun to try a new hotel  I read some of the reviews and was a little nervous that I might have made a mistake booking this hotel but Dream was perfect  Check in was fast and the staff was very friendly and helpful  The rooms were small put just right for a weekend getaway  I would defiantly stay here the next time I am in the City for work or for fun  
P => Perfect What a great place  No complaints at all  Friendly front of house staff clean room great roof terrace  It can get busy so we found it was best to go up for a few early drinks before you go out you dont go to New York to stay in one place all night anyway Watch the sun go down then head out    People had said that the lobbylifts get busy later on but if youre staying at the hotel you get priority  The room was smallish and didnt have a great view but it was very comfortable in every respect and as soon as you step out of the door youve got everything right there subway shops bars and the park  Cant ask for more than that 
P => Comfortable and modern   but noisy I stayed at this hotel for a business trip along with three of my colleagues  Checking into the hotel was quick and easy and the hotel staff was courteous and friendly  They do wear some strange uniforms of gold polyester that I found at odds with the hip modern hotel or I had a quotmediumquot room which supposedly came with a queen sized bed but I think I had a king  The room was a good size with enough space to walk around the bed so that I did not feel cramped  The room looked exactly like the pictures on their website with dark modern furniture white walls white bedding and the blue neon light under the bed  Thankfully you can turn these off The bed was really comfortable too The closet was tiny it was not deep enough for the hangers to hang straight  Bathrobes were provided which I did not use but they felt very plush as were the towels  The bathroom also was quite small which is to be expected but very clean  My biggest complaint about the bathroom is the lack of counter space there is only about a six inch deep shelf above the sink  This shelf also made it uncomfortable to lean over the sink as I always felt like I was going to hit my head The only problem I had with my room was the street noise it was VERY loud  My window was right above the front door of the hotel and there was construction across the street that started very early  And the trash collection apparently lasts all night in NYC with the truck positioned directly below my window  To move would have required an upgraded room  My colleues had rooms that did not face that street and had no complaints about noise Over all I enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again  
P => Chic   Trendy and fantastic location I was very worried once my boyfriend told me he had booked the Dream hotel and then read these review  Some are ture the staff can bea bit rude but nothing more than you would expect in New York  The room was small but wow how fantastic the bed was  I wanted to try and get it in my suitcase  But really if you are going to New York why would you want to spend all your time in your room  This hotel is not great for business people it is a trendy chic boutique hotel in Manhattan I would reccommend any brit to use this hotel just for the location and beds alone The shower was lush  Just what I needed after walking all day and night The room service was brill brits   all the freebies you can fit into your suitcase the shampoo soap etc was lush  I still have some and it is brill The bar in the hotel is so nice    very very dark but very cool   PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE BAD REVIEWS  This hotel is not the best you will stay in but for location and chic it beats the rest I only spent a weekend in New York so location was everything this did the job   mins from Times Sq  mins from Central Park  Mins from all the shops LOVE IT    xx 
P => Stylish pleasant and modern Dream Hotel I had read many bad reviews of Dream Hotel in NY and was wary of staying there  I did however want to stay in the location and wanted a stylish and modern hotel not a standard traditional hotel I very much enjoyed my stay there I have a couple of comments in response to the bad reviews  I think it is fair to say that this hotel is only really suitable for those looking for a cool and modern hotel with a lively atmosphere I found the hotel staff to be perfectly pleasant and not rude  Some people mentioned the concierge was useless  I did not use them but then I like to do my own thing and not rely on hotel staff to tell me where to go etc Rooms   there are a lot of reviews saying the rooms are tiny  Because of this I booked a king size room and it was a great size  Lots of room big bed cupboard to hang clothes clean and spacious bathroom etc  I would suggest booking a king size room for the space The only negative for me is that they put soft mattress over the main mattress which you sink into ok but not great  Butthe worst thing was that it slips off overnight so is a bit of a mess in the morning  We had no issues with the bar upstairs All in all a cool modern hotel lovely rooms nice environment  Perhaps expensive for what you get but arent all hotels in New York 
P => Dream Hotel   needs a couple of things to rate higher Nice looking building from the outside with a good location at th Street West and th Avenue   close to Times Square Central Park and a number of subway lines  The lobby is quite attractive with a fish aquarium from floor to ceiling statues with a sitting area and a small stylish check in desk   staff were friendly and efficient  There are a number of elevators   all on the small side but typical for older NYC buildings I had booked a larger room   appx  square feet   the standard rooms are  sqaure feet and come with a smaller bed  There was ent closet space and a sizeable bathroom that was well designed with many mirrors bathtubshower combination with good water pressure and temperature great lighting and good storage space The room was clean and had a neat blue neon type underlighting that gave the room a nice ambient feeling and had great lighting with lamps over the bed halogens with dimmer in the ceiling and accent lights For improvements and to rank higher in my opinion the rooms need some upgrade treatments  The chairs in the room were not comfortable to sit in and read   a nice reading chair would be good for a room in a hotel of this calibre  The bed was a mattress sitting on a wood frame   it was reasonably comfortable but would have been better with a boxspringfoundation underneath  The windows could use more upgraded sound proofing   I have stayed in NYC before so I do have an idea of amount of noise to expect however I was on a bit of a loud street and close to it was on nd floor facing onto th and believe that the windows would benefit from more soundproofing  The clothes dresser was or functioned as if it was a cheaper design   the drawers stuck and the piece screamed lower quality again for a hotel this calibre I expected betterAll in all the stay was ent and it is a good hotel   if the above areas were improved my rating would be above average  
P => No dreaming in this hotel Dream Hotel should have paid me  to stay in room  which is located under the disco through which you have to suffer until  am from the loud disco beat  To add insult to injury no treats no turn down of covers whereas my colleague had covers turned down and apples placed on the pillows  The air conditioning unit didnt work very well either  The hotel rooftop patio is great and if you steer clear of th floor accommodation you might enjoy your stay at Dream Hotel  
P => RUDE STAFF The staff at the hotel was very rude  Would not let guests on the roof k with shorts on  Then when myself and other went home to change and came back we found many people on the roof with shorts on They also do not allow anyone wearing sneakers in the front entrance after a certain time at night  The staff even gave guests of their own hotel a hard time about sneakers  
P => Will always stay there Loved it The Dream hotel is a great place to stay great location friendly staff awesome rooftop lounge wonderful spa and cool or the rooms are typical nyc size but very contemporary and comfortable the beds have very soft clean white sheets and great pillows  this is not a place for kids and families its a fun and young hotel I booked my hotel online through the IPrefer membership that i have and Fabia at the front desk took great care of us  Room service is on time and friendly  The Ava lounge is rooftop overlooking broadway to Times Square  the service is friendly and attentive but remember drinks are very exspensive have fun and remember you have to give to receive 
P => Nice Lighting     My wife amp I stayed at Dream for  nights in early mid month including a weekend  First impressions   conveniently placed without being right over the noise on Broadway  Easy to get the subway or stroll down to theatre land  The check in was Ok swift and professional  Small lobby very interesting design dressed stly  Great hi vis cylindrical fish tank by the check in  The room th floor via  small lifts small corridor They can be busy early evening as peolpe try to get to the Terrace for the bar and views  The double size bed is not big   its a minimum spec double in our view and two of you can battle for space  However   it is the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept in take it for granted  They use a sort of soft lined duvet over the mattress very cool  Beware U S  hotel rooms   they are small very small in general unless you can afford top line   experiences You have to work your way around the bed and  people cannot pass each other around the bed Doesnt really matter when you are out and about so a small niggle  Small but clean showertoilet  Aircon was efficient but can be noisy when on auto mode   it kicks in and out with a loud noise which can wake you up  Great quot plasma screen which oversized for the room but hey Good music via the Bose system  Good sound insulation  Bizarre but cool blue lighting under the bed and on the desk  I would recommend a room away from the main street and not on the same side as the  lifts The breakfast is good and OK value in the restaurant but eat out for all else  The downstairs Bar is neat and stylish Terrace bar views excellent   beware it is seiged by New Yorkers and non residents in the evening  You have to book to be sure of a seat The Amalia adjacent restaurant serves very good food even if it does come with an overly pretentious descriptions on the wine list  In general Dream hotel staff were helpful  
P => A Dream I do not know what hotel people were staying at who hated their stay at Dream  My stay was wonderful The room was spotless quiet and the beds were amazing  The staff was courteous    wished my dhter a happy birthday when we checked in The concierge was helpful and well informed and the bell hop was kind and also helpful The location cant be beat   Best stay ever in NYC   Will stay again  
P => Great location but full of drunk young trendy clubbers  Spent two nights at The Dream Hotel  In a great location close to Central Park and th Avenue  The rooms are small but funky  Small bathrooms but great showers  Best things about my stay Great and comfy King size bed  In addition Kevin the concierge was really helpful and recommended some great places to eat  Worst thing was the intoxicated night time ravers who visit the hotel bar and who travel up and down on the same elevators as hotel guests  Never very safe for a solo woman traveller  
P => Shame you cant sleep in the lobby We stayed at this hotel purely because i had won a competition to go to New York for the weekend so we did not have to pay anything for this  So this review is more matter of fact When we first arrived we checked in and the hotel concierge took our bags and said he would follow us up in the next lift with our bags   minutes later he had not arrived so I had to go back down and get them myself I also had to get another concierge to help me as they needed bring the key card up with them some fault at the time  The lobby was amazing clearly this was where the budget got blown  As for the rooms they were clean but it seemed like a star given a lick of paint  I was really disappointed that we were only given one robe per room when there were  of us and we had to pay for an extra one  There too much furniture in the room and yet nowhere to hang anything The room was very small and the use of neon blue lights under the bed were unnecessary  However the bed was so comfortable and we had a great night sleep being at the back of the hotel The service in general over the weekend from the reception staff and concierges wasnt anything special  Although we did use the restaurant for breakfast both mornings and the service and food there was lovely  We ate Manhattans at  a go it was definately worth it The room was cleaned once the first day and twice the nd  On the nd day they left an apple on each pillow and a New York Sunday Times paper hanging from the door which was very nice Dont be fooled by the fancy website or the lobby  To sum it up it was a very clean star with neon blue lights under the bed and piranas in the lobby  Bizarre 
P => Quiet Peace at The Dream Hotel This unique place gives you an opportunity to stop and find peace in the busy city  I loved the calm quiet athmosphere  The hotel staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help you  Anthonie at the front desk made checking out a plesant experience  I would love to go back to the Dream again  
P => very clean  other than that   eh Was sent to the hotel by our the company travel agent as a highly recommend Concept hotels rarely pay off on their concept promise I will say my husband and I were thrilled with the extreme cleanliness   but that is it  The staff was either ill informed   the concierge quoted me a price on car service from the hotel to the airport and then told me that I should just take a cab he didnt know basic info about the circle line tours and didnt know what the hotel restaurants corkage fee was he didnt know what a corkage fee was    or rude and unprofessional  The bell men were over eager to the point of harrassment about handling our bags  And while it is nice to have a hotspot in the hotel on the Penthouse there is no set system in place to get guests to their rooms  The mixing of bar patrons with guests caused a doorman to attempt to bar me from exiting to wait for the next elevator with my husband so we could go to our room together  The bar on the roof is magnificent and a highly recommend  But staff training was an issue there as well    a Kir Royale stumped the barback  All together I think this hotel is overhyped and over rated  The rooms are small and the staff training is uneven at best on the other hand it is very clean and the location is a plus  Would I recommend  probably not   there are better  
P => Just OK An OK hotel in a super location  Dream tries so hard to be hip that it ends up being a parody of hip  Everything looks like the photos on the website except much much smaller  What looks like a sweeping lobby with the huge Buddha sculpture is really just a small room with about  chairs  Check in was very easy staff helpful  I arrived at  and check in time was  but they found me a room so I could get ready for an afternoon meeting  They warned me it was missing the duvet on the bed but I didnt care  It was nice to be given a choice of checking in early  Duvet arrived shortly and housekeepers were very polite Rooms are tiny  Fine for one person I was travelling alone on business but much too small for a couple with  suitcases  Barely enough room in the closet to hold  changes of clothes  Window looked straight into a brick wall  Room did not have a Bose radio or any kind of clock  Plasma TV was quite nice  Bed was totally wonderful The blue quotrunning lightsquot are fun at first but I got tired of all that glowing light in such a small space and turned them off  Again theyre trying hard to be hip but not quite getting there  Surprisingly bathroom was small but very well laid out  Nice toiletries from the Chopra spa  Plenty of room and shelves to put your things Elevators are small and very slow  Luckily my room was on the nd floor so I took the stairs  Location is super    blocks to Times Square and theaters  block to Carnegie Hall and Carnegie Deli  blocks to Central Park  Lots of restaurants and delis  Hotel breakfast is expensive but theres a Starbucks on the corner and  delis within a block  I didnt try the rooftop bar but had a good lunch at Serafina  This would be a great hotel for singles or a young couple wanting theaters and nightlife  An older couple would lose patience  Not as good for business travel not good at all for families  
P => No Hot Water Tiny Rooms Bad for Business Travelers I stay in NY frequently for business and got a good deal on this hotel  for first night  for other nights  While the rooms are adequate they are TINY and i kept bumping into my metal bed frame I also had no hot water when i went to take a hot shower one evening my co worked had the same problem the day before  The front desk was completely un helpful with the situation  There is also no business center or area to print boarding passes  Although there is internet access in the rooms the desks are placed very high so they are almost impossible to work on if you have a laptop Overall this might be a good hotel for someone who wants to be near the shows but for the price you are better off somewhere else  If you are a business traveler definitely steer clear 
P => Honey I shrunk the room Yes those who have written reviews about he size of the rooms   especially the quotdoublequot   are correct  The double room is a bit snug and the blue quotmood lightingquot does not make it any bigger albeit the Bose Radio the flatscreen TV and those great bath products do add to the overall experience  Yet the other features of the hotel from the helpful staff a free NYT in the AM to the very soothing spayogameditation rooms and the very ent restaurant make you want to forget that one shortcoming  Breakfast was quite good a nice waffle with real fruit and a hot cup of herbal tea hit the spot and the waitress actually smiled and was very attentive   not a bad way to start the day The location is also quite good especially with a subway station literally a few hundred yards from the front door  I stayed in room  and there was very little road NYC street noise filtering in  If there is a loud party on the bar on the th you  want to stay a floor or two lower Overall a solid B  
P => Not that Impressed Overall it is clear I am not the person that should stay at this hotel  First the location is mid town on the East side which is great for the theaters but little else  The hotel fronts th and there is not really a drive up and with both sides of the streets lined with cars there is no drive up at all  There is even construction across the way so there is a large dumptster directly across from the hotel  Sidewalks are narrow and dirty  The reception area is unusual looking but nothing else  We had trouble checking in our room was not ready and continued to not be ready for quite some time  I would not have minded but I got poor cooperation from the front desk staff  Simply not very professional  One person was dressed in jeans and a T shirt Room is again avant garde ok and very roomy but the AC rattled and the bed linens dont fit the bed so that they are continually coming off of the corners during the night Halls are narrow and dark Room service made three trips to get our simple order correct  No newspaper had to request  Concierge was at best ok but recommended one location that was closed for lunch when we got there  Had to find our own The roof top bar shares elevators at night with the rooms so we had to wait our turn to just get to our room   and had to show ID just to get into the hotel  Probably need a dedicated elevator for their guests  Overall stay here only if you like the pure quottouristyquot section of NYC and like the avant garde to extreme  Could improve with higher expectation of management or owners of the property and the staff  You certainly wont confuse it with a first class hotel property  
P => Cool This is a very cool uptown boutique hotel  Very modern rooms and common areas  The roof top bar is brilliant with great views  Staff were very polite and helpful  Loved this place 
P => Good for a quick night in NYC The Dream Hotel definitely has its ups and downs  Ups the bars on the roof and location in Manhattan  Also the very cool  story cyndrical fish tank and the modern or  Downs rooms   the standard room is VERY tiny and the closet is not even full sized  Although the bathroom and personal care amenities are quite nice  A bit hard to maneuver yourself and luggage in such a small room I usually only stay here on business with the room to myself  If you are looking for a large space to relax in   you should DREAM about being elsewhere If you just need a place to spend the night  The Dream is perfectly fine  
P => Good Location Funky Hotel for Young People My initial impression was of a funky boutique style hotel  I would have never have guessed the hotel had in the region of  rooms  It seems a lot smaller  Dance music is playing in the reception area andthere is a small seating area furnished with expensive looking chairs etc  and a great big statue of NeptuneZeus  My room standard size was a little small but had a great view of Broadway and Time Sq in the distance  As I was the only one in the room it never felt too cramped but had there been two it would have been a little too small The bed was very comfortable but I couldn t seem to get the bloody air conditioning working right   the room was either too hot or arctic  Opening the windows was out of the question because of the traffic noise The shower was good and the cosmetics were of a high standard and were also used in the Spa downstairs There is a great bar on the room with an outside room terrace  I didn t get to go to the bar on street level as it s only open on Friday and Saturday  
P => Very nice but expensive At the start of our holiday to NY my friend and I went to the Ava Lounge at the Dream Hotel on the recommendation of the Time Out guide   and we liked the place so much that we ided to book a room at the hotel for the last two nights of our trip We werent disappointed   the room was spacious and very comfortable with a ent bathroom and a great AV system in the room  We enjoyed the finishing touches   including the blue neon lights under the beds a bit confusing after a few cosmopolitans but quite cool and the Big Apples ahem left on the pillows in place of chocolates The location is very good just off Times Square which although touristy is extremely handy for getting pretty much anywhere in Manhattan  Staff are very courteous and were more than willing to help us store our bags for a couple of hours after check out and then help us to the taxi with them when we left  We ate at the restaurant a couple of times and the food was pretty good The biggest positive The Ava Lounge  Rated as one of the best hotel bars in NYC its just fantastic  The Lounge is in two parts   an indoors area on the top floor of the hotel with big windows overlooking Times Square itslef and a roof terrace with views of the New York skyline  Service is good drinks are well made and the atmosphere is excellent   a buzzy suited and booted after work crowd is followed by dressed up late night drinkers The negatives Well it was expensive  Having booked online at a ent rate of about  per night for the room we ended up paying a total of  for two nights  How Im not sure    I think it had something to do with starting a tab at the bar oops putting brunch and lunch in the restaurant on our room bill and finally making a couple of short local phonecalls that cost a grand total of   I would stay at the Dream again if I was feeling flush and happy to splash out for some luxury  Its not the best hotel in NY Im sure but for the price not including bar tab etc its pretty good value  
P => Wish I could have stayed longer    Stayed just one night but liked the Dream so much Ill definitely return Service was impeccible  Everytime I walked through the lobby I was greated  The bellhops were great  showing me and my girlfriend around hailing cabs for us and holding our bags for us after we checked out  Other positives were the nice flat screen tv in the room the free yoga and meditation in the basement the rooftop terrace and the fresh fruit left on our pillows each evening  Only negatives I could find is that for the price I felt a little nickle and dimed by two things wi fi was  a night and the mini bar had a motion sensor on it and automatically charged you if you even moved anything in it 
P => Not the best in NYC I always make a point of reading reviews on this site before staying at a hotel as it is has nearly always proved very useful to me  However I try not to be put off by just a sprinkling of bad reviews where someone has just had a terrible holiday and EVERYTHING seemed to go wrong because there will will always be people like that  Anyway the review FIRST IMPRESSION   I unfortunately arrived on a saturday night and i think there is some sort of club on the top floor so the lobby which is insanely dark at night was full of partygoers waiting for the lift  Anyway it wasnt that much of a problem and I never heardanything from the club though i was only on th floor just wasnt a great first impression ROOM   My company had booked me a medium room with Queen bed  Now ifthis was a medium room God knows what the small one was like  It wasnot very big at all  Bathroom the same really tiny  But everything was clean and working When we first got in the room I realised that you could hear quite clearly the bell on the lift when it arrived on that floor and remember thinking that it if people come down the corridor drunk at night it will definitely wake me up but it didnt so Ill leave that one I cannot believe for a second that the bed we slept in was a queen  Idont think i know what that means as i did question the hotel about it and they said it was but i have a large double at home according to habitat dimensions which i have always called queen and if was definitely smaller than that  AND whats more and this would put me off more than anything else it was the softest most squidgy uncomfortable bed i think Ive ever slept in and for a hotel called Dream i thought it a bit ironic OTHER FACILITIES   The restaurant attached is quite nice I didnt eat there at night but sat at the bar a few times and they do cocktails mainly and some good wines  I had breakfast there once but was really expensive and service was a bit slow but be it was a one off LOCATION   In case youve not stayed in NYC before heres a quick rundown of what i think about the location  The hotel is on the corner of th ST and Broadway which is about five or six blocks away from the top of Times Square and four blocks from the bottom of Central Park  Some  see it as convenient for sight seeing whereas I would say that it is a bit like staying really close to Leicester Square i e  ultra touristy but if thats what you want I guess its a good location but if work hadnt chosen this area I definitely wouldnt have done  I usually try and stay midtown east which has better shops and restaurants close by  However New York is really easy to get around and cabs are cheap and plentiful so this is by no means a massive disadvantage OVERALL   I have given this a hotel a rating of   This is because it is not a cheap hotel  I think it was  per night and i have definitely stayed in much better hotels in NY for this sort of price I saw Kate Thornton in the lobby so I guess she was staying there at the time yet I wouldnt see it as a celebrity type hotel at all  My best judgement would be that although there were no major issues cleanliness noise levels etc were very acceptable the room was small and the bed was not good and i would only rate hotel as pretty good  star or very low end  star and would advise you to really have a good look round before you commit to staying here unless you get an amazing price  
P => A fashionable haven in the heart of NYC New York City is bustling and busy and yes you  not necessarily spend a lot of time in your room  However when you do get back to your room you do need a haven where you can chill out relax and recharge your batteries before you hit the streets again  New Yorks Dream hotel does exactly that  It is a calm haven overlooking Broadway  With spiritualist Deepak Chopra putting his name to the hotel you know an emphasis is going to be placed on relaxation The suite we stayed in goes against everything people tell you in New York about the rooms being small  Our suite boasted two bathrooms a living room and a bedroom with a bed wider than it was long We also had  quot flat screen tvs   one in the bedroom and one in the living room For a girl who likes attention to detail Dream had it all   from Egyptian Cotton Bed linen to Deepak Chopras own range of in room toiletries Room service is very good and the restaurant joined on to the hotel does a great breakfast  I never got to try the roof bar as there were private parties on during my stay but I am sure it is very good In terms of location you cant get a much better spot than this so if you are planning to visit New York I would definitely give this hotel the thumbs up 
P => It is a dream come true Location is great room was impeccable 
P => A Dream Worth Not Having Ive never written a review before but after staying at the Dream Hotel I feel compelled to share my opinions about this ridiculously overpriced hotel Lets stress the positives first  Even though I personally dont like Midtown and Times Square I have to be fair and recognize the location is great  Close to Central Park th Avenue theatres short walk to the subway station  The Chopra Centre amp Spa was amazing with one of the best massages I ve ever had  Thanks JoeI also have to say that contrary to other reviewer s statements our room number  was large even though it lacked wardrobe space Thats about itThe evening my partner and I arrived was a cold and rainy one  Our taxi pulled next to the curb and I noticed the bellman standing at the door and thats just where he stayed after Id pulled my suitcase out of the taxi and was rolling it towards the door whilst my partner was struggling with his  He only acknowledged us once we where inside the lobby  With only a few exceptions most of the staff was just average  Nothing note worthy in a hotel that claims to be at the top of a competitive game For a place called Dream you d expect each night to reach R E M  stage with no problem  Think again Yes the bed was comfortable but nothing to brag about  As noted by another reviewer the windows don t have double panels so you are treated to the sounds of the city but what s more ironic is that just as many noises come from within the hotel  A very loud AC kicking in a phone ringing in an adjacent room guests talking about the day ahead or waiting for the lift  Oh Yes our room was located next to the elevators One detail meant to impress the guests as they walk in is the dramatic effect of the room flooded in a light blue colour product of the neon light emanating from the glass topped desk and underneath the bed  The turned on flat screen and soft music coming out of the excellent Bose system add to this illusion that you just walked into heaven until you open the door to a tan and blue tiled grout covered bathtub cream coloured mildew spotted plastic shower curtain Motel  style bathroom I could go on talking about the run down appearance of the hotel scratches are a common denominator in the lifts and bedroom furniture tacky ors a back lit screen with a dove that seems to be coming to attack you as you walk out the lifts on the th floor the Ava Lounge which is more a club than a lounge a must avoid if you want to have a conversation with a bartender who doesn t know that tinis whether shaken or stirred are supposed to be served chilled  I don t reckon I m too demanding A bouncer at the Ava Lounge standing in front of the velvet roped staircase which leads to the terrace not letting you a hotel guest through to enjoy the so well advertised stunning views but allowing pass it another gentleman accompanied by two beautiful women instead  But I won t dwell on that I ve travelled quite a bit throughout the years and stayed at better and worse hotels than this one  The point I wish to make is that this hotel is just average and like I said before ridiculously overpriced regardless if it s Manhattan  As an experience it falls short in every single way resulting in a bad and cheap Philippe Starck wannabe hotel  
P => Perfect for our engagement weekend We stayed at the Dream hotel for one night ch  ch    We had a wonderful stay while there  The hotel has a contemporary feel to it from the pictures to the lightning in the rooms  We stayed in a medium queen room room   The room was extremely clean and very quiet  There was not a view but this is what kept the room so quiet so it was perfect for us  My fiance had planned a very special weekend in New York City for us as he was planning on proposing  He called ahead and thanks to the concierge Kevin he was able to have the hotel room prepared with rose pedals covering the room and champagne  With the blue lightning the room was extremely romantic  As for the size of the room we were happy with it  Of course its size must be considered by New York standards   lets face it hotel rooms in New York City will be smaller  The room size was just fine and much bigger than other New York hotel rooms I have stayed in  The bed was to die for  It was so comfortable I did not wake up once during the night which is unusual for me  The tv was a nice big flat screen on the wall  The bathroom does not have a bathtub just a ent sized shower  This was fine with us but if that is something that is important to you keep it in mind  We did not eat at the restaurant or go to the bar since we were only there for one night and had other plans in the city but from what Ive heard and saw they both looked nice  We were also told that a dance floor will be opening very shortly As for the service at the hotel it was amazing  Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating  As I state earlier Kevin the concierge was wonderful  He made sure that our stay there was as special as my fiance hoped for  The rest of the staff are very friendly and pleasant as well One of the biggest perks of this hotel is the location  It is located directly in the middle of everything  It is located on th and Broadway   four blocks from central park a couple of blocks from th ave and time square is straight down Broadway  Parking is  for  hours  If you choose to stay for a few hours past the  hour k you will be charged the full  but it is well worth it considering the average parking price at other garages is about  per hour plus tax  We paid over  for the one night stay at the hotel plus the parking but I believe the price was raised because it was St  Patricks Day  Things you should doTake a horse carriage ride though central parkSee a Broadway showShop th avenueVisit time squareI would recommend this hotel  It is nice clean and according to NY standards a nice size  Have fun in the big apple 
P => Hotel Dream is a dream to stay in      I visited New York for  nights staying from   ch  with my boyfriend and friends I was in a wheelchair as I have had a recent operation the staff were absolutely fantastic from the girls who checked us in upgrading us giving us more room because of the wheelchair to the guys on concierge the cleaners and the bellboys especially Edwin  I cannot believe that this hotel is so low regarding the rating for those considering booking this hotel it is a must as I say not only due to the incredible friendliness of the staff but also the location Wth St within walking distance of th ave Times Sq Central Park etc but the in house restaurant served great food the roof top bar WOW what a view of Manhatton and the restaurant Amalia which has just opened next to the hotel recommended to us by the concierge what a place again the friendliness of the staff and the food I had Roasted red pepper soup for starter wonderful Grilled Stuffed Ribeye steak for main  of us had this and both said it was the best steak we had ever had Creme Brulee for dessert  I cannot recommend both this hotel or the restaurants highly enough we had a fantastic time in New York made even more special by the hotel and our last night at Amalia so if you havent booked a hotel you must book The Dream and eat at their onsite restaurant have a drink in the roof top bar and enjoy a meal at Amalia we wont be staying anywhere else when we next visit  
P => Okay but wouldnt recommend it Being a devout reader of trip advisor reviews I should have known better and booked the Barclay or somewhere else after reading the negative reviews of Dream  Most of the critical reviews are regarding the room size  Well they are not lying  Myself and my husband thought it was probably over exagerated but our standard room was TINY  There was about a foot either side of the bed and that was the width of your room  Nowhere to store your case so ours stood propped up at the side of the bed doubling as a bedside table   thank god we only had one case  There was no in room safe no Ipod no docking bay   all of which should have been included as stated when we booked  On our first morning the toilet flooded  I attempted to flush and before I knew it water was pouring out onto the bathroom floor  We called the front of house who said theyd send someone up immediately we were mopping up the water with our towels and  minutes later we had to call again to chase When maintanence turned up with a plunger he fixed the toilet but when I asked him about the adundance of wet towels spread over the floor he told me that wasnt his job  Fair enoughThe positives are a great location just four blocks from central park a stones throw from fifth avenue and times square if you are there for the NY tourist experience  We visited most of the delisdiners in the area and would definitely recommend the Carnegie their sandwiches are ridiculously sized but worth every penny and you can take it with you when you leave  Although its the other side of town   go to Maxs chocolate by the bald guy just off of Union Square   this place is to die for   the best hot chocolate and the highlights chocolate pizza and chocolate syringes  The beds at dream are the most comfortable we have slept in and the turndown service is pretty good   fruit left on your pillow and a weather forecast for the next day Our experience of the dream certainly wasnt terrible but the rooms are tiny and a bit suffocating but hey you dont come to NY to stay in your hotel room 
P => Fair value in a good location with a few interesting twists  I stayed for three nights with my girlfriend for a weekend visit to New York  We booked in to a Queen which was small but not so tiny as to be claustrophobic  It was clean with a small bathroom   no proper bath here  The bed was comfortable with great linen  The blue lighting which features in promotional material was fun when you first enter the room but you don t use it again  The windows are not double glazed and ours did not close properly which means plenty of road noise   not great for dreamy sleep  The location is excellent within walking distance of a dozen sights  The subway is close by   including the E line for Airtrain transfers to JFK  We did not have breakfast in the hotel   it seemed poor value  The Applejack diner opposite is more than adequate if you like American breakfasts  The Ava lounge the upstairs bar is a great if pricey tini bar with excellent views down Broadway  The bar is a destination in itself so don t expect to a quiet drink or a seat  The hotel staff we encountered were fine but as you expect from a hotel sold on design the service levels were not stunning  One particular annoyance was the turndown service which on both nights was early and clashed with us getting ready to go out   which made it rather pointless and intrusive  We enjoyed our stay  
P => Exceeded My Expectations This is a very good NY hotel  Great rate too  Loved the room though the first room they gave me had a vomit smell  The new room was nice and quiet a bit small but thats what you get in NY The bathroom was small but clean and updated  The bed was VERY nice and soft and the work desk was good  Wish I had a view out the window but thats NY The restaurant was good for dinner but just average for breakfast  The rooftop bar was good nice view but somewhat loud and expensive  Try to use the quiet room behind the elevators Lobby was great  Service was OK  Id stay there again  
P => Book your room at Dream Hotel After thoroughly researching hotels in New York City I ided that Dream fit the bill    interesting design full list of amenities good location and relatively reasonable prices  I was in NYC for  nights on business and my wife joined me for  nights  We both commented that the room was large for a room in NYC  It was clean modern interesting design king bed nice linens desk with high speed connection plasma tv bathrobes closet clean bathroom with tubshower mini bar and really cool blue lighting  The room was very comfortable  Our room was on the th floor room  I believe and we had two windows facing east which provided us with great light throughout the day  The noise level was relatively low and the view was pretty good  The rooftop bar is a cool and comfortable spot to have a before  or after dinner drink  The staff were outstanding throughout our visit    helping me set up my internet connection taking the mattress topper off our bed to firm it up a bit providing directions and recommendations hailing cabs etc  I dealt with a gentleman named Adam who must have been one of the supervisors and he went above and beyond the call to make sure I had everything I needed and that we were comfortable  All interactions with the staff were extremely pleasant helpful and polite  The location was great th and th right near the subway easy to get cabs plenty of retail and restaurants nearby close to theatres and Central Park  This is a great contemporary alternative to the characterless chain hotels or the quotold world charmquot hotels  I am now looking for any excuse to get back to New York    and when I do I will be staying at Dream  
P => Very disappointed  dont stay here and get ripped off Whilst the location is good the room was very small with a tiny bathroom and a child sized bath and it was advertised as a medium sized room  the cheek of it allAlso it is worth noting that I stay in hotels every week for work and the Dream hotels overall service is poor compared to the other boutiqueexpensive hotels I stay in for work every week I was very disappointed in the bar too I wanted to go to the top bar and my partner and I ided to venture there on the last night of our stay but was told by a bouncer who revelled in turning people away that someone had reserved the entire bar  pathetic As a hotel guest at Dream we should get priority access to the top bar  To be told that we cant drink at the upstairs bar is rubbish  Also the or in the hotel is also quite trashy and tasteless and badly put together  The only good thing going for the hotel is the comfortable bed and the free yoga classes in the chopra centre downstairs but of course the staff wont tell you about that nor that it is located downstairs below the lobby and has a small fitness area  On my second visit to the chopra centre the entrance was flooded with water and several staff were trying to mop all the water up  They didnt seem to cope well with the matter and my shoes were ruined  Also avoid the Sefrina restaurant for breakfast  it is seriously overpriced Next time I will stay at another hotel  The owner of this hotel really needs to venture into something else  Trust me  if the service continues this way this hotel wont last long 
P => Good place to stay We stayed in room  which is not on a street side and it was great  No noise from the street at all  I would recommend this side of the hotel  Rooms from X X would be on Broadway and might be a little loud but all is not lost see below  Room is small so if you live in your room on vacation it could be cramp  It was clean and turn down service included a piece of fruit each night  It is in a great location just up from TSquare and just below CPark and Columbus Circle The only down side is that the small room puts you right next to the hallway  When you open the door your bed is three feet from it  We found that turning on the exhaust fan in the bathroom drowns out any noise from late night arrivals  I have to credit my wife with that little stroke of genius  We got a deal since it was winter and it made it worth while  
P => Very dreamy bed I stayed here two years ago and a nice time  Dream is true to its name it is meant for sweet dreams    the bedding is the key feature here  The down comforters and Molton Brown products including an awesome scented quotsleep sprayquot were so nice  The room has black out shades so it was very easy to oversleep  Plasma screen in room was nice  The bathroom was very small and overall there was not much space in the room  We liked the lobby bar and the cool paintings on every floor  It felt pretty hip  Since you are really not in the room that much in NYC it was OK to have a small room  The bed was worth it  Just request a room away from the elevator which is loud and you can hear it at night  
P =>  Your Just Like a Dream  I stayed at Dream before Christmas so I could see New York city during Christmas time   From the moment I walked into the lobby I loved it here    There is a great Fishtank and the or is great  We booked a medium room that was very clean and had just about the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in   Make sure you go to the top floor of this hotel There is a view of times square off of the roof that is great   I will defiantely stay again 
P => Not so bad    Ive read before leavin for New York as I usually do the reviews of Tripadvisor most of the opinions of Dream Hotel were not so good   This was my first time staying at Dream and during my stay  days after all I have to admit that my experience wasnt so bad What Ive really LIKE location very central just   blocks from Times Square and th Ave  the hotels stuff very gentle and helpful excellent Italian food and nice ambience can be enjoyed at Serafina Restaurant the room service is good the plasma tv and the blue light in the room bed very comfortable What I DIDNT LIKE the size of the room very small compared to other hotels Ive stayed in NY the bathroom was not exceptionally so quotfancyquot one day my toilet had to be fixed because it didnt work well  Anyway rooms are clean BUT small   Next time I will book another hotel and looking for a bigger room 
P => All about location There is no doubt that this hotel is all about the location  Youre basically on Broadway just south of Central Park and near just about anything youd want  Its slightly less expensive than the others in the area as well  Positives Obviously location  But they have done a good job bringing an old building back  The beds are very comfortable and they did a great job of using space overall  From the flat panel TV to the way they hang the towels its a good use of space  Second is that it is amazingly quiet  be it was just our room but overall I couldnt believe how quiet it was  And we were next to the elevator  Bose Wave radios are a nice touch as well and the robes are as soft as they come  The bars there are pretty good and seem to be popular  It was busy every evening  Negatives Its small  But so are just about every other room in that area so dont get hung up on this  Past that the interior rooms views are non existent  And it was pretty stuffy  We had the air conditioner on when it was  F outside It was  F inside  The only other negative I would give is that it just has the feel of a run down hotel with new stuff in it  Bathrooms are tiny and the window and tub seem ancient  But still value wise for mid town Manhattan in ember this will be difficult to beat  It was at least night less than most only a few blocks away  I would definitely recommend staying here unless you plan on spending a lot of time in the hotel room  But its NYC why would you do that 
P => Great   Not a nighte at all We travel abroad   times a year and stayed at Dream      I was worried about the Dream because of previous trip advisor comments  I need not have been   we had a large room on th floor with a fab view   bed was sooo comfortable and bathroom was a fine size   yes the grouting needs fixing as it is mouldy and some sloppy touch up painting has been done but it is clean towels are plentiful   fresh ones every morning and again in evening if required  Deepak Chopra products are replaced daily fresh fruit supplied and daily paper and weather forecast  Plasma tv is good too  Reception staff are a little aloof and not friendly but concierge staff are really helpful and nice with it  Bar is hip and staff were good  The Applejack diner across the road does great breakfast  Hotel is not luxurious for the money but it is in the ideal position for tourists not least because it is so close to a metro stop so it made getting round really easy  We abs loved New York and Dream was great   at least it is central and in quiet street for its central location and it was def clean which is what I was worried about  
P => Hip Happening Hotel After driving into the city we pulled up at The Dream and were greeted by some young hip doormen  Our room wasnt ready yet however they were very kind to hold our bags and direct us to some great shopping  Upon checkin later that day we arrived at our room which was very hip with the blue neon lights  Each floor that we passed had really great photos of hip happening babes The location is superb  Walking distance everywhere  The restaurant was great and the housekeeping staff was extremely accomodating  As with most NYC hotels you are not there for any view but location and comfort  The beds were extremely comfortable  We even had a Fire Alarm go off early in the morning with not much chaos  All in all i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants value comfort and a hipyoung atmosphere 
P => Dream is centrally located energetic safe and fun My friend and I were on a fast trip to NY one day in the Catskills and one day in the city  We were told by a few people to take the train into the city because it was cheaper than a car  DONT DO IT  If you are going to the Dream Hotel the subway does not have a escalator or elevator available after certain times  Needless to say my  lb bag felt like lbs flight after flight after flight of stairs  However when we did get up into the city Dream was just a short walk from the subway station  Upon turning on to the street of the Dream it is at night the blue lit hotel  The lobby is impressive and the elevator opens up on your floor with a commanding back lit art piece to greet you  Our room was small by Midwest standards but for us it was great  There was an impressive presentation  blue lit bed blue lit desk bose radio on and a pear on the pillow The bed was HEAVENLY I could not believe how comfortable it was  I had read reviews about the air conditioner being noisy but I did not have that problem  The air conditioner was quiet and worked well  In fact I was surprised how quiet it was in the room for being in the heart of the city  That was a great feature of the hotel   the comfort of the rooms being serene and the hotel lobbylounges oozing with energy  A great night life  especially on the roof  I would HIGHLY recommend making an advance reservation for the roof top  Believe me youll wish you had  All of the tables were reserved and I wished I had know that reservations were recommended  Because being on that roof felt luxurious and we both wished we could relax the night away up there  In the Ava lounge there is a delicious drink the KEY LIME TINI  Order it  Think  dollars is too much it isnt  just order it  I dont drink more than  beers a year and this was so amazing I had three  Edwin the bell man is so helpful and a get it done kind of guy  Want to know what is close  the best value or how to get there the best way  he is your man  Everyone is friendly and helpful IF YOU ASK but I think that is NYC  Edwin is the above and beyond employee for my stay at the Dream  I am expected to give above and beyond customer service at my work  in turn I have a hard time with standard customer service  Thanks Edwin I would recommend the Dream for people who want an atmosphere the view from the Ava lounge is vibrant the outdoor lounge is electric with energy and the bed oh the bed is nice It is located a short and safe walk from Times Square close to an ATM close to the subway and they will be adding a new dance club which sounded interesting  The manager at Dream k OBrien e mailed me same day twice when I had a question for him  It was not a complaint based question either  he really impressed me with his promptness  Stay at the Dream and have a great time  I did  And if I go back to the city Ill stay at the Dream and believe me I will have reservations for the roof  Youll know me because Ill have a Key Lime tini in my hand  Good Luck  
P => Nice Weekend Getaway My husband and I stayed at Dream for one night  We found the front desk to be very helpful and professional  We stayed in a large room which was adequate  The room was neat the linens were clean but there was alot of dust under the platformed bed and the shower had a small amount of mold  The spa was very clean and offered many unique services  The location of the hotel was great  walking distance to many great attractions broadway shows and shopping  The conceire was knowledgable and able to suggest a great place for Sunday brunch  This hotel is great for young adults and great for a girls spa wekend  I would not recommend this hotel for famlies  
P => Exceptional  We stayed  nights at Dream for some sightseeing and shopping the general NYC travel experience  We we greeted very nicely we had a great roomlittle small but we knew this before staying here  The rooms were clean and staff was very friendly often going out of their way  Location was great  short walk to Times Square  Subway around the corner and staff will give you lessons on riding it  The restaurant was very good and reasonably priced  We ate out on the sidewalk and drinks to follow on the roof  Would definatley come back if looking for a Times Square location 
P => Dream Hotel was my best NYC experience The Dream Hotel experience for myself and my family this past ember turned out to be the highlight of our holiday The Dream is a beautiful hotel in a great location  The rooms are clean with nice or and the service was one of a kind We had a great Manhattan view and we especially loved the penthoouse lounge which we spent hours enjoying  The view from the lounge directly down Broadway was just amazingAlso the adjoining italian restaurant was very good and we took advantage of it twice during our stay  The rooms the food the staff the location          all made our experience at the Dream Hotel to be the finest weve experienced So the next time you plan to visit New York City I would highly recommend this gem at the top of Time Square The dream is truly a dreamy experience 
P => Great stay at Dream Yes the room was small but I reserved the small room  The bed was a dream down comforter and pillows and the fresh quotcottonquot scent  Though I didnt have a view the room was very quiet and efficient  The bathroom had more storage for quotstuffquot and Chropa products were replaced when unnecessary  I was in NYC for business and pleasure and would return  The AVA lounge in the evening was the best to unwind after a busy day  Although I prefer the neighborhoods of NYC it was a fabulous midtown stay  PS thanks for the complimentary nightcapsPPS the room was standard for a room in Paris 
P => NIghte I heard mixed reviews before staying her but as I frequent traveller to NYC I like to try new hotels however I will I had never tried this hotel  Although the hotel was only opened a year or so ago the room walls were so ked up and dirty it looked  times its age  Everything felt old  Taking a tiny room and filling it with a tacky desk that has lights underneath does not make a hotel room neither does a  inch plasma screen positioned way too high on the wall  Still I could live with all that but the bathroom was frightening  If they had not moved my room I would have checked out and slept in Central park is I had too  As I opened the door a large group of Fruit flies started swirling around my head  There must have been  or more they were everywhere  The tiles on the floor were filthy and full of grout the fixtures were the cheapest I have ever seen I swear they took the bathroom from a cheap motel and just copied it and I am dead serious about this point I don t think the bathroom was ever cleaned and from the cheap shower curtain with mold all over it to the cheap shower head which had something else growing all over it to the odd hand soap it was a horrible nighte especially after having paid almost  dollars    Oh and one more the thing the quotfourquot star restaurant downstairs is just a cheap tourist restaurant disguised as something better  The service was horrible and the food even worse  It was the worst food I have ever tasted in New York  Instead of there try TGIF and you will get better service and food or even KFC would be better  If you want to spend  or  dollars on a room in New York try the Bryant Park Hotel that is where I moved the next day and they are always perfect  The itime Hotel is also excellent and both are priced the same as Dream  The bottom line is don t even try this hotel it is not worth  dollars  Take it from me and save yourself some frustration    
P => Cool hotel with great location We stayed in a medium size room for  nights  Very nice room but there was no view from the window  A wall a couple of meters away I liked the neon lights under the bed and in the desk  The internet connection was not wireless but pretty fast and costs about day until PM  Every morning we got newspaper outside the door and there was fruit and a next day weather forecast on our bed when we come back at night The mini bar in the room was automatic   meaning if you touch anything in it even if you put it back   you have to pay for it   so dont  On the wall there was a  inch panasonic plasma  The picture and sound quality was not that very good so I guess it was an old model    really NOT HDTV One night there was no picture signal to the TV at all  The toilet was very clean and nice   you get a lot of small bottles   schampoo conditioner body wash body lotion and packages with q tips cotton swabs shower cap and even needles sewing thread and shirt buttons in different colors PThe bed was the most comfortable bed Ive ever slept in really wow    The hotel had a great location on broadway but the hotel entrance was from the th street    and the sidewalk next to the entrance had a lot of rubbish  Times square was close   just   minutes walk from the hotel  The penthouse on the th floor had a nice outdoor lounge with bar and music   If you stayed on a high floor I can guess the volume could be quite annoying   The Serafina restaurant on the bottom floor served very nice italian food and we liked the atmosphereThe few times we had contact with reception and concierge service desk we got our questions answered fast and we felt the service was good I think the room was quite expensive   tax but I think it was worth it  Ive read that rooms in NYC are often small size and so are also the rooms if you book through the website hotels com etc  you only get to choose the smallest room size You have to use the hotel website dreamny com to book medium and large sized room higher rate though    Our overall experience was really good  This hotel is greatIve attached a couple of photos    
P => Not A Dream I read the reviews and had to see for myself  The spa is a  star and restaurant a   The hotel is just adequate  The rooms are smaller than any hotel Ive stayed at in New York and feel like a white box  From pictures youd think it was a minimalist theme but it is simply a cheap imitation  The room was clean the staff was professional and almost everything in the room was cheap  Except the TV  inch plasma  The other plus is the location  Great location  Its on Broadway and th  So I it all balances out  
P => Horrible Experience quotWhat a dump quot If you like a small bed in a tiny room with a miniscule bathroom that is filthy at best then do I have a hotel for you    Dream  I too have a Dream of charging  for a beat up dirty hotel with poor service  Unfortunately I have a conscience and would not do that to my fellow man I wont even mention that boogers that I had to remove from the wall next to the bed or the mold in the shower or the rusty shower head  Suffice it to say you should only stay at this hotel if there are no other rooms availabe in New York and the police wont let you sleep on a park bench Dream on    
P => Great trendy boutique hotel inconsistant service Just so you know my perspective I am a single business traveller in my late s and stayed for  nights for a business trip  For business travelling I know what top notch RitzFour Seasons service is like but when I travel on my own I stay at much more economical places and am not super fussy  Overall I thought The Dream was a great boutique hotel and I would definitely stay there again For the price which was high smid s depending on the night I thought it was a great value compared to most things you could book in NY for that cost The overall look is very trendy and hip The lobby amp rooftop bar and restaurant are VERY cool and eclectic  You can tell the  went here as the rooms are more spare  The pictures on this website are very true to what you get  Not luxurious but cute and worked great for me  The airconditioner is LOUD  The windows open to let in fresh air which was great  Toiletries very nice and are from the Deepak Chopra center which is actually attached to the property so looked like some great though very pricey spa options  amp up for a massageA big pro for the property is the fact that there are multiple restaurantlounge options  The on site restaurant has a great variety of delicious cuisine but bad service see below  The bar upstairs has a penthouse view and a rooftop open air level that is great in the spring  Think there is also a bar on the lobby level  The location is unbeatable   blocks south of Central Park   blocks north of Times Square   blocks west of th Ave shopping The service is inconsistent The hotel feels upscale because of the or but the front desk does NOT give upscale service  They are friendly but untrained too casual and lack the service standards that a hotel managed by a major brand like starwood etc would have  Restaurant servers lack training  They are not rude just spacey  I ate in the restaurant many times and it was fine for me amp a colleague as the food was great but I would never bring a client as it would be embarassing  The concierges are great and very knowledeable about restaurants give detailed directions amp really took their time with us  Bellman were also super friendly and responsive  Housekeeping keeps things clean amp in order but again service inconsistant  Sometimes for turndown Id have fruit in my room sometimes not sometimes a weather report for the next day sometimes not Cons for the business traveller are that room service doesnt start in the morning until am and there is no business center altough lots of nearby kinkos  No wireless internet but high speed ineternet access is in the rooms I would stay here again due to the hip atmosphere great food options amp location and would just know Id have to put up with the inconsistent service  Have also stayed at The Alex but prefer The Dream now because it is superior in these respects and less expensive  
P => Pleasantly Surprised Ive been traveling to Manhattan on business once a week for almost a year  Suffice to say that I have stayed in most hotels in Midtown at this point  I was very impressed with Dream  The room was relatively small though bigger than some  The quality of the bed down comforter down pillows and linens made for a very comfortable night  The plasma TV was a nice touch  Internet access was fast and very easy to use  Location of the hotel is outstanding   it is about a  minute safe walk to Times Square and less than a  cab ride  The crown jewel in the experience though was Serafina   the restaurant in the lobby of the hotel  Excellent food and astonishingly reasonable prices    even for room service  
P => Pretty good   but dont expect great service I was reluctant to book Dream having seen the wildly mixed reviews here but we couldnt find a better deal in mid town Manhattan  Those reviewers who suggest there are better hotels for the money nearby   please tell us which ones The rooms are small by US standards but theyre modern clean and equipped with Plasma TV and Bose radio  Personally I thought the blue neon lighting was cool The location is just off Broadway at th Street and worked great for us  The staff are mildly disinterested except when theres a tip involved   and then they elbow each other out of the way to help  But if you dont need the service and you can get a fair price we paid around  a night   good luck if you can get better and youd prefer a well equipped new room to an older but more spacious one then youll be happy at Dream  
P => Cute with a great location It was fine  The only problem was parking the car up front so the valet could take the car to the garage  I found later there were cheaper garages a few blocks away  so that was painful  It was pricey theres no way around that  But other than getting over the cost it is Manhattan so its gonna be pricey everything was fine  Its perfect for young couples  
P => more like a nighte So I travel a lot for work and hit NYC about once a month  I only post when it is really bad or really great  I had been on the road three weeks and stayed for  nights  I love smaller hotels and wanted to do the Chopra Spa so it all made sense  The first night I got in late and was put on the smoking floor when I requested non smoking  They said they were booked up and because I booked on Expedia it didnt guarentee a room type  The next day they moved me to the non smoking floor and to a quieter room smaller too  I had a box fed exd to the hotel prior to my arrival and nobody could find a package for me upon check in  I tried again the next morning no package for you Sir  Finally I pushed the concierge to look and we found the box in their holding cage  A day later had another box fed exd in same problem   never told me I had a package  I had to find the box myself behind the concierge desk because he was generally not at the desk So in night three of four the internet went down in the entire hotel  It was out all night and in the morning too  This is obviously not a business hotel  Additionally there is not a business center and the concierge couldnt even print my flight boarding pass  He couldnt get the printer to workSo the spa was great  It was one of the best massages I have ever had  Of course my luck the steam room in the mens spa area was out of service They did offer another room udi for my steam and allowed me to stay past hours in the steam room which was devine  So upon checkout I spoke to the mgr and she said to call her next time I am coming into town and she will make it right  I dont think so    They need to know that they have some issues though and being a business owner I did my piece to inform them  
P => Please read before booking this hotel  This hotel was WAY overpriced for the service and most importantly cleanliness  The carpet was coming up in  of the  rooms my friends and family stayed  The carpet seemed old and yes there were plasma screen TVs with horrible channel selection  The bathrooms were very small not very clean and the service was poor   best  Whoever says you shoud stay here is giving you the WRONG idea of a modern nice New York City hotel  There are MUCH better placed to stay for this price and that is being generous  
P => watch out for the con artists They prmised the quotstay  nights th night freequot online and then conveniently forget about it when you check out unless you explicitly ask them  Then they double charged my credit card one for the promotional price and another one for the full price Watch out for their website which screwed up our check in date  We were charged one night for no show and when we argued with the floor manager watch out for Adam basically what he said was quotyou screwed up not us haha quotThe room was very small  The plamsa TV turned out to be annoying    the picture quality was low and there are only a few channels none of which is HD  No in room videos nor any services The only good thing I can say about the hotel is that its on the same block as carnegie deli  
P => Distinctly average I found the hotel distinctly average  The blue neon lighting and the dimly lit hallways were bordering on seedy  When they describe the rooms as small they mean SMALL  The location however was excellent  Note if staying on the th floor over the weekend you need to be aware that the th floor houses the hotel night club and any references to this fact will fall on deaf ears when discussing with the hotel staff you will just have to lump it  
P => out of  Dream was a fun and trendy hotel that we really enjoyed staying at  Our initial impression was of the lobby and I must say it was very elaborately orated  The or is certainly ecclectic but it is really creative and we enjoyed the huge fish tank in the lobby  Our rooms were smallish and minimalist but the perfect size for  people  Also the plasma on the wall helped with spacing  There is a pedestal sink in each bathroom which also helps conserve space  Overall we really liked the rooms  Everything was very comfortable  As for the location it was perfect for walks to Central Park and is  blocks from Time Square  We loved the location and would consider staying there again for the comfort and convenience Now for the reasons I give this hotel a  instead of  First off they did not have our reservations in their system so the attendant in the lobby had to call a reservations system to ensure our reservation was valid we booked on expedia and paid ahead of time  The front desk attendant was courteous and we didnt have too much trouble checking in  However the main thing I was disappointed in was the attitude of the gentleman at the concierge desk  When we asked him a question he stated a simple cocky answer and then went back to his computer screen as if he couldnt be bothered  Even taking into consideration the unsocial concierge we would definitely stay here again  The location is fantastic the rooms are comfortable and its a really fun hotel  Although this is definitely not the hotel for a traditional person its a really nice hotel for someone who can appreciate the trendiness and minimal design  
P => Dream was fantasic   Despite the dodgy reviews I saw some pretty variable reviews of the Dream but went for it anyway priily because we got a good deal and due to location  When we arrived I asked for a room on the th floor as advised and I have to stay that we had a really great experience  The room was small but really nice and perfect for what we needed  We were there during the blizzard and had  inches of snow in a  hour period and the staff were fantastic at pointing us to stores where we could buy boots etc  One even walked to the store with my partner to make sure he didnt get lost The location is great for Midtown and we found it really easy to walk to most of the main attractions even with the snow We are early thirties with no children  We usually go for boutique style hotels and we really liked the Dream and would definitely recommend it to others in a similar position  
P => hated the service when you pay for the service for bell men it would be nice after along day of shopping and walking for a bell men to just open the door instead of talking to the fornte desk girls 
P => Trendy and well situated Stayed for a weekend  Trendy hotel with cool ambient lighting and minimalist touches in the rooms and elsewhere  A new Chopra Spa Center has great potential though we didnt use it  The upstairs lounge is for the young and want to be trendy crowd and has a nice view of the city  Service was prompt  The rooms can be small but overall we enjoyed our stay and would return depending on price  The restaurant is also recommendable for casualtrendy metro dining  There is a small gym  
P => Good location small basic rooms that were clean with good beds Let me first say that I didnt pay for my room I won it as a prize in a contest  I was supposed to receive three nights in a quotlargequot room but I think I ended up in a small room  The room was nicely furnished with a good bed an oddly placed flat screen TV and a small desk  No view from the one small window  There was another window in the bathroom but it had been covered over during the remodeling The Dream is one of those small NYC hotels that has been reated into a boutique hotel with small oddly shaped rooms and a few fancy touches The location is excellent close to several subway lines and walking distance to Central Park Times Square and many restaurants  We ate once at the hotels restaurant Serafina and found it quite good and not overpriced for NYC I found the staff friendly and they let us check in very early after an overnight flight from the west coast  However there was no leeway in the  p m  checkout time  I appreciated the book of Buddha in the nightstand drawer rather than a Gideon Bible One concern I had was a lack of security  Unlike most NYC hotels these days anyone can go up the elevators into the hotel without being asked to show a room key  The deadbolt lock on the door did not work though there was some sort of a latch to close while you were in the room No wireless internet at least not officially though there were several wireless networks available  Wired network access was available for  per day Easy access from JFK via the AirTrain and E subway line  We made a mistake when we arrived and took the Super Shuttle which took at least twice as long and cost more than twice as much as the return trip by subway and AirTrain Id stay here again and given that its NYC I guess Id put a fair price at around  to  per night which is lower than the rack rate but  be close to what the rooms go for through resellers  
P => Much better than expected Seeing all of the negative reviews of this hotel scared me a little when making the reservations  Opinions of rude service and run down rooms almost deterred me from booking a romantic weekend for my girlfriend there  After iding to give it a shot we couldnt of been more impressed with the hotel staff  The rooms were definitely small its New York but very comfortable  Plus we got a reasonable rate online  I would say however that the ventilation and heating in the rooms was a little poor  Ive been to a great deal of hotels in NY and Dream was not my favorite but I feel that it deserves some credit with regards to location hotel staff and price  
P => Stolen clothing and poor management Dream Hotel promotes itself as a very trendy boutique hotel when in reality it is a very quotseedyquot poorly managed hotel I had brand new clothing stolen from Saks no less without one return call back from management and had a lousy time at their very poorly organized New Years Eve party located at their penthouse cocktail lounge  Apparently the quotkeyquot tables all surrounding windows facing Times Square had been sold to quotthe rich and Famousquot for    If I had known people were to be segregated I wouldve never attended It didnt damper my pleasure for NYC the location is good and their restuarant Sarafina has delicious food Think twice about staying here or take old clothing that you wont miss  I certainly wont ever stay here again 
P => Missed the point The Dream does fit into the category quotvalue for money designerhipquot although regardless of category there is no excuse for poor heatingventilation system nor for the total lack of technical service or foodservice in the evening after   The least they should do is to outsource these   Also no point in having those generous sized plasma screens without a movie stream or dvd library 
P => Dream definitely not a Nighte My husband and I visited Dream in ember  After reading so many derrogatory comments about Dream we were pleasantly surprised  Prior to our trip we actually booked a room at the Ritz Carlton for our last night in case our time spent at Dream was actually a nighte  When it came time to move hotels for the last night we really did not want to check out  To breakdown the hotel yes the rooms are really small even the large room which we had the Ava Lounge is unique chic and enjoyable  The Penthouse Lounge is small but very understated quiet and elegant in its own rite  The Chopra Center which is open by the way is delightful and renewing  The lobby or is somewhat impressive and eclectic front desk help is adequate  The Concierge desk when available could use some help  However overall we would visit Dream again  
P => An Overall great  day stay  My wife and I just stayed at Dream a few weeks back and had a great stay  We booked a medium room and then checked rates  days prior to travel and ended up gettind an Extra Large room for  less  Rates seem to drop down whhen they are trying to book short term rooms  or  days in advance  Everyone downstairs was helpful minus the grumpy Russian working the front desk  A lot of people complain about the room size of the small room but that is standard for NY  Just pull the re book trip prior to traveling and you can get a ent room for a good price  If you plan on going to bed early request a room on the th floor or below since the club on the th floor seems to go until AM  Serafina has great food for lunch and dinner but the service was a little slow  Hit the bar up on Thursday or Friday and you will find a pretty good group of people to hamg out with  If you are of the quotOldser setquot or are more into the Ritz vibe this is not the place for you  
P => Great experience Intially I had my reservations about booking this hotel after reading some of the reviews but I must admit I am glad I made the ision to stay here over Thanksgiving weekend  We arrived at the hotel after a very short cab ride from Penn Station to a well lit and bustling entrance  After entering the hotel I knew I made the right ision from the  story saltwater fish tank to the friendly front desk and bellhops No problems with check in    took all of  minute There was some anticipation after getting off the elevator because I was expecting to be sleeping in a shoebox   yes the room was a bit small but sufficient for me my girlfriend and HER luggage My only knock on the room is that the down comforter and sheets were like sleeping on paper and everytime I moved it sounded like someone was balling up paper   but I slept fine And the bathroom was perfectly clean You have a choice of  bars and a restaurant in the hotel   but youre in NY   who wants to stay in   explore And explore you will because you  blocks away from Times Square   close to plenty of restaurants bars and shows If you want to be close to Times Square have a comfortable relaxing spot to reset after a long day on the town and dont want to spend an extra   to be  blocks down at the riott or W   trust me you wont be disappointed I wouldnt recommend that my mother and father stay here but a weekend getaway in youre in your  s for sure 
P => thanks for a wonderful weekend I would like to thank Dream Hotel for one of the most amazing weekends Ive had in a long time I knew I chose the hotel right when I arrived  The front desk staff and bellmen couldnt have been nicer  And the room The website pictures didnt do it justice  From the flat screen tv to the incredibley comfortable bed it was more than I could have hoped for  The concierege was a huge help  He got us tickets to a Broadway show and reservations for a restaurant that is almost impossible to get into  We loved our meal at the hotels restaurant Serafina  Their pizza and pasta were delicious and they had a great wine selection The location was perfect as well  We were able to walk to the theatre at night and Central Park during the day My weekend was truly a quotDreamquot come true 
P => Pleasant Stay My boyfriend and I stayed at the Dream Hotel and I will have to say that I had a pleasant experience  Aside from the room being extremely small we were already aware of that it was clean the staff were very helpful and friendly the location was awesome right in the heart of midtown near Times Square  The bed was OUT OF THIS WORLD I have never felt more comfortable in a hotel bed EVER I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel   the next time we definitely want to upgrade for more space  
P => Dont stay at the Dream Hotel I am so glad I wasnt the one who had to pay for my stay at The Dream Hotel  I am sorry anyone did  What a complete rip  The rooms were teeny tiny I had a king room at  a nightlacking any charm or warmth the service and staff were rude my air conditioner didnt work despite  requests to the front desk to fix  My television turned itself on two nights in a row remote control was on the nightstand  I dont know who this hotel might appeal to  possibly teenagers or posers in their s  Ultraviolet lights under the bed and in the white contemporary desk everything in the room is stark cold white is just a little freaky when you have had a long hard day in NYC  It took several minutes to figure out how to get all of these goofy lights off and just regular lights on  The lobby is tight and laid out very poorly with stupid columns and a tube aquarim completely in the way  The location is good  Oh also encouraged reading is The Book of Buddha in the bedside table instead of the traditional Bible  Call me old fashioned I would never ever even contemplate staying here again  even in a pinch  
P => Dream Hotel     STAY AWAY I am a Boston area travel agent     and made the mistake of booking for arate clients into the poor excuse of a hotel      dirty rooms poor service bard closed most of the time etc     worth about a  star on the hotel booking system     you can be sure I will spread the word about they way this place treats customers at the next IATA conference     Yikes 
P => Dream was a dream Just got back from one night at the Dream and I too was skeptical of staying there after reading the reviews  Our stay was very enjoybale no complaints Yes the rooms are small but that is true in general in New York city  The room was clean the staff pleasant the or very chic and the beds comfy 
P => Our night was a dream After reading many of the reviews I worried about staying at The Dream  I had friends coming in from out of town and I needed a good midtown location but did not want to stay at a typical chain hotel I wanted to stay at a trendy quotNew Yorkquot hotel  I had reservations about The Dream being too small to trendy or to pretentious   I found none of these to be a concern  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel was a pleasant surprise as a matter of fact we never left the hotel at night because we had so much fun at the lobby lounge and Ava  I booked a medium room and also a extra large room  The medium room was just a bit on the small side but had all the ammenties you would want for a short stay in NY I have stayed in much smaller rooms in NYC  If you are staying more than  days the extra large King would be well worth the extra money  The X large King room was great   and had a huge bathroom with a very cool tubshower combo Many of the reviews stated that the beds were very comfortable   This has never been a big concern of mine but after staying at the Dream it will be a a huge factor for me   These beds were unbelieveable I agree that Hautel Couture is not for everybody but if you are looking for a fun unique hotel to stay at this hotel is perfect   I will definately be back  
P => The Dream is a Nighte Hip and trippy lobby leads to rooms smaller than an inside cabin on the lowest k of any cheap cruise line  Ive seen small crampped rooms in NY but this beats them all  No closet space no room for even a chair a glass quotbenchquot for a desk a bathroom so small you have to reach across the room for the toilet papernoisy AC bad service a view of a concrete wall  feet from the windowthe only thing positive I can say is that the public areas are quotinterestingquot  Id stay in New Jersey before having to stay there again 
P => A Big Apple Success Over the last three years involving about  trips to New York City I have stayed at a different hotel each time from the large well known chains to smaller quotboutique typequot hotels I would categorize this hotel as quottrendyquot along the lines of a quotWquot This is a hotel in a great location with people who are trying hard to please guests and do a good job  Check in was quick I booked a quotlarger roomquot with a window towards a central courtyard not a street window  It was the most quiet stay I have ever had in a New York hotel never heard a siren or street noise   At check in there were no wash clothes or drinking glasses in the room but when requested were promptly provided  Though no new wash clothes were ever delivered for replacements of those used  The elevator had one of those video screens playing different scenes   on one occassion had pictures of naked bodies of both genders not in a sexually suggestive way   more in an artistic way which seemed to embarass one of my quotelevator matesquot   I thought it was great and I commend the hotel for the quotavant gardequot approach  Roof top bar on a warm tember evening on a Sunday was not crowded but the views and the ambiance were just great  It is a must see Would definitely stay there again  I found the related restaurant just fair as coffee and a latte on two different breakfasts served nearly cold each time including refills  Servers were attentive however  
P => Haute couture boutique hotel not for everyone Recommended for  to  somethings singles couples small group of friends Europeans and AsiansNot recommended for families  and up singlescouples big groups What to like VERY comfortable beds Molton Brown toiletries flat panel tv helpful concierge eclectic looking lobby Ava rooftop lounge the outdoor section ent Itallian restaurant next door convenience Applejack diner to the left Starbucks to the left and right and the location  walking distance to th Avenue shops Central Park Times Square What not to like small rooms sound of slamming doors across or next to room limited TV channel selection hotel already getting worned out 
P => A little disappointed     I was in NYC for software training in which the training facility mentioned three hotels that offered discounts to students   Dream being one of them I ided to give it a try because it seem to offer something a little more quotdifferentquot than most hotels in NYC  I must admit that although I checked with TripAdvisor first and saw the bad reviews I ided that sometimes people DO exaggerate and that I would like to see for myself   Well   First and foremost before I go into the review I must say that I applaud the effort they are making in putting together a different looking type of hotel and their attempt of making it a quotdream quot The theme of the hotel is really nice and I do like some of the amenities they offer that most hotels do not Flat screen plasma TVs Bose stereos BUT   unless you stay in the suites the rooms are far too SMALL especially for a six day stay  So after the initial shock of the size of my room although I was told that I was in a quotlargequot room   it certainly wasnt the large that Im used to I found it to be clean and cute  In an effort to try and make up for the quotlack of spacequot I ided to take advantage of the other amenities they boast about like the fully loaded IPOD and a DVD player so I can watch movies or listen to music  I was told that there wasnt an IPOD available as of yet and that I would be put on a list which I eventually got the same day  They also went on to say that there would be a  hold placed on my credit card for the IPOD and a  hold for the DVD player  Wow so much for amenities being included in your stay All I wanted was to try to get as comfortable as possible for my six day stay so I agreed to it all    no big deal On day three after spending some time with relatives and returning to my room alone around pm I got off the tiny elevator and walked down the dark hallway towards my room to find my door open I immediately thought that I was being robbed  I began to check the closet under the bed and in the bathtub to make sure no one was in the room  This was a little frightening to say the least  It appears that when housekeeping was doing the evening quotturndownquot they accidently left my door open which I found suspect because the doors are heavy and always slam close  I called down to the desk to make them aware of the situation  They apologized and asked if I wanted the key changed What difference would that make if housekeeping left it open in the first place Did I mention that I had a laptop out on my desk that could have gotten stolen Thank goodness that I had it locked to the table with a security cable  They asked me if I wanted to move to another room  I told them that it was late and I didnt feel like packing again to move so I would let them know in the AM The next day I ided that after that serious mishap I would call the Manager and demand an upgrade or leave the hotel  They cooperated and gave me a really nice suite my girlfriend reported to me however that they were working on a suite across the hall in the mornings which caused a little but of a nuisance for her in the AM  It was quiet at night though thank goodness and we especially enjoyed the bathroom in the suite because of the large jacuzzishower  The hotel is pretty new and is still under construction so I imagine that its pretty noisy during the day One small note on the location   I didnt particularly care for the location th Street between th and BWay  I found that everytime I went out I hated to walk back to the hotel through th avenue because of the smell of garbage amongst other things so I always went back to the hotel through the Broadway side  Overall we had a ent time and the upgrade to the suite was definitely a bonus  The staff was very accommodating and pretty much fulfilled all of my needs but I honestly dont know if I would pay my own money to stay there again my stay was company paid  The hotel is small but pretty small elevators small dark hallways and ofcourse the rooms   unless its a suite so if you want to try something new and different and dont mind small rooms this is the place for you  If you can afford a suite Id recommend it but if not Id probably stay at one of the more reliable Sheraton or riott hotels  Of course it wont be as pretty but its more secure and the rooms are bigger for the price  
P => Thieves at Dream Hotel I cancelled my reservation at the Dream Hotel but still got charged for a night  I contacted the hotel management but was told that since their staff failed to provide me with a cancellation number I would be responsible for the room  This is quite disturbing since it is the hotel that failed to follow its own procedure but elected to penalize me for their mistake  Worst hotel experience Ive ever had  And I didnt even stay there  
P => Not worth your money I was really excited about visiting this hotel  I spent over  months planning a trip to New York with my girlfriend and after reading about the  start hotel seeing the reviews good and bad it didnt phase me because it was a great deal and quotsoundedquot like it was an experience in itself  I was wrong  If you plan on never being in the hotel then it is livable for a couple of days  The rooms are literally about as big as my college dorm room  I am not being sarcastic  There is just enough room for a bed a small desk and the two night stands  Me and my girlfriend had to turn sideways to walk past each other to get things from our luggage  I also had no window  Whats up with that I had a fake window that was covered by a piece of paper that looks like a oration behind a fish tank and that had rips all down it also  They also make a big deal about their egyptian cotten sheets and the bed  Well the bed is no different than any other It just has a pillow top lining on it to make the bed softer  Like the previous review we also had an airconditoner leak  It didnt bother us but it made the room smell wet  The funny part of the room is we had a full length mirror but the room was so small and the mirror was in such a weird place in the room that it felt like a circus mirror to squat and see yourself  The staff was nice every night they turn down your bed and put an apple or orange on your pillow  But there was a private party upstairs at their bar all weekend  Even the guests couldnt get in  I thought that was pretty crappy that the guests had no right to go to the bar at a hotel that we paid for  I have been to New York several times and stayed in hotels from the Waldorf to the Hilton to the Holiday Inn and now Dream  This hotel was a let down  Like I said if you plan on being outside touring the city these things dont bother you and you can enjoy the extra savings of a hotel in a great location  BUT I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMMED SPENDING THE EXTRA  A NIGHT ON A DIFFERENT HOTEL like the Hilton  The Dream HOtel is not worth your money  If you plan on romancing your wifehusband then you will be highly dissappointed in this hotel  
P => Neither Pleasant nor Unpleasant We originally booked this hotel because we liked the orlook on the website  On the plus side the beds were very comfortable and more like something you would have at home the hotel staff was friendly and efficient the bathrooms were very nice and the TV was a great amenity  On the negative side the website advertises that all rooms are equipped with Bose speakers and iPods  be rented  We brought our own iPod but were still expected to put down a  deposit to rent the cable to plug into the speakers  After being in the room for about an hour we were interrupted by hotel staff who insisted on cleaning the glass in our room so he quotwouldnt have to do it tomorrowquot  The elevators were slower than death and Penthouse guests were ushered in front of other guests waiting for the elevator  The concierge seemed about as lost as we were when confronted about which train to take downtown  All in all it was neither a pleasant nor unpleasant experience but in the future when paying night I will definitely opt for a quotsaferquot hotel  
P => Careful We made a reservation for  for our after wedding party at the Ava Lounge on the rooftop of the Dream Hotel and a room for the newly ried couple for the night  Arriving at  pm the reservation time guests were advised that there was table space for  and standing room for the remainder of our guests  The age in our party was from   many from overseas and out of town  The manager on duty told us that was the best they could do and that was the way they handled reservations  Their method of quothandling quotreservations was not disclosed at the time of booking and had it been it would have been obvious that this was not the best choice for this group  No amount of discussion by the Bride and attempted reasoning could exact a solution  Guests left during the process when it became apparent there was not room for our reservation in the Ava Lounge  So    there was no after wedding party and it ended on a rather upsetting note  We were directed to the lobby lounge which some guests used but it was not the rooftop lounge reserved We requested drink compsand were refused  The Dream Hotel did Comp the hotel room for the night for the wedding couple  Not a reccommended venue 
P => Loved it My fiance and I loved this hotel  The bellmen and front desk were extremely nice and courteous  We loved the or of the hotel and our room which was small but its NYC what do you expect  Great in room amenities  Will definitely stay there again  
P => One Absolute Reason Id never Go Back The hotel wasnst so bad  Even if I totally overpaid for the tiny standatd room because I booked it last minute The staff was friendly  Check in was super fast  I was shown to my room within  min but again I checked in around midnight  Staff seemed short handed  Whenever I called front desk or concerige I was put on hold for quite a while  The room was tiny but no surprise I was warned  The thing I could not understand about the room o was that why they would put such a huge desk and drawer in such a tiny room  Oversized desk and drawer took half space of the room  The bed taking the other half of the space you really have to struggle a little nevigating around the room without bumping into the furnitures  They could have utilized the space a lot more with adquately sized desk and slimershallower drawer  And what is with the freaky neon light in the desk There is the blue neon light and it bugged the hell out of me I kept turning it off  But the maid kept turning it back on everyday sometimes twice a day  Later I gave up and lived with the light  Plasma TV meant nothing to me as no one sits around and watches TV in a hotel in NY  When I have infinite choices of flicks from grimiest Indie to the chic est retro in NY why pay for a generic movie in a hotel Besides you should go out at night  No time to watch TV  The good thingsExcellent location  Well I would have prefered down town but those boutique hotels are not very affordable and this one is right by F NR  train the most convenient location for transportation The room and the bathroom was very clean  The linnen was crisp with down comforter  The fruit thing with weather forecast was very cute and helpful  Bathroom is average but clean and well equiped  There is magazine holder in front of the toillett and magnifying mirror towels were good  I didnt bring any toillettery checking in the boutique hotel And was quite happy to find the Molton Brown ones  It made all the other problems go away but one The absolute reason I would never go back there There is no full length mirror Come  oooooon How coudl you call yourself a boutique hotel without a full length mirror People who chooses boutique hotel are more conscious of their looks than others  How could anyone leave out such important detail  Never mention boutique hotel Ive never been in a hotel without a full length mirror  For the  days there I had no idea what I looked like  Whether my heels matched my jeans or the new pair of jeans would go with the top I brought etc etc  Its a crime really  I was furious  I would have gotten the hell out of there the next day and move to another only if I didnt pay the whole  days in advance with Expedia in non refundable terms  I chose to be a little mismatched than blow   So I am not impressed with Expedia either  For this reason I would never ever go back to that imposter boutique hotel  And even though I cant imagine who only the people who can live without a full length mirror should go there  
P => Great for a weekend in the City My boyfriend and I stayed at the Dream in  after finding great rates on Hotels  The lobby was very cool and the rooms although small were clean and had a very modern feel  The location was close to everything The only disappointment was that the rooftop bar wasnt open yet  Otherwise  it made for a great weekend 
P => The Little Room that Could   I accompanied my husband on a business trip and so we checked into a room facing th street that had a king size bed  Yes the square footage is relatively small BUT the design of the room is well thought out with some nice points that we really appreciated  The window had two shades one for blocking out light and the second opaque for privacy   and the window can be opened  The plasma tv installation does save space  In place of the headboard is a  foot square of upholstered plether   very comfortable for sitting in bed  The bed itself is solid and the sheets etc  of very good quality  There is a deskvanity that has a glass top so that you cant lose your items in the drawer  The bathroom is nicely designed with the details of a toilet paper dispenser opposite the commode   no twisting for paper There is an excellent magnifying mirror that is set above the sink not on the side  I am saving the best for last   someone extraordinary did the lighting  There are recessing lights in the ceiling with a dimmer switch  The closet has a light  There are two full sized architectural light fixtures on either side of the bed for excellent reading lighting  Underneath the bed is a long neon tube attached by brackets  Flip a switch next to the bed and a soft purplishblue light is cast around the perimeter of the room at about  inches above the ground  It doesnt annoy you   more like settling into the glow of an aquarium  It is the ultimate night light   perhaps you are like me and worry that getting up in the middle of the night you  be disoriented and trip into something  This light eliminates that worry  This is not a hotel for families   its a nice hotel for individuals and couples who want to stay in midtown  
P => False Advertising AVOID RUDE  On their website they advertise a medium room as  sq ft quot plasma tv and queen bed  Be aware however that once you get there you could get a room as small as  sq ft and that is considered a quotmediumquot room as long as there is a queen bed  That is what happened to us  VERY SMALL room Rude front desk people Very poor service and amateur appearing remodeling  It is relatively cheap but you get what you pay for  I absolutely would not stay there  I cancelled my last  of  nights because it was intolerable  They should not advertise what they do not provide  It is also a very small hotel  floors so no view is possible  
P => Fun to Dream I recently spent two nights with my husband at Dream  Our friends made our orignial reservation and booked  double beds  My husband a lbs  linebacker is not one to share a double bed with We tried to change or cancel the reservation by phone and were unsuccessful  When we arrived at the hotel we eventually spoke to the GM and got a great room  It was in the back of the corridor and was quiet  We kept wanting to wake up early and never woke up before am As far as NYC hotels go this one was clean and while not spacious by normal standards a nice size for NYC  The or is chic and fun  Theres a fish tank that is two stories high and nice lounges on the first and top floors  They are opening a spa soon which should add a lot as well  Our friends stayed across the street in a dump and theres no comparison We had a terrific bellman named Edwin who helped in every way he could and was enthusiastic and really friendly  The pretension of some of the staff was just kinda funny since you scratch the surface and theres not much there  i e  the concierge who couldnt spell WestchesterWe spent our last night at the W on Lexington and the room was much smaller and had lots of other small problems  Id definitely stay at Dream again although Id probably still look around before I did  
P => Worth checking out I stayed at the dream for one night on a business trip  Found the room to be very comfy and clean  Restaurant on site is good for dinner however pretty busy  Breakfast service could have been a bit more attentive  Like all new properties its worth checking out becasue everything is new up to date and very clean  Plasma tv in the room was a nice touch  Front desk staff was very accomadating on all requests including  checkout to allow for a conference call  Room was booked through quikbook  Found it nicer than the Time Paramount but not as nice as the Muse  
P => A place to avoid Well it is not quotterriblequot but it is far from being quotOkayquot either  We were prepared for a small room but expected justifiably so for the price I believe that the tininess of the space would be compensated by a modicum of luxury  Instead you are crammed intio a white cubicle with not even a picture on the wall  The only quotluxuryquot is the flat panel TV mounted in an exceptionally tasteless and impractical way  Incidentally it didnt work took a call to mintenance to get it fixed  minutes  A doorless closet with not enough room even for what we brought along for a two day stay  A third rate bathroom with a plastic shower curtain no counter space   minute wait for hot water  A sliding door between the bathroom and the bedroom would have helped to avoid thye necessity to carefully plan all movements in the room prior to opening the bathroom door The bed is comfortable but the reading lights are awful  Most irritatingly the window shade is useless you are waken up at dawn by light pouring into the room No coffee maker  A request for one elicited the suggestion that we order a cup of coffee or tea from room service    a cup Apart from the ridiculously pretentious or in the corridors the level of accommodation is that of a     airport motel whre the airlines put you up when your flight is cancelled and you are travelling coach The service personnel were slightly hhty but professional and polite  
P => Its All About Design This hotel is all about design  Its what you might expect to find at a hip hotel in Milan  The staff was friendly and dressed in designer Frenchs uniforms  The large column in the hotel lobby that doubles as an exotic fish tank the eclectic furniture the current music that emanates from speakers in the lobby and a very attractive clientele provides a very chic atmosphere  The hotel is well located if you plan to take in some Broadway shows visit Central Park and check out local museums  As others have said the beds are quite comfortable feather bed types with nice linens  Oranges on the pillow cases made for an atypical turn down experience  On the down side I paid  for a quotlargequot room which I would say would be quivalent to a small room at most hotels  I can only imagine how small the quotstandardquot rooms must be at the Dream  If the room rate were in the mid s this hotel would have been a good value  In the high s low s there are many other hotels in mid town Manhattan that are probably a better value but with a more traditional atmosphere  The Carlyle a block away and the Helmsley Carlton House on Madison Avenue across the street from Barneys and near all the other high end shopping come to mind  
P => Underated After reading the reviews I was very skeptical about booking this hotel  I was pleasantly surprised by the clean rooms and ultra modern or  The  inch plasma TV is great and they use the highest quality bathroom products  The price is great for NYC especially considering how great the location is  But do not book the small room   it is very very small  
P => Great Experience Just got back from a wonderful trip to NY  I go twice a year and try to stay at new places each time  Was nervous about this reated hotel but it intrigued me so I gave it a shot  I dealt solely with one of the front desk staff throughout my stay  If you can try to get her to take care of you when you check in  Not sure of her name but I intend to find out and write a letter on her behalf  She was Scandinavian   I believe blond attractive and extremely extremly efficient and accomodating  Kept her cool in the midst of a very busy check inout rush  We were there for  days and only saw the same two women at the desk   she was fabulous  She handled some things for me that went above and beyond just being courteous  As a female traveler who gets irate at poor customer service I truly appreciated that The room was not as tiny as others have said the linens and comforters were the best Ive seen in a very long time and each night a piece of fresh fruit was placed on the pillow for turn down  Once an apple then orange then pear  The first concierge we dealt with was very good  Handled confirming our Nobu reservation with skill and got right back to me  The second concierge was miserably inept    didnt know the answers to any of the basic questions we asked him Request a room off Broadway   ours was not too noisy although I did take earplugs and used them anyway  The location of this hotel is ideal for the recreational traveler   very central  The elevators ARE small  and a little slow   but since we were never in a terrible hurry we just didnt care Doormen didnt open the door for us much on this stay      we giggled about it everytime we walked in   but that wasnt all that important to us Serafina restaurant was a nice option for an afternoon cocktail  The Ava lounge was more like a frat party on the Friday night we ventured up I think that I might just break my rule and stay here again based on the care from the front desk person the comfy beds great location and great toiletries  
P => Worth a Try I stayed for one night on a solo business trip  Aside from some early morning noise from the garbage truck and a VERY cold bathroom floor I had an enjoyable stay  The top floor lounge had a great view down Broadway and it was fairly busy for a Tuesday night  The features that stood out for me were the quality of the bed linens toiletries and definitely the location  If you go to New York more than once Id say its worth a try but I like to stay in different places each time I go  
P => Fabulous Hotel Tastefully understated this is a wonderful hotel excellent location and the staff was delightful  I would recommend it to anyone    anytime I cant wait to stay there again  
P => Above Average Good Location and ent value for the money  Concierge service a little below average  Make sure you do not get a room facing the street otherwise you will think you are in New Orleans at am 
P => Not really a dream Stayed at the dream for  nights     Booked online at the Dream web site dreamny  Rate was  a night plus all the other NY taxes etc  which pushed the price closer to   A lower price could be found on Expedia etc  but that was supposedly for a single bed ROOM Small about  x  with very little room for anything but the queen size bed  Everything was painted white which helped make the room seem a little larger than it was  A nice quot Panasonic flat screen is mounted to the wall a couple feet from the end of the bed  While this  seem like a nice tech touch I dont think the room could handle a regular TV there would be no place to put it  Thus the flat panel TV is almost a necessity  There were no movie channel offerings only basic cable  The front desk told me they would be getting movies in the future  The room also had a nice Bose wave radio but I did not see or ask about the iPod that is suppposedly available with each room  Bathroom was very compact  Closet was barely big enough to fit the hangars  The Bed comforter sheets and pillows were all first rate   the best and only real asset of the room  This is becoming more popular in hotels especially where the bed quotisquot the room  A small work desk with tech ports and plug is located next to the bed  Internet access was about  a day LOBBY Small and underwhelming  Dream is obivously going for the hip hotel image  It looks like they tried to pull this off with a very limited budget  Its not bad but I doubt that youll be impressed SERVICE Friendly   no problems  We my wife and I did not have a lot of interaction with the staff    check in and out and handling of luggage RESTAURANT We did not visit either of Dreams  lounges but did eat at the trendy Sefafina restaurant  Food was good and restaurant was busling on a week night  LOCATION Just east of the corner of Broadway and th  The location is great I always prefer a midtown location when in NY and this would be about as good as any OVERALL The Dream is billed as a  star hotel  Id put it closer to   although the bed and location are certainly pluses  I dont have anything really negative or positive to say about it  I read on Gayot that it was ranked on NY hip hotels list as    Many things in NY are ranked higher than they deserve to be   its a NY thing  The quotDreamquot theme is carried out with minimal expense dreamyhip blue and white backlit photos greet you as you step out of the elevator on each floor and there are quotdreamyquot blue lights under your bed and work desk in the room  I never felt like I was in a dream  Then again it wasnt a nighte perhaps the Dream is comparable to a ent nights sleep  Not bad  
P => Arrived with a girlfriend left with a Fiance I took my girlfriend to new york for her th birthday the whole experience was a dream and so was the hotel  Very impressed with the service and the people were so friendly The room was just like the photos i saw  The location of the hotel is spot on and only a  minute walk to central park and the same for times square I arrived ar Dream with a girlfriend but left with a FIANCEI would like to thank dream for helping with my dream  Top ks 
P => Much hype little follow thru The hotel has a fabulous location and looks great from the outside   just wait till you step in  TINY rooms a pastiche of colors and a lot of hype for what it offers  IF youre okay with being squeezed into a closet with some cool stuff for sure New York has tons of better choices beginning with the Bryant Park Hotel on th street or the Chambers on th  street  
P => Loved Dream I am very impressed with my experience at Dream  The Concierge was able to make a reservation for me at Spice Bar on a Friday night  If you know New York that is close to impossible  Very Impressive Overall I had a fantastic stay  
P => Dream Hotel in NYC   disappointing Hi all I was truly compelled by the idea of the Dream Hotel  Designed by Vikram Chatwal Golden lit lobby with a cave like underground lounge Blue lighting in every room Sounds like an surreal adventureNot so fast  The overall effect is creepy at worst trying too hard at best  The place overall seems unlovedrun down to be honest  Not to mention the size of the rooms They are TINY Two outstanding things of note on this hotel however GREAT  swanky fun bar  A must seeAmazingly comfortable matresses Happy hotel hunting    
P => For the price this IS a Dream My wife and I stayed at Dream over Christmas  on the tail end of our honeymoon  We had booked it purely on the recommendation of a British newspaper before it had even opened and were extremely impressed  Despite arriving a day late due to flight problems the staff were most accommodating and upgraded us to a King sized room upon check in The midtown location is perfect for Broadway the well known shops and Central Park all within walking distance  The staff were very efficient the room was superb the bed as good as they get and all the little extras in the room and bathroom are a refreshing change from the norm  We had a nd floor room and the th Ave traffic noise was not a problem at all You must check out the Penthouse Bar for guests on the th floor  The music and ambience is perfect and the view up Broadway towards Times Square is excellent  If youre a smoker dont fret because theres a balcony to have a crafty cigarette  Well worth a visit Were already looking forward to our next visit  Highly recommended 
P => not the faulty towers i read about  Well i have just come back from the dream hotel and it was very nice the bedroom i stayed in was a large with two double beds in my opinion it wasnt large but neither was it small The staff were very helpful and i will be going again but there was only one bad thing The people in the  bars in the hotel are very rude and unfriendly and also the night club so please check out the dream because it is worth a stay thanks 
P => Enjoyable stay Just back today from  nights   dream    I was very wary about my stay after reading reviews of this site  It just takes some planning to have a great stay  Book a large room with a king size bed ring ahead to specify smoking or non    Staff are fantastic very heplful with lots of local tips concierge was a gift   As for the rooms themselves never used the heating once and considering it was  c while I was there the room never got cold so i dont know what people r talking about turned the heater on once n it does make a racket but ull never need it The beds are from heaven I cannot tell you how unreal they are Location is fantastic    Would have no problems in recomending Dream   To make the hotel perfect I would add the i pods a dvd player more channels on the tv and a bigger bathim quot and after  days of walking all i wanted was a bath but couldnt fit in   
P => Good location but some staff need managing Firstly the hotel reservation team did not know about an offer agreed between HSBC and itself for HSBC premier customers  Neither did the keting team   I had to send a fax with the details  To be fair the person called back to explain that the person dealing with the offer had not passed on the details  Evidently the offer only related to a discount off the rack rate   this was not specified in the offer  The hotel itself was modern as expected  The lifts were working ok   this being a problem from previous reviews  The hotel has only been open for   months and still has a number of teething problems  The staff were in the main friendly and helpful  There seems to be a problem of communication between the bellmen and the concierge as the latter could only offer a car to the airport at a charge of  whereas the bellman ordered one at  A fault with the plasma TV however was fixed within  mins of reporting the fault  Room service trays were still in the corridor  hours after being placed there  Overall some matters requiring attention but if these are overcome then it promises to be a good prospect for Midtown Manhattan  
P => Will go back to Dream I enjoyed the Dream Hotel a great deal  I found the rooms to be quite spacious for a New York hotel  There was quite a bit of street noise but thats just part of the course for alot of hotels in the city  I found the staff to be on top of their game  The concierge was very helpful in finding restaurants and making reservations  We were even served a glass of champagne courtesy of the concierge at one of the restaurants  I found that very impressive The amenities in the rooms were replaced every day  I loved the Molton Brown products  The beds were one of the most comfortable Ive ever slept in  The pillows were like sleeping on a cloud I had a chance to eat at Sarafina and had a chance to go for cocktails as well  Enjoyed both experiences  The Dream Lounge was not my cup of tea alittle to dark  The Penthouse Bar was very nice  The views of the city are fantastic from up there All in all my experience was a very good one  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  Myself I would go back in an instant  The location was great and the experience was even better  
P => In this Dream     The guest comes last OKay Im am big on first impressions  So when I arrived to The Nighte Hotel Dream  We were excited for a nice little weekend getaway in NYC  Well  Everytime we exited the hotel we litterally had to walk around the DOORMEN and open the door for ourselves    I have NO problem opening a door for myself but The thing is   each one of them were either on their Cell Phone Talking about how cheap some guests were for not tipping them enough or just wanted to stay under the heat lamp to keep warm  I am an occasional smoker and I do not have any problems with anyone who smokes But I must say it looks a little trashy to have a doorman outside smoking a cigar  When you pay the rate to stay at a hotel it is not only for the room its also the HOTEL Experience   As for our room   yes it was the size of my bathroom at home   which again I dont mind since we are not living in that space  But it also seems like they did a rush job   like the bathroom tiles in the shower were painted tinstead of replaced   there were alot of broken cracked sheet rock in the room and in the lobby  The closet is litteraly x you ccould fit two shirts a pair of pants and  pairs of shoes   cant even store your luggage in it Ipod in room      NOT AT ALL I brought my own thinking ity had a base to plug into   when I asked the Front Dest they said quotI dont know why everybody thinks we have Ipod in roomquot just because we wrote it in magazine once doesnt mean we have it    hmmm false advertising tooSerafina       If you want to eat a nice meal and get HORRIBLE SERVICE   thats the place for you  Food was good but the Service was soo sooosooo bad  Room Service Breakfast  if you order eggs it does not come with any choice of baconsausage    now an egg to me is useless without a strip of bacon    its like peanut butter without the jelly     and the kid on the phone said sorry we dont offer that   I dont even think we have bacon    low and behold  orders of over ez eggs with  cups of coffee    no refill            How this hotel is a prfered property is beyond me      it is like a trendy Holiday Inn    or at least thats where the staff has worked before   If they do not like being in the service industry    they should get out 
P => A dream come true We checked into the Dream on Christmas day and I have to admit I was very nervous after reading the scary reviews on this web page Well here is my view on the Dream Hotel We arrived at about  on Christmas day and were checked in by a very friendly member of staff we were very impressed by the or of the lobby We went up to our room and instantly said Wow when the lift door opened as there was a huge lit photo of clouds in front of the lifts These are diffrent on each floor Our room was a large room with two queen beds a fair sized bath room and a cupboard  The room was very inviting after a long flight from London with its white sheets and blue lights Very trendy and restful From reading other reviews it seems our room was larger than others in the hotel but you really do get what you pay for in this life and with a location as fantastic as this hotel offers if you want a larger room dig deep and pay for it because its on offer at this hotel The TV did not disappoint and had tons of channels to choose from The room was cleaned every morning and was always spotless the toiletries were replaced every day the maids turned down the beds each night and left an apple each evening which was a nice touch In answer to a previous posting about the temp of the rooms yes they were a bit cold but it was    over Christmas and the New Year we put the heating on while we were out and the room was just right by the time we returned The location could not be better  mins to Time square not too far to Macys and a metro station on the corner and to top if off the best cheesecake I have ever tasted in the deli right around the corner All in all we had a wonderful time in New York and in the Dream hotel I would just like to say if you are going to the Dream soon enjoy I know Ill be going back and will be sending friends and family aswell  
P => never again We are quite used to things but this was a really bad experience  For  nights we paid more than  and what did we get   a very very small room  square feet even while my partner is almost  feet  A single room and the fact that there was only one bathrobe and one amenity set made this quite clear  Also old fashioned sheets on the bed so small we stayed awake all night   Even worse the rooms were very very old fashioned absolutely not what you see on the website  Old cupboards oldfashioned tv paintings my grandmother has hanging on her wall etc  In the hallways tiles were broken on the floor and wallpaper coming off the wall  Clearly not the rooms we booked the ones with the dream conceptIpod flatscreen blue light Never seen thatOfcourse we complained at the reception desk and with the manager but their excuse was that the hotel was fully booked and because we booked via Expedia we got the worst rooms Needless to say that now we are home some letters will be written We were so disappointed    
P => Tiny room modern done cheap  Our room was a box  My friend and I had a hard time moving around  The blue neon lights are very cheesy  Room was clean but the toilet had some nasty debris floating in it  Great location  Friendly staff  Cool view of Times Square  
P => Blue lights dont make it the W Dream badly wants to be as hip as the W but it doesnt come close  Dream wants to distract you from its slapdash refurbishment job bad plaster work two different colors of white in the bathrooms holes etc  by shining blue light in the room and putting in a plasma TV  This cheapjack refurb of the old Majestic will not fool anyone over  into thinking theyre at the W which succeeds at being cutting edge as badly as Dream fails My wife and I stayed there for a few days over New Years  I knew we were in for trouble when I asked about the much touted iPod thats supposed to come with the room and they told me there was no iPod  Strike   They didnt ask if I was a smoker and simply placed us in a smoking room without asking or informing me of that  Strike   OK that was only  strikes within  minutes of checking in Then the little stuff started piling up  The concierge was rarely around  Or if someone was around theyd give you wrong information e g  sending us to a restaurant for brunch that didnt serve brunch  The guy that puts the paper outside your door at  am doesnt set it down by the door but instead throws it at the door  Youll get random numbers of towels in the bathroom of completely random quality  The windows are ill fitting and almost impossible to close completely letting in copious cold air that the heating system is ill equipped to combat and also letting in significant noise  Strike  Dream Other reviewers are correct about the  of  functioning elevators that never come because youre competing with the staff for them and the noisiness of the lower rooms  For the love of pete if they put you in a lower room facing th street insist on a new room  immediately  The garbagemen stop directly across th from the hotel every other night at a random time between  pm and  am although the staff will never tell you about this  If youre on one of the lower floors that will wreck   minutes of sleep in the middle of the night  If you insist in staying in this hotel hold out for something on the upper floors facing Broadway or in the interior  The last straw for me came the night before checkout  We needed to check out at  pm rather than noon due to the timing of our flight  However the night clerk told us that he couldnt give us late checkout and that it was up to quotthe girlsquot his words in the morning  Id have to see them about it sometime after  am  Great  If I had been at the Fairmont that would have been trivial for any clerk to handle at any time  I asked him what time the manager arrived in the morning thinking Id speak to the management  He told me quotNine be nine thirty quot That statement unintentionally sumized the lackadaisical attention to service of the Dream staff On the plus side the location is great the bellmen are professional and efficient and the two bars are as hip as the hotel desperately wants to be while maintaining much better levels of service than does the hotel  You enter the unked Dream bar through the left door in the lobby in front of the front desk  
P => Some say dream I say nighte It was so many little things that made me realize that I would have been better off at the Motel   at least I know what Im getting for my money there  The Good the lobby lounge and the Penthouse lounge were good  The staff was cordial and we enjoyed a number of evenings having a post tourism drink in comfort and style The Bad The staff  The concierge sent us to brunch at a place that had stopped serving brunch ignoring at least  restaurants within a block that did have brunch  The maid service was uneven one day wed get replacement shampoos etc  the next day nothing the next day extras  The front desk was not eager to help or to answer questions  They were uninformed regarding New Years Eve on Times Square you would think that they would know when barriers would be up and how we could return to our hotel etc  luckily the local police were wonderful and happy to answer our questions  The front desk night clerk would not per hotel policy according to him authorize us to check out an hour after regular check out time as he said quotits up to the girls who come on at   Ask Them quot The Ugly Being put onto a smoking floor without being asked if we wanted smoking was bad enough but this floor was lower on the building  Our second night we were serenaded by the recycling truck for an hour yes I timed it  Having called down to the desk a woman DID offer to move us this was after  hour  Having unpacked we choose to remain however what she did NOT tell us was that the recycling men come every other day  Twice they came around midnight and the other time New Years morning at am  The New Years serenade was followed by our free paper being delivered by being thrown at the door at am  This was followed up by everyone on the floor getting the same treatment For the money Id go elsewhere  What should have a been a dream became a nighte of no sleep for at least  nights P S  the linens were nice but the bug on the pillow wasnt  
P => More like Nighte My Stay at the Dream hotel        First impression when stepping into the hotel is great looks ultra modern  But the rooms are more like ones that you would find in a  star hotel  Though the beds are very comfortable On entering my room I noticed that is was rather small unlike the price  It was cold and there was not a safe in the room  And no mini bar though a member of staff did provide as a replacement to this  apples and  bottles of water  I asked reception if they could get an engineer to fix the problem regarding the heating and after  hours nothing was done  They did though after some prompting move me to a room which was warm  The telly is big but I did not see any Ipod  Though i was happy with the nd room  The service elevator did not work so the other  lifts were often occupied by members of staff  And on one evening only one of the lifts were working very funny evening with guests using the stairs very relaxing They lost my dry cleaning which eventually turned up the next day  In my opinion the location is great but for the price I think that they have to do more than add paint and stick a fish tank in the reception  What started as a Dream finished a nighte though I must admit at a certain points it was like fawlty towers  
P => Dream was fabulous Just got back from a wonderful weekend in the city  My husband and I stayed for two nights at Dream  We were very hesitant after reading many bad reviews  However we had a great time and really loved the hotel  The hotel is very moderntrendy perfect for  somethings looking for a fun atmosphere  Our room was quiet and the bed was very comfy  I would recommend a King size bed as an upgrade from the queen  These rooms are much bigger  The location is PERFECT   within walking distance of Time Square th Ave Central Park MoMA and Rock Center  The bathrooms are small but you are not in your room long enough to care  Hope this helps put your mind at ease if you are worried about choosing this hotel 
P => Livin The Dream Ever since booking my  night stay at Dream I have been checking reviews on this site almost daily  To say I was nervous about how my experience was going to turn out due to all the negative feedback is an understatement For anyone doing the same thing in anticipation of your Dream stay I suggest you stop stressing it was a great experienceOn the much hyped construction woes we stayed the weekend of  and saw none of it  When we returned to our room one night a new element had been added to the fishtank so they are certainly still working on things but we saw none of it  The lobby design is eclectic but very tasteful is a quotpurposeful tackyquot sort of way  Besides actual fish in the tank everything looks to be completed in the lobby execpt the elevators let us move to that   On the elevators There are two lifts working and yes there was a bit of a wait at times   but nothing long enough that irked us  Now there were grumblings about BOTH of the lifts being down Saturday night forcing guests to walk up trechorous stairs but we went to bed early that night so didnt feel that pain and I can understand why they would be upset the stairs are steeper than K  And yes they desperately need service elevators as crowding on elevators with laudry carts should not be an issue guests have to worry about but so long as you are not of an uber high matinence temperament you will find the lift situation satisfactory  and there are  more lifts comingOn the rooms Yes they are wicked small   but they are no smaller than many similar botique hotels in the city  The bed is indeed VERY delightful something that was almost a deterant as we slept in every morning during our stay because the beds were just that comfy  And washing your face is a mess due to poor planning on placement of the vanity mirror deal  Youll love the TVs   because really when in the city on vacation when are you in your room other than drift off to sleep at night with the telly on As far as service the folks there are SO delightful  It is difficult to say who the concierges are as they seem to double as the bellmen but that is the benifit   everyone can help you and they do it with a smile going above the call of duty to make you happy  I dont remeber the names of the two gentlemen who constantly helped us but youll know them by the quality of their service The Serefina resteraunt in the hotel is good   nothing amazing but the pizzas are delightful  The bar downstairs is quiant and nice  And I couldnt help but be a bit star struck when I dropped in for an after dinner night cap and P Diddy had to wait until my drink was made before ordering his  The bar was never crowded and the service and attitude is un pretentious   example after finishing half my tini I went to grab a smoke and when I returned and it had been taken up after explaining my situation there was another tini in front of me on the house with a lenghty apology to boot  The penthouse bar wasnt my bag  It is like a lengthy hallway and just didnt have a quotfeelquot or vibe of any sort  I would recommend staying downstairs for libations The location is really the star here  On the same block as the Carnagie Deli and across the street from the Applejack delicious breakfasts abound  A short walk from the shops at th Time Square any theater in the district etc  etc  In all honesty in any place Ive stayed or even any place I have seen walking about I could NOT pick ANY location in all the city that would be more centrally located and convenient to an out of town visitor  Perhaps it was because I was expecting less and was delivered more but I loved staying at Dream  In talking with folks in the elevator and throughout the hotel I did notice one thing   those around my age I am  years old shared similar tales of satisfaction while guests  plus were complaining  Take that for what it is worth but I beleive they are catering to a younger crowd I spent months trying to find info on this hotel if you havent notice there is VERY little quotrealquot info on this hotel ANYWHERE and I hung on every review on this site   so if someone out there is doing the same I say to stop worrying   you will enjoy your stay very much  
P => Nighte My parents were visiting and had booked a room here  A room with a queen size bed  They received an unreated room with a full bed  Nothing else  Not even walking space  You were either in the bed or in the hallway  No lie  One of them had to be lying down or sitting on the bed for the other to get to the bathroom    it was actually that small  The fact that there was only one bathrobe in the closet confirmed that there was no way anyone expected two people to live there  I asked for them to be moved and was told that they didnt have the kind of reservation that allowed for that  After much persuading they moved them into a reated room  No bigger and reeking of drying paint  Interestingly the bathrooms were large and lovely  Go figure  Elevator situation a nighte  Front desk staff rude and without a clue  This hotel could not be worse if it tried  And where is that IPOD we kept hearing about 
P => A real mixed bag   definitely has some kinks yet pluses too First the pros  Great location right at th amp Broadway  you can walk to virtually every mid town attraction amp restaurant  We found the space to be quite nice and roomy  we did have a suite which offered  bathrooms and a very roomyquotlivingquot room with erate TV   another plus those plasma screens are cool Uber  trendy if not downright edgey with all the blue lights and euro techno feel  better to look at than actually get comfy though form takes precedent over function here   Nice ameneties like voss water fresh fruit and paper daily even on we  Cashmere robes were great Cons  By far and a way the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at  get a room AWAY from Broadway  terrible window insulation   the bathroom with a window was FREEZING   Elevators are S   L   O   W Always a wait  Doormen sometimes there sometimes not same with concierge  Staff when you get their attention helpful but often hard to find room was made up very late every day even though maid saw us leave early   lobby is very small and uncomfortatble  not good for business Net net it has the makiings and could be a great place but definitely needs some polish  
P => A great place Much has been said about the work going on this hotel  Dont be scared about it  When we arrived and ember for a business trip stay I was pleasently surprised how little we noticed about it  Room was adequate size for our  nights stay but who wants to stay in and enjoy the fantastic bed superb plasma and dreamy blue lighting when your so close to the best NYC has got to offerAbove all the friendly staff deserves a cheer helpfull in everyway It will definetly be my preffered choice next time I am in New York  Give it go I am convinced that thing will get beter although they are currently already nearing the point of perfection IMHO 
P => Dream ROCKS I loved this hotel I was there during the soft opening so there were still kinks to be worked out but I found the staff extremely accomodating and friendly  The room was much more spacious than I had expected and the bed was the most comfortable Id ever slept in Dont get me wrong the rooms are fairly small but at least  times the size of a Schraeger property and much nicer  I really loved the fact that instead of a bible there is a book on the teachings of Buddha  A lot of little things made it just great  The best thing about the hotel is the location without doubt but if youre a drinker go to the Dream Bar and have a Key Lime tini  THEY ARE THE BESTI would stay here again and recommend it to most people  
P => The spirit of Fawlty lives on Ha Ha  Lhably bad For such a terrific location Hotel Nighte is quite something  First the positives  When you complain   as you will   the staff do try their best to remedy the situation  For example when we arrived at pm to check in after an hr flight and were told the quotroom was not ready to check in yetquot the staff grudingly bought us a drink  When   on the following day   the maid forgot to service the room   the hotel bought us dinner  If wed stayed another night we probably could have the whole stay for freeOnto the negatives staff are poorly trained  Watch how they barge past you to squeeze into the one working lift or casually slump in the main entrance occassionally mustering the energy to ask guests whether they are staying in the hotel great security guys  Some rooms are shockingly small  The s for instance  If you unlucky enough to be allocated one   demand to move asap  The hallways are a dumping ground for the room maids trolleys presumably because of a lack of storage although possibly to save time The lobby is OTT   although there is something surreal about an empty ft goldfish bowl juxtaposed to the grunts of lift engineers working furiously on some clapped out lifts  There are abnomalies such as only one dressing gown in a double room bell boys that forgot to take up your luggage even after being asked  times and  doors to get into the hotel and no one to help you at any If you must go check in with a sense of humour 
P => Still working out the kinks We stayed at the Dream Hotel for  nights for business  The hotel is still working out the kinks but if you are patient you can enjoy the stay  Positives include GREAT concierge  co is incredibly helpful with dinner reservations  Hes one of the best concierges Ive experienced in my travels  Stylish or  Rooms were average size  about the expected size for a quotboutiquequot hotel larger than the Hudson and itime  Amenities including good bath products robes and the big plasma screen  Cool bars  Cleaning service was very thorough  Convenient location near subways  Negatives Elevators that didnt work  Spotty intermittent internet service  Unstocked mini bar they should have told us this when we booked our room  Thin walls dont get a room by the elevators  Lack of climate control in the room  Phones that didnt work in the rooms  Keep in mind that there are only two very small drawers which are not enough to accommodate a long stay Overall  glitches to be worked out but the staff is trying to work with the many problems to insure a pleasant stay  I would not pay what we paid to stay there again until they are fully functional and you get what you pay for or at least what is advertised on the website  However I think that the hotel will be a nice addition to the NYC hotel scene once the kinks are worked out  
P => Frustration and some Fun We were intrigued by the descriptions online and expected a freshnewly reated hotel  However the minute we arrived we realized that the hotel was merely a partially reworked old hotel  There was extensive construction in the lobby only one working elevator and an overworked staff  The room and bathroom were quite small and the shelf above the sink was badly placed  There is no iPod in the room although the online descriptions promise one  All of that being said the plasma TV Bose sound system and blue lighting were quite el  The room keys were also quite original  The highlights of the room are definitely the Kashwere robes and comfortable bed Overall it is still very much a work in progress   a fact that should be noted online and reflected in the price which is too high for its current state  
P => Not quite a Dream on th Street We arrived on Monday th  afternoon and waited until after  pm until a room was ready  Not ideal after a  plus hour transatlantic flight  The room we were shown had a queen size bed and was VERY small  Miniscule closet space and minimal floor space  As we were staying for  nights we complained immediately  To his credit the manager got back to us promptly and without hesitation upgraded us to king size better closet space and a gorgeous enormous and comfortable bed  Floor space far better too  Bathroom about the same size small bath but with a powerful and hot shower The or is very BLUE electric blue lights on the landing on a glass topped desk in the room and under the bed be not to everyones taste but the hotel is at least trying to distant itself from the efficient but samey mid town hotels sprinkled around the area Main gripes Only two slow lifts are working though a third should be online at some point   we were on the third floor and often used the stairs   not so convenient for those higher up  They are still working on the hotel I found myself on the st floor and saw a number of workmen still kitting out the rooms  The sound of the workmen could often be heard early ish most mornings  The hotel and the surrounding are can be very NOISY   the windows do not do a very good job of insulating against the sonic assault on the streetsThe lobby is still being worked on a two storey aquarium was still being installed when we left th   The lobby itself is a cornucopia of styles that be doesnt quite work We had to request a BOSE radio which are worth getting and a hairdryer Plus pointsThe Serafina the restaurant attached to the hotel does great pizzas and pasta not cheap but they do room service and very handy if you just want to chill and have a meal in your room The plasma screens in the rooms are cool but do not show the  plus channels as advertised in the hotel blurb  be they will in the future but its more like  at the moHotel staff on the whole very helpful  The smiley concierge patiently helped us book tickets for the Statue of Liberty Close to the subway Broadway Times Square Hope people reading find this long ish but comprehensive review useful  The hotel is definitely worth considering and will undoubtedly get better in time but please bear in mind the above before you book  
P => Needs a little work  but all in all really cool We stayed here this weekend  yes  they do need to quottweakquot some things  My sister was staying there and the first night we stayed in the room with her they were all booked up due to the NYC athon on Sat  night  Bed is HUGE  enough for  sisters to sleep comfortably  and the duvet was so comfy The second night we moved to our own room which was actually nicer than the first room  The first room was missing the Bose radio and hair dryer  and the neon light under the bed did not work  But they assured us that this would be taken care of ASAP  Nice that the maids brought us free bottled water and apples in case we needed a midnight snack nd room was nice  with dual shower heads in the shower awesome view  Beautiful bathroom  with good towels soft robes and good shampoo conditioners and lotions  and I loved the simple mod furniture  only complaint was that one of the outlets was broken  Membership to Golds Gym is complimentary for the week  And they had huge flat screen TVs in each room and great lighting in those rooms  The lobby WAS a little over done  too big statue overpowered a quotloungequot section  Penthouse bar  was nice  and packed Great view The lounge and restaurant on the first floor were really cooly orated  although we did not eat there  The maids were VERY nice as well as the bellboys  Most of the desk workers were nice  one man seemed a little bit short though  Location is great within walking distance of lots of great retaurants landks and stores  They are on the right track here  I think when the hotel is completed that it will be great

P => NYC Rules Convenient Locations to almost anything Located on th street this Four Points is located off the main area of Times Square Broadway etcetera but that isnt a bad thing  There was less noise glitter and lights than those other places  The hotel was located right off th Avenue and there was always a cab driving by so there was no wait standing around on the streets We were nine blocks from Magnificent Macys and walked up to Times Square and the Central Park area every day  We took a cab to Lower Manhattan  Great location for just about anything   will definitely stay here again The room was small as everyone else has stated but the ONLY time we were there was to go to bed at night  If you spend more time in the room in NYC other than that then you shouldnt be in the City anyways  I didnt see where the hallways were dark   there wasnt much of a hallway period  The rooms were very quiet as I didnt hear from anybody else on our floor yet I saw several people coming in and out of the hotel We stayed on the th floor with a great view of the Empire State Building Although the room didnt have wifi it did have an ethernet cable provided to plug into for fast connections to the internet  The bath was big enough for our needs and there were four adults in the room 
P => Would not stay at this hotel again While adequate and not a disaster by any means this isn t a hotel I would select for a future stay in Manhattan simply because far nicer hotels can be had for a lower price in superior locations  Even if using priceline this hotel isn t a bargain by any means  If I had to sum up the feel of this hotel in one word it would be  claustrophobic  LocationThis hotel is on a very dead side street on the border of what is supposedly Chelsea  It s a few blocks to the subway station but it is desolate at night and quite uncomfortable to walk some of those blocks  There is nothing happening around the hotel at night and very little in the daytime  On the plus side this means it s a quiet hotel which  suit some people  Lobby rooms and bedsThe tiny lobby in this hotel leads to immediate feelings of claustrophobia which are vastly magnified when more than five people stand in the space  The downstairs bar is also cramped  The rooms are very very small even by NYC standards and the tiny hallways leading to them are even more claustrophobic  Once a tray is placed outside a room it is hard to walk around as the hotel is so small that only a few rooms exist on each floor  Oddly only parts of the rooms have been reated in recent years which means while you  be treated to a newer bed or carpet the furniture is bound to be of the dinged up cheapo particle board variety from the s  This was really dising and gave the rooms a pretty awful aged look  Both the rooms we had were a definite mixture of old and new  Terribly old run down duvet with many lint balls permanently attached across the surface but relatively new sheets and mattress Horrible ked up ancient and ugly furniture but new carpet  Small ancient TVs but at least they functioned which is more than I can say about many a NYC hotel room  The windows in both rooms were so filthy it was difficult to see out of the grime  On the plus side the windows are some of the best in the city in terms of noise reduction ability  The dark d cor in the rooms makes one feel even more imprisoned  BathroomsOf our two rooms both had full reations in tiling and sink area but only one had a reated shower  This was quite a contrast as the older shower was one of those ancient sliding glass door varieties where the door doesn t quiet sit right  For those who like a bit of space around their sink area and can t deal with mini sinks made for tiny hotel rooms be prepared  While I quite liked the new reated sink area and adequate toiletries I could easily see that anyone in need of space wouldn t be able to handle these tiny bathrooms especially the miniscule sink Temperature controlAmazingly they use ancient window units Staff The desk folks were always very friendly and helpful  Housekeeping really did a great job cleaning the rooms not so much clearing the hallways which were always cluttered  However the permanent aging and staining that already existed in the rooms made it hard to get past the  rundown  impression upon entering the room even if it was cleaned well each day InternetThere are free terminals and printers in a business center on the first floor literally in the coffee barcaf  area of the hotel  This is a great plus if you can get on one  
P => Nice Stay My yr old dhter and I stayed for  nights at the Four Points Chelsea and had a good stay  Yes the rooms are small by American standards but I found that there was plenty of room to move around and I did not spend that much time in the room anyway  Staff was courteous and the hotel was quiet  The only real problem I had was that the curtains didnt completely keep out the light  Great view from the st floor and convenient to all of the West side attractions  
P => Great athon Stay I booked this room through points we had accumulated on Starwood Preferred Guest Amex Card  We stayed three nights arriving on Friday around  PM  Contrary to some other reviews we found the staff to be young courteous and almost overly friendly  They had the lobby orated for Halloween with candy bowls etc  The lobby was not confusing at all although the sliding doors between the vestibule and the outside are slightly offcenter so you have to kind of walk through them diagonally  Anyway very fast check in and just two blocks from the  and  redline subway at rd St and th Ave which made getting uptown or downtown very easy  Our room was on the th floor I believe and was one of only a handful  Rooms are def a bit dark and modern but were very clean and we did not feel cramped at all  Bed was very comfortable and we slept well except for the first night where we accidentally left the window cracked and the street noise could be heard  Once we shut that it was quite noise proof  No wireless internet in the room but they did have free wired access so just a matter of plugging an ethernet cable into the back of the laptop  A little less convenient to be tethered to the desk but otherwise no problem  Honestly I dont understand the problems others had with this hotel  How much time do you really spend in your room anyway when youre in NYC The protesters have long gone so that was not a worry either  I ran the athon on Sunday and got a very good nights sleep on Saturday night in the comfortable bed  Shower is a bit modern in that it is only arated from the rest of the bathroom floor by the curtain  Again not a major inconvenience more a modern style detail  Bathroom was clean as was the rest of the room Very little waiting for elevators which is a nice aspect in smaller boutique hotels like this one  Would definitely stay here again for the proximity to the subway and cleanliness and friendly staff There is a Whole Foods ket around the corner on th which was open late on Sunday night with a plethora of great food  We ate at a fantastic Barbeque joint called Righteous Urban Barbeque on rd also just a short walk  Great brisket sandwhich and empanadas  There was also a great affordable Mexican Restaurant and a  hour Chelsea Diner on rd with awesome burgers  Also worth checking out on rd is Trailer Park  Kitschy inside and fairly ent bar food Great location solid accommodations easy access to subway  What more could you want 
P => Didnt like the  Points This is a medium sized hotel located in Chelsea NY  The location is not very attractive the looks of the street are quite poor and at night its dark poor lighting  Not many nice restaurant options in the vecinity The rooms are very small and look smaller as a result of the dark painting  The rooms are not very clean the bathroom looks tired Breakfast restaurant attached to the hotel is fine  Service is courteous no complaints with the food scrambled eggs Front desk service is efficient and courteous 
P => Terrible Hotel This hotel is awful  It is truly the closest I will ever come to staying in a prison cell  The rooms are pitifully small and very dark  Walls are painted a dark brown carpet and tile are black the bedspreads are black with holes in them  The doors bathroom and entry are painted to look like stainless steel  The furniture is dark and scratched I arrived late at night and there was no water in my room and the TV did not work  I was moved to a quotPreferred Starwood Suitequot had to re pack my things and imagine my surprise when I discovered the room to which I was moved was identical to the one I just left with the exception that it had a coffee maker  It was the same or same square footage same view  Truly awful  
P => Nice and central hotel We liked our room with  double beds a lot  True the room is a bit dark but stylish spacious and modern  The location is very central and close to the nice streets shops and restaurants in chelsea  We had a great stay and found an offer buy  get one free  We would recommend this hotel 
P => Room  is a dirty dump a Sheraton in name only I arrived at am and was exhausted so didnt do my usual room inspection before saying yes and moving my luggage in   what a mistake  Dirt on the bathroom floor high miscellaneous hair count not mine mold and mildew all over show tiles burns on carpet left over hairpins on floor desk chair was a refuge from banquet dept  easy chair had huge tears on both arms and the carpet hasnt been properly vacuumed in some time  I called the managers office and housekeeping sent a supervisor who called it quotappallingquot and moved me to another room  I asked quotwho supervises the work the maids doquot Three people cover  rooms so they are too busy to deal with many problems  Nobody seems to care in this hotel and it is full of bus tour and airline staff guests who have no other choice so they can get away wit h calling this shabby shack at Sheraton  Its like a roadside motel stacked up  floors high Wisely the hotel did not charge me for my night in room   Stay elsewhere the Sheraton NY Towers across the street is a completely different experience  Will I consider Four Points by Sheraton for another stay anywhere Heck no  
P => Awful Very small rooms that are not clean  Staff is uninformed  Lots of better options elsewhere 
P => Not what I have expected The good  It is located near Whole Foods  It is walking distance to most areas we walked from this hotel everyday to th The rest  Expect mid s crowd Expect check in not friendly men are better than women Expect room to be dark dark brown wall and carpet with small size windows also dark brownblack titles in the bathroom Expect individual air condition unit rather than central air noisy Expect room to be very small measure before you go  It is about sq ft for the entire room  Yes small is expected for NY but this size room isnt suitable for international passenger with large luggage ok for overnight guest with boston bag  Remember the room has either king or two double beds Expect shower basin to be light brown used to be creamy white when its new  The hotel is only four years old  I bought cleaner but couldnt remove anything  
P => Perfect for My Quick Trip to NYC I got a fabulous rate on the hotel website night for a king room  I flew into Newark took the AirTrain to Penn Station and then walked a few short blocks to the hotel which is tucked away on nondescript th Street right near the intersection with th Avenue  The hotel is convenient to several subway stops so going uptown or downtown was easy  My friends and I were also able to walk through Chelsea to Union Square even down to the West Village I enjoyed being away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square The room was well appointed and perfect for my short stay  
P => Stylish and efficient Chelsea hotel but avoid the breakfast We stayed here for three nights in early e  It was an easy walk from Penn Station  Our th floor room with two double beds was reasonably sized for NYC and had an efficient layout  There was a nice view of the top of the Empire State Building from our window  The amenities and styling were splendid for this level of hotel  The free Wi Fi worked well  Note that some floors have a fairly loud ice machine and it is located about  inches from someone s door happily not on our floor  We had some vouchers for a continental breakfast or fruit plate one day and one of us  upgraded  to the waffles  Big mistake as they were straight from the freezer and the price was   The fruit plate had some good pineapple and raspberries but the cantaloupe was completely inedible unacceptable for a  item  We recommend that you just walk over to the Garden of Eden ket on rd St  between th and th Avenues and get some really delicious fruit and bagels for a lot less  There were several subway stations nearby  One caution the hotel is on the edges of the newly trendy Chelsea  East of th Avenue the neighborhood gets quite a bit rougher  
P => Great Find in Chelsea Overall a pleasant surprise On our annual girls trip to Manhattan we were unable to book a room at our first choice the W Hotel  However the reservation agent at Starwood found us a great bargain at the Four Points Sheraton in Chelsea  The rooms were a little small but typical for Manhattan  The rooms included free internet access if you bring your laptop and free access to the internet and a printer in the business center  The property was clean staff was very friendly and rates were resonable again for Manhattan standards  We were warned of the potential for protestors by the hotel in our confirmation e mails when we booked and the ones that were sent days before check in but we experienced no protestors  Also the location is great just over  blocks from the PATH train walking distance to the Village and a couple of blocks in either direction to the subways  Also easy to hail a cab as there is usually one waiting outside the property  We have gotten much less from hotels in Manhattan for much more money and we all agreed we would definintely stay here again  
P => The Space Between Us The HotelThe hotel itself is nice enough  The lobby is fairly nice comfy waiting chairs   not that I ever had to wait long to talk to someone  At first our card key didnt work but they were quick to replace it  Very pleasant to talk to and generally personable  They have a loungerestaurant with good food and terrible dining atmosphere  I suppose if you just wanted to have a couple drinks and chill out it would be nice but for dining the set up was not good  They dont impose a tip unlike many places in Manhattan  They held our bags without incident on our last day in the Big Apple   nothing lost nothing stolen The RoomA lot of people are complaining about the space     I dont know what type of hotels they usually stay in but compared to almost every European hotel this room was very adequate  I didnt feel cramped at all  There was a TV with a small sample of cable channels and room service although their first trip through the hotel is a little early for those of us who like to sleep in always did a good job of cleaning up and refreshing the room for when my wife and I came home  HOWEVER and this is where I took all the points off my wife and I celebrating our  year anniversary were FORCED to sleep in two double beds All the king sized rooms I guess there is a very limited amount were booked and because we booked through Hotwire we are last in the queue for the good rooms  On a non hotel note Hotwire only gave us  HotBucks for having to spend our week away in arate beds  Lame  Excessively lame LocationVery close to the Subway  amp  and NRW amp Q lines  Just a couple stops from Times Square and in a fairly nice neighbourhood  I was never worried about getting mugged at night OverallIm sure if you book directly and pay full price theyll give you what you want but if youve booked through Hotwire I hope you dont plan on sleeping in the same bed as whomever youve booked with 
P => Tough Call   Bad first impression but worth the stay I read that people had lost their room when checking in late in the evening due to over booking by the hotel Knowing wed arrive at about pm I emailed to confirm the reservation and the lateness of our arrival and received a confirmation back that the room would be available and we wouldnt get moved However upon arrival I was told that there were no rooms available that night due to overbooking  After  hours on the road and our body clock on am the next day neither I or my heavily pregnant wife were in the mood to be moved  They insisted nothing could be done and graciously offered us a room in another hotel   paid for and a refund on our room for the nightNot prepared to waste one of our five days in New York shifting between accommodation I demanded a manager deal with the issue as the receptionist wasnt budging  A phone call to said manager and a room became available  On one of the executive guest floors where they can pre check in without actually being at the hotelThat aside the hotel is very nice the staff are very polite and pleasent  The location is fantastic  One block from the subway and walking distance to most major places   The Rock Times Square Empire State th Avenue e t c  And if you get too tired then a taxi is about  to most major parts The rooms   yes they are not big but what do you want a palace They are very clean and tidy  The maid makes the bed every day and you dont hear much in the way of noise  Ive stayed in far smaller much worse places for more money  I would stay here again despite the issue on the first night  If they try and bump you from your room   put your foot downP S   The bar does  for  on drinks   great pre dinner idea 
P => Great Stay One of the best in New York Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Chelsea is one of the best hotels in New York  It has a great location Your close to every single popular part of New York  The staff are very nice But there is one staff member that really makes the hotel look bad she is always in a really bad mood  But most of the staff are really nice The protesters are not even there they are not in front of the hotel all quite  I dont get why people put reviews saying that the protesters are shouting They ARE NOT THEREOverall this is a really good hotel and in a great location very honest staff members P S  Of you get a chance go to the Malibu Diner they have great food there Breakfast Lunch and Diner  Great food thereP S  Will make other comment with photos soon 
P => Not the best definitely not the worst I booked  nights at the hotel for a work trip  I loved that it was less than a  minute walk from Penn at the outskirts of the fun Chelsea district  Chipotle Starbucks Whole Foods   lots of places around to grab something to eat or drink and many restaurants in the area as well My confirmation email mentioned something about strikers outside the hotel and I called on Monday to learn more  Something about union vs non union workers   I dont know the full story  There were no protesters on Monday night Tuesday AM or PM and Wed   all was quiet The lobby is small and feels transient  The hotel was sold out of king beds so I had a room with two double beds  The room could have been cleaner  The carpet wasnt well vaccumed either of the days I was there  I tested this by leaving the crumbs I found in the spot they were found in  Still there after I checked out  The sheets on one of the beds had some funky stains on them  The room was dusty too  For the love I cant understand why the bathroom did not have a soap dish  It was very strange  The bathroom itself was a pretty good size and the shower was fine  There was room for a soap dish but alas   I called the front desk around midnight for new pillows   ones that werent down  I couldnt reach anyone in housekeeping and after about  rings the front desk the woman hurriedly answered and asked if she could call me back in a minute  I said sure  After  minutes I got tired of waiting and called her back to ask for some non down pillows that I wouldnt be allergic to  She apologized for not calling me back and someone came up right away This is minor but a huge pet peeve of mine  Many of the desk documents what to do in the cityinfo on the hotel were tattered dirty or printed on basic white paper that looked like it had seen better days  I know other people have stayed in this room but be you could refresh some of the docs and be print them all on the same paper Its the little things that go a long way All in all if the price is right and you want to be near Penn St and Chelsea and you dont mind not staying in a perfect hotel than check out the  pts  
P => Lovely Boutique Hotel with a few flaws This hotel is based in the Chelsea district not one of the nicest streets in New York but conveniently located between sixth and seventh avenue just a  minutes walk away from the Madison Square Garden and  Minutes from Times Square The hotel lobby is quite small but cosy with a nice sometimes overwhelming cinnamon smell in the air Hotel staff at the front desk are not too friendly or enthusiastic except for one lady you will soon know who is meant but they do an alright job The hotel rooms are quite small but you get an awesome view from one of the upper floors  The rooms have all the amenities you could wish for including a big tv and a big shower and the beds are just divine  I have never slept in such a comfortable bed than this one  The cleaning lady does a very accurate job with the bed sheets Some people here have complained about the small size of the room but it is sufficient to store all your clothes your luggage etc  and besides youre in New York City youre not going to stay in your room all day long Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was ok nothing spectaculare you get free internet in the bar and the happy hour is just great  Go say hi to Jenna  A great great Whole Foods Superket is just around the block it is worth a peak  Starbucks just around the corner as well Concerning the picketing one barely notices it I dont see the big deal   and besides according to the hotel management it is not even Four Points workers who are demonstrating Overall it is a good choice as an hotel if you are in NYC as a tourist  I cant say much about the room price though as I stayed there on Starwood points  
P => Avoid at ALL costs Strikers will wake you up by screaming amp chanting Hotel is suing strikers strikers are suing hotel not a pleasant place to stay  Hotel will basically offer you a danish and juice for putting up with all of the noise  PATHETIC 
P => Could not have been better Recently stayed at this property could not haev been a better stay except if I had been able to stay longer Easy on line reservation and nice reminder email  Stayed here before so knew the location area etc  Arrived at the hotel early red eye flight from the West Coast around am  Able to check into my room immediately a big plus Greeted by smilesa nd hello in fact all interactions with the staff lobby restaurant maid were pleasant  Everyone greeted with a hello and smile  Even given coupons for free breakfast very nice surprise Room was not the largest but comfortable and well laid out  On the top floor looking south great day and evening views  Love the beds  papers outside my door in the morning another surprise Plus Early checkin Complimentary breakfast Complimentary papers Welcoming friendly staff LocationCon What is up with that alarm clock Could never get it to work Wake up call was late by  minutes   Was already in the shower when it went off   All in all a great experience  
P => Small Rooms Smaller Lobby I booked  nights at this hotel for the first part of my honeymoon in  of  using my SPG points  We arrived at the hotel around pm on a Monday and had to wait over an hour in a tiny overcrowded lobby for our room to be ready  The room itself ended up being the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in  Granted it is in NYC but this barely meets Four Points and Sheraton standards  The ice maker on our floor didnt work we ordered a movie on the TV that unexpectedly shut off  minutes in and the slowness of the free internet in the adjacent restaurant was not much better than a K modem  Outside of the great location and helpful staff this wasnt a great experience but hey we were in NYC so we minmized our time in the hotel  
P => Not up to much Totally underwhelmed by this hotel from its scruffy lobby and dingy bar to its lipstick on a pig bedrooms that in the cold light of day bear little resemblance to the website photos  In its favour is a great safe location with easy walking access to the main tourist amp business areas and a fabulous Whole Foods round the corner  Safe and clean its only a good deal if you get it for sub   If it costs more you can get better value for money elsewhere  
P => Good Hotel ent Location We booked this hotel as a Starwood reward night  One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because of the location which is convenient to restauarants and are galleries in Chelsea The staff was very nice and helpful  We stayed on a Saturday and there were not any protestors while we were there Yes the rooms are small however this is common for Manhattan  The or was modern and the room and bathroom were clean  One complaint about the bathroom is that there is very little room for your personal belonings  Another or different shelf would probably help  The view wasnt great but not expected for that part of the city The machines in the workout room need some maintenance as both treadmills were not working properly  It is very easy to walk to restaurants and Chelsea art galleries  To get a taxi just walk down to th Avenue and there is a Whole Foods right on the corner  Although breakfast was free it took an extremely long time to get service and get our food  The staff was very friendly however and did what they could to make the experience better  They were severly understaffed which  be attributed to the strike  Overall it is a good hotel in a good location  
P => Good place but bad bussiness model I stayed for  nights starting with New Years Eve  Lobby and rooms do not look as nice as in the pictures from the hotel website  There is a cheap feeling to this hotel  I am sure it is better than other hotels in New York but I have been in   stars hotels that felt better My main complain is that as of my stay the management has stopped providing employer funded health insurance for their employees  There were protests in front of the hotel which were starting at am each morning  If your room is on that side you will not be able to sleep after that time  These two reasons are enough for me to not return  
P => Satisfactory The Sheraton Four Points  Like many other reviewers the first thing I will note is that the rooms are VERY small but I understand this is typical for NYC  The hotel was clean front desk staff friendly amp helpful room was clean quiet and or was chic  Room was a little dark  As noted previously ask for an updgrade to a King room away from ice machines  Overall a satisfactory stay  no quotwowquot factor but very passable  Location is good but one thing to note is that there is nothing restaurant  wise that is very close  at least that we could find Whole Foods across the street is great  I would stay again for the right price  
P => Acceptable but not exciting  At the time of reserving the room the hotel was about  out of  NYC hotels and thats right where Id put it    just a little above average  As others have written the protesters were an annoyance but the staff is friendly  Free internet is a plus along with snacks at the desk in the morning  The room was functionally laid out but crowded  The exercise room was ginal but at least one of the treadmills worked and it was odd that the only access was via the elevator to the basement  Whole Foods nearby was nice as well as another similar store with a Biblical name a block further  The elevators could have been cleaner  We used the buses rather than the metro     at least you can see the city  
P => labor dispute still going on Ive stayed here twice in the last month  Both times stayed on low floors  Both times facing the street where the chants were clearly audible starting around am and still running when I got back from the office at pm The room itself is nice enough and I have sympathy for workers in general but they definitely succeeded in making my stay unpleasant  The management needs to do something to address whats going on  
P => Small rooms angry protesters My wife and I stayed at the Four Points in Chelsea for  days  nights and had booked a month in advance  When we arrived we were blasted by angry protesters yelling at us  We had no idea what was going on and when we asked the manager at the front desk Allan he just said it was some sort of labor dispute and brushed it off like it was normal to be screamed at when you check into a hotel in New York City  Everytime we walked in or out of the hotel the protesters were there screaming at us  Thank god we didnt have our children with us  I suggest to anybody booking this hotel that they call ahead and find out if the protest is over  It made for a very unpleasant experience  The rooms were also tiny  
P => Great NYC hotel staple I was on the road a lot last year and traveled to NY every couple of weeks  I stayed at this Sheraton each and every time  Not only were they kind enough to honor the corporate rate when Id beg them to let me book a last minute stay theyd accommodate me even when they were full even though I didnt have Starwood platinum level membership  The location is super   close to all the subway lines and in walking distance to Union Square Chelsea the West Village Gramercy Park Times Square Penn Station etc   plus theres a Whole Foods on the corner if you need anything  I ordered breakfast from Ume restaurant most morning sand it was always on time and pretty good  The rooms are well orated modern quiet fully functional no broken ac bugs etc clean relatively spacious at least compared to the Hudson the Time etc and conducive to working  Free internet is a nice touch  Beds are comfy too  The bar downstairs is cute and has nice cocktails  This is an ideal hotel for business travel though Id also stay there if I was just visiting  
P => Pleasantly surprised We stayed heere one night in early ember came in for the weekend to see a show and shop  Unfortunately this was also NY athon weekend so most hotels were fully booked and those that werent were outrageously priced Staff was helpful and friendly   We were able to check in earlier than the allowed time  Room was clean and in very good condition  It was small as most in NYC are  Overall the room was nicer than I expected  There is a restaurant downstarirs got coffee ther in the morning and it was good  There is also a bar  Other than that the hotel is basic without the amenities of larger hotels  But for this trip we didnt need those as we were out and about most of the time  Reminds me a little of a boutique hotel Neighborhood is safe and there are restaurants and shops right there even a Wholefoods on the corner  The neighborhood is quieter than midtown which can be a plus Subway is close by and the midtown area where we apent most of our time was a quick easy cab ride away Next time if possible Id like to stay in Midtown as that is where we spend our time  But if it is booked I would gladly stay at the Four Points again  We were very comfortable there  
P => loved it I enjoyed my stay at this hotel very much  Wonderful location Only a few blocks away from all subway lines  Good restaurants and breakfast places around the hotel  Small room but very clean  Hotel staff helpful and very professional  
P => The nicest Four Points youll find If youve never stayed at this Four Points the first thing you should know is that it is completely unlike other Four Points you  have stayed at which are usually minimal service business hotels  The Four Points Chelsea is a basically a pretty cool boutique hotel in a centrally located part of Manhattan  The rooms are small but nice including amenties like flat screen TVs and a free bottle of water  The lobby is very hipquot with music playing cool looking Europeans sitting around and a bar and a restaurant that both look trendy and probably are overpriced   but I didnt eat there I have nothing bad to say about this place  The rooms were clean  The service was good  They offered me a pm late checkout because Im SPG Gold  In fact I was able to stay here using Starwood CashampPoints for  and  points which is a real steal   if youre going to NYC check spg com for CashampPoints deals   they are the best Location wise This hotel is centrally located in the sense that it is easy walked distance to many interesting areas like Union Square Times Square Herald Square even Greenwich Village isnt too far away  And the public transit situation is great  However the immediately around the hotel there isnt really that much of interest   although there is a Whole Foods around the corner in case you need to pick something up Some recommended eats in the areaEisenbergs lunch on th and nd   old timey FANTASTIC FampB   top notch hot dogs and sausages on rd betw ampChat n Chew   union square   comfort foodTheres a ton of good eating in the area  You wont be disappointed  
P => Love the location I was looking for a location in chelsea and came across the Four Points  I was a little skeptical at first since i never stayed at a Four Points before but to my surprise it was one of the best experiences I had in New York This hotel is situated right in the middle of everything  Subway stations are  blocks down on rd street and get you anywhere in the city  The hotel lobby was a bit busy at checkin but it was pm and everyone wanted to checkin and experience the city  The staff were very friendly and greeted us everytime we entered the hotel  not something I expected My overall experience at this hotel was amazing I will definitely be visiting this place again  
P => Effecient Stayed for  nights with my wife during a NYC city break using SPG points  Hotel is a great location including several subway stations and a giant Wholefoods very nearbyHotel covers all bases competently from prompt room service good shower and great bed etc and room size was ent for NYC  We personally liked the wet room concept for the ensuite  On the negative side the gym is over advertised it is  machines in a cramped room and although I didnt pay with cash I know the normal room rate is c      per night which seems pretty steep and I dont think I would have personally paid this     but then again I have always had good service within the Starwood group both on business and personal so perhaps this is the price of confidence 
P => Great little hotel for a reasonable price  The rooms are a bit small they somehow look bigger in the photos on the SPG site as are the elevators but have comfortable beds and views of the Empire State Building and the interesting water towers on the roofs of buildings if you are in one of the Deluxe rooms on a higher floor Standard rooms on lower floors look into the office building across the street   so if you like to walk around au natural youll need to keep the curtains shut or ask for a higher floor  The staff is very helpful and friendly  The room service from the restaurant in the lobby was fast and the girl who delivered the food looked like a supermodel  The fish and chips were excellent  The Internet worked great but was not wireless  This is by no means a luxury hotel but is clean conveniently located and excellent for the price compared to some other overpriced hotels in NYC  
P => Good hotel but beware of strike outside We are currently staying at this hotel for a few days and since our arrival a group of hotel workers have been on strike outside the entrance to the hotel  While the hotel is fine on many levels it is definitely uncomfortable to be confronted with aggressive picketers who yell at the guests as they enter or exit the hotel  As a guest unaware of the situation and actually sympathetic to the workers cause it it still a bit annoying to be yelled at and to be made to feel guilty    we had no idea there were issues at this particular hotel and I feel the hotel should be upfront about the fact it is happening  We would have chosen an alternate place to stay had we been made aware of the strike Looking at other reviews other guests in tember had to deal with this issue as well  Too bad because the rooms are fine albeit tiny room for only ONE bed side table in a king size bed room and tiny bathrooms the hotel staff is very friendly the hotel is clean    Again the hotel per se is good but it is really too bad the issues between the hotel management and the workers affect our experience so greatly    
P => Workers on strike outside of my window I stayed at this hotel for work from   to    I usually stay at other Starwood properties in NYC but the rates were pretty cheap for the Four Points  What a mistake Every morning I got woken up by striking hotel workers  I was on the th floor and could hear them chanting   God only knows what When ever I walked out of the hotel they pubically shamed me  The place was crawling with security and guards outside of the hotel  The rooms were small and the bed covers smelled like they havent been washed in years  I complained to one of the workers and they looked at me like I was speaking another language  Ive never had an experience like this at a hotel  I cant believe that I paid to stay at this place  
P => Great Stay Short amp simple stayed here for one night and everything went smooth  The rooms are small however they are in great shape  I have stayed in many of the starwood properities in nyc and have to say this is the best bang for the buck  The only problem I did have is they did not have valet service  Granted the garage was a few blocks over it would have been nice to have the car parked for you  Would stay here again 
P => Terrific stay at the Four Points We visit NYC about three times a year and this was arguably the best stay we had in the many years weve visited  We hadnt explored Chelsea before and this trip absolutely convinced us to always pick this hotel Chelsea is a very cute neighborhood with plenty of couples and families  Its an easy walk to Times Square and theater district  but why stop there Explore downtown too the East and West Villages NoHo and SoHo  Youll be pleasantly surprised  The Chelsea ket is on th Ave between W th and th Streets  It is truly fantastic for foodies  My non foodie better half liked the offerings at the Ronnybrook Milk bar  Try the vanilla milkshake sausage and egg croissant and cast iron eggs  You wont need to eat for another six hours After the ket walk down further and check out the shops in the West Village like the Japanese superstore Uniqlo for some basic items  A couple blocks later on Mercer Street vel at the superb pieces in bathroom design at the Toto showroom  If youre looking for a unique scent head to Lafco NY on LaFayette Street  As for the picket what picket Get out early come in late  Youll miss it  Booked stay through SPG com used Starwood points Stayed in room    SPG floorBathroom was much bigger than most NYC hotel bathrooms  Cute bath items from Caswell Massey with a yummy lemon verbena scent  The king sized bed was quite comfy and comparable to Westins Heavenly bed which has a softer pillow top Other hotels weve stayed at in NYCSheraton Manhattan Tower near Times SquareW Hotel on LexVarious Choice hotels near Time Square 
P => Wonderful Hotel It was a great stay right from the beginning  The front desk staff was as friendly as can be and always went out of their way to help us in anyway we needed  There was a protest going on outside the hotel which sure didnt make sense as to how only a handful of the employees were out there protesting one minute and then coming in to work at the hotel they were just protesting about  If they really feel the hotel is being unfair or breaking laws QUIT and FIND ANOTHER JOB  No one is bound to a job and if they are unhappy they should quit not protest  That sure didnt make sense and only proves their protest is only when its convenient for them  Screaming out quotDont Check In Check Outquot it completely absurd  Do the protestors realize that the less people that check in the less rooms there are to clean which results in less staff needed Please people      make sense when you protestDespite the annoying disturbance outside the hotel handled everything fantastically and even took the forethought to call before my check in date to advise of the protest and offer cancellation with no penalty  Now thats customer service at its finest  I will definitely be staying at the Four Points next month and every time thereafter  
P => Do not book  There is currently  as of rd t an employeeunion dispute on  While the hotel itself was fine  room very small  we were greeted by protestors shouting as you leave the main door in the morning  The hotel have also employed security staffso they are present in and out of the hotel also  I have never passed a picket and am angry that the hotel did not advise of this beforehand  
P => Family Stay in Lower Manhattan I used SPG points for this one night stay in lower Manhattan with my family husband and two kids  Great location  Nice clean modern rooms  Yes they are on the smaller side but you arent here to stay in a resort setting and spend time in your room  Some nice bonuses are the outdoor seating in front of the hotel for the bar and the Whole Foods ket right around the corner  Would definately stay here again if I were passing throught NYC and needed a place to stay for a night or two  I belive the paid rates were not bad either for NY  
P => In the Middle of a Labor Dispute My sister and I traveled to NY from MD for one night  to see a concert in the area and booked a stay at the Sheraton  Points in Chelsea  Prior to our arrival we received email confirmation from the hotel and even several updates on the latest weather forcast for our visit  After all of this communication prior to our arrival it was surprising to find out there were VERY vocal picketers posted outside the hotel protesting and had been for many days but no mention or pre warning about that in any of our emails  Now I understand that advertising that your business is being picketed is not usually something thats good for business but neither is having your customers from out of state walk into a land mine like that  Once inside the hotel the staff really wanted to avoid even discussing what was happening and handed us a very short memo from the manager stating if we had any concerns we could call the listed contact number  I dont know about other rooms in this hotel but the sound proofing in our room on the front facing the street was like you were out in the open   the noise was amazing  Long story short at am the next morning the protesters returned and were milling around in front of the hotel and several shouted wake up wake up and then around  the full chants and horns began at fever pitch  For these lovely accomodations they wanted to charge us close to  for one night  After a few calls to the manager about the insanity of that he agreed to reduce the bill based on the circumstances  Obviously that is the right thing to do but why does it take the customer having to pitch a fit about an obvious problem before someone does the right thing  Advice to travelers going to this hotel check out the protest situation prior to booking unless you enjoy being in the middle of a labor dispute  and being awaken at am  
P => Great Experience Got a great deal with Priceline at  a night  My wife and I loved this hotel  Helpful staff very friendly  The hotel has a good location in the middle of the city  The nearest subway is a few blocks away but its not too far at all  The room was nice and spacious  Internet access was free and easy  The bathroom was very nice   the tub was bigger than normal and everything was uber clean  We will look to stay here again the next time were in the city  
P => Good location clean modern hotel freindly staff Stayed at the Sheraton Manhattan Chelsea on a Saturday night for one night  Had a king room on the th floor with a nice view of the NYC skyline including the Empire state building  Check in was super quick and the front desk staff was very friendly  I am a Starwood Preferred Guest gold so the staff usually is friendly regardless of property  I paid with points but I think the room would have been in the  per night  Sometimes when you pay with pointsmiles you get treated a little less quotnicelyquot but this wasnt the case here  Received a king quotexecutivequot room  Yes it wasnt very big but this is NYC and nothing is very roomy  The room seemed to be very recently updated  Had a king bed large armoire with safe and bathrobe TV with a ent amount of channels a desk with a tall back very comfortable ergonomic chair and a smaller size bathroom with large shower stall  Everything was very clean and tastefully done  Heard no noise from the hall and very little from the street below The location is OK  If you like antiques there is tons and tons of antique stores and kets within a block of the hotel  Its also within walking distance of the Meat Packing district if you want to go out clubbing  Plenty of delis and places to eat within one block  There is a barrestaurant on the st floor of the Hotel  Didnt eat there so cant tell you if it was good or not  Hailing a cab was very easy Overall I am happy with my stay with no complaints  I would stay there again  
P => shouldnt pay more than  including tax for one night here Definitely you dont want to pay  including tax to stay here just for one night  originally we prepaid with regular price to reserve a room with double bed  we asked about king bed when check in  so we got  But it is really surprised to see this tiny room with a king bed  Then we figure out this is a backup room because we recall that initially a staff said there was no such room while another said they had a special one for us  Now we know the meaning of quotspecialquot The room is clean  only an internet cable avaiable  No wireless at all  Some local TV programs are free  HBODiscovery    are not No fridge  NO microwave  The bathroom is oknot too small  Anywaydont expect anything other than a bed  Our room is next to a ice machine which cause a little bit noise which could be a problem for a light sleeper  Out room is at th floor  No view at all  Instead you can see an old shabby wall  But thats NYC  I guess   is the fair price for this room  
P => two stars at best Well Ive never had a Caesar Salad with powdered parmesan out of a packet before And all other aspects of the hotel were in every respect similar to the quality of my salad  Need I say more 
P => Weekly Customer I travel to NYC weekly for business and after staying at multiple hotel properties in Manhattan Queens LGA JFK and Long Island over the past  months I have found my quothome away from homequot The hotel accomplishes quite a bit despite its somewhat constrained space  The restaurantlounge area is an excellent place for meetings from  AM    PM   quiet room to spread out and private  The greenhouse effect and couches are nice too  The breakfast service is impeccable with a nice affordable selection  The hotel offers a couple of small meeting rooms and fitness center that I have not utilized though look ent  A few employees in the restaurantbar staff are a bit aloof however Rodney and Jenna make up for it The rooms are a bit small but the colors and or are unique and trendy  The beds are extremely comfortable and difficult to get out of in the morning  The hotel provides free internet access in each room  The views on the north side of the building are of the Chrysler Building and the Empire State building  Free bottled water in each room with multiple newspapers at your door each morning NY Post NY Times USA Today and WSJ The neighborhood provides a wide assortment of restaurant and nightlife activity  I dont access the subway system myself but several stops are within a couple of blocks of the hotel  The front desk staff is attentive depsite several of these postings and provide adequate service prompt check in and accurate billing and check out  
P => good location and price The location was great since I rarely venture above th street when in nyc  Easy subway access and soho and greenwich village are in easy walking distance  The room is small as most nyc hotel rooms are but was well orated and very clean The bed was VERY comfortable  We had to force ourselves out in the morning  It was nice to find a reasonably priced hotels with a little style in this neighborhood so I would definitely stay here again  
P => Ok The rooms are VERY small   some just have one double bed  For a Starwood property charging the rates they are that is small  The neighborhood is noisy even though it is on a crosstown street  They try to be hip and the staff was helpful  They give a free bottle of water  It is pretty close to the  subway line and activities in Chelsea 
P => Great location good value We stayed at this hotel for  nights and we were very satisfied with the whole stay  Nice rooms and no ice machines or other noise bothered us  Ask for a corner room though they are bigger  Nice and friendly staff and free use of the internet was very helpful as well  The location was perfect too  Right in Chelsea walking distance to midtown and downtown  Definitely good value compared to other hotel rates in Manhattan  I booked directly with the hotel because they offered the best prices  Breakfast is not included but that was fine  There are enough places around to go for breakfast I would recommend this hotel to others and definitely would stay here again  
P => Four Points out of Five I used Starwood points for my stay at the Four Points Sheraton Chelsea New York so cannot comment on value for money  I can however say thisThe rooms while small are well designed and quite comfortable  A number of rooms have weak air conditioners that have trouble keeping the temperature down on hot days ie over  degrees outside means   inside  Internet access is free and the connection is excellent If you are a light sleeper be sure to ask for a room on a floor with no ice machine  Unfortunately no matter what floor you are on you cannot escape the room doors that close or should I say quotslamquot automatically  Another thing that unpleasantly surprised me was that there were no blackout curtains and so the sunlight streamed in easily through the blinds The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the Chelsea nightlife and if you want to take the subway there are stations at rd and th Streets less than  minutes by foot Finally the staff are both friendly and eager to help  
P => Starwood Quality I stayed at The Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Chelsea on  th th  Upon arrival the entire front desk staff greeted me before I fully stepped into the hotel  I checked in at AM as they found a room for me with a quick call to housekeeping even though the night before was fully booked  The entire front desk staff worked in sync as one checked me in the other gave me mapsnearby attractions and the other made a car reservation for me to head back JFK airport  I was extremely impressed  The room is not small but not large  It seemed like it was just perfect for a couple  Great or and just the right amenities in the right places  Free bottle water and internet service is a great plus  Housekeeping staff are fantastic very friendly even though English is not their first language  They try and speak with you to see what you need which I love  The bar is very cozy and great happy hour specials  probably the best in Manhattan  If you do not have a computer you an use their free internet station  There is free wifi in the lobby  There is a fitness center and also a board room  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone  Come and experience this hotels energetic staff in a lively neighborhood  I give nothing but praises  Beats Hampton anytime  
P => New York Hotels are Just Too Expensive Though this hotel is a good deal for NYC at  a night for the least expensive room it is hard to feel like you are getting your moneys worth The rooms are small but spotless and in good condition  The beds arereasonably comfortable and the bathrooms were small but functional and extremely clean  The curved shower rod was a nice touch The hotel doesnt nickel and dime customers  three different kinds ofnewspapers are complimentary as is a bottle of water in the roomand coffee  They even had snacks at the front desk The hotel does have an exercise room with four cardio machines  thereare no weights  Chelsea is a good location though not close to that many tourist sites if that is what you are in New York to do This is a solid three star hotel providing functional clean rooms with a touch of design flair  Not a bad choice given the prices fo rooms elsewhere in the city  
P => ent hotel needs a few changes My dhter and I stayed at the Four Points Chelsea the last weekend in ch  Our room was very clean and the staff friendly although a bit befuddled on the phone  We used the free internet several times to check email  Our room was on the th floor facing the street  Lots of street noise all night long including a moving van being loaded at  am across the street The hotel has to address the window coverings The Roman shades are lovely but the windows need blackout shades and soon  Also as others have mentioned the lack of shelf space in the bathroom is a problem and could be simply fixed with a shelf along the outside wall  I took the towels out of the unit above the toilet and used that shelf for my toiletries but it was a bit high for my dhter to reach  Ask for rooms on the back of the hotel on the higher floors and the noise wont be much of a problem  We heard no noise from the elevator or the room next to us We had a Starwood hotel rate but Ive seen this hotel available for  which isnt bad given its location  We liked being so close to  different subway stations and took the bus back after a show on Friday night  Plenty of little breakfast places around for a quick bagel and a coffee before you head out for the day  The Chelsea garage flea ket is half a block away if youre there on the weekend too  We spend the following two nights at the Sheraton New York Towers  Although our room at the Sheraton Towers was quieter Id much prefer to return to the Four Points I have photos to add when we figure out the problem with my camera 
P => pretty good for NYC We cashed in some SPG points for a free night here and were very happy with the hotel  A couple of hiccups but nothing serious  We were first assigned a room that the desk clerk said with a smile as if it were a good thing was on a floor with an ice machine  Only when we saw that the ice machine was jammed into a space between the stairs and our room did we see why he was smiling  My loved one said it wasnt a big deal until I asked her to go into the room close the door and I then pushed the button for ice  After the avalanche of ice and noise she opened the door and said quotLets move quot  It was literally next to the wall that was  feet from the bed We got a nice room on the SPG floor no ice machines  The size was typical for NYC budget hotels enough room to move around but not a whole lot of room  We were on a very quiet side facing the back of buildings on th street so minimal street noise  We could hear the conversation of the maids quite clearly so pray you get quiet neighbors  The room was done nicely with the famous sweet sleeper and ent ammenities in the toilet The location is great if you like Chelsea but its close to walk to mid town Union Square or even the village if its nice out The major downside to this place is the breakfast  They wanted  for a simple coffee  I told the guy I was only going to have half a cup anyway so he let it go quotJust this one timequot he scolded  Seriously for rooms starting at  a night they cant have complementary coffee in the lobby or restaurantSumy go there its nice clean relatively cheap for NYC no pool gym good service and nice staff  Bring your own ice 
P => Overall good value My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights for an anniversary getaway  We chose this hotel for the location and value as we wanted to spend our money on dinners out etc   Overall we had a good experience the bed was very comfortable and the room was small but cozy  Everything was clean and the staff was friendly  There were however a few negatives  nowhere to place toiletries so we had to put them on the floor or toilet  staff walkie talkies were turned up very loud and we were woken up by them one morning at around  a m  Soundproofing also not very good as we could hear conversations in the hallway and noise from the street  we ordered a pot of hot chocolate through room service and after an hour called to check on its whereabouts  They had failed to take down our room number and were waiting for us to call them back  When we finally got it it was watery and undrinkable  They took it off our bill though the next morning without a problem  Chelsea is a cute area with lots of options for shopping and eating  However although the Theatre District and Times Square are technically within walking distance if you are looking to spend a lot time at these places consider choosing a more centrally located hotel If you are looking for a ent sized comfortable room for good value this is a great option  Just be prepared to deal with some small annoyances  
P => Perfect and reasonable Stayed at the Four Points Chelsea with a group of girlfriends over the first weekend of ch  It was the first time all of us late thirties have been out without the childrenhusbands in a looong time and we wanted to save our money to spend on going out as opposed to hotels  While the W is trendy this property was actually comprable room wise  They are not huge but definitely suitable and fine for NYC  We booked doubles which had  quotdouble bedsquot as they call them but they are really more like a twin and a half than a fulldouble  The area is fine and many things are walkable  Recommend Kanvass on th bw rd and th as a starting off point  It has the look and feel of trendy but not the attitude  Good music nice seating reserve and outrageously good appetizers  Best part is from   oclock tinis are half price at   We all had at least  drinks and an appetizer tower plus a few other apps  for person including tip Back to the hotel service wasnt a big need as we were in for one night but staff were accomodating and did their best to put us in rooms nearby one another etc  Highly recommend as a reasonable but clean nice place to stay in NY  
P => great location shame about the room Just got back from four nights at the Four Points by Sheraton  Location wise its great for the area  Theres a number of subway stations within a few blocks of the hotel so had no problems getting from JFK to the hotel Booked a deluxe room though not sure what that gives you about a traditional and asked for it to be away from the ice machine as others had stated  I was up on the th floor and there was an ice machine up there and it was very noisy so I understand now why people say this  If I was in the room right next to it theres no way I could have stayed there  Nice view of the Empire State Building from my window too Lots of people were complaining about the size of the rooms whilst in the lifts but as I was travelling alone it was ok for me but I can see their point The free internet access worked with no problems and was speedy enough for my needs  Most hotels have blackout curtains so whatever time of day it is you can close the curtains and have no idea if its daylight or not  The blinds here hang away from the window letting in a lot of light not what you want in the morning  Not very sound proofed either  Lots of noise from street level  Tried room service once got a warm burger and fries which was cold before Id finished it I would stay again if I got a ent rate  Just stay away from the ice machinesTo end on a positive note the staff were very friendly and probably the best feature of the hotel  
P => Clean Comfortable and Small I arrived late on a Sunday night for a long business trip  The location cant be beat and it was very clean and comfortable really the most important parts but the hotel itself has a couple of issues  While the room was very clean and the bed comfortable I heard the garbage trucks late at night and early in the morning as my room faced the street even though it was  stories up  Light peeked through the drapes all night but it wasnt horrible  I did sleep with earplugs though I couldnt hear my neighbors The bathroom was small and there was no shelf space for my personal toiletries makeup hairbrush etc so I was forced to place it on top of the toilet   not my favorite place  However I absolutely loved the mini products for use  Shea butter lotion and soaps were wonderful  I have to admit I took a few for later use The towels were abundant but a few were less than white There were no food options upon my late arrival pm and the front desk suggested I walk around the corner to a deli  Not knowing NYC I wasnt about to stroll about in the dead of night  SInce there was no mini bar I really was out of luck  I did enjoy the one complimentary water bottle included in my room one   even though there were  double beds and also the service that the cleaning staff provided when they remembered to deliver more than the one bottle of water for the rest of my stay Upon the arrival of a huge rainstorm the hotel did have someone catching cabs but the front desk staff failed to advise the accesibility of an ATM in their lobby and instead directed me to a bank several blocks away  It was raining  It didnt make sense to head outside to a bank  The gym was tiny and included a TV towels water  treadmills one of which was out of order  stationary bikes and  elliptical  Small and bare but it got the job done   for free  I would stay there again but its not my favorite  
P => Good Location Efficient Service We stayed for two nights over Presidents Day Weekend  We were on an overnight flight and arrived at the hotel at about am  Our room was ready for check in when we arrived  Thats always a plus  The staff at the front desk were friendly  We requested an extra pillow from the front desk  They called us back after a couple of minutes and said that they were going to be delayed approx   minutes in bringing the pillow but it did show up within that  minute timeframe  The room was small but sufficient  The only complaints I had with the room were  There was a dirty sock under the chair that a previous guest had left and housekeeping hadnt spotted   There was a stain on the comforter  I never sleep with the comforter on the bed anyway but it was gross   They also dont double sheet the blanket which would have been nice  Since the comforter had obviously been reused between guests what about the blanket Also be sure to give the bellmen a little extra time if youre storing your bags  There was only one person taking care of all of the bags and we had to wait a few extra minutes after our ride showed up waiting for the bellman to bring the bags up  I would stay here again because the hotel is in a good location  also if I got a good rate  
P => Contemporary   well taken care of Stayed here last ember  The staff was young friendly and knowledgeable about mass transit dont sit in the first subway car to Lower Manhattan and tourist sites  The parking garage is a block away  The rooms are typical in size for a city with dark walls and modern furnishings  Free papers in the morning  Quiet guests  The location is easy walking distance to Greenwich Village and Gramercy  An enjoyable stay  
P => Great little hotel for a night I have to say that for one night this hotel was perfect and not expensive  We had a birthday party to attend in Greenwich Villageand when I found several to choose from I read the reviews and this came up with good ones  We checked in late afternoon and the room looked exactly like the photo small but very sophisticated in its or and very cozy and clean  It had everything you could ask for  I would definitely recommend staying here if you need a place for a night or two  They even have a small bar and restaurant if you need a quick bite  
P => Great value and location My friend and I stayed for a week  As it was our first time we did not know what to expect and were very pleasantly surprised  The location of the Four Points is very good the rooms are clean with very comfortable beds and a good size too  Even though we could not hear any noise from the other rooms the ongoing roadworks ouside were rather noisy The staff at the front desk was very helpful  
P => Cheaper in Chelsea Preamble We used Starwood Points to stay for our annual pre Christmas holiday shopping trip given the current prices of NYC hotels it was a great use of points saved us well over Check in Professional efficient and friendly Lobby Small with a friendly bar immediately adjacent to the front desk Room Small nicely orated  Nice color and furniture scheme although the furniture was suprisingly worn in places despite our placement on a quotStarwood Preferred Guest Floorquot Bed Very firm nice linens and covers TV Excellent with HBO and lots of cable choices Bathroom Spacious with a great shower excellent lighting wonderful bath products and nice towels Check out Professional efficient and friendly Location Awesome if you want to roam around Chelsea and Greenwich Village quiet location but close to lots of shopping and restaurants BONUS FREE HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICE FREE BOTTLED WATER IN THE ROOMS  This answered two of my pet peeves about hotels these days  day for high speed internet and  bottles of water that you can get elsewhere for  cents Complaints You can hear everyone talking in the hallways in your room although not from the interior of the adjacent rooms  Scratched furniture contrasting with an otherwise creative or  
P => Not regrets great hotel I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor  I would say hotel was great above my expectation the room was nice clean and new plus bed was excellent The only disadvantage is the location   it is not right smack in the city centre and you will need to walk about   minutes to the city centre  Not many shops around this area  But for the amount you pay about USD plus tax it is definitely worth the distance because you can still walk to the city centre or alternatively there is a subway station near the hotel I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in a nice clean new hotel modern room though room is not that big and comfortable beds  
P => Excellent Stay in Chelsea My boyfriend and I had a very nice stay over Labor Day weekend at the Four Points in Chelsea  I usually stay at more upscale hotels but we wanted to be near the gay scene in Chelsea  From check in to check out the hotel staff were very professional and accomodating  We arrived a bit early and requested a room with a view of the Empire State Building  The room wasnt ready yet but the staff graciously stored our luggage and offered to call me on my mobile when the room was ready  The room itself was exactly as pictured on the hotel web site  It was small but very adequately equipped and nicely maintained  We never felt cramped or uncomfortable and defintiely enjoyed the view  The hotel was very gay friendly with many other gay male guests but also families and straight couples  I particularly thought the quotgayquot dance music playing in the lobby was a nice touch  The hotel was reasonably convenient to the subway and just a half block from th Avenue with restaurants shops and a Whole Foods ket  Will definitely return to this hotel the next time I visit Chelsea  
P => Nice Slower Pace Just got off the plane from NYC and this was a great hotel  My family and I go to NYC quite a bit third time this year for me and we usually stay in Times Square but this time we had something going on in Chelsea the hot new art area  My sister went to NYC for the first time in about eight years and stayed in Times Square a few months ago and she does not like the crowds lights or sounds at all  She really liked the pace of this hotel as well as Chelsea itself  While only having eight rooms to a floor and  floors in all the rooms were terribly small I think I read  square feet on their site but definitely comfortable  There were four of us and we ided to get two rooms as it would have been impossible to fit four people on two doubles  Speaking of the beds they were absolutely wonderful  The room features earthy chocolate walls velvet shades an amoire among other features  The view was exceptional  It overlooked the financial district and we could see the  lights at night although we were on the Starwood Preferred Guest floors which are higher than the standard ones  The only thing about the hotel that was sub par was the small and blank bathroom although the faucet toilet and shower all worked properly  Just no oration at all All in all this is a great hotel for those who prefer the slower pace of Chelsea and dont need a whole lot of space  
P => Great hotel friendly staff nice accomodations Got a great deal on priceline and it was a superb hotel  Friendly helpful staff great acoomodations and great location  Near subway lines and lots of great restaurants  Will stay there again in the future  
P => Ideal Location Quiet and Comfortable We stayed here in e having booked it through the Sheraton website as we are SPG members  Yes the rooms are small but what do you expect in NYC The rooms have all the amenities you need and the heavenly bed which is worth the admission fee alone  A fridge would have been useful but there is ice available  The one thing that struck us about the room we were on the th floor is how quiet it is  Despite being in a busy area of Manhattan is was really quiet so a good nights sleep was ensured The staff were very friendly and always helpful although we were out most of the day exploring For breakfast we checked out the cafe recommended by others on the site but it was  degrees so we didnt fancy many hot omelettes  We can recommend the Whole Foods ket just round the corner on th Avenue which has an amazing array of hot and cold food for breakfast and lunch  Theres another one at the bottom right hand corner of Central Park as well   great for picnics For dinner The Salaam Bombay Greenwich Street Lower Manhattan was fantastic and for Italian go for Pelegrinos in LIttle Italy which is a little pricier but fantastic food and service  Some of the other places in Little Italy offer below average food and way above average prices One tip   if youre flying back from JFK allow at least an hour from the hotel because the traffic can be really bad Great hotel   would definitely go back if we revisit NYC   reasonable rate clean rooms friendly staff and very quiet 
P => We had a Gay ole Time My partner and I went to NYC for the Gay Pride Weekend and the Rapture on the River dance on the pier We arrived on th street by foot after having taken the Ferry from New Jersey and the free bus from the ferry to rd and th  We walked two block turned right and there it was  The location couldnt be beat it seemed it only cost around  in a taxi to anywhere we wanted to go and all of the trains and buses also go right near by The lobby was well air conditioned much to our immediate relief as it was muggy and sticky outside  The staff was extremely well trained  We checked in and were told that there were no more king rooms left due to the Pride festival going on that week  I replied firm yet polite that our rate was for a king room that was confirmed over a month ago and if they wanted to give us a double room they should adjust the price downward because on the internet these rooms were less expensive  After some chatting with co workers about the situation both there in front of us and on the walkie talkie we were given a suite on the top floor I was so pleased I tried to tip Lisa Lew the front desk person but she would not accept it   We saw the bar but did not drink there but it was lit up like something in Sex and the City or Queer as Folk  Very chic  The staff always asked if there was anything they could do for us when they saw us in the lobby as if it were part of their greeting  The room was great There was a balcony overlooking the empire state building The balcony was shared by the suite next door but we never saw them or heard them  It would be fun to get the two suites and have a nice party Nothing over the top mind you just a nice party and fun in the city There was a leather love seat that folded out to a bed a chair for the desk and another comfy chair and a tv in the living room  In the Bedroom was a luxurious king bed with it seemed like hundreds of pillows and another view of the empire state building  There was a  inch flat screen plazma tv on an extension bracket that brought the tv almost right over the bed Excellent to wind down at night with  It looked exactly like the pictures of the suite on their website but we did not pay the suite price at all The place was spotlessly clean even my mother would have liked it and the bathroom was huge by NYC standards  We have travelled the world and this suite was holding its own in comparison The walls were so thick between rooms that when I was out in the hallway I could hear the people in the next suite being very loud but in our room at all  Let me tell you the fun we had on the pier was extended to the suite aftward  No one from the hotel ever bothered us or intruded on our privacy  I could not hear the cleaning service at all in the morning and that one thing is a personal pet peeve of mine because I cannot stand the sound of a vacuum in the morning time  I am a pretty picky traveller and I was pleased   Ice was on every other floor and easy to get to  The front desk offered a mini fridge but we didnt really need it  I personally never heard a sound from outside of our suite but I wouldnt want the room next to the ice machine  There were vending machines somewhere but we had the city to get our snacks from Definitely try the dumpling bar on west rd between th and th  We did not try the hotel food but it looked good Thank you Lisa Lew you made our Pride of  a wonderful memory 
P => Turned out to be a Great Hotel I stayed here for  nights with my dhter sister in law and her dhter so we had  and when we opened our door and saw  double beds we were worried  I asked for a roll away and none were available although they immediately brought up a refrigerator which I also asked for  We ended up just putting the one bed up to the wall moving the other one next to it and pulling up the cloth chair and bench to add a little more room and we sleep like logs every night Especially after all the walking  The room was small but the staff was wonderful the location was wonderful and it was perfect for what we needed  The maid even gave us extras when she saw the rearrangement of furniture and made us very comfy every day which we really appreciated  Id definetly stay here again  The front desk even let me come down and use their computer to print out double ker tour bus tickets and when I couldnt get to my email to get the confirmation after ordering them the super nice gentlement gave me his personal email address to send it to  Ran upstairs emailed him from my computer free high speed interent also and he had it printed when I came down to pick it up  Helped with ordering a car from the airport on our final day  HIGHLY recommended How much time do you spend in your room anyway  OHHH the best part We were on the st floor and our view was the Empire State Building Saw it change colors three different times while we were there  Just perfect 
P => Small Space But Big on Style and Comfort The Four Points by Sheraton in ManhattanChelsea is the quintessential pseudo boutique quasi neighborhood hotel  It small on space but big on comfort and isn t that all you need when your planning to be out and about in the Big Apple This was my first stay at a Four Points and I was very pleasantly surprised  It had a lot of the styling of a boutique hotel and the comfort and familiarity of a chain hotel The rooms we very stylishly appointed with dark cooper brown wallpaper and black amp white photos of machines  A mechanical motif runs throughout the hotel  The rooms had a cool dark relaxing atmosphere which was greatly appreciated at the end of a hot New York day  The furniture placement made good use of limited space  There was a desk dresser and wardrobe with ample room for clothes  But it was the beds  doubles that won me over    comfortable inviting and loaded with pillows  It rivaled some of the beds in higher end hotels  be a little of the heavenliness of the Uncle Westin s Heavenly Beds have been incorporated into the Four Points product line  I dont know for certain but I found them to be just as heavenly The bath surprisingly had a full size shower with the shower head mounted at good six feet or more on the wall  Ask any tall person and theyll tell you how that little attention to detail makes a big difference  The bath was also stocked with unique herbal based product    no cheesy French milled soap or brand name sample shampoo  The room and bath were both immaculate A little aromatherapy really added to the boutique feel but it was little overpowering at times  If you re sensitive to those type things you might want to warn them before check in  Add to all of this a courteous and efficient staff and you have a nice quotneighborhood  hotel   away from the hustle and bustle of Time Square but close enough to everything Now we get to the matter of price  The Four Points is one of the many mid range hotels that have been popping up in Manhattan as lower price alternatives to the big name luxury hotels  However some of these hotels can still pack a punch on your wallet so shop around  If you can get rates below  at the Four Points youre doing well and you will be pleasantly surprised  North of that price I would recommend you check around  You might do better depending on the time of year and the days of the week you will be staying  
P => Nice hotel for a good price Stayed there for  nights during Memorial Day Weekend The rates were reasonable unlike in other Starwood Hotels in NYC The rooms are a bit small but lets face it rooms in NYC are usually small butvery modern clean and nicely furnished  Staff was very friendly and check in andcheck out experience were both very smooth and fastThe Hotel is located on th Street and it is a  minute walk to MSG and Penn Station  Add another  to  minutes and you are at Times Square  So the location is quite convenient and you could even bring your car and park it on the street as you wont have any trouble finding parking space After staying at the Sheraton Manhattan for  times in the past where the rooms are a little aged and the rate is usually higher I can really recommend this hotel because it is good value for money plus you can earn starpoints 
P => Good value My friends and I stayed here for my bachelorette party  Its pleasant clean and cute  The rooms are a ent size for the price  No complaints  
P => Good Value for New York I recently stayed at the  Points Sheraton in Chelsea   very convenient location   I am an artist and wanted to be close to the Chelsea galleries  The rooms are basic but clean and comfortable  Not terribly noisy except when the garbage is collected  Close to public transport and a quick cab ride if you want to go to the theatre  If you are looking for a hotel with lots of extras this is probably not it however if you are looking for something clean affordable and fairly central then this is very good value  Less crowded than Times Square   you feel as if you are getting a real taste of New York  Across the road on the corner of th avenue and West th is a real good organic grocery store   they have a take away salad bar that is really good if you are looking for fresh vegetables and are tired of greasy take aways they also have lots of fresh fruit and a deli  Quick walk to the   art galleries in the district  
P => Great NYC hotel good price I ided to stay here for a weekend getaway with my husband after reading reviews on this site  The room is small but that is the case with my hotels in Manhattan  Chelsea is a cute little neighborhood and there are normal drop in type restaurants diners and small neighborhood places to have a casual meal  We never had trouble catching a cab from here  The staff was nice and the room was very clean  The orations were also very tasteful and modern looking  We were on the th floor and we never heard any of our neighbors or any street noise  I would definitely stay here again on our next trip  Also we paid night for a king thru the Sheraton website  
P => Great little find Just avoid room service  Got a great deal staying here for  nights in ober   Its a great little hotel  Our twin room was a little cozy but comfortable very clean and in good condition  The beds are great A few too many pillows though  is just overkill  The bathroom was quite large compared to the actual room  Even though the windows are double glazed the rooms at the front can still be a little noisy   but hey thats New York Earplugs worked a treat The staff at reception were very friendly and always willing to help  I would however advise staying away from room service very slow overpriced and badly made  The breakfasts are pretty much the same  Dont know what their dinners are like   the breakfast and room service put me offI would definitely stay here again especially if I got the same deal for  nights  
P => Loved Everything About This Place Ive been coming to NY on business for several years and this was one of the best experience Ive had  The front staff were more than helpful the rooms near brand new and kind of chic and very clean and the beds very very comfortable  It was even really quiet which is rekable in NY  Yes the room werent huge but what do you expect in NY and why do you want to be in your room when you have this amazing city to explore  There were endless bars restaurants clubs a cinema shops subway and a Whole Foods superket within a few blocks and far enough from Time Square to be comfortable It was also a lot cheaper than some of the Midtown hotels Ive stayed in  All in all great value  
P => Great room super clean helpful staff  would return for sure  Very nice  just remember to request a room away from elevator and ice machine  and higher floors offer better views  Windows opened which was nice  
P => Loved it This is my new favorite hotel in New York  Its a nice manageable size and I never felt lost in a maze of corridors  In fact the nd floor has only eight rooms  The front desk is staffed by enthusiastic and very friendly people  We felt welcomed in a sincere way  The beds in our double room were extremely comfortable albeit small  If youre sharing a bed be prepared to get cozy because theyre not quite doubles  Even though the room we had was small it wasnt particularly cramped  It was nicely appointed and very quiet  The hotel is in a great location  If you enjoy antiques be sure to visit the flea ket down the block might be weekends only  I didnt eat at the restaurant and recommend the Ridgeway Diner on st and th for a good breakfast  
P => New Years We had a GREAT TIME Very reasonable rates and close to everything  The subway is close so we were able to get to ground zero and times square very easily and a short walk to th Ave for some shopping Also we had the best veiw of the Empire State building it was beatiful lit up at night The rooms are bigger than most New York rooms Ive stayed in and have very well appointed oration  An Indrustrial feel very clean and healthy while being comfortable as well Lots of help from the front desk and room service was prompt We had a lot of fun in the bar on the first floor of the hotel before we went outWe will definitely stay here again 
P => Tiny Cool My wife and I stayed at the Four Points Chelsea for two nights and have stayed there before when were in Manhattan  If you can get a good rate and they very drastically for the same small room this hotel is a deal The rooms are REALLY tiny  You can walk around the bed but thats about it  However the furnishings are good  Compfy bed lots of good lighting big desk free and fast broad band connection coffee maker and nice amenities for the bathroom   not the standard Four Points stuff  The staff is young energetic and helpful   early check ins questions concerns room right next to the ice machine   all handled efficiently and pleastly   in New York CityHotel seems spotless and breakfast is good and inexpensive  The location is great close to several subway lines and only a short walk to theaters  Visiting Manhattan walking is part of the experience Theres a great Whole Foods ket just a block away for killer take back to your room meals  But unless you get a high floor youll be looking into windows of adjacent buildings  On high floors you get a spectacular view that could only be New York    picture taken from our room window is attached Finally staying there seems to cheer me up rather than depress me as happens in most budget hotels  
P => The good and the mediocre My wife and I stayed at the Points Chelsea for  nites over the xmas holiday and were pleased with the friendly and prompt front desk staff and the room that was clean warm well furnished and pleasant  When I had a problem with the room safe the front desk sent someone up in less than  minutes and fixed the problem Depending on the neighbor in the next room we found the walls to be a bit too thin  of our  nites  Also hallway noise was a problem when most guests would be talking or raising their voices while waiting for the elevator  The showers water pressure was non existant  Although advertised the room did not have a mini bar or refrigerator The Chelsea neighborhood is a mixed bag of upcoming shops and urban harshness and after pm its hard to find a restaurant  And forget about finding a ent cafe in the morning unless you like starbucks  The only saving grace for us location wise was the  block walk to the subway and seven blocks to Penn Station for the quick LIRR ride to JFK If you want good parisian style coffee in NY I suggest Le Pain de Quotidien but most of them seem to be either in SOHOVillage or Upper East Side  This place never disappointed us  Otherwise it seems that NewYorkers are content drinking some kind of icky brown river water they call kwa fee  
P => Great Hotel Clean and Comfy Really pleased with this hotel  The rooms not massive but the beds are VERY VERY COMFY with loads of extra pillows just what you need after a long day in NY  Bathroom was big and powerful shower everywhere was very clean and orated in a modern style browns and creams  Huge TV  Dont be put off by dark small lobby door man speaks little english but all reception staff very friendly  Would recommend this hotel and would go back there again  Short walk from shopping area  Felt safe walking around the area  Food shopseatries nearby  
P => Great Bang for the Buck This hotel is awesome  Everything in there looks brand new  And it is in a great location  Ive read some reviews about small rooms but you really cant complain when it is in New York City  All the hotels in New York City are going to be a bit smaller than your hotels in different states  Ive stayed at many different places but none of them can beat the quality of this hotel and none of them can offer it for the same prices  
P => Awesome Just returned from  nights in New York  I am a travel agent and a firm believer in you get what you pay for  I found that the  Points was a great property and the price was good as well in comparison to some of the hotels closer to Time Square  The location of the hotel was good as we walked to SOHO and Chelsea as well as to Time Square and the Theatre district and the Empire State Building  THe walk to Time square was about  minutes and we walked at all hours of the day and night and there were always people around so I never felt unsafe  We walked to teh Empire State Building as well and we went via the wholesale district and checked out some of the great shopping Our room was  and was in the front corner of the building with  beds in it this was all that was available when we booked  I did not find the hotel noisy at all and we were very close to the elevator  The rooms are small but clean and very comfortable beds  The staff was very quick and always had a good morning or good evening for us  They were frioendly and helpful with all that we needed and there always were lots of people working  The asian style restuarant and bar was a nice touch as well  We had drinks at the bar and visited with Benny the bartender who gave us some shopping and sightseeing tips I recommend that you try out a New York Deli called quotTOASTIESquot on th ave between  and th streets  They make amazing sandwiches and huge salads everything was fresh and tasted great  If you are looking for a close restaurant for a nice dinner try quotOrchidquot ampor quotRoguequot located on th Ave between th amp th street  They seemd to be operated by the same people and the menus are both similar but the service was good and the atmosphere was great at both of them Orchid was a bit more trendy and personal while Rogue more sporty  The hotel is within walking distance to most tourist areas with the exception of Ground Zero Financial District Fish ket and Statue of LibertyStatton Island Ferry  Taxis only cost about   to all of these areas from the hotel  If you want to do the tourist thing be sure to get a  hour hop on hop off double ker bus pass from Grayline  It was a great deal and you can get throughout the whole city on the pass and see all the tourist stops All in all I really enjoyed the stay at the  Points   it was a good price and good location and if you are a Starwood Preffered member you will get points for your stay as well  
P => Great location This new hotel was conveniently located with Midtown Chelsea Meatpacking and SoHo districts nearby  Rooms were clean quiet and of good size  And the airconditioning was great on those hot humid nights 
P => Great overall experience We stayed at Four Points Chelsea for ten days in il and it was a wonderful ten days It is a Category  hotel through Starwood but I actually preferred it more to the other Cat   hotels Ive stayed in The hotel staff was extremely helpful polite and warm  They also upgraded us because of our long stay we are Starwood members  The exterior of the hotel like others have said is very unassuming    so much so that when I arrived by subway I couldnt quite figure out where it was  I was searching for a big sign denoting the hotel but couldnt find one  The exterior is pretty subtle in that you have to pass by the hotel to see the sign  Anyway the lobby though very small is very pleasant and modern looking  We stayed on the th floor and the views from our hotel room were incredible I loved waking up in the morning and opening the curtains to look at the view The hotel room is incredibly chic and fashionable for a Four Points  Honestly it reminded us of the W hotels  The king sized bed was so comfortable and gave us many good nights of sleep  The leather chairs were such nice touches as well  The bathroom was very pleasant and modern although it had a small sink area The service like I mentioned earlier was impeccable  Everybody from the front desk to the room service people were very hospitable catering to your every need    very hard to find at times especially in New York They always had a pleasant smile on their faces too  All in all our stay in Four Points was a very pleasant surprise The or was what I would expect from a W the service was unbeatable and the location was superb as well    very close to the  subway lines as well as a short walk from the F subway station Also we made a few trips to the Whole Foods which is about a block or so away and Chelsea Papaya for a late night snack or dinner  I would definitely stay at the Four Points again  
P => Perfect for us My mom and I took our first trip to New York City and stayed here  Got a great deal on the Starwood website   buy two nights get one free  So check there before booking directly Its a small low key hotel with awesome staff and no I dont work for the hotel  They were friendly down to earth helpful and took their time with each guest   not the rushed feeling I thought Id get The hotel is right between two subway stops near Chelseas neat antiques and flea ket areas and since its right between Times Square and the ferry to the Statue of Liberty there wasnt a day that we thought quotOh no now we have to travel all the way back to the hotel quotThe room looked exactly like it did on the web site  The outside is very unassuming nothing special to look at but theres so much else to see why fixate on the hotelThe beds were extremely comfortable the or is hip modern and relaxing  It was clean and really I could only have asked for a better view   and I saw that in several other places  All in we had a great time  I wouldnt have paid more given my deal but felt we got great value for money  Advice book a room away from the ice machine  I did  When I used the ice machine I felt bad for the folks in that room  Its really loud  
P => Hold Out for a High Floor Last summer we stayed at the hotel on one of the highest floors  This time we stayed for four nights in early ust  in room  Like last year the beds were very comfortable the rooms are small the service is pretty good the elevators a bit slow and they brought us a fridge  The main difference was our rooms location  This time with our room situated on a low floor facing the airshaft really made it apparant how poorly lighted the rooms are  Do yourself a favor and get a high floor room  
P => Great quieter NYC hotel for business Quieter area if you like that nice rooms helpful staff  Its been a great stay as a business traveler who just wants high speed internet access bottled water and a comfortable bed  I was a bit concerned when I couldnt get a room via my corporate agency but reserved the room through hotels  They paused a long time at the front desk before I got a room  My advice based on this experience and others that Ive read about on this site   if you book via Expedia or hotels   dont arrive late or you  not have a room  
P => Great choice for NYC Just back  Excellent stay  Comfortable beds  New York sized room  Small bathroom but well stocked  Fantastic location  Whole Foods Tasti D Lite and good Chinese food on th  Diner next door with inexpensive breakfast New Asian restaurant in hotel  Hotel is now   smoke free  Ice machine is very noisy  Small lobby gets crowded  
P => Great Value for NYC I just stayed at this hotel for  nights and it was a great value  The rooms are small but have a great desk and king size bed  Bathroom was a normal size for NYC  The room was clean the staff very pleasent and efficient  THe clientele seemed to be younger than other Sheratons  The location is very convinent with WholeFoods on the corner and many great restaurants and bars nearbuy  I also found the rooms quiet  I was in  which was on the back of the building  I would consider staying here again  
P => Great deal in funky Chelsea My girlfriend and I had a great week in this property  The staff was very helpful and positive  The front desk helped us get a new room away from the noisy ice machine in just  hours  If you are looking for a clean and relatively cheap place to sleep in NY this is the place  it has free in room broadband access  
P => Its worth staying just for the service  I have to say this is the most impressive hotel I have stayed at in recent years mainly because of the above amp beyond service given at the Front Desk  The Operations Director Taa leads the staff her friendly outgoing team who go out of their way to smile offer help and seem to love their jobs  Although the rooms are small the hotel is definitely worth visiting while in New York to see how a hotel should be run  Ten stars 
P => Recommended Dimensions of lobby room beds are small but quality is high  Rooms are much more interestingly orated that one usually finds  No beige walls with pastel watercolor prints and floral bedspreads here A pleasant surprise  Beds comfortable  Good water pressure  Clean  Doesnt have the quotplastickyquot feel of many hotel rooms  More sumptuous  Good neighborhood  Id return without hesitation  
P => Know what to expect This hotel is in a great neighborhood Chelsea across the street from a Whole Foods ket they receive Doughnut Plant donuts every morning at  a m     dont miss them around the corner from the subway at rd St   One of the most comfortable beds youll ever sleep on    pleasant modern industrial chic or with dark cinnamon walls  Great water pressure and large shower head  But no minibar no central heatair a motel type wall unit does the job adequately and helps screen street noise as well  Small lobby and just  elevators  If these things will not put a bee in your bonnet youll love it here as I did  Rooms are snug but comfortable  Ask for a room away from the ice machine and on a high floor  Helpful friendly staff recommended memorable spots within walking distance The Red Cat restaurant one of the best in the city Kanvas gallery and bar and the hilarious Trailer Park Lounge great fun  Cosy breakfast spot a few doors a way on the same side of the street  
P => Outstanding service This is a fantastic hotel The rooms are well appointed and comfortable and has been mentioned before the staff is outstanding  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stylish hip hotel in a great neighborhood though the rooms are probably too small to accommodate nore than  adults  If you are traveling by yourself or with your significant other though this is an outstanding hotel  
P => its ok  but do the staff write some reviwes the place is fine  lobby a shambles bar and retaurant forgetit   but who needs them when your in the middle of chelsea  avoid rooms near the dreaded ice machine    all you will hear is clunk clunk clunk all night  per night is the limit   its not worth more  coffe in room a nice touch  um yeh its ok   but five out of five  no way  be the staff write some of the reviews 
P => Ill stay here again I had some big problems here but due to the fast response of the manager and Sheraton Corp to my concerns Ill stay again with no hesitationMajor problems during my  night stay Security  They accidentally issued keys to two different guests on two different evenings which opened to the door to our room Both guests were as shocked as we were and apologized profusely  Too bad the staff didnt call and do the same  Leaky toilet  Requested repair twice and was never fixed  Automated wake up call service inoperative  Fortunately I had my travel clock  Reported the problem the first time and they said it would be fixed quickly  It wasnt  Reported it again and it still wasnt fixed  Called a third time and they said they wont know when it will be fixed  I wish they had alerted us so that we didnt rely on the automated service twice  TBS amp CNN channels didnt work  Requested repair twice and was never fixed On the positive side Great accomodations  I loved the or  And the beds were sooooo comfortable   what a treat after a long busy day  Great housekeeping and turndown service Smiles smiles smiles Their friendliness went a long way to balancing the negatives Great response from the manager and Sheraton Corp  We reported everything to the manager and Sheraton after our stay  They called back in less then  hours and we worked everything out  They were professional and made me feel confident that the problems we encountered wouldnt happen again 
P => Very helpful Stayed here   ruary  Staff very helpful no problem with the two rooms booked being next to one another  Also very helpful when our return was delayed  hours allowing us late check out Great diner around the corner  the Malibu for traditional breakfasts  
P => what a great hotel I have stayed here on many occasions and found this to be among the hippest properties I have ever been in anywhere  They say this is the quotflagshipquot of the Four Points brand and I can see why   The staff is young and fun and they play techno music in the lobby   The rooms are just as they say industrial chic and very richly appointed   Request a room away from the ice machine   One of my favorite hotels anywhere  Especially perfect if youre visiting NY to check out the Chelsea scene   
P => Best Staff in New York   Hands Down I travel weekly   all ove the country  The staff at this small hip Chelsea hotel is absolutely unbeatable The Front Desk staff is always quotonquot although they do many things at the same time they never skip a beat  The service is not cookie cutter but personable warm amp always friendly  If you ask where to go to eat they will whip out  suggestions on the fly  The rooms are hip with the most comforatable beds in New York  They have a winner here  
P => Wonderful staff We stayed at this hotel last tember and cant say enough great things  The rooms were small we had  of us but clean and lovely  The location is great and the staff was so wonderful I have never had better service in a hotel  We booked on priceline for about  a night and woudl love to stay there on our next trip  
P => The BEST I dont waste time writing reviews on hotels or anything else for that matter that I dont like  This Hotel just happens to be one of the best hotels in NYC  Why The management amp staff are the best that you will find anywhere in the hospitality industry  I have never been treated better in any other hotel in the city  That includes The W Tribeca Grand City Club Morgans amp many more  The room size was more than adequate amp exceptionally clean  The hospitality starts as soon as you go through the door amp are at the front desk  After checking in head to the lounge amp Benny Rebecca or Jolene will make you the best tini in the city  The location is also hard to beat  Just a couple of short blocks to the subway on rd amp th  Will I go back in a heartbeatThanks to Al James  Parker amp Taa amp all of their staff at Four Points Chelsea  
P => Great value and service I traveled to New York for New Year     and at first hesitated for this hotel and the almost perfect reviews Well to my surprise it was an excellent choice We were  adults and  kids  The rooms are very nice even though kind of small opened in   the staff very servicable and polite It has  subway stations just about  minute walk a superket and an excelent choice for breakfast at a diner half a block away  Also nice restaurants for lunch and dinner at two blocks I will stay there without any doubt on my next visit  All family agreed that it was nice silent and confortable hotel I hope they keep it that way  
P => Perfect for a dad and his dhter Just a wonderful experience  Like others I reserved it based on the reviews here  Went with my  year old dhter for the Christmas holidays  Its in a great neighborhood  pizza shops per block good ethnic of every stripe convenient to subways  Seems quite safe a place where people live rather than visit  Bout  way between Macys and the Village From the second we stepped thru the door the folks at the front desk were wonderful very helpful  When we needed some plunging a nice young man was there in about  minutes  The housekeeping people are wonderful very conscientious and considerate Yeah the rooms are small but thats relative in NYC  Ours was more than adequate   very comfortable full size beds  And the hot water was hot a particular issue after our last trip up there We had thought about staying at the Chelsea but I am glad we did not  For less  we got a clean odor free room in a place run by very nice people  We visited the lobby of the Chelsea to look for ghosts of dead rock stars  That was plenty  Next time I dont even have to read all these reviews  Were going back to the  Points Sheraton  
P => Very Nice Stay  Went purely based on the favorable reviews on this web site and I was not disappointed  Although the hotel is oddly situated right in the middle of a rather shady looking neighborhood you forget all that once you walk through the two sliding doors into the modern appearing warm lobby   friendly staff  Small but nicely docorated modern appearing clean rooms   King sized bed was very very comfortable with lots of pillows and very nice sheets   Thoughtfulness everywhere best exemplified by the complimentary bottle of water every day Down sides are   shady neighborhood kind of away from major stuff   rooms are very small  no central AC or heating wall unit worked very well but was also quite loud had to turn it off at night to sleep but then got really cold in the morningOtherwise a very nice stay  
P => Good Price Good Location Average Amenities I stayed at the Four Points Chelsea the first weekend of ember   Overall I had an OK time I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay  Its no frills but definitely a good choice for business people not too concerned with luxury or casual tourists and students Service I was pleased with the service   front desk people were very helpful an polite housekeeping was efficient and unintrusive  AmenitiesI was a bit disappointed with the state of my room it was definitely the smallest Ive had when staying in Manhattan im there every other weekend on business  The desk and chair were worn out and scratched and the air conditioning unit was loud and ineffective  The beds were fantastic as usual with all Starwoods hotels  TV and other amenities were great too  My biggest qualms were the lack of room service any minibar or lobby level convenience store  It was a bit of a pain to have to leave the property to buy a snack or drink especially late at night  Location This was my first time staying in Chelsea and I must admit the location is pretty good easy access to midtown and union square by foot  If you want to go downtown a taxis probably best  
P => Generally a good hotel to stay I stayed there for two days during the Republican Convention  Booked a double bed room on priceline for under   The room is indeed small  Dont bring a lot of luggages because there isnt much space No minibar and no safety box  The room is a little bit dark because the walls are docorated with brown wall papers  But I like it being very clean and new  Also its quiet so you can have a good night sleep  The staffs are very courteous and helpful  Another plus is that it is close to subway stations  Generally I think its a good budget hotel  
P => Nice hotel Its one of Starwoods properties in NYC  Its more moderate in terms of price but they dont seem to skip on the quality  The beds are great the staff friendly and helpful  The ergonomic desk chair was great and the ac did the job I didnt get to the restaurant or bar so I wont comment on them  The location is about  blocks from  different subway lines as well as a couple of blocks from coffee and shopping  Lots of antiquevintage storessellers in the area  The hotel is in the heart of Chelsea so its quite friendly to gaylesbian guests  Lots of great restaurants in the area  Not much in terms of views from the hotel but its NYC what do you expect Id stay here again  
P => I hope they keep their rates low Stayed one week end of ust first week of tember during the Republican Convention  Yes the rooms are pretty small but almost everything else was great Comfortable beds modern lighting small but modern bathroom with superb water pressure powerful aircon excellent technical equipment TV flawless FREE highspeed internet in rooms superb ergonomic desk chair and plenty of power outlets  I got a great rate of   on their website  High praise for the housekeeping staff they kept the room spotless and were not causing too much noise  Excellent location close to subway and some great restaurants you need to try the quotBiltmore Roomquot on  Eight Avenue and th Street a hidden gem in walking distance  Extreme friendly and helpful staff  Only minor complaints The doors have a slam shut mechanism bring earplus otherwise almost no street noise and on my departure day they forgot my wake up call but apologized for the mistake I still made my flight  Restaurant not yet open they should mention it on their website  Will definitely return and hope they keep their rates low I tried to book for ember and rate are partly up to   a night now If you get a room for around   you cannot go wrong with this new hotel  Thanks Mr  Apodaca for your restaurant recommendation and thanks again Gloriana for faxing me the papers I requestedF  Diederichs Phoenix 
P => EXCELLENT This was my th trip to NY this year and by far the best place I have stayed  Staff was out of the  way friendly location was excellent  not too touristy like Times Square and the rooms were beautifully furnished  If you can live without room service this is the place to stay I got the room from Priceline for under  and wasnt expecting much  However I would stay here again and be willling to pay a lot more for the comfort amp location offered by Four Points Chelsea  
P => Cozy modern Chelsea hotel This hotel is a great find There are not many hotels in Chelsea and this one is perfect  It is new clean and modern  The staff was very friendly I even left my glasses in the room and upon returning home I called they had the glasses and sent them to me  no charge by  day air  The beds are very comfortable and yes the rooms are small but so is everything in NYC  The Whole Foods across the street is a plus  They have a temporary restaurant it wil be interesting to see the fininshed product  I will definately stay there again

P => Nice hotel   good value for your money I stayed here for  night over the weekend during a business trip  First time I stayed over in NY and picked this hotel as I got a good deal on the price gt dollar Hotel service was nice umbrella for loan friendly staff    and gave me a comfortable feeling upon check in  The location of the hotel was not perfect but close to a subway and I really did not ask for more  The room and general areas in teh hotel are clean and modern views outside of the window are not great but for an overnight stay I really did not needwant to pay for a prime location  I did not use the restaurantbar of teh hotel so no opinion on the qualityambiance  Overall I would recommend this hotel to other business travellers  
P => Great location good value hotel Joined my husband on a business trip  Was not expecting much except a great location  I was pleasantly surprised  New rooms with an industrial urban feel which fits in with the surroundings  Very small roomsbathrooms but definitely well appointed  No valet parking which was a pain  Location is perfect  Walked to Mas in village for dinner  In the morning walked down the Hudson to Battery Park  Beautiful morning A lot of revitalization going on  If your on a budget this a great hotel 
P => Best Hotel Experience Ive Had In NYC So Far    I loved this hotel  We arrived really early in the morning am and the front desk and bell staff were so helpful and accommodating with storing our bags assigning us a room and acclimating us with our surroundings  This hotel was the perfect location between Soho and Greenwich Village close to subways easy to hail cabs etc  We were able to get to know staff around the clock and all were so friendly and helpful   it felt like we were staying with family We even got hugs as we were leaving I will definitely recommend this hotel again and we hope to see you soon Oh and I was hesitant about the room size at first there was  of us staying in one room but it was layed out so well that it made getting ready for a night out effortless  Love you guys 
P => Wonderful hotel great location very friendly helpful staff My husband and I spent a week in NY and could not have been happier with this hotel  We arrived earlier than the check in time but they were able to hold our bags and get a room ready for us much earlier than we expected  We got a great room over looking the Empire State building and it was clean and comfortable  The staff always greeted us with a smile and was very helpful with any questions we might have  It made our visit to NY a great one and we will definitley come back and stay at this hotel  
P => Met all expectaions and then some I traveled     with  other friendscoworkers to New York City  I had checked prices on hotels for  months prior to the trip and found that this was the best deal and the pictures looked great  We were very pleased to find that the pictures were acurate The rooms were clean and beautifully orated  There were no complaints on the hotel what so ever What stood out the most with the Four PointSoho is the incredible staff  They were friendly and helpful and went out of thier way to make our stay more enjoyable  During the  days we were there we met many different employees and they all were wonderful I will stay here again when i go back and I recommend it for anyone else  
P => Cheerful staff   new hotel For this business trip which I extended with my personal Starpoints I required a complicated series of reservations because the reservations also involved other business travelers in additional rooms  The staff at the Four Point SoHo helped me through it all even when I asked for changes to the reservations  I guess I should not have been surprised that several of the front desk staff seemed to know who I was when I checked in    but I am surprised that they seemed happy to see I made it to their hotel in spite of my complicated series of reservations changes and use of Starpoints  Five stars for the staff especially the ever cheerful Emely The hotel itself is attractive inside and out and was only one year old when we stayed there  The basement gymn was completely empty both times I visited it in early mornings  Except for the  or st floors each floor has just  rooms    four facing the street four facing the alley  From inside my room I did not hear the neighbor in the adjacent rooms    good sound insulation Tip for people who sleep with an open window Ask for a room facing the alley south  The rooms facing the alley are much quieter because the taxi drivers who honk all night long on are driving south on nearby th Avenue away from the south facing rooms and the view facing south is MUCH more interesting than the buildings across from the hotels Charlton Street entrance Even though the first two blocks near the Four Points SoHo are largely boring office buildings the next blocks are amazing  We picked the Four Points SoHo because it had the best rate allowed for extra days with Starpoints and was within easy walking distance of NYU where we attended a conference  The walk each day was wonderful because SoHo and Greenwich Village have beautiful buildings and neighborhoods  Also we came visiting Manhattan from small cities but these neighborhoods    and everywhere we traveled in Manhattan and Brooklyn    felt completely safe  I was impressed  
P => Excellent hotel in an excellent location Stayed here for  nights with my wife  The staff was so friendly and helpful particularly Alex the rooms are small but plenty of room     super clean and brand new  Housekeeping did an amazing job  The best part of this hotel is the proximity to the Houston St  Subway Station less than a block away  Bleeker St  Spring St  are loaded with restaurants and shopping and are only a few minute walk for the hotel  I would stay here again   for sure  
P => Great location friendly staff and nice room My wife and I stayed here in tember  for two nights  We paid a little more for a room with a bigger bed We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room considering that its New York  It looked like it had just been orated and was well appointed  The bed was very comfortable Our room came with a coffee machine a safe ice bucket and robes  There is a small gym in the basement and also a small bar near reception  There is a small business centre with a couple of PCs that was useful for checking in for flights and printing train tickets  Im pretty sure that there was free wi fi too All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful from those on check in to the cleaners  Any request was dealt with promptly The location here is fantastic  You are a short stroll from Greenwich Village but not in the middle of the melee and are near both the  red and ACE blue subway lines  We came in from JFK by taxi and it would have been easier to get the subway to Spring St   it is literally just round the corner  We didnt eat at the hotel as there was a great deli open on the corner of the street   although this was only open on weekdays We had a great stay here with the only downside being that we felt the cost of the room was a bit high  Its the first hotel weve stayed in at New York that wed go back to though and weve been quite a few times  
P => Great location ent room some quirks I have stayed in the Four Points Soho for several weeks  The best part about it is the location near the West Village and walking distance well about  minutes from downtown  The front desk and bar staff is friendly  Rooms are modern but small  No suites for platinum members no lounge and the gym is minimal  However for those looking for a value hotel walking distance from the village and you cant afford the W Union Square the four points is a great option  
P => Cozy wonderful hotel with   WOW   location Set just a few minutes walk from Bleeker street this hotel is perfectly situated for seeing the SoHo and Village  Great shopping and eateries in the area Chinatown not too far away and a few subway stops in the area make this a great place to stay  Room was small but very very comfortable One negative   breakfast was over rated and over priced  Get out of the hotel and knosh on a bagel or egg n cheese sandwich from the local bodega There are many many food options get out of the hotel 
P => A perfect fit for our vacation I scoured long and hard looking for a ent Manhattan hotel under  a night  Lo and behold on Travelocity only the  Points had a deal for  a night  It couldnt have worked out better  The hotel is less than a year old so everything is still new  You are  blocks from the shops and restaurants in SoHo and  block from the  Line subway  We cht a broadway show in Times Square and it was barely  minutes straight up the subway and we were right there   minutes further up the line and youre at the corner of Central Park  Another highlight of the location was walking  blocks west and youre right on the Hudson  Its about a  minute stroll down the sidewalk and youre in Battery Park and the Financial district  Im sure you could spend more money and get a little more space but were all about spending our money on shopping and restaurants  Oh and the A C  in our room was great  You can have the fan only on and it provides a nice hum to sleep too drowning out the outside horns and sirens you hear anywhere in the city  
P => Great hotel quiet  Weve stayed here a few days mid tember  Great hotel in Soho area and very close   min walk to meatpacking district amp Greenwich   Free wireless internet is just great  Starbucks coffee in the hotel room  comfartable beds  hotel safe free  great staff they fixed our shower immediately      
P => Great Place to Stay in Soho NYC It was the first time that i chose a hotel in soho to stay in NYC and it turned a very pleasant surprise  The hotel is brand new very well located clean and affordable  The rooms are not so tiny the bathrooms are classic and good tasting U can walk to the subway to the most interesting atracttions in soho and village and u are  blocks from Bleecker Street  Perfect  
P => Great place to stay in new york Went there in tember for the second time the first being in il  service is laid back and friendly stayed on the top floor overlooking the Finacial District great view  Still could hear the traffic on th ave but it was ok  Room was small ish but clean and tidy great shower and free wireless internet  Great location for resturants around soho meatpacking district and th ave all within walking distance  The hotel bar is small but is ok you can sit outside when its warm  For us it was a great spot away from the touristy areas  We stayed there for  nights well worth it  
P => A well run service oriented  star Recently opened hotel I keep coming back here for the good pricing clean rooms very comfy beds fast free Wi Fi and a locations that although in an upcoming area thats currently still quite industial is steps away from SoHo and the Village    and for an excellent frequent guest program  In my  stays here I have not encountered any problems and the staff has ranged from being good to excellent P S  a major design flaw is that the bathroom ventilation is not in the shower so that area can stay moist I have spotted some beginnings of mildew in one shower 
P => Pleasant and enjoyable stay Stayed for  nights at an agreeable rate buy  nights get one free  Had a front room  The room was clean and tidy the location was great only a few blocks from most of the action  Really had a pleasant stay  The front desk staff were pleasant and courteous and always said hello  goodbye etc when arriving and leaving  Felt really at home  Would stay again  
P => Very nice stay at the Four Points SoHo The Four Points SoHo is clean nice reasonably priced and has an awesome location  The fun areas of SoHo and Greenwich Village are a  minute walk outside your door and there are two subway stations within a short walk one is right by the hotel  Its also nice that they have a bar and some tables and chairs outside in front of the hotel under cover    that was nice especially on a rainy night  We will definitely stay here again The only hitch    I agree with one of the other reviews    the air conditioning was a bit noisy  
P => Great room great service great location cant go wrong After MUCH searching I found Four Points Soho  Its easy to be concerned when reading the negative comments but I cant see how someone could be dissatisfied with this hotel  The staff were friendly at all shifts and very accomodating  The room was perfect good size   I assumed that the room was going to be extra small bc it was in NYC  It was one of the very few hotels that had two double beds which I need bc there were three of us on the girls weekend  And it was truly a few blocks from Soho  This will definitely be my default hotel whenever I go to NYC for the weekend  
P => Good Room Great Location Friendly staff that provided great dining recommendation try a Thai spot called Peep  Room was nice clean comfortable although view wasnt great  Shower pressure was awesome  Only one working elevator when I stayed and the ice maker is in the basement  Easily accessible from a few subway stops  Just a few short blocks away from SoHo action saw Mike Meyers in fact 
P => Great hotel great location Loved this hotel  Great location in Soho  Close to subway  Good shopping and restaurants close by  Great price for clean modern room  Would definitely stay again  
P => very good hotel comfortable clean and affordable  We spent  nights in the hotel and liked it very much  The rooms are small and full and theres little place for bags and suitcases we were  of us BUT we were in NYC  We only came to the room for taking a shower and sleeping  Perfect Everything what we needed was there and working beds are comfortable shower is strong and theres hot water all the time TV phone AC  We had a room to the street but it was no problem at all the room was not noisy  The next subway is one street away and there are some restaurants cafes around  The reception personal was very friendly and helpful  We didnt eat there therefore no comments about food  They have w lan in room and also some free computers in the lobby  And a small fitness room which we didnt use  All together we will come back to this hotel next time in NYC if we get the same deal or better 
P => nice staff poor neighborhood noisy room and AC Ok people at front desk are nice hotel is clean  Thats already great But the AC is horrible makes you wake up during the night when its on auto mode but if its turned off you can hear the traffic outside   make your choice  If youre a spg gold or more never expect to get your upgrade too small hotel and only two suites  More its difficult to get your PM check  out because they seems to be sold out mst of the time  
P => Perfect Quiet Getaway Spot In NYC The Sheraton Four Points SoHo in NYC is a brand new no frills hotel in a quiet but convenient area of the city  It is two short blocks from the subway and a short walk to the West Village and a short subway ride to Broadway and Times Square  The rooms are small although no smaller than most NYC hotels but well equipped clean and fairly well designed  The bathroom is very small and we were disappointed to find that we were only given two bath towels although the other amenities were fine  I am sure we could have requested some additional towels  This is not a hotel that would easily accommodate children as the rooms are small and there is no lobby to speak of  There is a fitness center downstairs  The hotel is probably full of businessmen during the week and has a small desk area and internet access in each room  Parking is available for  but it is a short walk away  There is a coffeemaker in the room complete with Starbucks coffee and tea  There is a Dunkin Doughnuts right downstairs and the hotel has a small outdoor seating area where you can sit with a newspaper and enjoy your breakfast  There is a deli a block away that serves breakfast as well as a McDonalds  The hotel does serve food and has room service  Within one block is the Jacques Torres flagship chocolate store where you can actually see them making chocolate and is a must see especially if you are a tourist and have never been there before  We were in NYC to attend a wedding that was three blocks away and the hotel fit our needs very well  The staff was friendly and helpful and I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to a freind  
P => Excellent service and location We were pleasantly surprised with our stay at the Four Points Soho  I didnt realize what a convenient location it had  We were literally a block from the Red  Line Houston Station which connected us to several site seeing spots as well we were walking distance to Washington Square and the best shopping in China Town and on Broadway  We also walked around through Greenwich Village and found some excellent restaurants within quick walking distance from our hotel The hotel itself was on par with most Sheratons Ive stayed at clean and modern  The rooms were small which was to be expected but we were happy to find that we had an amazing view we could see the Woolworth Building from our room  I recommend asking for a south facing room The only minor complaint I have involves the bathroom  The door is made of a sheer material  You cant see through it but light does pass through which made night time bathroom trips a nuisance for the other people in my room  Also there is no bathroom fan and I found it made for a slightly musty smell in the bathroom  
P => Adequate rooms with comfy beds in ok location Stayed here for  nights in last week of il with  other friends in a room with  double beds  The GoodBeds were comfortable  Room size was a tad too small for  persons huge bags but reckoned has enough space for  people  toilet was nice not overly roomy but of a nice size   you just need that much space for yourself after all do you not Tazo tea and Starbucks coffee with one bottle of water available daily  Free and efficient internet connection a big draw  TV was large and good  Location is good as Prince Street is just  blocks away yet hotel is located away from the hustle of busy Soho The BadAC will turn itself onoff while it adjusts to the temperature even while you are sleeping   noisy AC if you are a light sleeper  Toiletries supply was not consistent  Housekeeping did not provide new soaps and shampoos etc EVERY day  Even after I wrote a note telling housekeeping of the error  Elevator was slow but I was in no hurry so I found it ok but that irritated my friends alot  Ipod docking station was not working Will I stay there again I will be again coming in  weeks time  Price wise this hotel is good  Location wise I like it as it is in Soho but not central Soho yet easily accessible by foot  
P => Great Location Clean Rooms Just returned from a  night pleasure trip in NYC and stayed at the Sheraton Four Points Soho  The hotel delivered exactly what I was looking for Location in Soho clean hotel and reasonable rate for NYC anyway  The hotel delivered on all points As other reviews state the rooms are small but are very functional with a clean and and well appointed bathroom Great location within Soho and a short walk to a subway entrance  Overall a good clean functional hotel for business or pleasure  
P => cozy hotel in a good location I think this hotel is a ent choice in NYC depending on your expectations  I book a special rate program through the spg com website    off the second night but you had to pay a slightly higher rate the first night  Still a good deal  As a spg member I was hoping I might get an upgrade of some sort but even my request for an upper floor seemed to go unrecognized  I also thought that the fact that I had prepaid my stay might get me a little better service in that regard  But I ended up with a room on the th floor  So I could barely see over the building at the back of the hotel  If you are on a floor lower than  and on the back of the building you will have zero view But that is all quibbling  The room itself was compact but efficient  Flat screen hi def TV seems to be a requirement of most hotels these days  There is free wifi that worked fine  And an electronic safe in the little wardrobe  The bathroom is nice with a small sinkvanity  The shower is large and done in nice black granite tiles  The ac is noisy and if you run the fan on auto it will kick on cool the room artically for a couple of minutes and then shut off for a while  Running the fan continuously makes the noise less jarring and seems to keep things at a more constant temperature I found the bed fine but the pillows really lacking in support I did not eat at the hotel  Prices are very high for food as most hotels do  There are tons of places to eat a short walk from the hotel  Two subway stations are nearby  The   th Ave line is less than a block away  The CE Spring Street station is a few blocks away  So easy access to midtown and beyond  Taxis are not familiar with the hotel  I had to direct my cabbie and he still went right past it There is a small grocerydeli on th Ave so a short walk away for picking up a couple of things  Film Forum is nearby The staff were very friendly All things considered I think this is a ent choice in the Manhattan  In the last couple of years I have been to NYC three times and this was certainly the best of those hotels I stayed in  
P => Our favourite Sheraton in New York We are just back from a  day stay at this hotel and we loved it  As others note the rooms are not huge but they are well appointed and clean  The bed was super comfortable and the AC worked amazingly well during our hot stay  The staff is all very friendly and actually remembered us during the stay  The only down side is the elevators it is one of those hotels with lots of floors but only  rooms per floor so we spent a lot of time waiting  Next time well ask for a lower floor  The hotel is in a bit of an odd but really convenient location i think it is more village than SoHo  Easy access to the subway including the  and the ACE lines and everything village  We will definitely be back And if you stay here be sure to check out this restaurant which was spectacular and  minutes from the hotel httpkettablenyc com 
P => Perfect location very nice hotel rooms I love NYC to pieces and try and go there as often I can  The Four points by Sheraton in SoHo village is a brand new hotel building and I stayed there in ember of  for  nights  The lobby is very small and so are the rooms but this is NYC and hotel rooms are usually small  However the rooms are superbly orated and the bathrooms are very very nice as are the comfy beds and bath robes  So a very clean and modern hotel with small but super nice rooms is what you get here in a hot location with loads of interesting stores and restaurants in the neighborhood  The front desk staff also were very warm and welcoming and as a member of the Starwood preferred guest program me and my spouse were offered an upgraded room with a beautiful view of downtown NYC which I highly appreciated I will for sure come back and will consider staying at the Four points by Sheraton any time 
P => Great staff and location  Small rooms but clean and new The staff here is exceptional  Went out of their way for us  Brought extra towels right away and helped a friend who was feeling ill  Good location not too far from SoHo and a ten minute walk to Grenich or Tribeca  Rooms and bathroom are small but they are clean and modern  
P => Sall rooms but great staff The staff will do anything in their power to accomodate you  These rooms are not big enough for more than  or  people that dont need to move about  Everything is tiny   although we were given a high floor the view was of nothing  The hotel is convenient and the staff is wonderful so depending on the number of guests and purpose you might want to stay at the Embassy Suites if you need more room   we moved after the first night 
P => Great Location The rooms are small but practical and quite clean  Noisy AC  Good TV  Coffee machine is a blessing especially after arriving from Europe and waking at AM every morning  Elevator takes forever  Vending machine out of water  Staff very friendly and not as stiff as in the bigger NY hotels  No bed bugs which is a big plus for any hotel these days  All in all a delightful homey kind of hotel yet modern enough Great proximity to all the restaurants and shops in Soho walking distance to Canal Street Meatpacking District Little Italy Chinatown  Try the walk from the hotel down to the WTC area by way of the Hudson River path  Take an immediate left when leaving the hotel until you quothitquot the river then turn left and keep on going until youre all the way downtown  Early in the morning its lovely dog walkers joggers bikes and the majestic Hudson  Construction continues but it has improved greatly over the years  Another suggestion just around the corner on Varick Street is the New York Winery I think thats the name  Theyre just starting out and are not in the best location meaning not in the heart of bustling Soho but they have a really good selection of wine and a nice staff  Good luck to you guys  
P => Very Friendly Comfortable and Modern  New very modern hotel  Very comfortable room  Lots of very good resturants close by  Friendly staff  
P => Excellent little hotel   boutique style rooms Rooms were small but very nicely furnished   large comfortable bed flat screen etc  Staff helpful and friendly  Good location for shopping and restaurants  
P => Good Value and clean but small rooms Stayed on business for three nights  The hotel is a short walk from great restaurants and bars in the West Village or a short cab ride  subway journey from everything else on Manhattan  In fact you could easly walk and I did to Midtown in about  minutes  The hotel is new tall and very narrow with only about eight rooms on each floors  Certainly not a luxury hotel but it is clean and functional  Rooms are on the small side  I stayed in a deluxe room which was fine for one person had there been two of us the lack of space would have been an issue  Lobby is absolutely tiny   just a reception desk and four arm chairs and the elevator  There is a small bar just to the side of the lobby and a small breakfast restaurant just behind it  There are also a couple of PCs between the restaurant and the bars which are free to use  
P => Great hotel in NYC I just stayed at the Four Points in SOHO for a conference  The service is great the rooms are really tidy and clean NY sizes and it is close to several subway stops  The rate was very reasonable for New York City but really put it over the top for me is the service  The staff makes it a  star experience  I was really surprised  The brought my luggage out to me in the rain when I ran out of the lobby to grab a cab to the airport  I had already checked out but thats the kind of staff they have and theyd been that way during my whole three day stay The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable  The bar could be bigger but its New York  There are plenty of bars around  
P => Great hotel and worth the price We stayed at this hotel  nights in late ch for a business conference in Soho  The location was great and the price couldnt be beat  Staff was friendly and accomodating though I didnt think the housekeeping staff cleaned the bathroom very well  The hotel room is SMALL but ok for two  Subway only  blocks away  plenty of places to grab a quick breakfast and not too far a walk to the West Village  Only negative  hotel is on the main entrance for the Holland tunnel and it can get loud  you can only stay on the upper floors if you have a Starwood points card get one they are free  It can get noisy on the lower floors with the traffic noise That said I would definitely stay again 
P => Loved this hotel for lots of reasons    Visiting a friend who lives in the West Village we were lost for close by hotels until I found this one  What a great little hotel in the perfect location for us This Four Points opened in ember of  according to the great bartender on duty Tuesdays and Wednesdays and still looks clean and new  Yes the rooms are small welcome to New York but theyre spotless and efficient with lots of nice little amenities right down to a padded lap desk Our room was on the th floor upper floors available first to Starwood Preferred Guest members which lifted us above some of the street noise but didnt afford that great a view  Our first night of five was on the third floor facing south    the view was of a brick wall  The staff was helpful in moving us for the remainder of our stay The restaurant is small but all youll need for breakfast  The lobby bar has six or seven seats at the bar a television and lots to choose from  Once again its all youll need Subway stops are near by Varick and Houston and there always seemed to be plenty of cabs out front If you dont mind a little bit of togetherness it was my wife and our  and  year old sons youll love this placeCiao 
P => Great location great price so so experience The great  AAA rate for a Saturday night  Plenty of available street parking close to hotel you can park in front for  hour to unload   they will give you a sign for your car  Small but efficient room flat screenent bed free WiFi  Great location   close two blocks walk east  to the heart of SoHo or three block north east to Greenwich Village  The so so Somewhat surly staff weird hotel configuration a support pillar blocking the front door entrance and another the elevators small rooms narrow hallway on each floor strange quotC levelquot   the basement with tiny gym ice machines etc  The complimentary water is warm  The shower is amazingly narrow and leaks miserably  The hotel can be loud   from street noise or from narrow hallways  Elevators sem to take forever  A lobby bar that looks like a glass closet All told   price  location  parking clearly make up for some relative negatives  Will visit again unless something else nearby can match value  
P => Cant Miss Hotel in the Heart of the City I have been staying at this hotel every week for a few months while I work in NJ  I travel for work every week as a consultant and this is the best hotel Ive every stayed in for work  Its fairly new   and right in the middle of restaurants and good shops on the SOHOWest Village line  The staff is very friendly and accomodating  Highly recommended for free internet free water and a very comfy bed  Hotel is less than a block from the  subway station on Houston St  
P => Really liked it There are so many advantages to staying at the Four Points that you cant imagine  Number one Parking  We parked our car a half block away and kept it there all weekend  If youre not sheepish about leaving your car on the street in New York this is the place to stay  The Four Points is a small boutique style hotel thats been open less than half a year  Everythings new and clean  Its super quiet and the rooms are not tiny compared to other properties  The staff is wonderful  When we walked in on a cold night they offered us hot apple cider  You wont find that at a large impersonal hotelWe didnt eat breakfast at the hotel opting for neighborhood restaurants such as Cafe Borgia on Prince Street just walk east on Charlton and the Van Dam Diner one block south A minor complaint If you take a late at night shower you might not find the water very hot  It was fine other times even earlier at night  The shower head is terrific The hotel is a little off the beaten path and the neighborhood is semi industrial so at night you might find it lonely  But walk two blocks north or east and youll find the excitement of the Village or SoHo  The IRT   train is less than a five minute walk from the hotel  
P => PERFECT Just got back from a great stay here  I was in NYC for New Years with two friends  We met up from different parts of the country and wanted to be somewhere fun for New Years but not in the crazy midtown area  This turned out to be perfect  It was easy enough to grab a cab to head uptown to tour around and a short stroll to the SoHo and Village areas    even an easy walk to check out Canal Street Chinatown ect  Tons of restaurants delis bars shops and everything nearby  Being very unfamiliar with Manhattan I was hesitant on booking this hotel since it is not in the typical tourist area but once we got there and walked a couple blocks we were SO HAPPY with the choice  To make it better the staff was the nicest staff Ive ever experienced  They were happy to help us with any questions we had  And along with suggestions we got walking maps and directions to suit our needs  They made the stay amazing And since it is hard to adjust the first day a good destination to grab lunch or a drink is always helpful  The only difficult part was the size of the room which I am assuming is normal for Manhattan it is just a little small for three  some year old girls  Clothes and shoes were EVERYWHEREI want to be back there 
P => Great NYC Four Points property This is quickly becoming one of my favorite quotaffordablequot for NYC that is hotels in New York City taking the place of the Sheraton P Chelsea  For the sake of this review Ill use Chelsea as the barometer for Four Points properties in the city  Good  Rooms Very small but modern and well built  Wood and steel accents  I dont feel claustrophobic like I sometimes do at the P Chelsea   Complimentary in room internet WiFi or wired  Not always the fastest but it works   Location with a quotbut This location isnt what I or most people I know would reasonably call SoHo  its generous to do so  However the  train is a block away and the Holland tunnel is right there as well  However getting a taxi is a hit or miss so give yourself time   Service Friendly desk staff  Very welcoming Bad  Lack of amenities No breakfast or any type of lounge  Bottle of water is standard as with other P properties   Lack of suites Similar to Chelsea I believe there are less than four suites in the hotel  Tough to book even tougher to get upgraded even if you stay there every week     Location As I said above this is an interesting location  Not much in the way of entertainment or food in the immediate vicinity youll have to travel up Varick St  to the village for that but there are options close by    Parking No garage on site  quotPreferredquot garage is two blocks away  Its a safe neighborhood but I wouldnt want to walk there or back alone if I had the choice esp  if youre a womanAll in all I really like the hotel and prefer to stay there when Im looking for a quiet night away from the usual craziness of NYC  Highly recommended  
P => Basic and Functional This is a new no nonsense hotel in Soho about   blocks from pockets of restaurants  The hotel is basic and great for business traveler small clean totally functional rooms lots of desk level plugs yay tiny little exercise room   machines  hr access and some of the narrowest showers I have ever seen alas no bathtub  Small somewhat awkward interior lobby with a big outdoor seating area that abuts the inside bar  stools total  As a colleague pointed out the exterior looks a bit like a garage   dont be alarmed  My main negatives the fans and blowers in bedroom and bathroom that seem to turn on and off at random during the night AND the hot water in the shower never seemed to creep above warm but sink got to hot   go figure  This place is  degrees from the designed experience of the Tribeca or Soho Grand where I often stay there is no hipster element no ambient soundtrack no amber mood lighting no attitude laden staff  In many ways it was a refreshing change  I will stay here again  Good nearby restaurants   a number of places on Bedford Street near DowlingCarmine Spring near Thompson Recommend Ditch Plains AquaGrille and about  othersApprox   rooms per floor  Caswell  Massey toiletries  Opened t   Have had rates quoted from  to  so ask nicely 
P => Great for the Price This is my seventh time in NYC during the Black Friday chaos  We usually stay in boutique hotels but ided to try this Sheraton bc it was fairly small new and in Soho I think the rooms were not that small has anyone ever stayed at The Mela The service was great  We were given a room at a very early check in and a given a late check out with no charge The bar is small but cozy the free internet service is great No noise  I guess it was a holiday great location if you like Soho  Accessible to GREAT restos and to taxi cabs If driving to the city you can actually find free parking on the streets  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who loves a a great price for the boutiqish style look  
P => Nice Hotel Eh Staff I chose this hotel because I am a loyal starwood guest and it was one of the cheaper rates for the time I was going to be in NYC  Before I start telling you all the bad things that happened during my stay let me first say that it was overall a very pleasant experience  The rooms although small were reasonable and comfortable  I would not recommend this hotel for people traveling with a large family  This being a new hotel I was fairly surprised at the level of service I received  Overall the staff at the front desk were very helpful with the exception of one who seemed to talk and never get anything done  I would ask for something as simple as a bathrobe and it wouldnt get delivered until I spoke to at least two different reps  I wont name names but this person worked during the early shift and I didnt see him around at night  Hope that you dont get him for check in    The restaurant is a whole other issue  I ate there because the staff at the desk recommended it on my first night being that I was tired and I was new to NY I did not want to galavant around town looking for something to eat  There was absolutely no one eating in the restaurant  It was just me and two flat screen tvs  The one staff member seemed to be the waiter and the barkeep so as you can imagine service was horrible  Anytime I needed something I would have to go to the bar and ask  The food wasnt that great but its what you expect from a hotels restaurant  ent  After these minor hiccups on the first day the rest of my stay was a breeze  
P => Soho Village good deal for price wminor quibbles We spent two nights ThanksgivingBlack Friday at the Sheraton Four Points Soho Village  Extremely clean and although the KingDeluxe room like anyplace else Ive stayed in NYC was on the small side it was comfortable newly furnished generally quiet there is apparently some construction in the neighborhood but not on this holiday weekend and did I say this before very clean  Nice complimentary toiletries but   my minor quibble surprisingly roughcheap toilet paper  Pleasant and helpful staff  For under night I think this was a pretty good value  Comparing travelocity hotels com orbitz on line prices with the Sheratons own reservation system I got the best price by calling the  number  No on site parking but they provide a discount for a garage several blocks away which added another  to the cost of the stay We were on an upper floor so we had a great view of downtown Manhattan  The immediate neighborhood is mixed commercial residential and fairly deserted after dark but not unsafe  Arriving late on Thanksgiving evening we wound up having a nightcap at the somewhat overpriced hotel bar but once we had our bearings we found it a very short walk   blocks to Sohos many shopsrestaurantsetc  The Aqua Grill a few blocks away has fabulous seafood and an amazing selection of raw oysters  
P => Promising Hotel   Would return My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton SOHO t    ober   shortly after the hotel opened  Just about everything I have read in the other reviews seems accurate  We had an insane number of problems but the staff were invariably considerate and worked hard to overcome every problem  Most of the problems were a consequence of the newness of the hotel  Some problems were due to the construction next door  Other complaints by reviewers about small rooms and anemic exercise facilities are correct but consistent with most Manhattan hotels The location is fabulous if you want to explore SOHO Chelsea and the rest of lower Manhattan  We have usually stayed upper midtown a couple of blocks from Central Park so this was a nice change  Yes there are not a slew of restaurants within a block but there are within   blocks  Access to the subway is good although you have to make more changes than if you enter the system from some other locations  No one mentioned that the location is incredible for chocolate lovers as Jacques Torres is just around the corner  We walked to the Blue Note in under  minutes  Ignoring the many other attractions in the area such close proximity to great jazz and chocolate makes it hard to complain As I wrote we did experience many problems some major like no water unexpectedly after working out one morning  However I have stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world including some that are considered among the best  It is always possible to find faults but in my experience if the staff are dedicated and considerate whatever problems arise they make it so that I have a good stay  The staff here were among the best I have found and so as they settle into their work and iron out the kinks in the building I expect this to become a very popular hotel  
P => Sheraton Soho great location After reading some negative reviews I was hesitant to stay at the Sheraton Soho    I booked anyway because there arent many hotels in the Soho area  My husband and I stayed  nights and were pleasantly surprised The room was very clean nicely orated and the bathrooms were spotless and new  The rooms were typical NYC size hotel staff was nice and maids were wonderful  Absolutely no complaints and wouldnt hesitate to stay again  Anyone who gave a negative review due to the location either doesnt know Manhattan or hasnt been there many times amp is looking for the touristy stuff  MacDougal amp Bleecker Streets are within easy easy walking distance and have loads of great pubs cafes and bars amp restaurants Try Cafe Reggio on MacDougal for breakfast   yummy cappucino The Red Lion near Washington Sq  for several bands daily and Murrays Cheese Shop on Bleecker for EVERYTHING ITALIAN and Johns Pizza on Bleecker   trust me 
P => Great stay We stayed at the Sheraton Four Points Soho over Halloween weekend   Its brand new and very clean and well run  Everyone we dealt with was very nice the room was normal Manhattan size although it had a desk and a side couch type area which is more than Ive had at other hotels in the city We loved the location   walking distance to Greenwich and SoHo restaurants stores and bars  We obviously had a very opposite experience from one of the previous posters   Never had a problem finding a cab    Plenty of places to eat nearby if you just walk a few blocks      Bed was super comfy   Agreed on the pillows not being my favorite but the mattress was greatThey also had nice bath products Caswell Massey and free bottled water which doesnt make or break a stay but are nice additionsIll definitely stay here on my next trip to the city if the prices stay the same    
P => New choice near NYU We use Starwood properties when we stay in NYC  We were very excited to see a new Sheraton in Lower Manhattan because we now have a dhter at NYU Law and this hotel is within walking distance  It is located a few blocks from the Houston St stop on the quotquot  On arrival we were greeted by a very enthusiastic knowledgable young staff  There were no Starwood rooms available as yet so we left our luggage and went to lunch  Recommend quotBreadquot as an economical tasty choice  We had asked for an upper floor  quiet location   beware there is a lot of construction in the area  and we were put in room   The room is small but well planned out  Neutral colors king bed nice LCD tv with good channel selection work desk with a power strip FREE wifi Starbucks coffee and hot chocolate  There also is a chair with a floor lamp next to the bed  Bathroom is also compact   good lighting magnifyingshaving mirror Speakman shower head plenty of towels  Fancy frameless glass shower door that doesnt close tightly so floor gets wet  Room also has slippers and bathrobe and free bottled water  Ventilation system worked well and was quiet  Only negative we observed was very slow elevators  Overall we highly recommend this hotel as a great choice for lower Manhattan  
P => Soho is the Gem I was one of the first guests to check in at this hotel  When I called starwood reservation I wanted a clean hotel in a nice neighborhood  The rep told me that this hotel is brand new so I figured why not  I went to the hotel and its very trendy  There were lots of staff on hand to help me out as this was the nd day of opening  The lobby is small but functional  I stayed up on the th floor and have no complaints  The rooms are NYC rooms and if anyone complains about these rooms they should try booking themselves into the W New York on Lexington Avenue  These are probably  percent larger in size than that W  The location is up and coming and I did not mind since it was only  blocks to the West Village and  blocks to West Broadway where all the shopping and restaurants is to be done  I wish I took pictures of the hotel room but you will not be disappointed  The bathrooms are very nice and clean with glass door showers  There are LCD TVs in the rooms and pretty good noise insulation as there was a bachelorette party  rooms down from me  I would highly recommend this hotel and not put Soho as my top location to stay in when I come in to New York City  Which is going to be a lot now since my firm sends me here over  times every month  I highly recommend this place and do not know why I read a bad review from the first poster  Probably because he is comparing the Soho Grand vs  a Four Points   Im not surprised since the Soho Grand is about  a night   Apples to Oranges   If you go try Archipelago on Hudson Street  I heard from the waitress that they have the chef from one of Morimotos restaurants  
P => Total Rip Off  Bad Location  Didnt sleep I am currently staying at the Four Points Hotel in Soho New York  My company usually books me at the Tribeca Grand or Soho Grand  amazing boutique hotels  Since there is a UN conference this week those rooms went for over  a night  So I was booked at the Four Points Hotel instead at a whopping  a night  My boyfriend and I have been giving this place quotstrikesquot  Ill share those with you  Strike One BAD location  The only places to eat are Mcdonalds Dunkin Donuts and the empty one in the hotel  Also they are building a very large building directly next door to the hotel  So at  am  all you can hear is jackhammers and construction  Also since this street is so dead no cabs come here  You have to walk around  blocks just to get a cab and if you have luggage which most out of towners do  it can be a hassle  Strike Two The room size  SO tiny  Imagine a king size bed with about  foot of walking space around it  The bed is also the most uncomfortable thing either of us have ever slept on  Big still pillows with the Sheraton logo on  and you KNOW they dont wash the throw pillows and flat nasty feather pillows  Strike Three My boyfriend and I work out a lot  One of the main reason we stayed here was because of the so called quotstate  of  the  artquot gym  It is literally a treadmill an elliptical a bike and a small weight set  No wonder the website doesnt show photos of the gym  Strike Four The Restaurant  was empty  It WAS only Tuesday but when the hotel put so much effort into making the inside of the restaurant cool and your room sucks that bad  its annoying  Especially when we ate there and we were the only ones there and probably the only ones for the night  I wont ever stay here again  There are enough cool hotels in New York to choose from  dont stay here

P => not bad the hotel is very new clean and nice  its directly across the street from port authority in btwn th and th ave  right now there is alot of construction going on outside the hotel  but once you get inside you dont hear any of the outside noise anf forget that the neighborhood you are in is a little bit suspect  there is a xxx dvd store on the block but the area is not known to be really dangerous although i was not about to leave the hotel at am to find out  one of my issues was that the rooms are a bit cramped but it is ny  and at the sink you cant have hot water wo having the water pressure at the highest  i wasnt sure how to wash my face wo splashing water all over my clothes so i let the water fill the sink and then washed my face  
P => Clean and New in Red Light District I stayed here twice during ober  once for Columbus Day weekend with my wife and a second time by myself for the World Series  I used Starwood points each time and when I requested an upgrade based upon my platinum status I was given a suite on the top floor on my second visit  The rooms are quite nice and everything is brand new  The staff was friendly and helpful  The only downside of the hotel as others have noted is its location amidst porn shops across from Port Authority  If you can tolerate the half block walk back to a mainstream neighborhood the hotel is a good choice  
P => Its all relative in NYC      About me  Starwood Gold member and used points for two nights at this hotel  Rate I found on line was  per night which I felt was high for a Four Points property Arrived just after  a m  after a redeye from the west coast  Room availability at that hour is always a coin toss but they typically willl check you in when you are part of their quotprogram quot In this case hotel was completely sold out the night before  Seeing I was in a jam the front desk clerk offered me a key to a room that had been vacated but not yet cleaned so I could change into a suit for me meeting  The clerk that came on shortly after asked for my cell   and called me by  a m  with a clean room ready for my use  Ive been to  star hotels that do not offer that kind of service  Bellman and conierge were also helpful friendly and cordial each time I encountered them  I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel Location   I had th floor at the back of the hotel facing the Westin at st and th  Noise was absolutely zero  Im a little confused about the noise complaints from buses in and out of the port authority  There is some traffic in front of the hotel but I saw few buses and anything was rarely moving fast enough to make any noise due to proximity to traffic light and traffic  Perhaps it is louder on lower floors andor facing another direction  Im not sure what people expect in NY but there is nothing unsafe about this location  There is one or two adult bookstores on the block but never did I encounter anyone loitering and feel uncomfortable at any of the day or late night  Well located to attractions dining subway and Times Square  Best to walk  block to th or th to get a cab  They were not easy to find in front of the hotel  FInally this place is great if you are traveling in or out of Newark airport  Very close to the tunnel and you can get a one way charter bus on Coach USA for   Door to door in under  minutes Rooms   nice or with minimalist approach to orating  Beds were very comfortable and clean  Flat screen tv clock radio with mp connection plenty of outlets to plug things in  Bathroom lacks counter space as do most in Manhattan  Strangest thing to me was having the turn water pressure all of the way on to get hot water  The flat bottom sink would splash everywhere so use caution if you are fully dressed  Great glass shower with good pressure and lots of space  In room safe iron and ironing board all in good working order  Two free bottles of water per day and wiredwireless internet included throughout the hotel  Yes   the room is small as most are in NYC  If you sit at the desk across from the bed another person cannot pass behind you  You just dont get square footage in the city so I dont factor this as a negative Hotel   did not use the gym  Lounge is small counter up front for breakfast and drinks in the evening with a tv for sports or news  Did not order room service or use small restaurant on premise so I cannot speak to food  All common areas were were cared for and clean Not much negative to say about this hotel  If you can get a fair rate for this brand it certainly is a little gem for business or pleasure  
P => lousy location makes this one to avoid If youre nostalgic for the Times Square of porn shops and liquor stores Four Points is up your alley  Those establishments and the busy Port Authority bus station make this area busy and seedy  Rooms are new and clean with comfortable beds  Service is ok though they didnt clean my room until almost pm  With so many better choices in NYC and Times Square area dont bother unless rates are really low  
P => Great location Nice hotel in a good location right across from the Port Authority bus station and two blocks from Times Square  
P => Good Location Loud Slow Internet The proximity to Times Square Hells Kitchen and the Bus Terminal are convenient  But it results in the hotel being pretty loud  The rooms are clean modern and pretty much no frills  Beds are comfy  Internet is next to worthless the few times i was able to get on i ran a speed test with the resulting max download speed at  kbs modem from   If you are a business traveler who needs a hotel with connectivity dont stay her  If you are going to shows on broadway or want to see the city and stay someplace cheap this would be a good location  
P => Fantastic stay Were just back from a  night stay at this hotel  We were lucky enough to have a room on the th floor so noise wasnt a problem at all sign up to be a SPG member its free and youre more likely to get a room high up  From the th floor we had a nice enough view with no noise  The bed was the most comfortable bed I slept in and I already miss it The room was a good size neither small nor big and very clean Theres also a computer downstairs but the internet connection is quite slow  The complimentary bottle of water was a nice touch In terms of the area I knew that some reviews said that it was a shabby area  My husband didnt  I didnt tell him until we left that every single day we passed the Parole office and two adult stores and he was actually surprised and never noticed them I really dont think that the neighbourhood is that bad  OK its not like in the upper west side but for the price we paid for the hotel  all taxes included for  nights it was really good value for money with a great room with virtually most of the metro stations within  to  minutes walk Ooh and we also went on the roof th floor great view on Jersey and the times square area 
P => Comfy beds The neighborhood is not that seedy but it is noisy so bring your ear plugs My boyfriend and I came for an event at that riott quis but they were booked on Wednesday and Thursday so we had to look for alternate lodging where we could use our SPG points  The closest available hotel was the Four Points Midtown I read the reviews and was a little concerned about the neighborhood but figured it was only two nights and you are basically just there to sleep rightI believe this hotel went through a reation not long ago so the outside and lobby look new  The lobby is small with a small concierge desk check in desk and a tiny barcoffee lounge to the right Check in was pretty quick and we headed up to room     The room was simply remodeled but you could tell that it was an old remodeled room if that makes sense  Its small   there isnt room for two people to walk between the end of the bed and the deks at the same time  We had a king bed which I must say was VERY comfortable along with the pillows and linens   by far the best feature in the room with two nightstands an armoire to hang your clothes and housed the safe iron and ironing board and coffee maker a desk with chair a flat panel TV and a side chair and lamp  The bath was very small and plain but did the job  Not fancy  but clean and like I said the bed was fantasticAt this point I was pretty happy with the hotel and we went out exploring   SO   onto the hood   dont let the reviews saying that its a seedy neighborhood and that its unsafe scare you    its really not that bad Directly across the street is the Port Authority with buses coming in and out most hours of the day   so expect noise  Quite a lot of it actually Yes and just a few steps out the door of the hotel and to the right is a Parole Office but I honestly never saw anyone hanging around there  Nor did I see any shady looking characters hanging around the Adult DVD stores  Just keep walking by and youll be fine   Its about a   minute walk to Times Square depending if you hit stoplights or not and how fast you walk There are tons of convenience stores restaurants fast food and sit down and a Starbucks on the way We didnt have any issues with the air conditioningfan our water temperature or pressure   or anything else funky for that matter So far so good right   until we went to bed  Oh Lord It was so loud that I kept getting up to check to make sure the window wasnt open I am somewhat of a light sleeper but typically when Im traveling and I walk many many miles in a day I crash pretty hard  But it didnt matter how tired I was I absolutely couldnt get to sleep because of the noise   mostly coming from the Port Authority across the street  Luckily I remembered I had some ear plugs so I popped those in and managed to get about  hours of sleep  Now I have to say that my boyfriend is a very heavy sleeper and could fall asleep on a tarp in the middle of a construction site so he didnt have any problems  Perhaps the noise wouldnt be as bad on a higher floor My suggestion would be to avoid the street side on the th floor   unless you sleep like my boyfriend Or have ear plugs With that    Overall even with the noise I think this hotel is a good value for its location  Feel free to contact me with any questions   Happy TravelsLisaMpls 
P => Above average hotel in great location Having been to NY at least a dozen times before I have stayed in various locations in the city depending on what I was going there for  This time was for a quick  night to see a show with a friend so ided that we really didnt want to be more than a   minute walk to Times Sq  area  This hotel fit perfectlyAs others have mentioned the location is great    mins  to TS and theatre district but some  be a bit put off by the semi sketchy streetneighborhood where its located ie adult book store Port Authority bus station  But dont let that scare you It was perfectly fine and we as  woman traveling alone didnt feel threatened or awkward  Its NY after all   full of all kinds of characters but thats the charm The interior of the hotel was nice   simply furnished and functional with the MOST comfortable beds and pillows  Really Our room was located on the th floor and had a lovely view  The staff from Reception to Concierge to Room Service were all exceptionally nice Just a couple of other nice features in the room window that opens just a bit an Ipod docking station to play music bottled water and large flat screen tv I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again and would certainly suggest this hotel to others  
P => Small clean enough  Didnt like the neighborhood at all  From my hotel window I see the buses of the Port Authority Bus Terminal on th Avenue  Times Square isnt close but if I walk by five or six Adult DVD shops two massage parlors and a peep show booth I think Ill get eventually get there  
P => Worth considering if you can get it cheap The Four Points Times Square is in a great location if you want to stay in midtown the rooms are well appointed and the staff are friendly  You get a cool flatscreen tv on the wall the beds are super comfortable and theres a small gym in the basement  They deserve respect for offering free wifi and free bottled water On the down side   and its hard to quantify exactly why   I was put in mind of the quotLinton Travel Tavernquot during my stay    I just found it a bit depressing  Big caveat to the following comments is that they probably apply to many Manhattan hotels The rooms are quite small the building is wedged in pretty tight to those around so you look out your window and find yourself staring someone in the face whos doing the photocopying in the office opposite small corridors cheap products in the bathroom smell of stale cigarettes in corridors and liftselevators etc As others have observed the beds are very comfortable although I was bitten all over my right arm during one night so it appears that there were a few quothouse guestsquot in the room   Overall its fine and if you get a good deal then it would serve you well for a stopover or short stay especially if you dont expect any nice surprises or cleverly thought out design details  
P => I love the Sheraton Hotels The hotel was recently remodeled I believe  The room was small but had all the amenities needed  The Sheraton beds are the best The staff was quite helpful amp friendly  The food in the restaurant was also wonderful  The one negative is that the shower head is placed too high  Standing on my tipee toes I still had difficulty moving it  I am quot  
P => Got a great deal The hotel front staff werent very friendly but for the price and location it was a great place to stay  The room was cleaned and very comfortable  I would stay there again and would reccomend to friends  
P => Friendly staff Good location close to Bus terminal with buses from Newark airport for only   roundtrip nice rooms with excellent beds friendly staff  We stayed here  adults and  child in  rooms  Loved it The only thing is the pornstores on the way to the hotel but it was ok anywaynot much action going on around them anyway  
P => Efficient and comfortable in good location I spent my st and last night at this hotel in NYC  I found it to be clean and serviceoriented  The rooms were nice typical size for NYC functional with nice work area withfree WIFi and coffee and tea maker in room  Lovely soft bathrobe with slippers  I was able to fit my lap top into the in room safe which was great  I stayed in a King room and also in a  bedroom suite which was very nice  
P => Great value totally safe area We booked with the re opening deal of  per night  That in itself made the stay great but we were plesantly surprised with the size of the room and the great view  We could see Times Square from our room  Our room was very clean and the beds were great I see some reviews mention the adult stores on the streets  Yes they were there however I never once felt unsafe  I loved the fact that Times Square was a block away  The Port Authority Bus Terminal was across the street which was kind of handy because there were lots of affordable resturants and shops  Not a bad deal  This hotels grand re opening deal allowed my family to extend our vacation and I will stay here again 
P => Fatal Errors For all of the good things one can say about this relatively new hotel eg incredibly comfortable beds st design for such small rooms friendly staff there are a couple of major problems that make it impossible to stay here again First is the air conditioning  As previous reviewers have noted when the cool or hot air kicked in the sound was so loud that I was awakened every   minutes during the night  There is NO option to keep the fan on when the cool or warm air is also desired which would at least keep the noise at a constant level  How could a new hotel adopt such an antiquated system And why does using the TV remote turn the ac offSecond is the in room internet  Yes it is free but in this case you get what you pay for  The wired option is so slow that doing any work was all but impossible staff advised that too many people are on the system and suggested that I go down to the business center to work  The connection was non existent for the wireless option  I stayed for  nights and not once was the connection quotnormalquot much less high speed as advertised I leave this hotel both tired and frustrated  
P => clean reasonable convenient but nothing exceptional  Stayed for just the lasy night of a  night trip with my partner  It was a very clean reasonably priced room that was really conveniently located  I didnt mind the somewhat grungy hood but felt the hotel could have been better formatted for its location including not having such a massive bed in such a time room and a more efficiently designed lobby to cater to the small size of the lobby and the large number of guests Still Id stay again if the price was right  
P => Clean Hotel Location is both Good and Bad I arrived at the hotel at  am after an overnight flight from Asia  Check in went smoothly and they got me into a room with a  minute wait which was great I am a Platinum member so not sure this was the reason why but was a very nice start of the trip  Other than this never talked to the staff of the hotel as I didnt need anything Rooms Perfect for NYC  Small but very functional  TV was a good size I would guess  or quot which is plenty big for a small room  Comfortable bed and everything was new  The only issue I would say is the in wall air conditioner which is very loud when needed  Luckily the weather was fairly cool during my stay so used the fan only mode mostly  But I think if I needed the AC all the time it would have been very annoying Location Great if you use public transportation  Almost every subway you need is right around the corner a half city block  You do need to walk in front of the NY Probation office but quite frankly its fine  I walked alone at all times of day and night and never felt an issue  Now if you walk away from the subway station to th Avenue thats a little more sketchy but only because they are doing a ton of construction work and you end up in these little tunnel walkways  The worst thing about this location is there are very few cabs that travel down th  I think it has something to do with the construction or the traffic patterns but taxis dont like this as a crosstown route  So if taking a lot of taxis are in the cards keep this in mind  I used a car service to get to the airport because I wasnt confident that I could get a taxi at am when I had to leave I had a ton of luggage and didnt feel like walking  block at  in the morning The hotel offered free internet service but it was very slow  I guess you get what you pay for 
P => GREAT HOTEL lovely clean hotel in an excellent location port authority is right across the street as is a  storechemest theres a lovely cafe in the port authority for breakfast as the food in the hotel is pricey  the rooms are small enough but perfect if you were just showering and sleeping there as we did the t v in the room was great even if the remote kept switching on the very noisy air con the bed was the most comfortable ever but the pillows were way too soft with no support and they didnt offer an alternative for people who need support from their pillow  the bar in the hotel isnt really a bar its a small alcove to the side of the reception area with approx   tables  We had asked for a room with just a shower amp no tub but they gave us one with a tub I made a  minute phonecall to ireland and it cost   yes thats NINTY THREE DOLLARS  some reviews say the area was a bit dodgy but i dont agree o k there are a few xxx shops but the windows are covered and no one hangs around outside and there cops everywhere in n y so we felt pretty safe  upon checkout there was an issue with the amount we had already prepaid and the manager did very little to resolve the situation infact she point blank lied to our faces which really let down such a nice hotel but i would definatly stay here again and again  
P => Incredible bang for your buck in a super central albeit seedy for the suburban traveler location Sumy For the introductory rate of  that I paid the value was beyond expectations for such a central location in Manhattan  The hotel is less than three months old which makes it one of the newer and cleaner hotels in NYC Rooms The brand new rooms were a reasonable size for two adults and immaculately clean especially the all white bathrooms which seemed to sparkle when the lights were on  The bed was top notch and the desk was actually designed for life in this century       meaning the TV was mounted on the wall and there were more power outlets built into the desk than I had plugs for  The desk even had built in USB connectionsLocation The location is flawless if you are a leisurely tourist right next to Times Sq and abundant subway lines and cabs though some of the adult shops and grungy street characters on the block  turn off suburban visitors who havent experienced much of NYC  Overall a great base to for your sightseeing or nightlife excursions Service For a select service hotel not bad at all  I called down for extra Seattles Best coffee yum bottled water free and toothpaste on arate occasions and they were all brought up within ten minutes or so  The housekeepers were friendly and did a great job making the room comfortable after returning from a long day of walking  While some of the staff seemed new what do you expect Its a brand new hotelCleanliness Like I said brand new hotel  It doesnt get any cleaner than this in NYC  I just hope a year from now the cleanliness doesnt start to slide Value After reading the above sections on my experience what would you say the value was for a  rate   I know it was an intro rate but the experience I had was worth well more than        be in the upper s Id say or lower s during peak dates Other comments The lobby area was a bit crammed  There is a circular seating area which takes up half of the lobby space and creates an obstructing wall in the lobby  At times it got claustrophobic with all the tourists and their luggage but the reception desk agents did a good job greeting guests and checking them in efficiently  
P => Great Hotel We went during the promotion pricing and we were really amazed at this hotel  Yeah like a few people said    its about   blocks into the ghetto area which half of NYC is  But its really about  blocks away from Times Square  Point being is that its close to the subway food shopping and amazing entertainment  The hotel was nice staff was friendly location is great I definately recommend this hotel and will be using this again in a few months  The internet was a little slow at times but get real    if you are going to NYC you arent going to sit in a hotel room much  Use this hotel 
P => Nice but would not stay again The hotel is very clean and new  The hotel is on a street across from the bus terminal  We felt safe walking to and from the hotel until we were leaving for the airport  We had to leave for the airport at  am  When we went downstairs we asked the man at the front desk about getting a taxi and he said we would have to walk to the corner and go in front of the bus terminal  We had to walk with our luggage there  It is a short walk but at that time of night it seemed like alot of shady people were hanging out in front of the bus station and we felt very uncomforatble and not safe  The hotel is on a one way alley and there are no taxis riding down it unless they are dropping someone off at the hotel Unfortunately because of the taxi issue I will not stay again  
P => Great value for promo price in Midtown Exceptional bedding and very comfortable new beds internet and business centerw printer for boarding passes a plus  Small rooms typical in size for NYCno view  Broken coffee maker replaced upon request  Free bottled wateris one bottle per day for a room accommodating up to  people  Dirtystreet adult toy store scaffolding acceptable tradeoff for proximityto Times Sq and Broadway  Lines to check in  Tiny congested lobby butclean and new  Friendly staff  Initially told reserved room w two double bedswas not available and that I would have to either share a bed with mygrown son or opt to have one sleep on a chaise  I pushed the issue and got the roomreserved well in advance and guaranteed with a deposit First night maid service didnt happen until pm  We were told theywere running a bit behind  This wasnt a horrible thing and late checkout privileges more than compensated since ability to shower middaybefore heading out during brutal ust heat wave was pricelessFloors tiny elevators slow everyone required to travel to thebasement for ice machine Not worth current pricing of  per night given immediate competitionin the area with better aesthetics  Would return in a heartbeat for thepromo rate  
P => Good hotel  Would certainly stay again  I stayed here for two nights last week with my  year old son  We too booked at the Travelzoo rate of   I am sorry we didnt stay longer  The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable The staff was friendly and most went out of their way to help us  There are adult bookDVD stores on the block but the windows are covered and the only thing you see is the words quotAdult DVDs      The Port Authority Bus Terminal so close was good  There are many places to eat there for reasonable prices and since they are open  there are always people around including police officers  I am a single mom my son and I walked back to the hotel after  each evening and never felt unsafe  I would have felt unsafe in an area where there are fewer people around on the street  I would certainly stay here again if it were a good rate  If I were going to pay  a night I would probably stay in a larger hotel with more amenities  
P => convenient and safe As others have noted the hotel is next to the port authority bus terminal and  short blocks to times square and within walking distance of grand central fifth avenue central park south all broadway theaters etc  Really a great location  The street is unattractive but quite safe  The hotel is brand new so the furnishings and bathroom were nice and the beds  doubles for us were very comfortable  However the air conditioner sounded like a jet taking off every time the condenser came on  It was ridiculously loud how can this be with brand new equipment and woke me more than once during the night  This is really something they need to address  I ahve not had such loud air conditioning in any of the  or so other hotels I have stayed in around New YorkCity including the Times Square area including very comparable hotels to this such as Hilton Garden Inn or Doubletree  
P => Good choice and location  Free internet Like the other recents reviews I found this place via Travelzoo  USD  night and you just cant complain regarding those prices for a new hotel  Im not going to repeat the same things mentioned so Ill just mention good value eatsMiddle Eastern street vendors   sells styrophome container of lamb or chicken and rice for only   Popeyes Chicken on th btw th amp th Ave   nuggets are   and  piece chicken meal is   
P => Neither Great nor Terrible A great deal on Travelzoo led us to this new hotel  We would agree with some of the things we had read on TripAdvisor before staying there and disagree with others First the hotel isnt on the best street in NYC  There is a huge bus terminal NY Port Authority across the street and a few places on the street I wouldnt want to take children to see as some have said  But we never felt unsafe  In fact NYC felt very safe throughout police officers were everywhere including one or two on the corner of th St  and th Ave  near the hotel almost everytime we walked by  On the other side th Ave  had many good restaurants  We also found advantages to being close to the Port Authority  Inside are good places for breakfast and coffee below is a subway station and outside were taxis all the time  In other words we were able to get a good coffee and pastry in the morning and then travel to anywhere in the city we wanted  We also liked the fact that we could easily walk to the theatre district  We saw two major plays on th St  just five to ten minutes away Second the service was hit and miss  A few employees were very helpful and a few didnt seem too responsive to requests  One thing that especially bothered us was when we wanted our sheets changed the first night because of strange hairs in the bed they only changed the top sheet  This happened twice  We finally got the sheets and changed the thing ourselves  Besides that the bed was very very comfortable  I must also give the hotel credit for storing our baggage for free on the day we checked out  This allowed us to see more of the city before our night flight  Finally the hotel was nice and new but the room was small the bed took up most of the space Overall we were happy with the low price we paid to stay in Manhattan the value for the money but we wouldnt have been happy if we had paid much more  
P => Courteous Staff well appointed room parole division one door down Clean and courteous on th and th  Points Sheraton Times Square is a few blocks down from Times Square  Rooms are clean and nicely furnished  Be careful of a few things It is directly across from Port Authority  a multi story bus station and one door down from the NY Division of Parole  Police are present in the area and it is overall safe  The guest can be noisy in the hall which can be heard in the room  I was awoken several times  AC is noisy but necessary in the summer and can interrupt light sleepers  There are only  elevators all going to the top floors  At times I had to wait quite a while to get a lift  There are computers available for use but the internet is slow  I got a great rate but did need to be flexible  
P => Great Hotel The neighborhood is safe  i wouldnt have any problems walking outside at AM  Sure theres a shelter across the street and a parole office next door  I wouldnt stand in front of the hotel taking pictures  But half a block away is the New York that most people would recognize  If you can get past the grittiness outside the door youll find a gem of a hotel to stay in  Almost new as of this writing  Super comfortable beds  Great showers and bathrooms  Slightly smaller rooms typical of New York  For the price about  this is a great place to stay  
P => If you get a good deal this is a steal Stayed at the hotel in ust  for  nights  Traveled with my spouse  year old dhter and  year old son  I was very concerned about the location especially with some of the reviews I read regarding the hotels location since you must pass a couple of adult bookstores and a parole department  However the location was fine  There were no scary people loitering about I hardly noticed the parole department  There was a cop usually on the corner of the street which is not unusual since there are all over the times square area  We just walked quickly to the hotel and even if we hadnt I dont think it would have been scary at all  No one bothered us at all  I dont think this is an issue at all and would not be concerned about recommending the hotel  Now regarding the hotel itself the beds were the most comfortable I have every slept in  The rooms were clean and I felt like for New York the rooms were a good size  We werent tripping over lugagge  The only thing I felt misled on was the fact that the hotel says they give free bottled water  In actuality they only provide ONE small  oz  bottle per day  I didnt expect them to provide a bottle each day for the four of us in the room but one bottle seemed stingy and misleading from what they advertise  I think two bottles a day would make a better impression  If two people stayed in the room for example couldnt they cough up enough water for at least the two of them to have their own bottle If they dont want to do this they shouldnt advertise that the room comes with free bottled water  It seems like a deliberate ploy  Overall if you get a good price I would recommend this hotel  TIP If you buy tickets from the TKTS booth count the money in your hand BEFORE you give it to the person behind the counter  The TKTS clerk stole money from me because I was counting it out as I slid it through the window  MISTAKE Dont take your eyes off them for a moment when you hand them money  
P => Poor Location I stayed at this hotel for the weekend with my family  I had arrived in the city with my child early as I wanted to check in early and go too chinatown  Before I arrived at the hotel I got lost thanks to my google maps which was on my cell phone  I rang the hotel to get directions and Nicholle who i spoke too had no clue in giving me the right location of the hotel  The street that the hotel is on is horrible there is men working and awful rated R dvd stores  But when you take a right out of the hotel at the end of the street you have the subway the New York Times Building a very clean and large drug store across the road  And also you have the bus station near as well  Its a very short walk too Times Square which is great  If you want too go to Central Park we took the sub which is quick but dirty  We also went too the Bronz Zoo which was great   Overall I  stay here again as I know the location  And my husband loved the bed the bathroom was small the toileties were great you get a bottle of water in your room free intnet downstairs   Coffee maker also in the room and great bedroom slippers  The only issue that my husband also didnt like you have to go to the basment to get the ice  Also the he thought the bar tender who was on a Friday night who was female was rude and didnt serve him she said she was not serving any more drinks but yet she was still serving the two gentlemens at the bar  Nicholle who checked me in who was not that great not very knowable and I did sign up to be a starwards perferred guest she did not explained the program at all  But we did have a great time in the city I love New York  
P => A steal for the location This was my fourth visit to NYC and my husbands first  I have only stayed on the Upper West Side before and took the chance with the Times Square locale with the fantastic deal they were offering night     check the hotels actual website  Although this area is definitely more quotgrittyquot than the Upper West Side the Times Square subway station gives you access to many lines that go all over the city  The room was very well appointed and I never slept in a more comfortable bed   no kidding  There is a close subway station and a pharmacygrocery right on the corner down the street to purchase snacksmaps etc  The bus terminal was also right there and we saw a few homeless types but the patrolmen politely asked them to move on which they did  The terminal by the way has a ton of low cost restaurants and snack shops also  Its also good to know a portion of Times Square is closed off on Sat  nights so pedestrians can fully take in the magnificence of it all  If you want to be close to Times Square and Broadway this is a fantastic deal you shouldnt miss  
P => good access to subway and times square brand new hotel location so so also got the grand opening special of  dollars with taxes just off times square   only had problems once with riff raffbrand spanking newonly  rooms per floormy room looked greatbigger than i thought i would get for new yorkreally not much smaller than a hilton i stayed in in New jerseydesk with hookupcable for laptop  dont even need to use the Wi figreat value but if i had more money id stay away from Times Square i think    i think id like more downtown th street has access to the Times square subway   like there is a subway entrance half a block from the hotel        A C E lines on the other side of th st is the bus terminalthere was also  computers for public use   had a working printer so i could print my boarding passsmall fitness centre  didnt use it   didnt see anyone in itstaff room made up nicelythe front desk staff have google       when they dont know they can look it upi thought they tried hard when i had a concern 
P => Mixed feelings I have stayed in NYC a few times in different places  As others have said the location is great as you are only a few blocks from times square  However I have to agree that the walk to th St  is a little shady but its short   and not so scary that we would avoid walking there at night  We were two women alone and only once did we feel a little nervous  There were often police at the corner of st and th right down the street  The hotel bed is very comfortable and size of the room is fine   I have stayed in bigger and smaller  The overall service though is lacking  Housekeeping forgot to restock things for us daily and Room service also failed to show up on one occasion and forgot things on another  When we asked the front desk a question or two about getting back to the airport they were less than helpful  Another complaint would be the air conditioner  It was terrible It was very loud and very strong  Overall I would recommend the hotel due to the price of USnight along with the comfort of the bed  Another tip   eat lunch at Schnippers at st and th in the bottom of the New York Times building  Great food 
P => ent but not anxious to return This brand new hotel is located close to th Avenue with the Port Authority bus station across the street and a number of adult shops just up the block  There is ongoing construction on the corner which makes for noise whenever you leave the hotel plus you have to negotiate all the scaffolding  It is not a pretty block  However the proximity to the Hells Kitchen neighborhood is actually wonderful  Many great restaurants on th and th Avenues and you can walk to the Hudson where you can rent bicycles walk along the riverfront or visit the Intrepid battleship museum in just a few minutes The hotel itself is nice enough  Rooms are clean and comfortable  Staff though arent of the quotgo the extra milequot breed  To be fair the lobby is tiny and it must be tough to manage guests in such a small space In conclusion it is a ent place to stay  We got a promotional rate and used points for a four night stay so we got a very good value  But if we werent using points I imagine wed use Priceline to stay somewhere better  
P => Unlike others no complaints After reading the reviews for this hotel I was skeptical but that was completely unwarranted  To those who have complained about the hotels location grow some thicker skin  The hotel is not in the greatest area but is by no means dangerous  Yes there were a couple of homeless people in the vicinity of the hotel but they did not approach myself or my friends nor did they attempt to talk to us  The area surrounding the hotel has some great little restaurants and bakeries a previous reviewer said to avoid th ave  but I completely disagree there are so many great spots thereAs for the hotel it was very clean Rooms were a good size for Manhattan and the bathroom was spotless  We were on a high floor so we had a nice view of the skyline  The staff was courteous at all times and a nice perk not mentioned is the fact that the hotel offers discounted parking  per  hours at a lot just up the block all you have to do is have someone at the front desk validate your parking ticket  The wifi worked well throughout our stay and the complimentary water was a nice touch  All in all great hotel in a great location close to Times Square but not directly in the hussle and bustle  Definitely worth the grand opening special of night  
P => GREAT HOTEL IF PRICE IS RIGHT Although the hotel is on the south side of the Port Authority Bus Terminalthe street is safe and hassle free  Taxis frequent this cut through street so it is not a problem getting one quickly Small clean new hotel with easy access in and out Polite friendly courteous staff who are all willing to help  Rooms are average size for a NYC hotel but being that the hotel is brand new made it more comfortable  Would recommend this hotel for singles or couples  Any price under  makes this hotel a bargain  
P => Good Value Great Location Four Points Sherton Hotels are usually a ent quality and good value  Thie was a brand new hotel so new it wasnt on the Super Shuttle Hotel List  So if you go soon make sure that you tell the company it is a new Four Points Hotel and the exact address so they dont get it mixed up with the other Four Points hotels in New York  We got a great rate on the room because of the Grand Opening special promotion  Only paid  plus tax per night  It couldnt be missed  But as people said the room is small I think it is only  sq feet  Get  queen beds in there and you dont have a lot of room to move  But if you are only sleeping there it is adequate  Our only complaint about the size is that when I was sitting at the desk there was no room for a person to pass between the bed and the back o fthe chair  Oh small closet too but adequate number of shelves and drawers for other storage  The location is great as far as proximity to Times Square  The subway entrance is a half block walk  Times square is at your feet  But you do pass a couple of Adult Book Stores and the Probation Office  There is always a police officer at the corner usualy day and night But I noticed quite a few police officers all over times Square on this visit to NYC  I would definitely recommend this hotel but if you have to pay more than  per night check out some of the other in the area to compare  I think the Hilton Garden Inn rooms are bigger for the same price  
P => Nice Stay We stayed at the Four Points for  nights in mid y  I saw some less than favorable reviews for the location and I was a little concerned  This is about  blocks from times square but not a quotbadquot area  I didnt feel unsafe at any time walking to or from the hotel  The rooms were nice and new  They were a little on the small side but we got a deal on the rate so I wouldnt complain  Overall we had a great stay  Never waited more than a couple of minutes for an elevator and all of the staff were very nice and helpful  Definitely convienant location since youre only about a block from the subway and the bus terminal  
P => Will be back Clean affordable  I stayed here for one night during a very warm week in y  The aircon shuts down if you are out of the room for a while motion sensors but since they are brand new it cools the room down very quickly  The shower and bathroom were spotless and laid out nicely  The complimentary internet and bottled water are nice amenities they also had an ipod docking radio which had ent sound  My king bed room on the th floor had a nice view of the Empire State building and city in general  It was very quiet and well orated  Elevators were slow during peak use times but never more than a  minute wait for me  The only ice  vending machines are in the basement which is slightly inconvenient  There was also a fitness center down there but I did not try it nor did I try room service or the lobby lounge I arrived at  and as others have stated no rooms were available and the small lobby was full of bags which looked a little shabby  Had lunch on th Ave and then came back around  and was given my room which was nice since check in is technically at  As for the area it is fine  not Park Avenue but certainly not dangerous in any way  It is close to multiple subway lines and cabs are plentiful  The airport express bus departs from the north side of PA bus terminal on nd a cheap way to get to nyc airports All in all it was a clean affordable hotel in a great location for a quick visit to New York no major complaints at all  
P => Nice hotel   but was not told of its exact location When I booked  rooms for my husband and myself and  boys I was told by an SPG reward operator several things  First and most important the hotel was located in Times Square across from the Westin  It is not The area  be considered Times Square but there is not much pedestrian traffic and what there is not reassuring  The hotel is actually beside the NYC bus terminal  The back of this building is the front view of the hotel  We had to walk our  boys down this dark street that looked like an alley with bars homeless and adult DVD stores  I did not FEEL SAFE walking on this street Also the hotel has no connecting rooms and only  double beds per floor  My husband and I split up so an adult was in each room with our kids The beds were nice and price was great    but I feel I was greatly misled by starwood  We definately got what we paid for  This is not a place I would EVER bring my kids back too  If you have kids please learn from our mistake and stay elsewhere   
P => A very good find in all aspects   highly recommended First of all I really liked the hotel  My room was new and quite spacious especially considering youre in New York City  The bed is the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Bed so basically you feel like youre sleeping on clouds  The hotel also features a restaurant but didnt try it  Hotel offers free high speed internet in the rooms and has a small but efficient fitness room Then the location I had no problem with it  Its on West th St between th and th Avenue tell the cab driver this since the hotel is so new he might not know it  Hotel is on the right hand side if you come down th Street  Seriously youre in New York City youre bound to see stuff you dont see in your home town  I dont agree with other reviewers that it was seedy or uncomfortable  They make it sound as if youre descending into hell which really isnt the case  I returned to my hotel after midnight and did not feel uncomfortable at all since the area is well lit  The hotel is right next to a Fairfield Inn by riott and Times Square is a  minute walk  Bus Terminal is right around the corner as is a Duane Reed drugstore and the subway is very close as well  Taxis arent difficult to find on th Avenue and it only took me  minutes to get to JFK by cab  dollars flat fee   dollars toll In all I can really recommend it  
P => Great Hotel   Unfortunate Location The hotel was great  I also received the amazing opening special rate of  so we ided to stay overnight in the city after watching the fire works  Our room was of a ent size for New York and the beds were fantastic  The or was very nice and the front desk check in was courteous and pleasant  I dont have one complaint about the hotel itself  I would not recommend this location for families and those not familiar with NY  In this city one block can make a big difference  And at this location right next to the bus terminal it does  There is a homeless mission and a more populated area of people who  make some uncomfortable  I would not have felt comfortable with just a girlfriend or my dhter  We saw a homeless man rip a flag out of a woman s hair and almost pull out her hair  I m used to seeing homeless people in the city  What I am not used to is seeing them laying across the sidewalk apparently not breathing and a cop basically just walking over him  These were just  of the many sites a block over from the hotel  Stick with th Ave if you can  If you are a couple used to NY or a bunch of guys   no problem what so ever  And from what I ve been told they are trying to revitalize the Hell s Kitchen area so it could get better in the future  
P => Great price nice new room I stayed a night on   When I tried to check in the small lobby was filled with bags and there was barely any room to stand  I proceeded to the SPG line and was told that no rooms were ready this was  p m   Not a big deal since checkin wasnt until later  The woman at the front desk wasnt too friendly and seemed overwhelmed by all of the baggage in the lobby  I asked the front desk attendant to hold our bags and we came back around  p m  and were able to check in  My room was on the th floor the SPG floor and had a view of the roof of Port Authority  The room was clean new and had a very comfy bed  The curtains didnt close properly so we woke up very early the next morning due to all of the sunlight  The rooms have an iHome iPod dockclock radio but it didnt work The elevators were dirty and made the worst creeking noises  We didnt have time to check out the gym  When I asked about upgrades I was told that the suites were still under construction As others have mentioned this hotel isnt on the nicest block in the city  While its not unsafe it is unsavory with adult DVD stores and homeless people flanking the entrance I would stay here again as the hotel was affordable convenient and clean  
P => Nice Hotel     With Some Flaws Just stayed here for four days with some friends  The hotel is nice and the rooms are pretty spacious for New York City travel  The only problem I had was what other reviewers said   it is down a sketchy side street with a lot of adult stores so we four girls did not feel safe walking at night or the day in that area being hooted and hollered at  However the hotel staff were very friendly in checking us in early and allowing us to leave our bags there until our room was ready  Granted the view was of the Port Authority station the view was great from where we were The lobby is a bit small and the bar area wasnt ready yet but since it was only opened three weeks ago its okay  They were friendly about giving us extra towels and coffee and even had razors for us since we didnt bring them on our flight It is very close to Times Square and there are no worries about getting around NYC since you are near the Subway station  The staff is willing to help you get to your destination  GREAT Cheap pizza place right around the corner    pieces of pizza and pop for       and it was good pizza Other than that no food IMMEDIATELY next to the hotel  Beds were soft nice tv Our iHome ipod station didnt work which was disappointing  Note there is a full size blow dryer so dont bring one Wireless was great although slow but cant complain for free internet There are only eight rooms per floor so as soon as you step off the elevator     BOOM your room is right there  But it was fairly quiet so we cant complain on that perspective  For four girls and the low cost per night we couldnt complain too much It was a problem getting a taxi since it is a size street so you had to walk to th Street which was somewhat annoying but dealable since there is a taxi stand right off of this street  
P => What the heck were they thinking You approach the hotel along a narrow one way street with no available legal parking  Opposite the property sits the eyesore that is the Port Authority Bus Terminal while most of the rest of the hotels side of the block is occupied by adult video stores and peepshows  I didnt feel unsafe walking to or from the hotel even relatively late into the evening just be aware that it isnt a park That said the hotel itself is solid  The tiny rooms are well appointed with great beds  There were three of us in a double room and you literally have to get on a bed to let someone walk past you  They are indeed that small  One ice machine serves the entire property so no matter what floor you are on you have to elevator to the basement for ice In the room itself as I said the beds are GREAT  Roller shades can either obscure the view or provide very acceptable blackout for sleeping in  The internet is available via wireless or wired  It is painfully slow but workable and free  In an indication that hotels finally are beginning to understand that we have things we need to plug in there are available outlets everywhereDining is available downstairs but at   for the average breakfast do yourself a favor and walk one block east and stop in at the Teleon Cafe  Breakfast and dinner is cooked fresh and fast at a reasonable price Sumy At around  for a new property this close to Times Square jump on it  Just go in aware of the potential shortcomings  
P => Good Deal in NYC This hotel is brand new less than a month old and located on the corner of th Ave and th Street in Manhattan  Overall the block where the hotel is located is fairly dingy but the hotels location right in Midtown near all major subway lines makes it very convenient to all areas of Manhattan  Service was very friendly and as a new property the rooms were spotless and nicely orated  The room was tiny but fairly standard for New York  Be aware that rooms in the back of the hotel face an alley and have no views of any kind  Despite that bedding was excellent and the free internet was a plus  For under  this hotel is a solid deal and perfect for a quick trip into the city  
P => Brand New Great Value Would Stay Again I stayed here from e     and was pleasantly surprised at check in when I learned that the hotel had just opened a few days prior and I was the first person to stay in the room  I got a rate of about night which I think is pretty good given the proximity to times square the fact that you free get high speed internet bottled water and a great little room  The staff were all excellent the room nicely appointed but standard NYC small and the gym was wonderful as well  The hotel is in a bit of a quottransitionalquot area meaning that there are some adult DVD shops a few hundred feet up the street but you are also right there by the NY Times building and th ave  I will definitely be back to this modern affordable boutique style hotel  
P => Sub Standard f r ein Sheraton hotel

P => Heavenly Possibly one of my favorite hotels I have ever stayed in  I cannot rave enough about the service location rooms or the physical building itself designed by a world famous architect  I would recommend this hotel to anyone in a heartbeat    anyone with the wallet fat enough    
P => Too much  attitude  better nyc hotel choices I feel compelled to write because this is the first time my husband and I have stayed at The Fours Seasons Hotel in NYC and we found it to be less than what we expected  Our complaints are minor but when you stay in one of the quotbestquot you expect that level of service  We had stayed at The Four Seasons in Boston over the summer and found it to be magnificent unfortunatley we did not find that in NYC  Here is our list of quotproblemsquot  We ordered breakfast on Friday A M  that came with a piece of hair on the cream cheese and hair on the table cloth Saturday morning breakfast arrived  minutes later than the time we were told it would arrive  We wanted to dine at Nobu and the concierge told us that he could not get us a table until after PM  My husband called Nobu from his phone and we received a  PM dinner reservation  On Saturday we asked to speak with a manager to relay some of our unpleasant experiences  We prefaced our conversation that we thought the hotel should know the less than stellar moments of our stay but we did not expect anything from the hotel except to know that we were quotheardquot  The manager said he would have someone follow up with us the next day  No one ever did  If you are someone heading to NYC stay at the St  Regis on th and Fifth Avenue  There you will find excellent service stunning rooms and suites incredible food perfect bell staff accomodating concierge staff agreeable front desk and perfect housekeeping  We have always stayed at the St  Regis and we will never venture from there again  The St  Regis lacks the quotstuffy attitudequot and offers incredible service where they will always appreciate your business and remember your name  Sometimes you really do need to venture away to truly appreciate what you have  On a side note if you want incredible cupcakes go to CRUMBS on rd and Madison  Our sons favorite is quotsmoresquot we love the quotcookie doughquot  
P => What a location from which to explore New York Our eldest has just started college in New York so we took the little ones out to see where she would be living and also a chance for them to see New York They saw all the usual attractions including the Beast Speed boat   crazyWe stayed in the Four Seasons and it was a lovely hotel   very friendly   great location   good sized roomsThey recommended some great little restaurants for us to eat in and a great dinner for the kids to experience a full on American breakfast  
P => Lovely but Ouch The room is without a doubt lovely the bathroom is possibly the best in any hotel Ive every stayed  The staff were friendly enough a bit stuck up in the bar  We paid  a night just for the room  Im thinking that overall its a tad pretentious  
P => Good but not great This is my tenth FS property and my least favorite  I could not understand how any FS hotel could rate so low on TA but one stay here and you  know why it is middle ranked  For the price the service should be flawless and for the most part the staff held true to this  The spa staff concierge desk and housekeeping department were top notch  The front desk also did a fantastic job  However the doormen and bellmen failed miserably on nearly every arrivaldeparture from the hotel  I think living in NYC requires grit attitude and a gimic and the FS staff can give you plenty of that  be I am a naive over friendly optimistic country mouse but it sure would be nice to at least get a greeting from the staff when youre paying  a night The one shocker is that the spa is located seven floors underground  A sinking thought to be in the bowels of NYC  Ask for the fire escape plan on arrival and try to settle into a relaxing massage with this on your pragmatic mind Not worth the asking price  Get half the price and twice the service at The New York Palace  
P => The Best in the City Ive never been disappointed by a stay at this hotel  The staff is always perfect  The service is typical Four Seasons always there when you need them with no flaws  The bathroom is huge with one of the fastest filling tubs Ive ever seen in a hotel  The walk in closetdressing area is HUGE  Lights are on dimmers in every room  The curtains and shades are powered  The views of Central Park and the city were perfect  The front desk staff and concierge addressed me by name every time I passed the desks and always with a smile  The elevators are incredibly fast  The hotel location could not have been better  The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on  
P => PERFECT   just how it should be We are just back from a  night vacation at the Four Seasons in Manhattan  We considered many places Mandarin Oriental The Peninsula The NY Palace as the rates advertised were substantially lower than the FS but we are just glad we finally stayed there  Business being what it is in the US currently and the low season starting in NYC all hotels did big rebates  This is not FS policy  They do packages instead which bring the tab from obscenely expensive to something more affordable  Taking advantage of the quotStay Longerquot package stay  nights pay only   one week end rate a Premium Deluxe room set us back  nightly plus taxes CHECK IN was extremely prompt and smooth  Our request to get the highest available floor with the best possible view was well taken into account within the category booked  Room  was on the th floor and boasted a roaring view of Central Park  We were glad we did not book a Tower Parkview Room which would have cost  extra per night  Our luggage was brought up after a couple of minutes  Great bellman who welcomed me quotbackquot and did a perfetc tour of the room The ROOM was extremely large especially by NYC standards  Typically Four Seasons meaning that you do not really recongnize the city where you are by just looking to the room  I stayed there  years ago and the room has not aged  It has been updated with flat screens TVs in the room and bathroom huge channel selection  Spotlessly clean with plenty of storage and a great dressing area  The highlight of the bathroom is the fast filling tub which truly fill up in under a minute  Eventhough I know it and had used it previously it cht me off guard  View was awesome  Central Park to the north west only interrupted by The Pierre hotel and city views to the north east SERVICE is perfect  They take all expectations into account and go over the top to please you  I called reception with a standing request of  bath towels at any given time and ample toiletry supply  I could have started a towel and toiletry shop at the end of the stay  They noticed I had put on the floor a third bath rug  They replaced the  small one by a single larger version  Evening turndown would blankly respect the privacy sign and slip a note under the door instead  They did came up at any notice Our request of a later check out time was graciously met  they offered a  pm co at no charge which was less than we needed but more than we expected  They stored our luggage and we enjoyed the Spa facilities for a shower before heading to JFK at no charge Doormen open the doors for you  they never miss to spot you on your way in or out and greet you with a smile and kind word  Well in many NYC high end hotels they keep themselves busy counting their tips instead Overall AMBIANCE is that of a very high end hotel  Stepping in the spectacular lobby all ble and high ceilings is a welcome relief of the noise hustle and bustle of the city  It mostly caters to corporate people and the crowd behaves does not shout out and is very well groomed  Even if we were flip flop types which we are not we would not feel comfortable walking around in a too relaxed outfit FOOD  we tried breakfast once  quotquot was fully booked so they redirected us to quotTYquot across the lobby  Spectacular settings great service corparate crowd quotstrategizingquot and quotneeding to restrategizequot  I was not overly impressed by the food selection  We went for the Park Avenue menu  At  pp it featured coffee and juice  pieces of toast a coupleof eggs any style and  strips of bacon  I acknowledge it is the right rate for a FS  quality was very good  but it did not deliver the right quantity  it was on the scarce side for us especially before a day out walking the city We had all other breakfasts at Normas   The Parker Meridien a short  minute walk west on th street  For a similar price we had unexpected menu selection outstanding quality and quantity in a somewhat noisier and stepped down dining room We enjoyed the bar  Good drink selection  We did not love the settings  too many armchairs around tables too few settees aroung coffee tables  Highly but rightly priced for that kind of place   Coke and cocktails OVERALL we loved the place  We were sad to leave and would go back any time  Could it improve  Hardly  Well perhaps at these rates some fresh flowers in the room and a bottle of water at evening turndown which they do at other locations would not hurt  And would not go them bankrupt  
P => Four Seasons New York   Worth it  I recently stayed at the Four Seasons in NYC and I really enjoyed it Really good location that brings you close to everything you need in New York For a excellent dining experience you can also try TAO right next to the hotel Highly recommended  
P => elegant and worth every dime was out here for a three day business trip  Took my wife along and ended uo staying three more days after the business convention was done  Took her shopping had a blastHighly recommend the benz and bed package Newyork can be very crowded but overrall we had a great time romancing eachother for the reminder of the days  Fine cuisine excellent staff  
P => big rooms good food good location   not so great for kids I took my dhter to NYC for shopping  She is a toddler and I researched hotels looking a family friendly one This does claim to be family friendly All was fantanstic   except room service was not great  often they forgot small items for a quotchild menu orderquot such a spoon she could actually fit in her mouth no sippy cups and the breakfast area in the morning while lovely is filled with priily business professional  We were a real stand out The crib in the room was large they did provide a nice kid set of shampoo baby wash  the diaper genie provided was dirty   yuckOverall I would stay there again  but be try a different hotel for my family experience 
P => Great Room Awesome View Good Service My husband and I stayed here for  nights in uary  We are in our late twenties  This was our first experience staying at a Four Seasons Property  We will be visiting the one in Bora Bora in    The front desk was professional and friendly  The bell boy gave us a thorough run through of the hotel and our room  We were on the th floor and had a great view of Central Park  There was a nice bottle of Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room when we arrived We didnt order room service or use the spa  We were out and about in the city most of the time  The room was clean and very functional  We needed an iron and it was brought promptly and so was the replacement hair dryer we requested We loved the bathroom and the tub that filled up in  seconds  In only  days my husband took  baths Imagine thatOverall we had a great stay and the Four Seasons not sure if we would return since there are so many other great hotels in NYC in other neighborhoods that we would love to experience  
P => Typical Wonderful Four Seasons We stayed at the Four Season New York for three days prior to our trip to Anguilla and then for another day on the way back  The hotel is typical Four Seasons     impeccable service great bar and food and wonderful rooms  The concierge service is among the best we ever utilized at any Four Seasons  They got us into the best restaurants on very short notice easily arranged for limo service and even handle getting a prescription filled  Emmanuel should get a raiseThe bar was terrific and made for great people watching  Plus the tinis were sensational  The workout room and spa more than satisfied our needs The rooms were as good as ever and the views from our th floor were unmatched  Chris the bellman couldnt have done more for us  A special thanks to Liz for all her help in getting our reservations taken care of  I dont think I would ever consider any hotel but the Four Seasons on subsequent trips to New York  
P => Great Hotel   some issues I have stayed in New York many times and this hotel is by far the best The room was amazing with lots of space and light pouring in from all directions  I could have lived in the bathroom it was so big And with a flat screen TV on the counter I soak in the tub and watched the news every morning The lobby is grand and impressive and I loved the lights that focused right on the concierge desk  The bellman gave us a great suggestion to go to Carniege Deli for lunch one day  WOW We brought him back half our sandwhich Now the negitives   The front desk was so cold they felt like you could not approach them  I dont know if they were too professional or if that was the New York attitude shining through  The bartenders were also very straightfoward no chit  chat just make the drink and move on  And if you are paying  for a tini you expect a little smile at least  Other than the cold welcome from these particular areas the hotel was great  
P => Fabulous Stay Our stay at the FS   NY was absolute perfection  Liz the executive assistant to the regional VP of FS came out to greet my husband and I as we checked in   we were personally escorted to our suite   which overlooks central park and many high rise buildings  I shopped at Chanel Dior and Jacob amp Co   and to my delight everyone was aware I was coming in to shop and I was greeted at Chanel with champagne and Dior with all the handbags I was looking for awaiting me    My hubby and I came back to the FS in the evening and since it was his bday they had his favorite cake and fruit awaiting us    The next morning   It was a late night since it was NYE and the guest manager called asking us if we would like a late checkout which was very much needed after a late night out The service is spectacular and the rooms are immaculate and cozy especially for NYC  This hotel is def much better and more service oriented than the Beverly Wilshire  We will def be staying here again 
P => One of the Best Hotels in New York The Four Seasons in New York lives up to the FS standards  We arrived from LaGuardia via limo and were greeted by name with smiling faces to a place that we had never stayed before  We were early therefore naturally our room wasnt ready so they offered us a complimentary drink in The Bar which five minutes into they told us our room was ready  We ided first to adjorn to LAtelier de Joel Robouchon hotels signature restaurant for lunch before going up to our room  The room actually suite was spectacular  On a very high floor with views of the city and Central Park  The bathroom was one of the nicest I have ever seen  The Spa was just as gorgeous as the rest of the hotel at five floors below ground though it is a tad scary going down to it  My masseuse was great and the massage really relaxed me  is another good restaurant in which we had Brunch on Sunday and breakfast once  The hotel has an excellant location across the street from Turnbull and Asser on  btw  Madison and Park You are so close to all the good restaurants and shoppingI would definatly go back in the future 
P => So disappointing We have been all over the world and have stayed at many Four Seasons  The New York Four Seasons is just not even in the same league as its fellow FS hotels  You expect absolute cleanliness at a minimum at a FS property  Not the case in NY  The carpet in the hallways is dated stained sewn in places on the th floor where we stayed  The air was stale and filled with that old smoke filled hotel room smell  Our room needed a thorough dusting  Lets be frank if youve got the money to stay at a FS your home probably has flat screens big bathrooms and nice furniture and lighting  Why leave home for leisure time if you dont get a more superlative experience with personal attention perfect cleanliness and a bit of pampering If youre looking for that kind of experience at a Four Season property go to their Jackson Hole or Vancouver spots  Well stay at the Peninsula or the Ritz Carlton the next time     Probably the Peninsula as they have pool and new spa opening in a couple of weeks  How sad         
P => Completes the Four Seasons chain I booked through the hotels website  Simple and easy  From leaving the limo out front you have someone to take your bags and another to open the doors  The Four Seasons always has perfect service The lobby is beautiful and has a ble look feel  It reminds me of a calm cozy coffee shop but hotel style  Check in was simple and we went straight up to our rooms There is no pool though which was kind of a disappointment  But the spa was very lavish and the staff was extremely friendly  Ive stayed at many Four Seasons before and this is definately in my top   My other favorites include Las Vegas quiet sanctuary in crazy city Miami relaxing atmosphere by ocean Bora Bora cultural journey and Beverley wilshire classic stay  NY just completed the pack with sophisticated and warming 
P => Classic perfection in modern setting first rate amid the hustle and bustle of NYC thoughtful umbrellas for all guests to take when it rains great Restaurant Rooms picture perfect  
P => Pure Perfection Let me start off by saying that my expectations were surpassed in my  night stay  It was my Birthday weekend and I was greeted with a wonderful cake and a bottle of champagne in my room  The room itself was immaculately maintained spacious quiet and clean  Yevgeniy the bellman assisted me with my luggage he did a wonderful job going over everything in the room  He was very kind and efficient  The hotels restaurant was nice amazing food and has one of a kind chef Nick whos just a star He truly knows how to wow people it was the level of service friendliness and professionalism that did it all  My friends and I were treated like royalty  All in all the service was impeccable and genuine a perfect balance between formality and familiarity  Thanks for everything 
P => Fabulous Weekend in NYC My husband and I just celebrated our anniversary with a weekend stay at the Four Seasons New York  It was such an indulgent treat in many ways   the beautiful and spacious park suite the luxurious room amenities the incredible view   all signs of a great hotel  Another sign   the gracious and attentive staff  The spa staff bellmen front desk concierge room service housekeeping   they all deserve high praise  It was a wonderful experience from start to finish  Next time perhaps well have the chance to try the restaurants  On Saturday night we opted for one closeby on st called Aureole which was phenomenal  Thanks to the concierge who suggested it  
P => Everything works at Four Season NYC I had a very pleasant stay in y at Four Seasons New York  At the arrival we got upgraded to a room with a balcony which was just wonderful and although we were below floor  the traffic noise didnt bother In room breakfast was delivered quickly and it was deliciuos  It is actually nicer than eating breakfast down at the reastaurant which is a bit crowded Location is very good indeed so many things are within walking distance  Consierge services are impeccable  I had problems with charging my mobile but they took care of it they book us a table to a restaurant in Village which is nearly impoosible to get table in and in so many other ways they were able to help with the most polite and friendly attitude  Very professionalI was not too impressed by the spa services though  The spa area is nice and tidy though  And if you have a late flight they allow you to use the spa facilities the whole check out day which is nice I feel that the front desk staff was also very frendly and efficient  If you want everything to work fine and like to trust that quotmy hotel can help me with thisquot go to four seasons nyc  
P => Perfect location We stayed here last ember and had an exceptional stay  Spacious room masses of wardrobe space huge and perfect bathroom fantastic views and the most helpful staff amp concierge Ive ever met  It is in a fantastic location   and is absolubtly everything a good hotel should be Only negative   was the Joel Robuchon restaurant the food wasnt bad but portions were tiny and despite ordering twice the reccomended amount we didnt stumble across a single dish we would rave about  Not a disaster   but there are an abundance of better places about  Wouldnt go back to Atelier   but would return to the hotel anytime  
P => a disappointment    Stayed four nights at FSNY e   Check in was quick and we were taken to room by front desk rep  A good start  The room was dated at best  The bedspread needed replacing and we put it away for the rest of our stay  The room furnishings were worn leather chairs were scratched etc    The bathroom had peeling paint on the ceiling and the shower handle fell off and we had to call maintenance which did fix it  The terrace had so much mold on the floor Room  that we could not be outside without shoes on  The terrace table was covered in dirt and unusable  Weeds were growing on the corner of the terrace Room service was late every time and did not even include water  At these prices a dirty tablecloth on the room service tray is not acceptable  Our hallway was full of ks from luggage etc   and needed repainting  Housekeeping was good  Bathrooms are dated as is the hotel in general  There is no room in the lobby to sit down unless you are eating in one of the restaurants  Location is great as is the house car a silver Phantom if you are lucky enough to snag it This hotel is not in the same league as the Mandarin or St  Regis  The service is not there and the maintenance is not there  The prices are on par with the best New York Hotels however  
P => Start Spreadin The News  This is the best hotel in NYC The quintessential NYC experience  We were on the th floor with views of this incredible city and more specifically Central Park  I simply have not had a bad service experience with four seasons hotels and this was no exception  Nice people going out of their way to make us feel important and welcome was what we experienced here  Our room was very large and tastefully orated  The tub filled up in about  seconds  The large head shower was like showering in a waterfall The location of the hotel is wonderful being a short walk from Central Park on th th Madison and Park Avenues The hotel has that buzz of an important place with investment bankers and lawyers more prevalent than lobbyists in DC  The clientele is also a cosmopolitan set from the corners of the world There is a swanky bar that serves cool drinks and while in NYC one just feels like being cool for a few days The only surprise was that upon checking in we were given  towards our breakfast which seemed a deal  When I received our bill a few eggs and a bowl of fruit for two adults and two little kids came to over   My breakfast has become an expensive mealOther than that it was a great stay and well be back when we return to NYC  
P => Wonderful weekend stay Just returned from a weekend at the wonderful Four Seasons Hotel New York City  Whats best about this hotel Fabulous location beautiful physical property and the incredible staff and service  We truly enjoyed the oversized rooms amazingly comfortable beds and sheets and glorious bathrooms  The only flaw in our experience was the hotel charge of  per page to print our boarding passes   insignificant when considering the bill for our stay but irritating nonetheless  
P => Four Seasons NYC the best in the world bar none I booked two rooms for my wifes th birthday one for my love and I and one for our three children  Since we are close to NYC we opted to use Airbrook limo services to get there and back  The reason being that parking in Manhattan especially valet parking is extremely dear  We actually saved money by using a limo service Our experiences with the Four Seasons began in Philadelphia  One of my dhters is in university there  We ided to spend a weekend at Four Seasons philly during move in and were so satisfied that it is now the only place we will stay in philly ManhattanThe second we arrived we were treated like honored family  We observed people that took this excellent service as their due  They were in my opinion snotty self indulgent and rude  We actually saw an older couple wearing His and Hers mink coats LOL  Through it all the staff were always the best I had booked a balconey suite though it was uary in NYC  At check in we were offered the th floor south suite  This has to be one of the most spectacular hotel rooms in the world  Im sure that the st and Penthouse on the nd floor are superior  But the views cannot be any better  I say it again there cannot be any better city view in the world  We could see the flashes of the cameras on the Empire State Building observation desk  The east balcony had views that ranged from Conn  to the statue of Liberty  The west balcony had views from Alpine to Long Island ServiceSuperb fantastic what else can I say  My wife received extraordinary birthday favors delivered to the room  Champagne chocolate covered fruits robes slippers heated bathroom floors  etc By the way the tub has a sign that says it will fill in under  minutes and it DoesRestaurantLAtelier you need a new mortgage to eat here but it is well worth it  We are foodies and truly enjoyed the tastings dinner The concierge arranged a pre theatre dinner at the Rainbow Room tourist trap but that was what we wanted  It was not an easy reservation to procure especially the same day On the other hand Im a smoker and I spent alot of time hanging out with the doormen outside  They were the epitome of real caring New Yorkers  All the staff are superb we were very impressed with the level of service My kids want me to list the stars and famous people they saw and met here  Id have to say I only saw other guests  Then again Im a dummy No better place in any city in the world Unless it is on the company be prepared to indulge the love of your life  She is worth it as is mine  
P => enjoyable splurge I stayed here for  wonderful nights late last month using a certificate for a free rd night that Four Seasons graciously sent me  I had stayed here before about  years ago and little seems changed in the public areas  The former  restaurant is now the hot LAtelier de Joel Robuchon and the TY lounge was an unused space before as was the area opposite the reception area which is now a small art gallery with rotating exhibits  The hotel is very modern designed by I  M  Pei and was built from the ground up  The entrylobby is grand with a high quotwowquot factor  Service is top notch I was given a considerable room upgrade to a deluxe premium  a corner room on the th floor out of  floors with huge windows on  sides  The room was quite large and as such seemed sparsely furnished but it really did not lack anything  Lines are clean modern simple  The room and dressing area are paneled with blond wood the bath all ble and the tub really does fill up in  seconds as widely touted My package included breakfast   could be spent anywhere  Breakfast is served in  venues downstairs plus theres room service  Needless to say everything is expensive but  can adequately feed  people  The spafitness center  levels below ground is smallish but has all the needed amenities  spa steam room sauna etc I had been having shoulder problems but was able to sleep well here  great bed Given the luxurious surroundings plus the included breakfast I found I did not get out and about in the city nearly as early as in prior NYC visits  I didnt leave the hotel before  am a good   hours later than usual It is well known NYC has very high hotel room rates and the Four Seasons surely is one of the more expensive but this was a thoroughly enjoyable adent splurge  
P => A perfect stay Just arrived from the Four Seasons New York and loved it  At our arrival we received a better room than the one we reserved  The reception gave us the room   on the th floor facing th St WoowwwA corner room with a view As advice observe that after the th floor there is no other buildings at this heights on that face Check our photos  A pair of windows make the room full of light It has a closet and a big bathroom The service is very quick and the concierge veeerrrryyyy helpful The only negative note is that the breakfast either in the room or at the doesnt value what you pay for Certainly recomend and will return to this hotel where we stayed for  nights  
P => Incredible rooms wonderful hotel  We had a wonderful time at the Four Seasons New York  My boyfriend and I spent  nights here late uary and the hotel is in the perfect location if you are looking for top of the line shopping and incredible restaurants not to mention Central ParkThe rooms are huge    I could not believe the size because NYC hotels even at the  star level are usually on the smaller side compared to the rest of the world  But this room was definitely top of the line    comfortable bed amazing pillows flat screen tv and also a flat screen in the bathroom  The bathroom is huge and clean and well appointed to  The bathtub fills up in  seconds and is the best tub for a relaxing bath  The bar serves great drinks at  a drink and has a great menu to choose from  The front desk personnel are professional and the doormen were fun to talk to I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for luxury relaxation and tons of entertainment right outside the door  
P => We cant get enough of the Four Seasons We stayed again at the Four Seasons NY for my sons birthday celebration  Its hard not to like this place where they pamper you endlessly even if youre not a celebrity During the Christmas season theres a quotbeany babyquot tree in the lobby which the kids get to pick from at every meal or just walking by  The hotel is owned by Ty Warner creator of Beanie BabiesWe always opt to include breakfast with the rate because we will eat the extra  they charge to include it  There was a stay  nights get  free so it almost made it reasonable in cost The location is great if youre looking to stay near the park and the shopping is extremely close as as well Whenever we can afford it  its the four seasons or the St  Regis for us 
P => Beautiful Hotel but no wireless internet Hotel has a very asian flare  Expansive Lobby and comfy beds  Doormen and Concierge are world class  But the hotel still does not have wireless internet  How is this possible at a  star hotel in  Our closet was the size of my first apartment  If you like to spoil yourself stay at the Four Seasons and visit the spa but dont plan to curl up on your bed and get some work done  You have to hard wire into the Ethernet at the desk   threadcount and no wireless   Above Average  
P => Astonishing Palace   Wonderful Four Seasons Wonderful stay at the Four Seasons Hotel New York so far the finest Hotel I have ever stayed in  My experience has been amazing if I value the physical features of the Hotel including interior and exterior designarchitecture as well as the quality of service I received by all the staff commencing from the doorman at your arrival  The Hotel is a  story building at a premier location  East  Street between Park and Madison Avenue  For some reasons   such as the masonry building and the punched windows   it reflects the perfect tradition of New York and fits in it gorgeously whereas in a different way itself stands alone it is not a flat building but a light limestone cascade which creates an inviting scale for the main entrance  At each corner is set a lantern which at night create an invitation from the outside  The light honey colour of the limestone tower gives you a sense of well being and when you are inside it is all a surprise  LobbyImpressive high ceiling with columns onyx and limestone composes the foyer which is open onto the terraced lobby lounges on both sides  On one side there is  Restaurant and on the other side you have the TY Bar  Front OfficeConciergeThe reception is located past to the Concierge  desk which is in front of the main entrance  Staff is excellent   kind prompt friendly   they always come with a smile  Check in is was quick and although the Hotel was fully committed we did not have to wait for our room to be ready  With the Concierge we only arranged a couple of sightseeing plus booked  dinner and experienced their insightful knowledge  RoomLarger than average Deluxe Room even for NY standards with plenty of space for a comfortable sitting area with a divan armchair   seating for  people with a large coffee table  The FS beds are vellous all over the world I would love to buy one for my home  There is a large oval table which serves either as a working desk either as a dining table  At the desk you do have the cable for the Internet connection a printerfaxscanner at your disposal and all the electrical devices for your laptop  The table faces the huge glass window which itself overlooked the bustling th Street  Even if you are not staying at top floor   we were at th   you would definitely enjoy stunning views of the city  UpgradeOn our seventh and last night we have been upgraded to an enormous  square metres studio one bedroom suite on the th floor see picture  We enjoyed breathtaking views of Manhattan either at day and night and there was also a private terrace which we   unfortunately   cannot take advantage of because of a tight working schedule  All of our baggage have been packed and unpacked for the room move but you have to authorize them for that  BathroomHuge full ble bathroom with ample space  Features englassed walk in shower and arated bath tub that really fills in within  seconds it is a promise   perfect for a last minute relaxing bath after a long day of work or sightseeing  Luxurious Bulgari Amenities that are replenished twice daily  Excellent turn down service as per the picture and very nice touch the plasma TV screen RestaurantsWe dine once at the outstanding l Atelier de Joel Robuchon where we experienced an excellent service  The ambience is sophisticated and elegant yet casual  The kitchen is open onto the dining area and you can see the Chef at work which is basically the meaning of the word  Atelier   The dishes are tasteful   even if you are not a French cuisine fan   and presentation is top notch  You can even choose less formal dining options such as Express Menu which we enjoyed at the fairly reasonable price of USD   If you are looking for something less ambitious the  Restaurant is good as well and overlooks the main lobby  Great for business breakfast andor lunch  At the TY Bar you can choose among a wide range of tinis for appetizers or cocktails  This is facing the main lobby too with a very nice fireplace  BreakfastIt is not buffet of course and you can choose among the most sophisticated combination of cold and hot dishes according to your low fat diet or choose a Breafast Menu such as AmericanContinentalJapaneseCentral Park I loved the Central Park Menu and also tried the Japanese one with the finest grilled salmon and green tea I have ever tried  All of them are approximately at USD  except for the Japanese USD  which is not that much for what it is included  One breakfast menu can be sufficient for  persons or even for three  Fitness Centre square metres of space for your daily routine with complimentary juicewater and cut fruits  A wonderful experience to start or end your day in the city better if combined with the Spa  SpaWhirlpool Jacuzzi and Turkish bath are perfect for relaxing in a tranquil environment  Did not have massagetreatments and cannot judge on the quality and service but it certainly is overpriced  NegativesDo not have a swimming pool and the spa area needs much more air and open spaces  Room featuresI would have chosen parquet floors instead of carpets to give much more elegance to the room fittings  Room ServiceOverpriced in fact each dish is not inclusive of service charge delivery charge   tax and sales tax and   of course   you have to tip the waiter  If you are on budget go for an a la carte breakfast in the restaurant  Business Centre the fee is expensive i e   USD access   USD per min  taxes therefore  hour for checking the e mails and printing few pages comes to more than  USD  They should not charge for it and offer as complimentary Overall experienceThis is definitely a place to stay in New York City  
P => Wonderful service at the Four Seasons I stayed here for three nights in ember with my husband who was on business  The room was wonderful the closet space and bathroom enormous and there was nothing I could fault about it apart from the fact that we seemed to be on a housekeeping schedule that left our room until  pm each day  It was really quite annoying to come back from a morning out and find the room still not done My only other complaint is that the portions of anything from room service were enough for two or three people and it felt like a terrible waste  I expect though that this would be a real plus for a lot of people Apart from the late housekeeping the service was really quite outstanding  I was treated like a valued long term client despite it being my first stay and it really made me want to go back again   soon  The main restaurant is a Joel Rebochon which is wonderful at home in Monaco and just as good in New York  I ate there once for lunch and once at dinner   highly recommendedThe price tag is high  per night but this is serious value for money  
P => Disapointment  We ided to give this hotel a try from many reviews write ups and quite frankly the Four Seasons name  What a disapointment First of all make sure your room is high up   for a modern hotel   the street noise is terrible  We checked in to our room on the th floor   long narrow sterile average furnishings and bedding  The nexy day the front desk did accomodate us in the move   however we had asked for the move to happen while we were out as we would be rushed to get ready for an event once we returned to the hotel   not done had to wait for our bags and heard all sorts of excuses  Skip room service   does not arrive in the stated time and by the time it is there one has cold eggs nice job for breakfast for two  The business centre is a total ripoff    log in and min  The location is great for shopping  The gym is great the ONly really good thing about this hotel Although the Penninsula is not perfect   they at least have more value for the stay   also there roof top bar is loads of fun in the summer  Will take my business back here Obviously the Four Seasons chain doesnt keep a quotstandardquot  The George V is amazing and we call the Whistler Four Seasons our home away from home   New York disapoints  
P => ummm Good location average room for a huge price tag  If youre gonna spend that kinda money for a night NY has better hotels to offer  
P => Not up to expectations I am a big Four Seasons Fan and have stayed at many of their hotels  I stayed at the NY property on a business trip and was disappointed  The room I was first assigned to was oddly configured and extremely small even by NY standards  I asked for a different room and was graciously moved but the new room lacked charm  I found it cold and unwelcoming  It was also very dark in the evening even if I had all the lights on which made it difficult to work in the room Please dont take me wrong the hotel is still a Four Season location  The staff is wonderful it is clean and it is definitely a luxury hotel  Just when I compare it to other properties in the city in the same class ie The Peninsula I just think the Four Season team could have done much better and does  If you want to see it done right visit their Chicago property or better yet their Maui one  
P => Expensive New York Favorite I stayed at the Four Seasons New York for  nights in ember   This is probably about my th stay over the past  years  Room rates and restaurant prices have increased with each stay and are very expensive  However this hotel remains my favorite in New York  The facilities and service are outstanding as is the location on th between Madison amp Park  All staff encounters were of the highest level  Rooms are very large and spacious There are only a few rooms per floor and rooms are very quiet  There is a little muffled street noise but no sounds from adjoining rooms  You usually have an elevator to yourself I ate for the second time at the LAtelier restaurant which is an expensive adventure for those with gourmet tastes Convenient to Lexington Avenue subway th amp rd Street stations As an indulgence this hotel is hard to beat  
P => Great if you know what to expect This is a great hotel and one that should put anyone in a  deluxe  New York state of mind I M  Pei made sure you feel like Bruce Wayne in the public rooms  The service and all the rest are as expected or better with the Atelier restaurant worth an extra star in itself if youre a foodie Rooms If you expect a view you need to spring for the upper floor rooms  Know that the square footage is larger on the corner rooms below and as long as you clear the  th floor the view is basically the same as much higher up in the building it becomes a question of improved view vs a few extra square feet  If youre a family of three to a room definitely go for the larger room quotdownstairsquot  Toddlers love the rooms as there are windowseats hiding places and everything is padded except the coffee table Having said that Ive found Im most comfortable in the low end quotsuperiorquot room  the one a previous reviewer found facing into a wall the ones facing west are better  My reasoning is that unless Im smack on the park or above the th floor Ill pass on the view and go for comfort   the layout of these rooms on the side of the building is great with arate walk in closet and bathroom to either side of the entrance hallway  Check out the floorplans offered on the S website for more Cheapskates like yours truly will delight in buying their own water etc across the street on th street entrance at Duane Reed and there is an EXCELLENT coffee shop next to that called quotOrensquot  
P => Not worth the money    My overall impression of this hotel is that it quite simply is not worth the night price tag    The rooms are comfortable but basic and the or is unimaginative and lacks the luxurious touches expected of a hotel of this sort there were no cushions on the sofa no complimentary fruit and water in the room   The check in was disastrous  One of our rooms was not ready yet we were taken by a member of the reception staff to have a drink in the lounge  We were left standing at the entrance for  mins whilst the receptionist ensued in lengthy debate with the girl at the desk in the bar that we couldnt sit down for a drink as they were busy they werent this situation could have been handled much better had someone taken charge  We were then taken all the way to the back bar where we were charged for our drinks any other  star hotel would have given these to the client complimentary   I asked the concierge for an adapter as did the other half of our party in a different room it took  phone calls and an hour to get this adapter to us   Our room was not turned down on the second evening of our stay   The first morning we booked breakfast with the concierge half an hour in advance went down for breakfast and the restaurant told us they didnt have our booking However on the other hand  The rooms are large with great views   The lobby is fantastic and I dont think I have ever seen one to rival it   The location for shopping is unparalelled   The breakfast was fantastic   If you can overlook the inefficient service you realise it is warm and friendly  
P => Four Seasons best hotel in NYC This hotel can not be beat It is a beautiful property  Location is great  Service impeccable If you can afford it   do it 
P => Best Hotel in NY Stayed here over Labor Day weekend  This hotel is phenomenal Everything was perfect here My girlfriend and I went for a girls weekend and stayed in a beautiful room overlooking th street  spacious and very simple  Bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was huge The hotel was booked  US OPEN but you would never know it because you never saw anyone in the elevators or the lobby  The concierge service is the best in the world  Misty Shores the concierge is incredible  They got us in every single restaurant every time  Darrell the doorman sent us to the theatre in the hotel Rolls  Truly VIP service I would stay here every time if I could 
P => great hotel great location Everything you would expect from a Four Seasons hotel  Great location and beautiful room  The bathroom was very comfortable like you might find in a nice home rather than a hotel  The concierge was extremely helpful with finding a great place to eat nearby  Although we did not eat at the restaurant I hear it is fabulous as well  Would stay there again without hesitation  
P => Perfect Perfect service perfect room great with children best concierge only breakfast could be improved if we consider the cost    
P => Unquestionably the best hotel in the world As a regular visitor to the Hotel The Four Seasons in NYC th time after time delivers best possible experience for the discerning visitor What sets it apart from any other hotel in the excellence of its staff   be it the doormanront deskconceirgeetc Its the small touches that sets it apart the rest     from the doorman having your keys ready as you get out of the car so you go straight upto your room after a very late night arrival after a delayed flightetc This is the only establishment where one gets a true feeling of coming back home each visit The only downfall is that one benchks the Four Seasons with every other hotel and they never match up to the standard  
P => Staying in an airshaft I booked on the S website  My room on the th floor had an apartment building  feet outside the main window  When I worked at the desk I was looking directly into the apartment and vice versa  It was similar to being in an old time NY hotel in an airshaft  For  the S should do better  When I checked in to the hotel if I had been told about the room I would have gone elsewhere  
P => Sheer Heaven  I love this place I have stayed at this property numerous times amp dont always post a review but I feel I am doing a dis service to them if I dont  Briefly   it just doesnt get any better than this  If you are looking for a sleek semi quiet the bar during the week is quite happening with business types luxurious stay with excellent service this is the place for you  What I like about this hotel is its location the size of rooms the fact that every staff member makes an effort to know your name amp that its not overrun by conventions weddings etc  The answer is always quotyesquot at FSNYC amp my answer is quotyesquot I wouldnt stay any other place 
P => One of my favourites I love this hotel  I stay here every year with my family and have never had a complaint  Excellent size of rooms service location and most importantly attention to detail  Would highly recommend to anyone  One trip in particular sticks out   the black out in NY Summer    The Four Seasons made every effort possible to ensure comfort in this tough time esp when most other hotels simply closed down  
P => Amazing Had the most amazing stay here  The rooms were great  The service was THE BEST I have ever experienced especially Steven at the Concierge desk  
P => Still head and shoulders above the rest Having stayed the the FSNY several years ago I was almost afraid to return after reading several of the more recent reviews on this site  I had fond memories of the stunning open lobby the oh so savvy concierge the friendly staff and the velous and comfortable rooms and especially the bathrooms  This is not to say I do not remember that all of this comes at quite a hefty price but one must pay for a superior experience  So off I went fingers crossed and      I am happy to report all is well at the Four Seasons The same helpful and knowlegeable staff the same sky high standards of care obvious in the housekeeping and furnishings the same absolutely fantastic location  And the same stratospheric prices I remembered but somehow didnt mind paying  This hotel is an experience in itself and one not to be missed  You owe it to yourself to enjoy the splendor at least once in your life  Somehow I think youll find it was worth it  
P => Very good not the best After staying at a few FS hotels throughout the world I ided to spend the week end with my wife there The FSNY is a very nice hotel but it lacks life It felt very sterile and too corporate to us  On the plus  staff is very friendly location is good their signature massage is top rooms are clean and spaciousOn the min rooms lack inspiration turn down service is just that not like in the Mandarin with water chocolates info paper and an Asian inspired saying amenities though by Bulgari are very basic high premium to be paid for a good view always inclusive at the MandarinSo if you want to stay in a top chain hotel in NYC the Mandarin Oriental beats the FSNY easily lively nicer and bigger rooms more amenities and even cheaper     
P => The Four Seasons Nighte after nighte I cannot express my disappointment with my stay at this hotel  There was still feces flecking the toilet when we checked in and a hair on the nice white sheets  It took two hours for them to ide if they were going to change our room or clean it  they ultimately cleaned it with no apologies  The front desk staff were gruff and unhelpful  failing to even answer basic questions about museums and theatre tickets  The elevators were broken or under repair for our first night  At the restaurant the first two items we ordered were unavailable  I expected much much more from the Four Seasons flagship in NYC  No apologies were ever made  
P => Couldnt fault it I was very impressed with the FS mostly with the hotel staff from checking in to the bell boy and the doorman everybody knows your name here who ever you are  Bathroom was quite impressive with the bath filling in seconds very handyRooms were cleaned very well and turndown was good also The only thing is    they phoned me at  am to ask what time I was checking out that day why phone at am when i was sleeping in bed If you want a very upscale hotel in new york go here but very expensive  Did not eat at the hotel so can not comment on the food  
P => The Four Seasons made our NYC visit Fabulous We visited NYC for the first time and have really enjoyed the Four Seasons in Paris and Geneva so it was our priy option  The location is excellent for the quotth avenue strollquot The lobby is beautiful and enormous  It was a great welcome to a wonderful two night stay  We checked in with ease and waited for our friends to arrive by having a high tea in the wine bar just off the entrance  Everything was delicous All of us enjoyed the spa Four Seasons in One treatment for  minutes the first afternoon and then got ready for dinner  We dined at Daniel and per se thanks to the unbelievable concierge team in NYC  We were wait listed for per se which I assumed meant quotno chancequot but they kept checking for us and three nights before called our home in Switzerland and told us we had reservation at per se  Everytime we asked for help from the concierge it was if it was there true pleasure to help us  That is what I expect at the Four Seasons and they delivered   We choose a deluxe basic for the Four Seasons room and it was spacious enough  ft     the rate was  per night  We all talked about how well we slept in the wonderful beds The biggest downside is the expense eating there  Breafast was  per person for a normal two egg sausage     and high tea was  for four people  However I knew that going in and with the great service     I am happy to pay In our opinion the Four Seasons in Paris is still our favorite hotel in the world but the NYC concierge is quotthe bestquot thanks again for the per se experience and it is an overall great experience  
P => The very best in NYC How in the world can anyone find fault with this the very best of all Four Seasons hotels  Ive stayed in the ones in Paris Lisbon Great Exuma and Nevis this year and none can touch the one in New York  The rooms are lovely and so well appointed  The service is exemplary  The restaurant is even excellent  And all this located on th Street between Madison and Park what could be better  
P => Outstanding the most memorable part of our visit We checked into the FSNY on a Monday following a weekend at the Library Hotel as part of a surprise trip for my partner s th  I had booked a deluxe king floors   street view direct with the hotel for their online rate inc  breakfast exc  tax of   We had been in NY over the weekend with great weather so ided to check whether there was be a terrace room still available we could upgrade to   on the lower floors but it would be nice to have some outside space  I mentioned this to the wonderful receptionist who checked us in who had very subtlety noted in the booking my partners birthday and said he would have a look and see what he could do  All the terraces were booked but with some checking he said he had managed to locate a suite on their th floor which had two terraces He wrote down how much the room normally went for and then how much extra we would need to pay on top of our current rate and we instantly wrote off our holidays for the next couple of years and jumped at the chance  Because they weren t expecting any guests in the room that day it would take an hour or so to send in their crack team of housekeepers and the room would be available for us no later than pm  In the meantime the check in person escorted us to the restaurant where we were seated straight away and enjoyed a vellous lunch the steak was the best my partner has ever tasted After lunch we explored our new location just round the corner from Central Park and the amazing shops on th Ave and returned at pm to pick up the keys bags efficiently already taken up to the closet in the room  We d done a brief tour of the hotel ourselves out of curiosity when we first arrived so just collected the keys from reception and let our ears pop as we shot up to the th floor and headed to our room  Oh my oh my oh my  Just as we first opened the door we saw the  office area  which had its own desk with TV faxprinter and sliding doors onto the  East Terrace   I was still wondering at these vels when I heard  your not going to believe this  gasps from the other half when he walked further into our main bedroomliving area  I nearly fell over the couch looking at the views straight ahead of the Chrysler building and the Empire State Building   we had queued and paid good money to go see these sights up at Top of the Rock the night before and now there they were on tap Once we had got over that shock we moved across to the west side of the suite and down the corridor to the very grand ble bathroom with TV closets and the West terrace with views to far right of central park  I  be paying it off until my th birthday but those first impressions and the whole experience at staying at the FS were priceless  In fact we wrote off the rest of Monday and didn t leave the suite at all   we had THE most memorable meal via room service this time steak for me nice   bottle of wine Pinot Noir from Oregon and to top it all a surprise birthday cake was sent up by  special services  with a lovely welcome card all laid out by the room service waiter on the terrace table  Absolutely stunning evening  Bathroom is huge ble and luxurious with Bvlgari toiletries and a small LCD screen next to the sinks  Also nice inlays aside the deep bath great for candles and a relaxing soak  We did however get brown bathwater which put us off  Shower was fabulous  There is also a bedside Bose clock radio pre set to some great stations that has vellous sound  We had breakfast in the restaurant area for  mornings which I must admit was a bit confusing   we had booked  breakfast inclusive  so wasn t sure which option we were supposed to choose from found out with a call it was the  American   When presented with the bill each time we had to inform the service staff it was inclusive  On our last morning we had breakfast in our room and kicked ourselves for not having done that sooner   so much more comfortable with all the choices there and you can take your time  Would recommend having breakfast in your room or you  end up sitting next to a couple of high brow business men one who was sacking the other as we found one morning Lovely selection of fresh fruit two eggs how you like pastries amp juice smoked or Canadian bacon etc  Over our  night stay we had wonderful cocktails and nibbles  would recommend the back bar close to the restaurant it s busier than the one to the front but has a more extensive bar menu better complimentary snacks and for us anyway friendlier staff  We put the poor concierge staff through their paces by requesting a table at one of the most popular restaurants in NY at   pm that night but they were able to oblige even then  The doorman on the th exit recommended two fabulous Italian restaurants nearby for lunch  We booked a car via concierge for our transfer hotel to airport which was seamless  The whole experience was momentous  If you can do  
P =>  Seasons quality and     I  be a bit critical only coz of being a loyal Four Seasons customer that believe in their quality as well as the price paid for this particular property USnite excluding all other taxes and this is a BampB package  Having said that I do like the rooms spacious on the rd floor with LCD TVs one in the bathroom a big glass shower with a sit down bench a nice music pipe in system ble bath tub big etc  Towels and bathrobes were thick and comfortable as were the sheets in the bed  See attached photo for room details  One thing that I had found that was unacceptable was the mold in the brackets that hold the shower bench together  For an expensive  Seasons the cleaning should be more thorough We had a King bed and a little sitting area that overlooks a buidling that has a penthouse rooftop garden that was quite pretty to look at  I especially like the dresser area   big walk in with lots of room for his and hers and enough drawers for his and hers  usually most hotels have only  sets of drawer but this room has    Check in was swift and efficient things breakfast gym etc were explained and indicated to us so we didnt have a problem finding our way around  Gym was adequate I especially appreciate that they have a fridge stocked full of bottle water rather than the usual water cooler Breakfast was good dont know the price coz we had a package but nothing amazing  Location is great if u like to shop  We husband and I especially enjoyed the bar which makes a good tini and what a variety  All in all we had enjoyed our stay staff are friendly good amenities and location  We will return but this time if I see another moldy shower I will inform the hotel about it  It is just not acceptable for a  Seasons that one has to pay nite  
P => Best In New York Having previously stayed at the Trump on Central Park getting a bit worn and the Ritz Central Park I have to say that my last stay at the Four Seasons is making me lean towards them  First of all the hotel itself is immaculate   everything looks like it is brand brand new and there is not a feature out of place  Secondly the service is exactly how is should be but is not always the case at a four seasons hotel  Sebastian at the front desk was great and assigned me a corner room overlooking central park and th st  on a high floor    ask for the  series of room on a high floor   lovely configuration for a king bedded room   about  sq  feet with small dressing area   perfect for  person  Door and bell staff were great always welcoming me back after I returned each day and running up and down the street to get me a cab during rush hour  When no cabs were available they put me in a complimentary Rolls Royce Phantom one of their two complimentary house cars the other one is a bach  On another occassion I left the hotel with an almost empty bottle of water in my hand  Randi the doorman on the th st  entrance whipped out a new bottle of water to take with me on my way out  Concierge were fabulous very witty and charasmatic with some superb recommendations   listen to everything they say to you about the city transportation and dining   they really do know what they are talking about   Helen and Reynold are great  The service in the hotels restaurants is both proffessional and personable   our waiter ultra camp had us in stitches with his opinions on everything from the world cup to his newly designed uniform  He comped us all desserts if we quotpromised not to tell his managerquot  Food however is just good hotel food nothing spectacular and very very expensive think  for a burger or a caesar salad  Much better places to go in New York although their new restaurant Atelier de Joel Robuchon should help them compete with some of the better restaurants in the city when it opens next month  Housekeeping service is unbelievable  I bought a six pack of diet coke from a store which I left in my room   the maid filled a large ice bucket and placed the drinks in the bucket so they would be chilled on my return to the room  All my clothes were refolded to perfection and a cigar ashtray was left for the cigars I bought they were actually a gift for someone else but nice touch anyway  Tipped the turn down lady   Spa service is fabulous I was quotwelcomed backquot by the spa attendand who remembered me from my first stay  months ago There is no pool though but there is a jacuzzisteam room  The spa itself is not as impressive as other areas of the hotel   a little small and in the basement    its all service based with this facility You have to pay for the business centre  a minute for internet access and its only open during certain hours    not impressed with this  At other four seasons e g  Boston it is complimentary and open  hours Overall the hotel is the best in new york  Every staff member is genuinly hospitable and helpful and basically thinks for you so you can spend your time enjoying yourself or maximising productivity if youre a business traveller  However be prepared to pay for it    by far the most expensive hotel in New York in every way  Expect to pay  per night for a standarddeluxe king room  If you can find a room for under  a night e mail me  
P => Fine Hotel with One Caveat The Four Seasons New York is an all around excellent hotel  As would befit a Mobil Five Star and AAA Five Diamond property you are put in the heart of the shopping district th Avenue and are a close cab ride to most of the popular tourist attractions  You are in a posh location and you certainly pay for it  I booked a Superior Room and was generously upgraded to a Deluxe Room with Terrace and it would have been nice to utlize the furnished terrace for an in room dining experience but it was freezing outside I went the week after the snowstorm in NYC in ruary  The prevailing rate for this room is night  I paid roughly ish a night for two nights and my third night was free  At that rate I dont have much to complain about  From what I gather this hotel caters mostly to business people on an expense account and is usually fully committed sold out accordingly for those guests concerned about the carpet on the guest floors being a bit soiled or worned out   this place  not be for you  If you are pretty mellow when you stay at hotels this hotel wont disappoint  Keep in mind while this hotel does its best to keep everything looking clean this is first a SERVICE ORIENTED hotel  Otherwise the rooms themselves and public areas of the hotel are immaculately maintained and furnished  The elevator banks are divded into two sections one for Lobby Floor to  and the other    whatever the highest floor the hotel occupies  There were very quick  Each side has three elevators  The gym is stocked with chilled towels juices and fruits for your enjoyment  The room was very modern style wise and that is the theme I guess at this hotel  which is good  I am not into the traditional look think Ritz Carlton etc   There were electronic controls to control to window curtains from your bed  There was sufficient lighting and unlike the bathroom you can moderate how much light you want  The AC Unit is not powerful as it should be or I just dont know how to use it  The wall mounted plasma TV swivles so anyone in the room can watch  There is a DVD player and a faxcopy machine inside the room  Room was isolated just fine  You have an abudant amount of closet space  We stayed for three nights and there was enough space and then some for both of us The bathroom is done in ble and is simply spectacular  I loved it  arate bathtub and shower  Amenities soaps were nice  Bathtub filled up quick  seconds as advertised I am not so sure but fast enough  The small LCD TV in the bathroom is a nice plus  There was an excessive amount of lighting in the bathroom however  if you like light then that is good for you then  I only had breakfast at the quotLobby Loungequot during my stay as it was included with my rate and the food was just average  American Breakfast during my stay was   per person  Room Service was prompt and expensive but that is expected   expect to add to your order service charge taxes gratiuty and delivery charge  I didnt order anything spectacular from both dining outlets in the hotel just french toast and eggs and breakfast meats  If you want to eat in your room and want to bypass the service charges that accompany ordering room service go downstairs and order at the restaurant quotto go quot The breakfast credit was around or close to USD with a breakfast package   Bar was very energetic when I went around  oclock on a Saturday night  Even as hotel guests we had to wait   minutes to be seated  I just went to the bar and ordered a drink and took it back to my room  A Long Island Iced Tea sets you back  Housekeeping did an amazing job cleaning the room during the day  I lined turn down service but I imagine it is up to par  When I did request some items tolietries from housekeeping it sometimes took in excess of two or three calls to have my request fulfilled My biggest qualm with this hotel is their Concierge  Before my stay I like to make contact with the Concierge to see what they recommend and most of the times I reach them I am put on extended hold times probably due to being inundated with guests at the hotel  There are usually four or five Concierges working at a given time during the day  Everytime I called during the day New York time I was asked to hold  This happened on several occasions when I called from my hotel room holding  In some cases I would just call the Front Desk and have them relay a message for me which worked quite well  Your best bet to reach a Concierge and have their undivded attention is probably later at night  oclock PM EST  They work late I remember being up around midnight and the Concierge was still answering phone calls   a plus  When you talk to them they are generally helpful and very nice  All of my requests were meet and processed efficiently  P S  A bag of MampMs that you can get for     costs   at this hotel in the mini bar  I purposely ate one bag and replaced it with a store bought one just for fun  The hotel has a  bach that it uses to transport guests around town limited radius that you should check out or better yet use  
P => A great hotel This Hotel is always going to be a safe bet if you can afford it It met our expectations in every way especially the service levels the staff have an excellent professional and friendly attitude without any stuffiness which you find sometimes in expensive places  The breakfasts are fabulous and it is well worth booking for breakfast on an inclusive basis otherwise itll set you back  for two  Avoid room service    for two cups of tea and even worse for liquor which you have to buy by the litre at   The Spa treatments we ghad were good though the environment is only average  The location is unbeatable for being central to the main shopping area and Central Park  
P => Worth every penny all nine bazillion of them Our family of four stayed at the Four Seasons in New York this past ch and it completely lived up to our super high expectations  Deluxe rooms We had booked two deluxe adjoining rooms for a family rate nd room at half price  Each room consisted of a large bedroom with a sitting area and a gorgeous huge bathroom  Our two rooms were parallel to each other so if we were in one room our kids would not be able to see or hear us in the other room even with the doors open   while that might sound great to the parents out there we knew our little boy would be really scared  However I would definitely recommend the deluxe rooms for any couples or solo travellers Front desk The front desk was absolutely wonderful about showing us a suite immediately and that was what we upgraded to  Yes it was twice the cost but our son was a lot more comfortable because it was pretty much an enormous apartment The suite It was probably about  square feet with two bedrooms two and a half bathrooms a living room and dining area a large walk in closet and views in three directions  The or was clean and modern without being intimidating or stuffy  The views I knew I was a little afraid of heights but I was seriously dizzy for the first  hours in the suite  And I was freaking out because we were paying a lot of money and all I could think of was the possibility of the building falling over  But just as one of the employees assured me I got used to it and actually could enjoy the view by the end of our stay  We could easily see the Hudson River the East River the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building  We had a small glimpse of Central Park  Our views really looked like something from a postcard of NYC The beds Perfect  Sheets blankets comfort   perfect Service Perfect  I swear that each employee we encountered went out of their way to say hello and make us feel extremely welcome  The doormen were especially wonderful and helpful The lobby Breathtaking  Room service OK this is really the only complaint I have  We ordered dinner one night and several of the food items were incomplete or wrong  Several of the dishes were lukewarm  The overall quality of the food was really just average   almost like average diner food  Concierge Thoroughly professional friendly and helpful  Within about a minute of asking for a local restaurant recommendation we had printed directions in our hands as well as the suggestion quotAnd  we call them to let them know you will be arriving soonquotLocation I felt completely comfortable walking around this area with our children  Overall I would bring our family back in a heartbeat even with the shock inducing rates   as soon as we can afford another visit 
P => Four Seasons Triumphs Once again Four Season triumphs  We had an executive room plenty big enough with a fabulous bathroom and walk in shower  Beds great cleanliness superb  Service however is always a trade k of the Four Seasons  Let me give you an example  My thirteen year old son collects old car number plates from most countries we visit  He was having trouble finding one in New York despite Stephen one of the concierges trying to find one for him The day before we left Stephen had still not located one but had gone to the trouble of bringing in one of his old number plates from home as a gift refusing any payment Other hotels read and weep We were also chauffered around in a brand new Rolls Royce Phantomand a bach as their courtesy car for short trips  Great rooms the hotel has undegone a major refurbisment in the last two yearsgreat location great staff and service out of this world what more could you want 
P => Perfect Views We had a wondeful time here  Stayed in room  with perfect views of the city and Central Park  Make sure you get a view of the Park  Bath tub was great and the bed was as advertised  My only critique is that they should have wireless Internet access  Will definitely return  
P => Best Hotel in New York This was our second stay at the Four Seasons New York and it is by far the best hotel in Manhattan  We love the location service and rooms  The service from the front desk to the restaurant were spectacular  Not a detail overlooked We had a park view executive suite which was very spacious and comfortable  We love the plasma tv in the bathroom We have been fortunate enough to stay at numerous luxury hotels in New York including the Ritz Central Park HORRIBLEand the Mandarin Oriental but none come close to the pampering and luxury at the Four Seasons 
P => Lived up to expectations My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for a long weekend break  We had high expectations but some concerns having read postings on this site  We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay  We were upgraded on arrival and found our room to be comfortable and spacious  The staff we encountered were polite and efficient specifically the concierge who was vellous  The restaurant bookings that were made on our behalf were excellent and we received superb service as Four Seasons guests while dining  Having heard about the outrageous price of breakfast we asked for a recommendation for a local diner and were directed to a fabulous place just a few minutes walk away  Two small disappointments   the main restaurant was closed for reation and dinner in the alternative lounge bar was just average but very expensive  On departure we waited  minutes for the doorman to hail us a cab and in the end had to do it ourselves when what were clearly regular guests arrived and we were promptly and rudely forgotten  
P => Dont be afraid to bring the kids My husband and I have stayed here twice and I cant say enough about how fabulous this hotel is  The first time was pre baby and we loved it then for the terrific service the large immaculate rooms and terrific food  This time around we brought our  month old dhter  She got the full Four Seasons royal treatment with a special stuffed animal washcloth and terry bath toy to keep diapers wipes her own baby toiletries a diaper champ full sized crib with sheets blanket and bumper etc  This was all in the room when we walked in  I am sure that these reviews have already gone on and on about how gorgeous the hotel is how attentive courteous and helpful the staff is and how they have thought of every detail in both the rooms gotta love those ble bathrooms and the service so I want to focus on how kid friendly they are We have been to a number of Four Seasons and though they are among the nicest hotels in the world I have never felt that my dhter was unwelcome  Still I was a little nervous about New York as it is a little less casual than some of the other locations We ate in the  Restaurant which by the way has excellent food twice   once for breakfast and once for dinner  At breakfast my dhter was given crayons and a coloring book not just a placemat and her food came in Barbie dishes with toddler sized silverware  The hostess brought her a small stuffed animal during our meal and the server as well as the other staff in the restaurant all waved to her and generally were very attentive and kind At dinner two arate staff members brought her stuffed animals to keep she really made out with the toys during our stay  She threw a pacifier on the floor at one point and a staff member ran over before we knew it picked it up sanitized it and returned it on a plate right away  The staff was willing to and did bring pretty much any dish we requested both for our dhter and for us  At one point my dhter saw a waiter walking by and held out a piece of pasta toward him  He whipped out a silver tray and held it at her level and she put her pasta on it and he disappeared to clean it off Thats how over the top they go to back up their claim that they are kid friendly Each time we called to get restaurant recommendations they reminded us that their restuarants were kid friendly  Even housekeeping paid attention to every detail   down to laying my dhters stuffed animals in her crib with their heads on her pillow Bottom line is this hotel is great for anyone  Yes it is expensive but you get what you pay for  If you want amazing service beautiful large rooms and terrific twice daily housekeeping stay here  And dont feel that you need to leave the kids at home 
P => Loved the service  This place is oustanding The staffs are friendly from the bellboy outside to the waiters inside the  restaurant are all respectfull and helpful We stayed at  and the room is so spacious luxurious and excellently provided  The view outside the windows are spectacular from having a drink by the window to watching the golden sunrise in the morning is an experience I will never forget  I would love to be back again 
P => Top ks for design The most striking thing about the Four Seasons is the beauty of its design  Its just incredibly classy for an American hotel tasteful elegant stylish and imposing yet relaxing  The reception area is glorious and all the public areas feel a world away from the bustle of the New York streets  The rooms are huge too  Light wood makes them feel spacious but the sitting areas and classy bathrooms are achieved by devoting real space to them  Too many places in New York can feel like a rabbit hutch but theres no danger of that at the Four Seasons So why one star short of perfection Well its not quite stress free as a place to stay  One day my room wasnt made up until almost pm requests for things missing from the room a corkscrew a battery for the wireless keyboard took a fair while to process and the check out procedure was complicated by the wrong charges being assigned to my account  Theyre comparatively minor things but given the prices its not too much to ask for them to be sorted out  Worth noting the maid said the delay in cleaning the room was caused by too much work for individual staff members And beware some of the extra charges  The limo service from the airport is efficient but it should be at   On planning the return trip to the airport the concierge kind of lined to come up with an alternative to the limo   even though a cab outside the hotel would have been a third of the price Its still one of the very nicest places to stay in the city and youd have to be Mr Hyper Pernickety not to enjoy it to a very signficant degree  But it could do just a little bit better if it wants to be one of the worlds greatest hotels  
P => very average room at the seasons nyc stayed on the th floor with a spectacular room with some issues  the room is extremely average for a fourseasons  the or was like a dorm room with very few amenities  the location is good the lobby is beautiful  I would choose the ritz or st regis next time  
P => A shame for such a price Waitress from the bar were really bad Plus the hotel is really average  In our room it smells as if something die Not acceptable when you pay such an high price  
P => Perfection There is something magical about the FS New York  From the moment you step into this hotel you relax completely due to the amazing staff the fantastic guest rooms and impressive public areas  We stayed four nights in a deluxe room and enjoyed it fully  Awesome bathroom with great water pressure and great Bulgari toiletries In most hotels there are small details that start annoying you after a while but this is not the case here  Its truly perfection in all details The gym is quite well equipped but it could be improved We were told that the restaurant Fiftyseven Fiftyseven will close completely for three months during the winter for remodelling  Definitely among the worlds best hotels  
P => Excellent Stay at an Excellent Property You will love the Four SeasonsWe just returned from our stay at the Four Seasons and we loved every minute of our stay  We stayed in a Deluxe Room and the room was very spacious and comfortable   everything you could want in your home away from home King sized bed arate changing area seating area w desk and couch ble bath w stall shower and arate bath  Flat screen TV w swivel in bed area as well as a small flat screen in the bath  Aside from the wonderful accomodations the staff was friendly and attentive to any requests  Room service was a treat especially loved the breakfast   food was always delivered by the time stated and served at perfect serving temperature We absolutely loved every minute of our stay and cant wait to go back 
P => The best Many people point to the Four Seasons NY as the best hotel in the country and I cant really argue with them  Ive stayed there a countless number of times and I have never found another hotel half as good as this  They do everything better than everyone  The rooms are magnificent but fairly simple  Very luxorious but not like the Ritz Carleton where every room looks like the living room of a Bel Air mansion  The bathrooms in every single room are to die for  I never want to leave the showers and the bathtubs are full in like  seconds The beds are amazing and I even ordered their pillows for my bed at home The staff is so unbelievably courteous and can help you with anything  I dont know what else to say  Ive never once met anyone who does not like this hotel  Its as close to perfect as can be  
P => World Class and they charge for it  We really enjoyed our stay after having spent a previous night at a nearby so called trendy hotel  The beautiful lobby of the Four Seasons and the huge flower arrangements makes you want to sit down and take it all in Luxurious room on the th floor with a view of Central Park  Loved the bathroom and dressing area but could have used a second sink  The bedroom is nice but a little austere  Wonderfully comfortable king bed  Our weekend rate was around  which was better than the weekday  something  Dont think Id bother to stay a week at those rates  Breakfast was excellent in the main dinning room but our lunch in the lobby lounge was way below average  Ask the Concierge about the Executive pass for the Empire State Building  you get to skip all the lines 
P => Fabulous Hotel What a fantastic hotel  Great location for Central Park and Fifth Avenue  Service standards excellent and room wonderful  We had a large double room overlooking the front of the hotel  Beautifully clean and great attention to detail  Bathroom wonderful  The claim the the baths fill in  seconds is true and the Bulgari products are a favourite  The gym and spa are on the lower ground floor are good  The bar on the main ground floor is a great experience although the cost of gin and tonic is expensive  Great three day stay and will definitely be back  
P => Dont bother I just returned from having lunch at the Lobby Bar at the Four Seasons  I was very disappointed in the very stark or and small size of the public rooms  The service was very poor considering this is supposed to be a five star hotel  Lunch for three people without alcohol was   For this princely sum we received average service  I was with my  year old son and they didnt provide him with a place setting until I asked  They forget my husbands beverage and my dessert was so small it was annoying  There was also almost a  minute difference between when I got my dessert and when my son and husband were served theirs   At the table next to us there was a full figured woman  I heard her order a club sandwich and the same lousy waitress we had told her it could be made in a low calorie version  The woman had not asked for that  I felt embarrassed for her  I have lived off and on in New York all my life and have eaten in almost every  star restaurant in town  This Four Seasons Hotel was substandard  
P => Great rooms We stayed over the New Year period at this hotel our first room over looked two huge air conditiong shaft from the next building so close we could touch them if the windows opened we where moved to a great room with views of Central Park and beyond  The rooms are a great size and bathrooms have a great soaking tub  The best service here is the maids they are invisible but your room get made over and all done expertly unlike the Mandarin Oriental   bad service  The room service is good but very expensive over  for breakfast  We will come again but be sure to get the roomwe want  
P => Just another  star hotel    Review As a connoisseur of  star hotels worldwide and a keting specialist I know quality  In my opinion attention to detail is what makes a hotel memorable or forgettable   There were several disappointments at this hotel the least of which was the feeling that I was just a number just another guest I stayed here for  weeks over Xmas amp New Years Eve         The staff who greeted me were lovely but after that everything was very mediocre  I appreciate they have a lot of things to deal with but if that is your job you need to be an exceptional person   Firstly the rooms apparently recently reated were clean and tidy but too modern there was no warmth although the bathroom was spacious and lovely and very bland coloring now I like neutral tones but combined with the minimalist design it was just not that comfortable  The movies were blocked regularly I had to call down  times to have them switched on so I could watch a movie  I asked for the dvd player to be attended to as it wasnt working  Turns out it wasnt a multi zone dvd player and they didnt have one for my use  do they expect all their guests to be Americans   I sent a bunch of flowers and some doughnuts to the front desk amp concierge to thank them for their assistance and as a gesture to gain some respect when you give you get   not here  I had to call down the next day to see if they were even received no thank you and was told quotoh yes they did arrive  OKquot Lovely   I ordered room service many times and there was one dish that arrived as Id ordered it  Every other dish had some mistake even though I specifically asked for certain things eg skim milk vinegar instead of oil etc When I asked for a pasta bosciaola the quotchefquot had no idea what it was I explained it was a common Italian dish like Cabonara only with mushroom instead of egg and I was sent a bowl of plain pasta and a jug of cream mushroom soup     star I think not Twice when I attepted to order room service they put my call on hold to answer another call and left me on hold till I hung up No call back of course  As far as I know professional reception involves placing the second caller on hold amp coming back to the first   Concierge is also constantly putting calls on hold for extended amounts of time obviously very under staffed The concierge is nice but rather powerless several times I requested assistance and they were unable to help  I also needed a car to be sent after being stuck in the city with no cabs for  hours at night  They said I would have to wait an hour in the cold for a car and it would be a  hour minimum   for a  cab ride I called  hour limos    they are a great company with the best rates in town they got me a car in  minutes  Similarly on NYE when I needed transport to and from the Rainbow Room the concierge told me it would be a  hour minimum    an hour Please I ordered a car with  hr limos and it was arranged  each way    Avoid asking concierge here for assistance  Very mediocre and taking full advantage The do not disturb sign is continually ignored I was buzzed about   times a day never mind that I was jet lagged and sleeping    If I was awake and did not have the privacy sign on I was bothered about  times a day for cleaning mini bar checks and a simple do you have any trays or tables to collect   if Id had one Id have called to have it collected Over done service in all the wrong ways  The chamber maids were very friendly and polite though There were no comments gifts mention of Xmas on the day I was expecting at least a note under the door wishing merry Xmas perhaps with a chocolate or something These special little touches make all the difference  In fact not once during the entire stay did anyone contact me to ask how my stay was whether I was happy needed anything etc  I expect a little more from my  star hotels  The location of the hotel is ok however it is set back a bit in midtown great for Barneys amp Bloomingdales etc but I find the Plaza a nicer location for the park and open space only a few blocks up  Personal preference The four seasons NY lobby is small but tasteful and the restaurant and bar are the same small but nice  However I will never stay at this hotel again it is just not good enough for me to consider a second home when I travel  I have stayed in other Four Seasons hotels my favourite being the George V in Paris which is superb and totally unrivalled but the New York branch is sorely disappointing   I will try the Four Seasons Pierre next time see if they are any better   
P => Luxurious Wonderful Stay Spent  nights at the Four Seasons New York in   and it was an amazing experience  From the moment we stepped into the lobby we knew it was going to be a great stay  We booked the Bed and Breakfast package  Upon arrival we were upgraded from a Moderate to a Superior room  You can either enjoy the breakfast in your room or in the restaurant  The room is very big for NY  The bathroom was beautiful and the tub does fill in  seconds  Loved the Bulgari bath products  We have stayed in other FS properties such as Hualalai and Santa Barbara and have never been disappointed  If you are looking for a luxurious hotel this is the place for you  A great location if you like shopping on Madison and th Ave  The museums are also very close

P => Chic boutique hotel in the heart of the financial district Usually when I come to NYC I stay in SoHo or the Lower East Side  If you plan to go out in those areas or even up in the East Village or Chelsea this hotel is a bit out of the way  But the price cant be beat for a Thompson boutique hotel  The subway is close by but Fulton Station is not easy to figure out  Youll also need to transfer to get to where you need to be  Some of the direct lines to that area also dont run on the weekends  The hotel will call a taxi for you so getting out of the area is not an issue   I stayed in a standard room the first night and then upgraded to their biggest suite both were really great  Really SOFT and heavenly beds  Service was friendly but sometimes slow as they didnt have enough people working the front desk  Im still working through a dispute with the hotel as their housekeeping through out one of my shopping bags  Usually for the amount of money spent here I wouldnt have to go through this much trouble for a reimbursement  However management has been courteous throughout this situation There is only breakfast room service but many restaurants in the area also deliver  Since you will be in the financial district many of the neighborhood bars and restaurants might be closed  Id really only recommend this location if you know the city well and will not be around the hotel much  
P => Great hotel if location is right for you I stayed at the Gild Hall in tember  while in NYC for a quick break before heading elsewhere int he US on business The hotels great   large rooms clean and good value However the location could be a down side depending what youre visiting NYC for  If youre on business youre right in the heart of things with easy access to Wall Street etc  For leisure its less good  Easy access to Battery Park and the ferries but beyond that youre facing a subway guide to get anywhere   especially weekends when a lot of the shops and eateries in the immediate area are closed  Fulton Street subway station is also hideously complicated Also thought that any hotel charging this much should have free wifi  
P => Great boutique hotel in Downtown NYC My husband and I wanted to spend our th anniversary in downtown NYC  I booked the Gild Hall Hotel based on reviews and the location  It was a great choice Its walking distance to the Seaport the Hudson River walkwaypark and Battery Park  We wanted to do the Ellis Island Tour and also be able to go on long walks so this area was perfect  The hotel is a funky little place with a great staff   very friendly and attentive  I lost a shopping bag at the bar one night and the staff really bent over backwards to help me find it  The even offered to watch the security tape to see if it had been stolen  Ive never encountered people so willing to go beyond their job description The room was a good size   the only strange thing is that the bathroom is walled in with frosted glass blocks so you can see the person on the toilet  Even after  years together thats just too much information  The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of closet space  The only bad thing about this location is the lack of places for a good breakfast on the weekend  Since its a business area a lot of the surrounding shops are closed on the weekend  The diner that the staff directed us to was horrible  I would definitely stay here again  
P => safe and great location Stayed here for  nights before moving mid town  Loved the location as it was perfect for exploring this part of NY and felt very safe at all times of the day and night  the hotel was very comfortable but like other reviewers did not like the bathroom door   very inappropriate  Didnt find the hotel staff particularly friendly in fact we felt as though we were just about tolerated  They just answered our questions as briefly as possible and never offered any advice or additional information  On the plus side we never heard any noise from outside our room and the bed was extremely comfortable with excellent bedding  There was no iron in the room but we asked for one and it arrived straight away  All in all a good choice of hotel but didnt want to spend time in the lobby as we felt this was quite depressing with no atmosphere  
P => Nice hotel shame about the room keys Staff were friendly and the room was comfortable and nicely furnished but would suggest to them to get rid of the shabby tartan throw rug on the bed   awful  Good location to Southport restaurants and shops and located just near Wall Street  We had good and inexpensive breakfast at nearby Zeytuna each morning yogurt fruit good coffee or cooked breakfast if you want  Big problem with this hotel is that the room keys need to be re set constantly same happened for our friends who also had a room there  Given we were there for four nights this was a little tiresome  Hotel bar and reception area has nice atmosphere  
P => One of the BEST Stayed here in e  worst weather ever for new york but this hotel was fantastic  Bit difficult to find but once found fantastic Subways literally around the corner as is Wall Street having been going to new york every year for  years and this is the first time that I have made it to this area  I found it amazing there is even a Tiffany store Trump Hotel but not the same as looking at them in th Ave Going go get the only real negative out of the way  BATHROOM   OMG   Four girls in the one bedroom four crazy irish shoppers into the mix and a bathroom that you can see right into  Feel sorry for the person who is on the right hand side of the bed your nose is literally squeezed into the glass and boy there is nothing left to the imagination here Immediate call down to house keeping to tried to do something with a double bed sheet and thumb tacks which kept falling each time some one entered the bathroom but we had to put up with it   Why on earth cant they just put something on to the glass like a perspex al or something   It really is unacceptable Front desk where always very friendly the bell hops at the front door where in a league of their own  On the last day they could not have been better  One of the guys went round the block until he got us a taxi van rather than pay for  cabs to take us all plus numerous bags to airport Weekends this place really does go to sleep but come monday morning it is bouncing  On arrival we all received complimentary vouchers for drinks which we forgot about  Didnt eat here but used one of the carts just across street which was gorgeous  Room service was fantastic loads and loads of snow white crisp clean towels shower really powerful and any amount of hot water  Mini bar in room which we emptied to store our own drinks which was a pity The bedroom was big enough for four would love to stay again at xmas but the prices are crazy so if anyone has any good low cost hotels they can recommend please do so  
P => Gild Hall is right golden  Everytime we go to New York we like to stay in a different neighborhood  This time we picked Financial District so Gild Hall of the Thompson Hotel group was the best choice for us  We were quite happy with the place despite being a tiny bit worried about the mixed reviews  The or is a unique mix of old boy British club meets Zen simplicity  There were lots of quirky touches such as a rhino footrest in the lobby and antler chandeliers  Loads of cushy leather sofas to chill  If the names Wes Anderson and Vivian Westwood mean anything to you you will appreciate the look and feel of this place  The room A plaid throw on the bed which has a huge leather headboard contrasts nicely with clean unorated walls  The dark blue industrial grade carpet in the room however was jarring against the sumptuous and simple details of the room  Having stayed in a number of NYC hotels I have to say the room size was pretty generous  Toiletries were spare but nice from C O  Bigelows  No shower cap or other little extras just lotion shampoo conditioner bar soap  Oh and no wi fi and they charge  clams for internet  WahThe front desk and service were lovely the bar was fun and attracted what seemed like locals and regulars mixing with out of towners  The restaurant Libertine was closed for summer so I cannot comment on that  But there are tons of bars and restaurants nearby in every direction  Dont be misled by those who say theres nothing down in the Financial District  We found good pizza old skool diners and more  The streets are labyrinthine so its not as easy to naviagate as the gridded parts of NYC  Subways are nearby  Overall this hip cozy lodge was a pleasant surprise  
P => Perfect Location to S  Street SeaportFinancial District OK I did have concerns about staying at this hotel since I am a female traveling alone on business  My company wanted me to stay at an affordable hotel within walking distance to the financial district  So at night this was it  I had a hard time finding it since it is on a side street but I was able to find it  It is Art o or and a small boutique hotel so there will not be a lavish lobby but there is someone at the front desk  The staff was very very nice and made me feel comfortable  I was able to walk to South Street Seaport by myself and no problems at all  I was able to shop drink and eat  Fun  One of the days I went to a spa to get a massage in the neighborhood one of the days  And most of all I found some really great places to eatshop   Century  the best store on the planet   within walking distance about  blocks Crumbs bakery near wall street   Double YUM and Adriennes Pizza Bar on Stone Street for the best pizza  It is completely safe  Back to the hotel the room is very small the halls are small too  The bathroom doors are dusted class  I wouldnt recommend a family or a couple at least not the room I was in  Oh they do have condoms in the room too  Just in case if you meet someone along the way     They also have a library on the nd floorlounge too  I had a great time  Oh one more thing I am also a travel agent and I would recommend this hotel for single travelers or business  Fun and safe and bit of real New York City 
P => Great Location I stayed here in a room with too big and comfortable doublebeds with three friends for nightperson The only negative thing about the whole stay for our kind of trip is the fact that room and baathroom are only divided only by a thin pane of frosted glass  That carried no weight since all the rest was positive  The location is unbeatable in my eyes  Starbucks Superket with all the freshly prepared foods you can imagine pharmacies and several bars and diners around the corner  The latter ones have food and drinkss at reasonable prices and appear NOT to be typically tourist places but places for the people working there  We enjoyed those place much more than places in midtown where we stayed later  The liveliness on the streets from early in the morning till the late afternoon also seems to be much more that of the quotreal New Yorkquot than the life in many other places we have seen  Also are both the       J A C E M Q R W and Z   trains in  minute walking distance and take you to basically the whole city including Midtown upperlower West Eastside the nice parts of Brooklyn you might want to change to a northbound G    the Bronx and Queens Its a short walk to Ground Zero Century the port and lots of other places of interest   Both the room bathroom lobby bar and the rest of the hotel were clean at any given time  The staff was friendly professional and unobtrusive   The room was not huge but there was enough place for all our stuff on the floor in the dresser and the closet  It included a bigscreen tv an ipod dockingstation a safe a minibar an icemachine on the fourth and th floor a silent and powerfull ac and a nice bathtub  The interior is classy with leather and dark woods as seen on the pictures provided by tripadvisor  Also the rest of the Hotel has an elegant appearence   All in all our stay at Gild Hall was near perfect and not only better than our stays at quotSwiss quot quotthe Edison Hotelquot and quotthe Portland Square Hotelquot but also better than the stay at the th floor in the quotWaldorf towersquot where the TV didnt work and where we had to open the main door by ourselves unlike at Gild Hall  
P => a pleasant stay Stayed here for four nights in y From the moment I checked in staff were extremely friendly and very happy to answer any questions I had regarding travel and anything else to do with the hotel The hotel has a lovely or which has a quottrendyquot feel to it  The restaurant looked a little pricey and was pitched as quotenglish gastroquot being and Englishman myself I steered away from it but from what I could see the food looked pretty good To be honest in this location you have thousands of choice of places to eat so eating in the hotel would be a silly idea anyway go exploreThe business centre was pretty useful containing a few shared PCs and a networked HP printer which I used to print directly to from my laptop The rooms are fully equiped with LCD TV minibar bathrobes wardrobe and small desk Other people have mentioned the rooms are a little small I would agree if we were comparing against other outer city US hotels but the rooms were pretty much the standard size you get in any European hotels and inner city hotels  AC in the rooms was great and even with the lovely duck down covers in summer I slept like a baby The hotel is very close to Fulton street subway which is  fantastic  as its on stacks of subway lines you can get anywhere in manhatten very very quickly  Its quite easy to get lost in the maze of streets around the hotel but this is downtown in the financial district what do you expect with a good map you can find it perfectly The bathroom was great very clean and bright and a powerful over bath shower and fully stocked with the usual hotel condiments  Other reviewers have complained about the transparent material used between the bathroom and the room it is in fact shaded so you cant see through it at all apart from the odd shadow and wouldnt be a problem for people sharing a twin room My only complaints were  day for wireless at a top end hotel pitched towards business this was totally unacceptable even smaller low end hotels have free wifi these days   Wardrobe space was OK but no drawer space at all for longer stays a few drawers to store clothes would have been required with two people in the room we struggled Otherwise I would highly recommend this hotel for business since its a few blocks from wall street use or for tourists since its perfectly connected a short walk from the downtown sites and a  minute subway ride from the rest of the city  
P => Friendly Service Saves the Day Like the other review here I too stayed at the Gild Hall on the nightmorning of the atrocious fire alarm  The difference is that I was approached at reception and an immediate rekably sincere apology was extended  Although I was in a hurry to catch a flight the front desk did all they could to mend the wounds of being awoken at such a ridiculous hour I am from the west coast and had logged a mere  hours of sleep  Throughout my stay I found the front desk to be warm friendly funny amp helpful especially Kelli  At this price point I would call the Gild Hall a good value  
P => cool hotel tucked away between seaport and tribecca destinations Stayed here over the y th  very cool hotel nice common areas very friendly staff great access to much of tribecca and the seaport  Its nice to be able to remove your self a bit from the midtown crowds on a weekend such as the fourth and still be so close to so much  
P => Good but not great  Likes Location just a few block from the Fulton Street Metro station and the South Street Seaport  Superior room was ent sized for NYC  Nice LCD TV in room  Nice design throughout Dislikes day charge for WiFi WTF   after paying night for the room  Glass bathroom door   who really wants to see their companion sitting on the john anyway Only cover for the bed in the heat of summer was a thick down filled comforter   we had to turn the thermostat down to  degrees and run it all night to keep from roasting  A simple top sheet or thin blanket would have been nice  
P => The Best Excellent in every way  Location price staff room etc     perfect  You cannot go wrong with this hotel  It is a gem  
P => Gild Hall is very nicely orated in the common areas good location I rarely stay downtown    generally in midtown instead  Gild Hall has very nice common areas that are warm and old school feeling in a trendy way  good experience  If I needed to stay downtown again I would definitely consider again  
P => Great service great atmosphere great hotel My boyfriend and I were visiting NYC just for the night to see some friends and ided to get a hotel instead of crashing on someones couch  Someone recommended Gild Hall and we booked it  The whole stay was great  The front desk staff was friendly and efficient when we checked in and gave us  free drink tickets for the Libertine Bar in the hotel  When we went to the bar before dinner we had great service again  We ordered the crab cake and when a mix up in the kitchen caused it to come out somewhat late we got another free round of drinks unsolicited we werent in any rush  The or was very cool   quotmodern hunting lodge chicquot if I had to define it  The room was comfortable spacious and clean  The automatic light on the mini bar was a sleek feature although some wires must have been crossed in our room because it turned on and off on its own all night  My only complaint with the room was the very strange design feature of a frosted glass bathroom  You could see right in from the outside The hotel isnt in a  great  area of the city as far as Things To Do goes but it was very quiet and cabs are easy to find  I would definitely recommend a stay at Gild Hall  
P => The Gild Hall made my first trip to New York a delight The staff is excellent   very helpful  courteous and go out of their way to ensure that their guests have what they need  The room was a pleasant surprise in size accommodating  wormen with plenty of suitcasesmakeup bags and snacks  The only drawback is as mentioned in previous posts the glass wall for the bathroom is not everyones cup of tea  If they would block out the middle section it would help but when the bathroom light was turned on in the early morning it was tough for those who wished to sleep in  We are adaptable so it didnt bug us too much because the rest of the room made up for it  The restaurant for dinner was delicious and the staff there were great The location is perfect for catching the subway getting coffee at Starbucks food nearby at the Deli and walking to South Seaport for a meal  We will be coming back to this hotel when we make a return trip to NY  I was apprehensive about the trip and check trip advisor before I ever book a hotel so I thought it only fair to give my feedback and say I was not disappointed in my choice  
P => Nice Stay We stayed at the Gild Hall on  th for our th anniversary  I got the night as part of a package with dinner through Skyauciton com  While we live in Brooklyn we rarely spend time in that part of Manhattan so it was a nice experience  We felt like tourists for a night  The rooms were nice and chic reminded me of the W Hotels  Beds were comfortable and the location is ok but more geared for weekdays as evenings and weekends are pretty dead in the financial district  Having said that there seem to be some pretty good rates by New York standards for the hotel on weekends and you can walk to South Street Seaport Liberty Park etc  By the way there is a great little specialty grocery storerestaurant called Zaytunas very close to the hotel  During lunch time the basement of the store is a cafeteria type deli with lots of great MedditeraneanMiddle Eastern kabobs salads pizzas etc  
P => Nice at st glance but actually a very poor hotel We were excited to stay in a boutique hotel by the Thomson Hotel company and severely disappointed by this overpriced hotel that is not properly maintained  I am a frequent traveller amp stay at riott whenever possible  Most important to me is a convenient hotel with clean rooms that are functional  My st complaint with this hotel is the bar in the lobby that is not cleaned properly  If you arrive at pm pm pm or am it smelled of beer and cocktails as though they were spilled on the floor But the real quottreatquot is in the rooms  The room was incredibly small be a little over  sq ft and yet it featured a king bed  There was very little room to store luggage and get around the room  Then there was this misguided notion of a glass wall for the bathroom facing the room actually it was pretty much in the room     you could exactly see the person in the bathroom amp the toilet was right next to the glass wall that was pleasant  Also the rooms and halls were in need of refurbishment Given the location and price we expected far more  We stayed at the Sofitel for the last few days of our trip in New York and had no complaints     Gild Hall is very very mediocre and not worth the money  
P => Good business hotel Good business hotel   great location in Manhattan quiet yet at the centre of things Rooms are small ish but not at all uncomfortable  Room has fairly good facilities   mini bar internet to pay for toiletries etc Would be good if they can shove in a reading chair or sofa     a single seater  Also a coffee maker is sorely missedOtherwise a very pleasant place  Staff are polite and professional  Hotel has mini gym on each floor for the so inclined  
P => Cute Boutique Hotel in Manhattan with service to make you smile We only stayed at GildHall for two nights whilst passing through Manhattan but really felt involved and appreciated  The manager and concierge went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and to ensure we had a brilliant time in New York  The room was large and very well appointed and with Kiehls products  It is a little out of the way but we like that its only a short taxi drive from midtown and Soho and as it is so close to Brookyn bridge its great for an evening stroll  All in all this is the best hotel Ive stayed in for a long time 
P => Excellent hotel What a superb hotel  Comfort was excellent rooms super clean and cosy Everything was perfect  Staff is really nice and helpfull Large and comfortable bed Cookies ice at arrival newspaper offered every morning SUPER QUITE Breakfast was just ok and weve been charged the Espresso we asked for everyday Infos   iPod amp iPhone dock in all rooms charge and listen music  a great METRO stations at  min walk  Fulton st   min walk from Ground Zero  Century  perfect for low price shopping  Safety box   min walk from the brooklyn bridgeWARNING  be aware that Lower Manatthan is a BUSINESS DISTRICT  It means its crawded on weekdays and dead on weekends  Nothing particular to do at night If its your first time in NYC consider booking an hotel in Midtown East or West  
P => Nice Hotel with Funky Designer Vibe We were looking for a  star hotel to join our friends in the Financial District of Manhattan so we went on Priceline and got this little gem for a great price night  We had looked it up on the internet and were delighted to see a hotel with a distinct designer vibe  Its as if the Scottish designer duo Collin and Justin went crazy and orated the entire hotelUpon our arrival the staff was courteous and suggested an excellent Italian restaurant nearby Giardino DOro  Although on the smaller side our room   was beautiful with a large comfortable bed with exquisite Egyptian cotton sheets Frette  The large LCD tv made my boyfriend very happy  Its a smaller but very cozy and extremely beautiful hotel  I would suggest going there if you like boutique hotels  
P => Great stay    again I have stayed at several Thompsons in New York and have never been disappointed  While the Gild does not have the SohoLESTribeca address the quiet neighborhood can be welcoming during the weekends  More importantly the staff remains on its toes  During our stay the service was nothing short of excellent  Everyone went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay in NYC  
P => We liked the Hipster Hunting Lodge Gild Hall was the first Priceline hotel we ever stayed at so we were delighted to have gotten this upscale funky hotel for only  a night  The or is a very distinctive hybrid of chic and rustic    to this day we call it the Hipster Hunting Lodge  Well be happy if our Priceline bid lands us there again The staff was very courteous and housekeeping was thorough  There were nice little perks like the tasty Fat Witch brownies waiting for us and the overhead lighting fixture that appeared to be made out of a cast iron wagon wheel  The bed was huge and comfortable  Staying in the Financial District is more interesting than youd think  There was a branch of The Strand Bookstore right around the corner and plenty of places to eat  By day its bustling but at night its so quiet that youd think you were in the suburbs  Its perfect for travelers who arent into night clubbing and partying The room was lovely but beware the rooms with glass bathroom doors I loathe this trend in interior orating which seems to be trying to imply that sharing all at potty time is somehow sexy  The glass was frosted but the toilet is right up next to it and you can see everything  My partner and I adore each other but we dont go to this level of personal exposure  I dont know if they have some rooms with normal bathroom doors but you should ask if this is a problem for you I wish we had Other than that we enjoyed the hotel very much and everything worked as it should  
P => Amazing and Comfortable Great staff loved the location amp staff Only  minutes away from Century  and the TKTS at theSeaport location We found this hotel on Priceline for a great price  
P => Slightly odd location downtown but nice boutique hotel My stay did not start off well as my cab driver hit construction at the end of the block and told me Id need to walk the last block and a half to the hotel but once I arrived it was a good experience Room size varies   mine was smallish while a colleague was pleased with the size of his room  Ask for a larger room  The vibe is very boutiquey and Id say a bit on the masculine side  My room had a huge brown leather upholstered headboard and a plaid throw blanket  I cant be sure but the sheets  well have been Frette they were very high quality as were the Kiehls toiletries in generous sample sizes There is a nice bar in the Lobby with a library vibe which kes for a good after work stop  
P => Cozy modern beautiful    I loved it  We stayed for only one night alas on a quick trip to New York  My son who lives in the west village warned me about staying in the financial district calling it quotdesolate on the weekendquot  I didnt find that to be true at all  Sure its not Times Square on a Saturday night but I hate that  Lots of people were about sightseeing     with the ferries Ground Zero Southstreet Seaport and residents out walking dogs and shopping for groceries  We picked the Gild Hall as we got a good rate on Expedia and it looked lovely  And it was  When we checked in early they explained that the king room we had booked wasnt ready yet but for  bucks more we could have a suite  I hesitated and the clerk said  quotIts a great suite that normally rents for  more a nightquot     so we said Sure Am I glad we did    it was a seriously fab sweet suite    the design in this place Todd English is amazing two big wall flatscreens   both with HD   I wanted to have a party in there it was so cool   gorgeous ble bathroom with Kiehls toiletries  In the words of Tina Fey of  Rock   quotI want to go to there quot Subway entrance a couple of blocks away great pastries and coffee at Financier Pastry also closeby and an amazing gourmet grocery store Zey Tuna again a couple of blocks away  One angst moment    you have to pay for wireless internet  Come on Gild Hall Was my  bucks worth it 
P => Great hotel in a great location We stayed for a week in the Gild Hotel and couldnt fault it  From the welcome cookies to the lovely Kiehls toiletries they made our stay so enjoyable  We have an  year old and an  year old and were slightly worried beforehand that a boutique hotel would be be not quite the right atmosphere for them but we couldnt have been more wrong  Would definitely stay there again  
P => Unique and botique  Excellent hotel  Gild Hall is a modern and funky boutique hotel right in the middle of the financial district  We stayed for a weekend and enjoyed the property overall  We loved the or   which we ided was modern mixed with elements of s s EuropeNorway  The hotel staff were both friendly and attentive during our stay  Standard rooms are small ish but are very well laid out with all the modern amenities youd expect to find  The bed and bedding were excellent soft and comfy   per  hours for Internet access wasnt a big deal to us  Like all big cities theres some street noise  For future improvements Id suggest that Gild Hall go for sound proof windows overall but once the bankers go home for the day it wasnt really an issue  Speaking of location this property is located in the Financial District so theres not much going on after  p m  If you expect to step out the door and be in the quotmiddle of it allquot probably not the right property for you  However Gild Hall is only a two minute walk from a major subway hub Fulton St  where you can pick up the red  lines and green  lines meaning you can get ANYWHERE in New York from this point  Were subway friendly people so this ended up being a real plus for us  The price for the room was excellent and the location worked as well  One thing to consider Theres major roadwork being done in the entire district so getting to the hotel by cab was a challenge since many streets were closed off  The entrance is on Platt St  and after we circled around in the cab a few times we just got out and walked a  block to the hotel entrance  Not a big deal just something to keep in mind Overall Nice stay very enjoyable  
P => Excellent hotel in the heart of Wall Street Theres a lot to like about Gild Hall its a great hotel in the middle of the Wall St  area  Rooms are ently sized clean and modern  Cordless telephone internet access at a modest fee of day and flat screen TVs were all amenities My one complaint would be the desk  not a lot of room to sit down and work  The TV hovers above your head The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean  Kiehls toiletries are a nice touch The location is very good if youre planning on spending most of your time downtown a little less desireable if youre going to be spending time midtown though subway access is just a block away and can get you to midtown fairly quickly  The restaurant in the hotel was very nice though the music in the pub is a bit on the loud sound making conversation a little tough Overall Id highly recommend Gild Hall  
P => Good but some disappointments The bed linens and cleanliness were all great  The opaque door to bathroom would be odd for most people But they lied about the parking straight up  We were told that it was  for the st  hours but if we stayed on after that it was an hourly rate  Well a few hours late for the st  we were charged a full  hour rate And they pay to park it but you kinda have to let them park it so you are stuck wthat extra quotvaletquot charge  That parking thing is just wrong Also whats up wcharging  per person for the quotbottomlessquot cup of coffe in the morning Most hotels even excellent ones give you free cooffee Id stay there again but Id scope out parking elsewhere or take the train in and go next door to Starbucks for my coffee Also the brunch menu is outrageously expensive and there are great breakfast places in all directions  or  blocks away  Much much cheaper  Still the staff was nice  Loved Alex the bartender  
P => What a Gem We stayed at Gild Hall while looking for apartments in the financial district  The staff was very friendly helpful and educated in hotel service  Our room     I suggest that room because it is a King Premium and it has more space   nice shower was quiet and well appointed  The bed and sheets were perfection Better than any Ritz or Four Seasons that we have ever stayed in  I love that they offer Kiehls products in the room I am a designer and quite picky so I had concerns about the noise etc  We did hear the trash trucks but at night around  so no problem  The restaurant Liberteen is nothing to write home about in terms of food quality but the bar is charming We had a great time there We did a tour of all of the room types for future reference because we plan to put our family there when they come to visit  I suggest asking for the rooms with the higher ceilings because it makes all the difference We felt the price of  for a premium room we negotiated that at the front desk when we went in to check out the place was beyond a great deal I have to say I did not like the charge for internet why do hotels do this but as I said we got such a low rate for the room that I did not linger on this negative aspect  It is true that car services need to be told to come to the Platt entrance because that caused a delay for us in getting to the airport  The gym needs to be redesigned and given more importance in my opinion  But overall it is a great find 
P => Great Value Very pleasant hotel  Booked a superior King for  directly from website how can you beat that  Incredible value for a nice sized very clean room with a  inch lcd tv  Nice looking hotel from the lobby to the rooms  Its not spectacular but its the best hotel for the price in all of downtownprob all of NYC bar none  Plenty of street parking if your stay is on weekend  Staff is friendly and professional  One gripe bar in lobby closes earlier than stated  If youre looking for the most bang for the buck on the weekend and only a  cab ride to SOHO this is it  Better than Club Quarters Wall Street Inn and Eurostars   kets  block away and  blocks to Broadway where you can grab subway  
P => Price was right   clean rooms nd year taking the wife to a Broadway show  Last year we stayed at the Millennium Hilton right next to ground zero   which was nice very expensive and we had been warned about the  hr  construction noise  Went searching for a hotel this year and based on its reviews alone I booked Gild Hall and Im glad I did  Lets put it this way  nights here cost me slightly more than  night at the Millennium last year  The bartender on Friday night informed us that it had been converted from a Holiday Inn about a year ago to a Thompson hotel  Rooms were cozy modern clean and comfortable  Good water pressure in the shower and a nice flat screen on the wall of the room  Really what more can you ask for Cabbies had a hard time finding it coming back   theres a lot of construction in that area and even though the hotel is  Gold Street one has to enter at Platt   blocks from the Subway well be back for sure  
P => Modern style attentive staff Stayed at Gild Hall for  nights in   on a girls weekend in NYC with my mother and would definitely return  Id describe Gild Hall as trendy without pretense  The or is reminiscent of a lodge   lots of dark leather and wood panelling but its delivered in a very modern way  The lobby is cozy and inviting with chess checkers and books and it adjoins a Todd English barrestaurant had lunch there   small but good menu The room was clean modern and fairly spacious by New York standards  Kiehls soaps and shampoos in the bathroom   other quotamenitiesquot in the mini bar not suitable for a motherdhter getaway but provided a good lh  The hotel was very quiet  Theres not a lot of street noise like youd find in a Midtown hotel  While thats one advantage of the location some might find it far removed from main attractions in the city and taxi fares uptown can add up  And the area is pretty much deserted on the weekends  If youre not too familiar with NYC and even if you are navigating the Financial District can be confusing  Personally I dont mind the location  Its only a few blocks from the subway and you can often find good deals in the Financial District  So for my next trip to NYC Ill definitely look first at Gild Hall 
P => Beautiful Boutique Hotel in Downtown My boyfriend and I stayed here after spending  nights up in the Theater District at the Sheraton Towers  The two hotels were night and day  I was exhausted and cold from the previous  nights in Times Square weather was in the low s  The room was small but had very nice finishes  The bedding was super soft and the bed itself was very comfortable  The bathroom and wet bar had everything we needed including Kiehls shampoo and conditioner and an adult quotpleasure packagequot which I had never seen offered in a hotel room  The room also had a flat screen TV  The only downside is the location sort of in an alley like street  There arent many great restaurants within short walking distance so we always took the subway to Chelsea to eat  We didnt eat in the restaurant located in the hotel but it looked like people were enjoying it  Upon leaving we checked our bags since our flight back to Seattle wasnt until   The front desk staff was more than helpful accomodating us  
P => Wonderful Romantic Getaway I had originally planned on staying in another hotel   but with the lining dollar and the financial crisis the Gild Hall slipped into my Eurobasedbudget  I stayed there with my wife a few days before Christmas for her Birthday We were warmly received on the evening of our arrival and after a speedy check in shown into our large and nice room the guest pictures shown here well reflect what the rooms look like The cake I had ordered via e mail was duly delivered on the birthday next morning together with a nice breakfast  Because we couldnt eat the whole cake it was stored for us and taken out on our request we were even served a complimentary hot chocolate one afternoon   the cake was too huge to be eaten up completely   and delicious  Except on this one occasion we never had breakfast here as we were always up and rushed early in the morning for siteseeing  The place appears to fill up as a bar in the evenings although we never made it   always being to exhausted from a day out The location is absolutely no problem   it does get quiet in the evenings which is great for light sleepers like myself but access to nearly everywhere is excellent with well connected subway stations within a few minutes The hotel also offers a gym not seen or tested and a small internet room with free and fast internet terminals The the last day there was a pipe burst which put one of the elevators out of service and flooded the nd floor bar and lobby   put it was professionally handled and elevators were back in service fairly quickly   it was an exciting little quotadventurequot while staying there All in all service is excellent friendly and very personal and for under USD a night the value for money was great Thanks to the Gild Hall team for making our stay my wifes first to New York so pleasant  
P => Good hotel for the price My husband and I stayed at this hotel during the Christmas period for  nights  I was impressed with the size of the room given we were in NYC afterall and only paid USD  per night  I was initially concern with the location as it is in the financial district instead of the more usual tourist hotel locations like uptownmidtowntime square  However the hotel is very close to Fulton station which was very convenient to get to most tourist hot spots  Also the fact that it is in the financial district i e  quieter area at night was in fact a blessing in disguise especially after spedning the day in busy Manhattan Hotel service was friendly  The cookies that we received at the start and end of our stay was an added bonus In sumy I would recommend this hote for those who like a little quiet time at the end of the day and if you are able to get a good price for it  
P => Romantic Evening I stayed with my boyfriend at Gild Hall for a romantic little getaway and we had the most wonderful evening  Our room could not have been more comfortable or stylish yet the fittings seemed more classic than anything  The service was great the employees were friendly and helpful and the food at the restaurant was absolutely delicious I highly recommend the lobster sliders    I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone looking to spend a perfect quiet night in NYC  
P => Fantastic base for people who know NY We stayed at Gild Hall for  nights and really enjoyed it  We got a really good deal through priceline and it was completely worth it  We have also stayed at  Columbus and preferred Gild Hall  Our room was small but fine   this is NY so to be expectedWe have lived in NYC and so know it very well  For this reason we knew where we wanted to go and it was very easy for us to plan how to get around  However for people who want to be more in the middle of things it might not be as suitable The concierge was fabulous and all the staff were so friendly  When we were there the restaurant wasnt finished so they just had pastries and coffee so i dont know what the situation is now All in all it has always been very difficult to find affordable places for friends and family who came to visit us but if you can find a good deal on this place it is definitely worth it  
P => Helpful and Friendly in NY This hotel is an exceptional find in downtown New York  The hotel has a relaxing atmosphere after a day in the city  We stayed there Saturday to Monday the neighborhood is quite at the weekend as it is in the financial district pubs and restaurants are walking distance away and easy access to the Subway   The bedrooms are very comfortable large flat screen TV mini bar and modern furniture all add to the experience  The staff at the hotel are very helpful the concierge was a great help  thanks Damian TIP The taxi to JFK can take up to mins allow plenty time to check in 
P => Excellent hotel My wife and I stayed at the Gild Hall from st   to th    to celebrate my wifes birthday  We found the hotel to be stylish comfortable and would not hesitate in recommending it We loved the hotels boutique style and ambiance The staff were extremely friendly and helpful  We arrived early prior to our room being ready  However this wasnt a problem and they stored our bags securely to allow us a couple of hours to explore the immediate area  The Gild Hall is located in the Financial District and is only about a  min walk from Wall Street Ground Zero Clinton Castle the launch for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Battery Park and the Brooklyn Bridge  There are plenty of subway stations nearby and Time Square is only about a  min ride  We found the location to be perfect the financial district is more sedate if New York is ever sedate than Time Square etc so this allowed us the best of both worlds In my opinion the rooms at the Gild Hall were clean stylish and the large bed was extremely comfortable  Perfect after a long day of sight seeing  We really could not fault the standards  My only slight criticism would be the noisy air conditioning system however once I worked out how to turn it off this was no longer a problem we were there in ember Overall we found the hotels standards and location to be perfect  I would definitely stay here again and would not hesitate in recommending the Gild Hall to other travellers  
P => Nice rooms hollow doors noisy hallways I stayed at the Gild Hall Hotel for three weekend nights and while the room was clean comfortable and stylish it was difficult to get a solid nights sleep due to the noise coming from other guests hallway conversations and doors slamming in the wee hours Otherwise the staff was friendly and the service was fine  I didnt hear anything through the walls or the floors and street noise was minimal since the hotel is really on an alley size street  The window was double pane and blocked street noise well Superket drugstore and a Financier cafe a few blocks away for morning espresso and french pastries was handy  
P => Holiday Inn or still haunts Gild Hall The only downside of Gild Hall is that the rooms still feel too close to a Holiday Inn  The or has been switched out and the red accents are modern but the layout is still basically the same  This is not exactly what I expected from a Thompson hotel  The staff is stylish and attentive  The bar is inviting  The valet parking is convenient  
P => Recommended We enjoyed a  night stay Fri Wed and found this hotel to be excellent   we were upgraded we were told and had a large room with plenty of space around the bed and the furnishing and or was modern and fresh  The ipod dock and wireless internet was appreciated The frosted glass wall to the wcbathroom might be a bit more than some appreciate and of course putting the bathroom light on at night illuminates the room but we thought it rather funky The staff were all very helpful and welcoming The reception area amp downstairs bar very pleasant there is an excellent upstairs bar area above reception giving a club type environment  We didnt use the in house restaurant choosing instead to eat out at different venues around the area and beyond but probably missed a trick there the restaurant looked very pleasant The price of a couple of beers at the bar slightly shocked us and put us off from having more drinks there but we are probably out of touch with NY bar pricesGood bed turn down service with complimentary brownies and fancy Norwegian water is there no spring water closer to NY than Scandanavia The hotel is well located for public transport which we used extensively  We did find that the room on th floor was a little dark in terms of daylight but that is a function of being surrounded by tall buildings on a fairly narrow lane Platt St  Only other slight criticism was that there are only two lifts for residents and staff and waiting for a lift could take a few minutes on occasion  Not a significant issue with stairs available from th floor though We booked through Quikbook com   excellent service amp value cheaper than offered direct  
P => i   rhinos My husband and I stayed at Gild Hall for  nights in ober and were really happy with our selection  The price was great for New York at around  per nightThe hotel is out of the way   for those who consider Times Square  the way  but for us it was wonderful  Situated close to several subway stations and the financial district we found the area safe and full of amenities The staff was amazing   helpful and friendly  They happily held our luggage as we arrived way before check in time  We found the hotel very unpretentious which was appreciated Also appreciated   the interiors  The restaurant lobby library corridors and rooms were all lovely  The hotel has a traditional Englishequestrian feel with lots of wood panelling and rich colours but is kept contemporary with the additions of antler chandeliers and a small leather rhino in the lobby Our room was large the bed was extraordinarily comfortable   the linens were amazing   aided by the turndown service with brownieThe bathroom was lovely   although as noted by others   you need to be intimate with whomever you are sharing the room with because the door is a glasspanel   which does obscure the user but still   Loved the kiehls toiletries ipod docking station and the free WiFi   all bonuses for us Overall   a great find  
P => Great Customer Service Room Location     I booked the Gild Hall Hotel through a special on Quikbook and got a great rate for a Saturday night in tember   The hotel has recently gone through a refurbishment and the whole place is fun stylish clean and comfortable  As everyone else has stated The hotel is not easy for cab drivers to locate  I had the address the Platt St  and Gold St  information and all cab drivers still had a tough time locating the hotel  Perhaps the Gild Hall website could include printable directions from airports and train stations in addition to the address  I think this would solve some of the problems we and others have had locating this fine hotel  We were able to store our luggage upon our early arrival  The doorman concierge and front desk employees were professional and pleasant to deal with  We quickly got walking directions to the Brooklyn Bridge and after giving them a cell phone number to reach us when the room was ready we enjoyed our day  The hotel is close to South Street Seaport Wall St  and the Financial District  Its close to subway stations as well  not too far from the Fulton St  station The room was ready about   This is a really nice place  Good storage in the room everything is new and I do appreciate the duvet cover rather than a bedspread  Room was a good size again very clean and stylish  orchids is water glass vases trendy glass bathroom tiles muted shades of everything thick wooden blinds leather headboard stocked mini bar and hangers that actually come off the rod and lovely toiletries and  robes  The glass door to the bathroom is so patterned and the quottoilet sidequot of the glass wall is frosted that there was enough privacy for my husband and me  Might be uncomfortable though if youre not there with your partner We enjoyed the lobby bar good selection of Champagne and vodka  The lobby is designed to invoke the atmosphere of a British mens club but we thought it looked like an Argentinian mens club because of the hides on the floor  Anyway its fun without being silly  We didnt eat in the new Todd English restaurant in the hotel but we should have  The Libertine serves  meals a day we passed up their brunch offerings for a miserable experience at the Gold St  restaurant just down the street from the hotel  The concierge confirmed our dinner reservation made suggestions for the next days lunch and was available attentive approachable and professional  Doormen will get cabs for you not just quothailquot them they actually go around the corner to secure a cab and ride it back to the hotel for guests  Their sister hotel  Columbus stored our luggage on Sunday while we explored that part of the city  Again really great customer service at both properties and wed stay here again  
P => Nice clean and large rooms I definitely agree with the comment below  The hotel rooms are large and comfortable  The bathroom does have a transparant door but I do not agree that you would see everything trough it  I had the same experience with the pastries and coffee in the morning  By  I couldnt get any tea  With regard to the location there is not much going on in the night but all subwaylines stop very near the hotel including the expresses and overnight lines  And the fact that there is not much fuzz means that it is also a quiet place which appeals to me after going out all day and night I would recomend this hotel allthough it is worthwile to compare the rates of different websites  You could have a real good deal here 
P => Interesting remodel and attentive staff I stayed for five nights with my college aged dhter in late ust  early tember at Gild Hall  Having stayed there many times when it was a Holiday Inn and once when they were in transition last ember I was not quite sure what to expect  I found that the staff was very friendly and helpful  The room was clean the bed comfortable and the pillows were nice  The wi fi and flat screen television were an improvement from the previous set up  Things that could be improved on are the see through bathroom door is truly see through and I as well as most people like some privacy in that room the designer benches that flank the air conditioning unit are not comfortable and difficult to sit on for a small person a nice chair or so would have worked for me a microwave and mini fridge would have been nice too not the mini bar fridge  Other than that it was an enjoyable stay  We always use a car service to and from the airport but taxis seem more plentiful in front of the hotel than in past years which is a plus  The restaurant at the hotel was not yet open but they did have room service available from another facility that was reasonably priced and delivered in a respectable amount of time  Nice job for the most part on the remodel  Would definitely stay there again  
P => Top Notch Service Looking for a Financial District hotel and stumbled upon this newly opened property  A wonderful experience with extremely attentive staff and personal service  It is an obviously new a reated hotel originally built in the s  The first seven floors have quite high ceilings original property had meeting and conference rooms here and the or is well a little strange but the cleanliness is impeccable  I stayed during a holiday weekend so the QUIET was VERY welcomed and not a common experience in Manhattan  And they actually answer the telephone another rare occurrence in todays era of connectedness Connections to the subway lines is very close by but thanks to MTAs never ending construction and thoughtless entrance closures make it ridiculously difficult to use  Trust me take the taxis that is what MTA really wants you to do For lower Manhattan business this  unit hotel is an excellent choice and seemingly willing to please  
P => Liked it   will be great when complete My husband works in the financial district so for a getaway I booked an overnight here and met him downtown  This hotel is in the general vicinity of South Street Seaport   but beautifully tucked away as others have noted  I booked through a discount site for  a night and prior to this had never heard of this hotel  We were warmly greeted by the staff but noted a lot of construction still in the area of the lobby and we saw some workers about the place and in the elevators in and out  The room we got was very clean and orated in a modernminimalist style  The hallways were brightly painted and had many vintage photos for wall art at least on our floor  We didnt have much of a view   but we didnt stay in our room except to sleep  What we liked about the hotel was that it wasnt tremendously busy even for a Friday night and with the exception of another guest who came in loudly at  AM and couldnt seem to determine which room was theirs complete with a  AM phone call to our room we heard no other guest street or construction noise  The beds were exceptionally comfortable Yes the AC was a little bit noisy but the room was sufficiently kept cool which is whats most important  The only real complaint we had which we brought to the mgt s attention is that the shower fixture in our room had been installed in such a way so that no matter how we turned the knob at best only lukewarm water came out  I like my showers hot so this was unacceptable to me   and this was true even while very hot water was coming out of the sink faucet  The hotel does offer a light continental breakfast in the lobby but if that doesnt suit you there is a diner on Pearl Street not far from the hotel as well as other coffeedonut shops in the general vicinity  This hotel is about a  cab ride from GCT area and a couple of blocks away from the Fulton Street subway  We would definitely stay here again as we dont mind being away from the craziness of Midtown  
P => A Secret We Dont Want to Give Away Gild Hall is a diamond in the rough  We booked on quikbook for  for FriSat  As a former New Yorker back for a weekend I had no idea where Gold St was   save yourself alot of hassle and tell your cabbie  Platt as the address Gold is only about a block long   The hotel is a gem  With a wonderful friendly and helpful staff great rooms   roomy plush CLEAN most important to me in NYC and freshly orated by New York standards  Fantastic extras like Fresh body products Fat Witch brownies at turn down coffee and pastries in the lobby in AM close to Soho LES etc    Really a luxurious little boutique hotel  Cons no room servcice hard to find at first when word gets out prices will soar Also a Todd English barresturant will open soon which will raise the profile of this hotel  We loved it   stay while you can 
P => Great deal Awesome Hotel I booked this hotel through Priceline for  on a Saturday night   and overheard the hotel staff say that the regular room rate was night When I arrived at the hotel the check in staff was very friendly and attentive  My room was awesome very spacious clean and quiet  There was a large flat screen TV on the wall a huge comfortable bed down comforter and pillows and a top notch bathroom ble floors glass tile  The hotel also has a fitness facility and offers free coffee and danishes in the morning  The staff was nice enough to hail a taxi for us and the guy pulled right up to the front door of the hotel  Despite what I read from other reviews the hotel is not difficult to find and the air conditioner is loud but compared to other NYC noise I didnt think it was a big deal  There are some great bars and restaurants nearby as well  Overall this hotel was awesome and our experience was great  
P => Loved It Booked this hotel because of the reviews from trip advisor and I have to say   they were not wrong The hotel is beautifully furnished and very comfortable  For a NY hotel room at night  tax   a steal  Knowing that I would be getting into NY late around midnight I called ahead to let the hotel know a week and a half beforehand  To my surprise I was told that they did not have a reservation under my name  I booked a month in advance It was only until I gave them my confirmation number from expedia com that they found that my name was spelled incorrectly in the system  I had a similar problem as some of the reviewers here  When I actually arrived at check in I was told that I only had reservations for one night at the hotel when I had booked a room for the weekend  The gentleman at the front desk asked for a copy of my reservation and he entered some info in his computer and presto i had a room for the weekend The elevators   which where small and somewhat cramped   my boyfriend and I opened the door to our room  We found two large double beds in a very spacious room   pretty but not the superior king room that I booked  However as soon as I had sat down on the bed to contemplate whether to ask for a room change the phone rang and it was the front desk calling to ask if i was okay with the room  Basically we ended up switching rooms and we stayed on the th floor  Our room was spacious and overall perfect  We found a comfortable bed clean sheets and an amazing bathroom  The Fresh products were excellent and very enjoyable  Just look at the pictures and youll be able to see  The TV had a welcome message with my name on it   which was fun to see  The brownies were delicious and a very nice touch to the door  I have no complaints about the hotel   good location very accessible to the Fulton St train spot and only  min walk to ChinatownSoHo areaLittle Italy  Check out was easy and efficient  Great experience well def go back 
P => Whats all the fuss about Gild Hall was OK   but I dont understand all of the oooohs and ahhhs of my fellow reviewers  Their reviews were the reason I ided to give Gild Hall a try   be my expectations were set to high  So here goes   The room was gorgeous well appointed and utilized for the space provided  Great tall ceilings and nice new furnishings  REALLY nice bathroom with great water pressure  If you ignore the realiy REALLY noisy AC unit and the very strong quotFabreezequot like smell when you entered I guess there could be worse smells in your hotel room the room was really great What I dont understand is all of the great kudos to the staff of Gild Hall  Yes   they always greeted you and smiled and were polite  Yes    they occasionally made small talk and yes they were very pleasant  They also smiled when they told me that I did not have a reservation only to find when presented with a confirmation number that they entered my first name as my last and my last name as my first  They blamed this on Quickbook yet every written communication from Quickbookon this reservation had my names in the right sequence  They also smiled as they told you that your room was not ready even though you were not an early arrival and they didnt bother to see if another similar room might be available  They smile as they hand you a key for a room on the th floor out of  when you asked for a room on a high floor   both on your reservation record and verbally in person  After waiting an unusually long time for the single elevator the baggage guy with the baggage cart that takes up  of the single elevator greets with a sincere smile and quothelloquot as he tries to maneuver the cart to be able to quotsqueeze you inquot  And while I understand their frustration the guests from all of the higher floors get very perterbed when the elevator reaches the sixth floor and you barge in no matter how much room there is because you are not going to wait for it quotagainquotThe quotcontinental breakfastquot is coffee wo any kind of lower fat milk alternative and a tray of mini croussants  If you need something a little more continental there is a great gourmet deli just a few steps up the block on William Street that has a wonderful selection of fresh pastries fruit juice breads and everything else most places offer as a quotcontenental breakfastquot  Now   in fairness   if youre standard is Intercontinental where they also smile but it is because they take pleasure in frustrating you and love to say quotsure cantquot or riott where they just dont notice you at all   then Gild Hall has very good service  But for those of you who think this was great service you should check out ANY Kimpton property    Park Ave  or The Muse in NY    and THEN you will experience outstanding service  OK   Kimpton has spoiled me    but the way I think about it if Kimpton can do it why cant everyone elseDont get me wrong   Gild Hall is a nice place and given the price I paid via Quickbook it was a really good deal  Id possibly even stay there again at that price   but dont go for more than   for this place   youll be able to do better  The service is quotpleasantquot   but not necessarily quotgoodquot  be I was just really bothered by the fact that I got ONE tiny Brownie left on my night table when other reviewers got TWO      
P => Gild Hall Gold st  New York Having stayed in various hotels in Manhattan over the years Gild Hall is by far the best  From check in to check out the staff work hard towards making your experiance of New York very memorable for all of the right reasons A little out of the way it  be but there are plently of places to see from this Wall St location Try the Cuban restaurant at the Seaport or go shopping at A amp F the only one in Manhattan both are  minutes walk away The bar amp restaurant are opening mid ust which will help I cant see any normal people being unhappy here its a great place to start discovering the Big Apple 
P => Fantastic Hotel My boyfriend and I recently stayed at Gild Hall in New York for  nights  This hotel is absolutely stunning  It is currently under reation we only had access to one of the elevators for the weekend because the second one was being changed  But aside from that noone would even know that reations were being done  Check in is not until pm unless rooms become available but the great thing they provide is luggage storage and a guest list so you can be notified if a room becomes available before the standard check in time  They also have a courtesy room that you can use to freshen up if necessary  The cleaning service comes around twice a day morningafternoon and again between  and pm so we always had clean towels  They also leave a lamp on in your room so you dont walk into darkness    and instead of those typical mints on your pillow they leave really good brownies on your night stand  The beds are the most comfortable I have ever experienced in a hotel  And even though it is in the financial district there is the Gray Line Tour Bus that picks up two blocks away from the hotel    and a cab to Times Square costs under   The service was great and everyone is very friendly  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York 
P => A Real Gem   But Hard to Find We selected this hotel for a long New York weekend based on the Trip Advisor reviews and comments  We found the reviews to be accurate and helpful  The hotel is excellent  The rooms were large   by NYC standards   and the beds in particular are exceedingly comfortable  We found the rooms to be very clean and really liked the Fresh brand toiletries  The real strength of this hotel is its friendly and talented staff  From the team at the Front Desk to the ladies in housekeeping we found them all to be courteous and interested in making our stay as nice as possible  The challenge for this hotel is its location  We were driving from DC and had trouble finding the hotel even with GPS Mapquest and a good nav system  The construction along nearby Fulton Street made access to the hotel even more difficult  Once at the hotel the Fulton Street Subway stop gave us easy access to the rest of Manhattan  I would caution anyone who drives to this hotel about the high daily parking charges  We found them to be very high for weekend rates  All in all it was an terrific home for a fine New York weekend  
P => Fantastic experience My best friend and I stayed at Gild Hall from y th to the th  Coming up from DC I had not spent much time at all in New York  After consulting some friends I heard the SOHO would be a really great place to stay  With time running short to book we tried our luck with Hotwire  When I first saw that location of Gild Hall I was a little concerned but the location ended up being great for us  We mostly took taxis and walked but we got to see the city fairly easity  The hotel as you will accuratly read is in the financial district only a few blocks away from the NY Stock Exchange Trinity Church South Seaport Statue of Liberty etc  The hotels staff is absolutly wonderful  friendly and have great recommendations about restaurants and bars and will call a taxi for you if needed and offer to even if its not  More about the hotel  The hotel lobby and each of the rooms is orated nicely and is super clean  We stayed on the th floor and slept on a comfortable king bed which suited us fine because we had plenty of room to ourselves on each side  The LG flat screen had great picture quality  The water pressure was great in the room  The bathroom was stocked with Fresh products the mini bar had Dean and Deluca  Each night our bed was turned down and we were left two Fat Witch brownies  The glass bathroom that you can see in other pictures  bother some people who are light sleepers because the light shines through pretty clearly though it is tough to tell what is going on inside because of the beveledtextured nature of the glass  The first night we were there we didnt think they had a hair dryer but they do it is in the closet by the provided robe  They have three small gyms on different levels  We had an awesome experience and will stay at Gild Hall again  
P => mixed feelings We stayed  nights in the Gild Hall end of e and stayed in a superior king room    Room was rather small for the night we payed buit well equiped  The big problem with the room was the very noisy airco unit one of those large old fashioned in room units  They come to life with a very loud click and in case you are not so sound asleep ie when jetlagged or after a few hours of sleep you are sitting upright totally frightened and wondering what happened  There was no way to avoid turning off the airco unit because New York City was very hot and humid and     across the street is a building with an airco unit that is even more noisy  So opening the window is no option Apart from that some minor nuisances that you would not expect in a hotel in this category Tv channels did not correspond with the titles in the menu the free wireless hotel guests network is NOT the one called Thompson thats the one for the administration but the one called ZyXel which is confusing when your computer detects  wireless networksApart from that there are quite a few very positive aspects front office staff is very helpful and friendly and so is the concierge  He even put our rented bikes in a special storage room  
P => Awesome I travel on a budget so have never before stayed in a  Star hotel but because of a great introductory weekend rate I reserved this hotel for when I popped through New York on a return from London  This hotel is just wonderful   from the warm welcome at midnight on Friday to the brownies at turndown the coffee and pastries in the morning and the lovely room it was wonderful  The room was beautiful the lights and TV on when I entered I thought I had walked into an occupied room but soon realized it was because of the turn down service  Im not usually fond of quotmodernquot lines tend to prefer more of a cozy feel but this room was perfect  The bathroom is lovely and the toiletries and first rate I loved the large soaps and high end shampoo conditioner and lotion that was changed out each day with fresh items  There was a nice comfy robe and lovely soft sheets a wonderful mattress and thick fluffy towels  I didnt hear any noise from outside or from adjoining rooms even though my room was close to the elevator The only downside is that it was a bit difficult to find after dark the cabbie had no idea where it was and the area on the weekends tends to close down and restaurants are a bit away but there is room service available and the on site restaurant should be great when finished  Everything was first rate and though I doubt I will be able to stay here at regular rates I would highly recommend it  
P => Gild Hall was great except for the bed  Travelzoo had a great deal for the hotel and I am a big fan of the Fresh brand products that the hotel stocks the rooms with so after reading the great reviews I ided to book a room for our trip to NYC  It should be noted that although the hotels address is  Gold St  its entrance is on Platt St  Good information if youre arriving via car  Some of the nearby streets are closed for construction the sign says through  so be sure to look for the hotel on Platt not Gold or youll spend a lot of time circling around the nearby one way streets that arent closed off The staff was very nice and the lobby and hotel in general are very attractive  Its a close walk to the piers and less than a mile from China Town and Little Italy  Perfect for dinner  The next morning we also walked to Ground Zero and the Wall St  area which were very close The nice little touches turn down service in the evening Fat Witch brownies left in the evening a mini bar fridge which had a little room for our leftovers Fresh brand lotionshampooconditioner love them flat screen tv a quiet air conditioning unit and a plush bed  The bed reminds me of the Hyatts Dream bed  So comfortable to relax on but oh how my back hurt in the morning  Too soft for me though I wanted to like it  High powered shower in the morning felt great The glass bathroom door that some people have referred to didnt bother me  Its texturized glass you cant see everything behind it  The muffins and pastries in the morning were nice fully stocked until almost  AM All in all a great stay and if they had firmer beds Id gladly return  
P => No doubts I will be back    Before booking this hotel I had reserved other hotels in NYC and one day I saw good deal from quickbook  The price was the reason I chose hotel since I was having doubts on their design location     I cancelled earlier booked hotels and gave a try After this stay I know I will definately return to this hotel even if I have to pay more  People working at the hotel are so friendly relaxed and laid back Such a great welcome no attitude or arrogancy as in many NYCs hotel of such level  They were always there to help us  The room is cute  Enough for two  Great bed and great bed linens from Frette  Huge flat tv free internet  Bathroom is small but no problems with that  The only thing I did not like is old air condition machine which does make quite a lot of noise  Luckily it was not too hot on NYC when we were there but in summer you might need to leave airco on the whole night and I do not like that idea    No problems with location  Actually it was nice not to stay in up manhattan but in down town  Brooklyn is very close  Meat pack Soho Lower East a few stops with metro  Enough to discover and see Thanks guys at Gild Hall for such a great service 
P => Loved it Found a great last minute rate through Travelzoo com for  on a Saturday night  The hotel is fabulous  The bed is extremely comfortable and the staff is very helpful  The concierge wasnt quite as helpful but the check in staff were  I highly recommend this hotel  It is a quick walk to Battery Park World Trade Center site etc  and about a block and half from several metro lines  Cant say enough about this hotel  
P => Love Gild Hall I have been coming to the lower Manhattan Financial District on business for many years  I was always a little jealous of my friends who got to stay in really cool hotels in mid town  Well now with Gild Hall on Wall Street it is my friends that are now jealous of me  Gild Hall has recently been reated and I have to say it is now one of my most favorite hotels in the country and I know plenty of them I don t like traditional style hotels but sometimes cool and hip hotels are not comfortable  This is not the case with Gild Hall  It is really cool but also warm and comfortable no matter where you choose to drop  The rooms are about as comfortable as they come the beds are to die for with their incredible linens and down beddings  I also liked the iPod docking station and the large cozy robes The Gild Hall restaurant is not open yet but they do have  hour room service and the food is great Take all this and add to it the really personalized and caring service and attention of the Gild Hall staff and this hotel is really a winner  You don t get any attitude just warm and friendly interactions with the staff there and anything you ask for gets an immediate answer with a smile included These people did this right and I have found my home on Wall Street at Gild Hall  
P => Excellent I paid  and consider it the best hotel deal possiblein NYC because this hotel has class style luxury and asuperlative staff  Example of superlative staff the air conditioning was a bit noisy so they had a staff persongo to another room and test it for sound before I went intothe new room to test it with positive results  This hotellocation is at the lower edge of Manhattan near the site but it is within two blocks of the Fulton Street subwaywhere you can catch trains going all the way up thewest side or east side  The  train was  minutesto Grand Central  The booking was through quickbook comand it still felt like preferential treatment but it is their wayat this hotel to treat eveyone like they are paying per night which you  soon have to do  They do a lobbybreakfast for free with excellent coffee and fresh frenchpastries or scones  Only improvement would be toprovide the rooms with a coffee maker  
P => Top notch When our booking with a small uptown hotel was cancelled one of the owners fell seriously ill so they had to close their doors temporarily Gild Hall was the last minute replacement they found for us and I must say we were really lucky The room superior king quotsuperiorquot meaning quotstandardquot  was on the small side but tastefully orated and the big bed was really comfortable with luxurious linen  Bathroom was also stylish and toiletries were from Fresh  Only thing that bothered us about the room a little was the constant loudish humming coming from the climate control unit   I think the sound actually came from outside through the units vent from the parking building and its huge ventilation openings across the street  However that was the only noise so it was probably about as quiet as it can get in New York However what really makes this hotel the gem it is is the the staff   everybody and I mean everybody from the doormen to front desk to handymen or other staff members we came across were so helpful friendly and efficient  Nothing was ever too much troubleThe location has pros and cons   it is great if you have business to do in the Financial District and you can also shop til you drop at Century  and JampRs both of which are about  mins walk from the hotel  However there does not seem to be much nightlife or it is currently mostly hidden behind scaffoldings and roadworks  We did find a nice Italian restaurant One Ten at  John Street with good food and great atmosphere and their bar seems to be quite popular with after work crowd Of course the subway connections uptown and the quotnightlife areasquot are normally good eg  express A to th St ie the Village and th ie  Meatpacking District but during our stay there were some service changes that made things a bit trickier  All in all Gild Hall was a great experience but for our next visit wed probably consider staying in a different neigbourhood  And after the hotel is fully up and running the bar and the restaurant werent open yet and there are no more quotsoft openingquot deals to be had wed probably wouldnt even afford it    
P => Great location in financial district My husband and I were in NY for our first time and only for one weekend  We had tickets to the Yankees game Friday night and even though this location is pretty quotfarquot from everything we had no problems taking the subways to the Bronx Central Park and everything midtown  The lobby is nice great doormen and super nice front staff  No restaurant yet but the one across the street honored   off orders was open  hrs and would deliver to your room  even though we didnt use itRooms were really modern great comfortable bed and updated bathroom with good amenities  Delicious complimentary coffee and pastries in the mornings were a perfect way to start the day Overall I would definitely recommend if you dont mind taking subways to midtown and it was pretty close to Soho the village and chinatown  
P => Wonderful quiet location great front desk folks We stayed at Gild Hall for  nights   my boyfriend was there on business in the Financial District  Having stayed at  Thompson I just had to try the newest Thompson hotel  I prefer to stay in a quiet part of NYC and this was it  Granted the area is dead at night but I walked from Soho to the hotel in  minutes so its not too far away  I dont like staying in midtown its way too noisy and Ive done all the quottouristyquot things   I prefer the downtown shopping and restaurants so Gild Hall wasnt a bad location for me  If youre a first time visitor to NYC you might want to stay in midtown to see the quotattractions quotThe lobby was newly reated very quotcountrymodern chicquot   its a very small lobby much smaller and less glitzy than  Thompson   which I love but is still very stylish  The front desk folks are amazing   so nice and helpful  Each time I stepped off the elevator they asked what I was doing where I was shopping or eating and gave recommendations and got me a cab in just a few minutes The hotels restuarant isnt open yet but Harrys is within walking distance a Wall St  steak house like Mortons  We ate in Soho and Little Italy too   just a short cab ride or walk away  If you like a quotscenequot try Balthazar in Soho  Youre sure to spot a celebrity or two and its nice to stroll around Soho  Anthony Bourdains quotLes Hallesquot is also close by Gild Hall in the Financial District  We walked down to the Ritz Carlton at Battery Park and watched the sunset over the Statue of Liberty at the Rise Bar on the th floor  Very romantic What I loved about this location was that its very quiet at night  Also being in historic downtown NYC is charming   its the oldest part of the city and so the streets are tiny  I would say its a bit like being in the Grand Canyon down there  Its actually quite nostalgic and we enjoyed walking up and down Wall St  past the NYSE and other historic buildings and taking it all in  The sense of history in this part of town is striking  Fraunces Tavern where George Washington gave his farewell address to the oficers of the Continental Army is  is interesting  The rooms are very nice and chic   the linens are by Sferra Italian and are to die for  Im extremely picky about bedding and it passed the test    very nice pillow top mattress and leather headboard  Also I loved the light fixture over the bed The in room bar is nice too    just open it up and pop a half bottle of Veuve Clicquot after dinner and viola   the perfect end to an evening in the city  Of course my boyfriend wanted to kill me for running up such a tab the prices are double what it would cost you to buy an item elsewhere    for that half bottle    heeThe only thing I would point out is the lack of privacy in the bathrooms   I dont mind but my boyfriend sure did  The bathroom has frosted glass walls and doors so you can see and hear everything Overall I would definitely stay here again I didnt get the deal others on this site did  Sunday night and  or so Monday night but its still a great deal  I cant wait to come back once Todd Englishs restaurant is complete  They do offer coffee and pastries in the morning which really was all that we needed considering we love trying new restaurants in the city  
P => Another Hip Holiday Inn Reation If you dont mind being downtown which I dont this hotel from the Thompson Hotel folks is pretty good  Located within  blocks of most of the downtown subway lines you can easily get almost anywhere in NY  Our room was pretty big and was orated tastefully in a fantasy backwoods lodge chic style  
P => Loved it But no in room coffee Priceline brought me to hotel when I booked a businesspleasure trip on which I brought my son for  days  Everything about the hotel was splendid  The staff has clearly been trained in top notch service  The rooms are sparkling clean and beautifully orated  The hotel is also close to the subway  If it were not a business trip I couldnt have afforded the hotel on my own  The only legitimate critique I have of the room is that there was substantial thought into the or and service aspect but there were certain essential items that didnt factor into the planning  For instance since I was there on business I had to be up and out of the room early but there is no in room coffee  Definitely a big minus  Also the mini bar is stocked in such a way that its virtually impossible to stash your own soda water and goodies in there  There was also virtually no drawercloset space so we really could never unpack our suitcases and wound up living out of them for the whole trip Finally when the heat kicks in and out at night its exceedingly loud though I give this a quotpassquot since the same is true in many older NYC buildings  All in all a fabulous stay but a few more tweeks would make it even better for the business traveler and considering the hotel is in the financial district I would presume this is the priy client base  
P => Clean modern   great option in financial district Provided that you want to be in the financial district this hotel is amazing  They are currently reating the place so there is no restaurant at the moment but since you are in Manhattan you probably want to save your dining out options for someplace more fun anyway  I spent the bulk of my sightseeing in midtown so the location wasnt ideal for me but it was easy enough to get around since the subway is just blocks away  Some streets in the financial district seemed dangerous late at night but I think its mainly because everything seems to shut down after work hours  On to the actual hotel I stayed in the King room which was very large and had first rate amenities safe flat screen tv hair dryer upscale bath products  The or was a sleek modern western theme and everything felt very clean  My only complaint about the place is that since it is going under reations only one elevator is working so by the time the elevator gets to your floor it is jam packed  We stayed on the th floor and tried walking down the stairs but it led to an emergency only exit so unfortunately you just have to wait    a long time  Something that  be of concern is that the bathroom door in our room was translucent so you could see an outline of the person in the bathroom doing their business  Overall I loved the place and it has nothing to do with the fact that I paid only   
P => Great experience    I think I beat everyone on the price that I got for one night at this hotel   Given it was for a Friday night which is dead in Financial district as the previous poster said but it made no difference because we used the subway to commute into the city during the night anyway  I booked through Quikbook if anyone is wondering  Echoing the other posters the hotel was great  The bathroom is very modern and clean  The SERVICE though was what really stood out  When the wireless cut in and out I went to the front desk and asked for an ethernet cable and someone came by  minutes later  Housekeeping service knocked on the door taking me by surprise and asked if there was anything else we needed and I asked for more soap since there was another person with me  Cable TV was very fuzzy on the flat panel LCD which the engineer looked at when we were there but he couldnt do anything about it  Also when we needed to store our luggage for the day it was no problem for them to accommodate us As just graduated students who dont look exactly like professional business folk we kind of felt like fish out of water in this posh hotel  But the staff didnt treat us any differently as far as I can tell  Kudos to Gild Hall p s  Its best to find this hotel on foot with a map its very easy to get to from the subway station  
P => Great hotel As you  have seen in other reviews    this hotel is currently under construction   but I have not noticed a bit  It seems that everything is completed with the exception of the restaurant  The rooms are   complete   and gorgeous I dont know how to compare the size of the rooms to other NYC hotels bc I havent stayed in any     but theyre small  Not tiny but I kind of expected it to be small anyway My room has a fridge w minibar safe cordless phone free wired and wifi internet an iHome alarm clock with iPod dock wall mounted LCD tv w HBO and Cinemax   The bed is comfortable  The bathroom is nice   fixtures are awesome After reading a lot of reviews prior to staying here I was kind of concerned about only seeing renderings of the room    but that main rendering you see is of the new lobby and its very nice   though the front desk is a bit small and only one elevator is available at the moment   off and on anyway  Sometimes both Hopefully the pics I added will help you out    
P => Great Hotel The price could not be beat for being in the city  Even though it is in the Downtown area close to the seaport   we did not run into any issues finding the place or getting to where we needed to  The staff is amazing Everyone is so hospitable and very helpfulThe room was excellent dark wood or flat screen tv big comfy bed clean bathroom  Very clean It was very chic to say the least  I would definitely come back again I just hope   just like everyone else that the price do not get so high  If it does Im just glad for the experience  Try the Gold St  Diner around the corner they give   off to hotel guests  Small discount but its something Also the Italian restaurant around the corner from the hotel is superb 
P => Very Lovely Hotel I stayed at Gild Hall for one night and really thought the hotel was very nice  My rate was  via quickbook and i am certain that once the hotel is finished it will be well over  a night  Overall the experience was nice my hotel room was really lovely and it had luxurious toiletries and towels  I did have trouble finding the hotel and i am certain that cabs will never be able to find itIt is located right near Century  the twin towers site brooklyn bridge and south street seaport The neighborhood is DEAD at night not something i really liked because of the lack of restuaruants and activities  However it is close to the subway lines and a good spot for travelers who are ready to see different parts of the city Unbelievable bargain for  but i definately wont stay there when it is over  purely because of the location  I prefer to be in SOHO Tribeca or the Meatpacking District  
P => Great hotel   would definitely return if I can afford to Having moved away from NYC after years of being a true quotNew Yorkerquot Ive always found it difficult to stay in a hotel when I come back into the city and have been able to for the most part avoid it by crashing at friends places when they are out of town  Recently though everyone was staying local when we came to visit and I booked a room at Gild Hall for a surprisingly low price online at quikbook com  The site had the warning caveat that the hotel was under construction thus the low rates no doubt during reation  We assumed safely that there would be little interfering noise on a weekend stay and booked a standard king room New York City hotel rooms are notoriously tiny with variable amenities and equally variable staff attentiveness   imagine our surprise to enter into a quiet little world of wonderful  I almost hate to write this review and quotoutquot the hotel a supreme gem hidden waaaay downtown but I feel like I should share our experience The entrance is on a tiny side street off Gold St a   min walk from the Fulton St subway stops which serves nearly all major subways lines one could want for  While the hotel undergoes reations the lobby is the size of a cubby but who needs more than that for check in We were double upgraded they informed us to some sort of deluxe king room compliments of the hotel and whether it was a line or a true upgrade the sentiment was kind and the room lovely   unbelievably high ceilings even spacious by NYC standards  The bathroom was huge and came with fresh brand toiletries   quite highbrow actually and a thoughtful addition  The room had the requisite and now ubiquitous iPod docking station and flat screen TV and an extremely comfortable bed  As we were getting ready to go out turn down service rolled by and while we lined it was a nice touch for a fledgling boutique hotel The room was quiet dark and blessedly free of radiator rattles construction or hallway noise even though we were right across from the elevator  The water in the shower was hot the robe in the bathroom sumptuous and everything clean and orderly  Quite honestly   what more could you expect or want forI know the hotel will grow the Todd English tavern will move in and I imagine it will become quite the hot spot downtown with prices to match other Thompson group hotels are NOT cheap but in the meantime its well worth booking a room even if its further downtown than you might normally consider in order to have the little quiet luxuries that Gild Hall offers before everyone else finds out about them too  
P => Great hotel   wonder if it will stay like that I stayed here just before Christmas when my usual Midtown hotels were busy andor prohibitively expensive The pricing was in line with the fact that the public areas are worse than non existent   positively tatty  But     the bell hop and desk staff were fantastic   greeted me by name during the whole stay  My room was great spacious and st In line with many reviewers I had been concerned about location   I neednt have been  Plenty of dining options close by   I recommend the various diners for breakfast and the Brasserie Les Halles was great for dinner  The subway was close by and the Seaport area close also However I do wonder what will happen to the prices once the reations are complete  
P => Great place to stay in NYC I booked this hotel through Quickbook  It was currently under construction when we booked so we got the hotel for a great price  Good Stuff The rooms were huge for a NYC room with a great king size bed FRESH brand toiletries and a roomy bathroom  The room was very clean and they provide a wonderful flat screen TV across from the bed See provided pictureBad Stuff The only thing negative I can say was that the air conditioner for the room was really noisy and we had to turn it off   no big deal  So to sum it up Id easily stay here again   actually    I think Id like to live there If I had to live in NYC  I really loved it that much

P => Nice hotel I agree with great service and very nice room  We upgraded to a one bedroom suite and it felt like we were in our apartment in NYC  A nice apartment at that  Everyone was very helpful Now onto the opinion side of things  This is a great hotel if you want to be in a residential part of NYC and not close to the big attraction  If you want to party stay in the meatpacking district  This is not a party hotel  It does have a nice bar downstairs but you are not getting in at night just because you stay there  The rooftop was a dissapointment because it was enclosed and stuffy and not much of a view  If you wanna party stay at the Standard  If you want a rooftop check out the Gansevoort  This hotel just seemed dark and stuffy  The W Union Square which is close by and closer to hustle and bustle looked more airy and more people hanging out in lobby I think I was just looking for a little bit more fun hotel  This hotel is a good place if you want a quiet getaway to NYC and want to stay in your room  Which I dont know who is looking for that Celebs that dont want pazzi It is a quotnice hotelquot just not what I was looking for this time in NYC  
P => Impeccable  I stayed at Gramercy Park Hotel in ober for  nights and the experience was truly amazing  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise and great start to our stay  The front desk staff were very polite and helpful the concierge was always on hand to assist with any questions we had which was a big help as we were unfamiliar with the locale  The eclectic design of the hotel is second to none everything is carefully thought out from the amazing artwork on the walls to the beautiful furniture  As soon as you walk through the front door the hotel has an ambience which lets you unwind from your busy days cruising around New York City  The Rose Bar is a popular late night bar not only for hotel guests but is also a favourite among New Yorkers the Diamonds and Pearls cocktail a must  By far the most incredible space is the Private Rooftop Terrace amazing drinks chilled out music an uninterrupted view of New York City and the coolest design to a rooftop garden I have ever seen  In addition to all this the rooms are spot on egyptian cotton sheets plasma tvs stunning furniture and plenty of space which is a rare commodity in most New York hotels  On my next visit to New York there is only one place I will be staying   GPH  
P => Beautiful unique hotel experience Had a wonderful time at the Gramercy Park Hotel  Stayed in a Superior King with two kids under  as did the adult amp two teenagers travelling with us  Turned out just great  Lots of storage space in our room great bathrooms  Quiet and relaxing unlike other NY hotel experiences weve had  Had an extra fridge requested for our kids needs as well as a crib  We definitely werent the typical clientele but it suited us just fine  Great location   in its own quiet pocket between all the great destinations  Several parks close by for the kids  although too many quotrulesquot in the Gramercy Park to make it a great destination for kids   Madison Square Park was better for the wee ones  Concierge was great help for reservations etc We got a really great deal through quikbook   not sure if we wouldve gone otherwise  Therefore in hotel dining was a bit out of our price range unfortunately  Was also shocked by the wi fi charge on check out  But apart from that a beautiful unique experience   great to be close to such great art and or  
P => Incredible The Gramercy Park Hotel is the most stunning sexy hotel I have stayed at in a long time  The lobby is welcoming serene and hip and the room we had a suite upgrade was divine  Magnificent furniture beautiful colors great products in the huge bathroom comfortbale bed lovely lighting  The restaurant on the roof top was not to be beat as are the prices but the views the mood the artwork   A The staff was pleasant respectful knowledgable and clearly all about pleasing the customer Lots of cool vibes in the reservations only bar and even sawe some celebrities  
P => Definately not standard Perhaps my experience was colored a tad by the fact that I had such an abysmal time at The Standard but I could not have been happier with the Gramercy Park Hotel The area is not as trendy and permeated with designer stores but I found the location to be preferable for getting around with great access tofrom and plenty of restaurants and nice places for drinks close by  Most importantly though the room was so much more comfortable then The Standard everything worked the was actual space for clothes and luggage and the quality all around was far superior   much more so then the actual price difference between the two for the rooms we had  Sure the elevators were a bit slow and the guests were perhaps more posh then the mix of hipsterstouristsbridge and tunnel in the Meatpacking District but the hotel itself really made it a vacation and provided a haven of relaxation and actual sleep in between stints of running around NYC Taking one star off only due to the overall high prices along with the fact that they apparently allow for smoking rooms and the smell made itself rather apparent at night in spite of the ventilation  I would return but be better prepared for that PS If you need a lh while at the GPH check out the  tee shirt they have for sale yowza 
P => Nice But Bring Your Flashlight We really enjoyed our stay here  It was a refreshing change from our usual Upper East Side more formal places  The Gramercy is fun and stylish hip but still comfortable  The location in a beautiful residential neighborhood right by Gramercy Park was the best part    it was very quiet at all times so we got to enjoy New York without the street noise  True its not in the middle of shopping streets but the area is great for strolling As for the flashlight this was the darkest hotel weve ever stayed in The or is dark brown deep burgundy forest green    when we stepped off the elevator onto our floor the lighting was literally so dim that we could barely make out the large numbers on the wall showing which direction to go  The hotel actually compensates by having the room numbers woven into the hallway carpeting next to the room doors white numbering against deep burgundy carpet  Pretty funny  We were upgraded to a roomy park view suite with comfortable furnishings  The mini bar was gorgeous with cut crystal glasses and beautiful silver accessories  Again the or was in dark colors burgundy royal blue but thanks to four windows overlooking Gramercy Park the suite had good light and was very homey  The bathroom was rather cramped and surprise dark in the vanity area despite artistic clusters of light bulbs on each side of the mirror  I realize its a style thing    after all this is Ian Shrager    but its nice to be able to see when youre shaving or putting on makeup The roof terrace open only to guests of the hotel was great sunny and filled with potted plants and the seating was sufficiently spread out that we had privacy even when all the tables were occupied  The only detraction was the host of aggressive insects large fruit flies be that descended whenever food appeared and hovered around the buffet breakfast as well  This was the case even when the retractable roof was closed  Service was adequate not great our breakfast order was bungled and took nearly an hour but we werent in a hurry so no big problem While all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful the strange placement of the concierge desk in the middle of the lobby    the concierge sits on an angle with his back to the front doors and never looks away from his computer screen    was vaguely unwelcoming  Otherwise the lobby was great with a real wood fire burning in ust in a huge fireplace at the end of the room and huge contemporary artworks on display This hotel is different and fun and we would return  
P => Posh Yet Funky Been to NYC a few times and Heard about The Gramercy Park Hotel I loved it very pleased with the Very Friendly StaffLoved The Rose Bar and The Roof Top Bar 
P => Gorgeous hotel amazing staff Comfortable elegant stylish rooms great service   a treatThe bar is incredible   the watermelon mint tini by the Israeli barkeeper was the best ever 
P => Gramercy Park Hotel is in a wonderful location  Rooftop garden is beautiful and is fun for people watching Servers at Rooftop garden very friendly Drinks are very expensive Room was cleaned daily Bed was wonderful  Room was very dark Hotel lobby very dark A different experience Area around hotel was wonderful and quiet Room service not always prompt Menu prices too expensive Not sure that I would return Gramercy Park next door was a real treat If you want to spend that kind of money go for it 
P => A fantastic place to stay in NYC I stayed at the Gramercy Park Hotel for one night at the end of a weeks stay in New York  I have to say it really is a stylish hotel  The lobby is very impressive with a beautiful chandelier as the focal point  The staff couldnt have been friendlier or more helpful   nothing was too much trouble  Also the guy who brought my bag to my room was literally male model material   in fact everyone who worked there was model material My room was tastefully orated spacious and had a great view over Gramercy Park  The ensuite was small but perfectly formed with great fixtures and fittings and luxurious products  The location of the hotel is in a lovely area close to the subway and within walking distance of lots of shops and restaurants a ten minute walk from Macys  All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Gramercy and only wish Id been able to stay longer   one night was definitely not long enough  Incidentally a friend went on to stay at the Waldorf the next night and said it wasnt a patch on the Gramercy  Praise indeed  
P => comes with the key to the Gramercy Park I lived in NYC for  years and never got to go inside the Gramercy Park     until now  This IS the best thing about the stay here  Its a cute well done great service boutique hip hotel AND a key to the Gramercy Park  Go for it  Its a bragging rights picture on the facebook that you get out it  Hotel itself is cool adequate luxury place with a comfortable bed nice accesories leather desk  Not everyone  like the dark green walls with the red velvet accents    I did  Think quot bordelloquot like oration in a good way  Nice  Love the wood oration and the scent in the entry hall  is it cedar    I was upgraded to a quotloft quot  miniature sized room with normal high ceilings    not sure if this was a loft what is the scale of the standard room  A shoebox  Well this is New York afterall  
P => A change for Schrager it really works    and yes I bought the t shirt Stayed at the GPH and have to say it was terrific  Service was spot on from getting out of the taxi til the time I left  Brilliant design that is nostalgic and timeless but not in a glamour way with all things bright and shiny and new  More of a mansion from quotGangs of New Yorkquot with untreated timbers and rich dark ripe colours and hues  The rooms are dark there are dimmers but if there was a suggestion is that you should be able to turn up the voltage in the bathroom  Shaving was a little more difficult than usual  All other elements very comfortable excellent minibar bought the art t shirt as a last minute gift Had drinks in the bar and the list was interesting and well thought out  Location worked for me because this time I had stuff to do down town  I have previously stayed at W Union Square but actually prefer this now  The only downside was the gym with the low ceiling and limited equipment  Im hardly the jolly green giant but I felt it was compromised Apart from that loved it  Will return  
P => Unique Hotel Ive read some of the negative reviews and had to add my opinion  I have stayed at the Gramercy Park Hotel twice and find it unique interesting   and SO much better than almost every other NYC hotel I have occupied  The rooms ARE dark and yes I had to call for extra soap as well but the location is great the service is wonderful and the rooms comfortable  I have no reservation recommending this hotel  
P => Sexy Chic Hotel We spent  nights here in uary w Amex Platinum card with the rd night free so they give you the room upgrade free breakfast and a complimentary lunch  It is such a chic beautiful hotel with amazing original art hanging in the lobby and bars and located in a great area  Gramercy park which is such a nice area in Manhattan  You feel like you are in a private club when you are here  Yes it is very expensive  the Jade Bar is so expensive for drinks and the Rose Bar is by reservation only whether or not you are a hotel guest  celebrity spot  one night we were there we saw Kate Hudson Sean Penn Josh Brolin and Anne Hathaway  A round of drinks for  can run you minimum of   unless you get beer  The Rooftop bar is open only for hotel guests and their friends  It is one of the most beautiful hotel rooftops in Manhattan  From Breakfast to sunset drinks its awesome  The service is great here also and very attentive  We brought our own bottle of Veuve Cliquot Champagne for a special occasion and they let us have it in the rooftop  Nice staff beautiful hotel would definitely go back again  
P => LOVELY   GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL As a seasoned luxury traveler I expect a quality product and greatservice at the hotels I choose   especially in major metropolitan areaslike New York  I stayed at Gramercy Park Hotel recently and receivedjust that  A lovely property with spectacular design and a team ofemployees that were just as nice as possible especially the Front Deskand Concierge  What a gem 
P => Over rated Ripped Off Fed Up Unfortunately read the latest reviews here and trust them   I wish I did  This hotel does not deserve  stars but does deserve the disapointing ratings listed here  We arrived at  pm after having informed the hotel that we would likely arrive then aftter a long transatlantic flight and were told that our room was not ready but that if we paid  USD more per night we would get the next category of room right away  I told them that we were insulted by this and that we reserved a month earlier  reconfirmed and were disappointed to have to wait  They told to wait in the bar   where they did not offer us water tea or anything   instead we paid  USD for a beer and  for a water and waited  or  minutes for our room  The internet noted that the rate for our room was  per night with a special for every other night at   discount  We were charged  per night with   on the second night   when I inquired why not the internet rate we booked I was told that if you do the math the actual price per night is   The internet info was highly mis leading  The room was okay   nothing impressive and VERY dark and certainly not worth  per night  The bath area opens into the room and is very small and too dark for putting on make up  I had to ask for body lotion and they never refilled the shampoo or lotion during our  day stay  We only had one roll of TP and had to call to get more  There is no room for anything on the bathroom counter and towels and tissues are placed under the sink  No amenities like cotton swabs or nail files  The table in the room was placed in front of a sofa   fine for relaxing but terrible for working  No working light no electrical plugs for a laptop telephone charger etc  This is not a good hotel for a business traveller   the business center is literally a small closet off the front desk   only room for one person at a time at a tiny desk  They charge  USD per day for using internet in your room  But the hotel bed was comfy though  If you dont have advance reservations you cant get into the bar for a drink  We asked if we could have tea or wine on the sofa in the lobby   absolutely not   the only offer was to make us a bar reservation for the next night  The roof top garden area is lovely for breakfast but costly Two orders of egg benedict coffee and juice was about  USD  On the internet the gym looks great   but it is a small room with  quotnordic trainersquot  treadmills  recumbant bike a couple of weight machines  The hotel has some nice art the lobby is small not much personnel around  The employees and bar guests are all in their mid s  When I asked directions to the Gramercy Tavern nearby well known restaurant I recommend  the casual girl at the front desk pointed right and said go left a couple of blocks but didnt know the names or numbers of the streets   she didnt seem to have a map to offer  She really didnt know where to send us or offer to call but we managed to find our way there with help of asking passing pedistrians the clerks directions were completely off  The hotel is in a fun part of town if you want to pre book to hang out in the bar with the young and lovely you might find the hotel worth staying at   and if you like dark slightly dank rooms that feel like your old Aunt Ednas parlor complete with lacy throw on the sofa and kitchy chairs and you like spending a lot of money for not much then this  be the hotel for you  If you cant get into the bar to pay  USD for a GT you can relax in your room with one of the only free things in the hotel   the loan of a DVD from their collection  Oh they dont leave newspapers on your door and when I left shoes out to be shined the night before I had to call in the morning to get them back  And when we sent laundry out with normal service requested they tried to charge   for express  
P => Overrated Ian Schrager treatment so hip yes worth it  Negative  Not only overpriced hotel is cheap k per night for penthouse level but one bar of soap and had to call for a bar for the shower and had to call for lotion  Get this  per night to valet park your car Give me a break  Bright spot is the Rose Bar which you must reserve with concierge even if in residence  Rose Bar on Wed  is Okay but DJ a litle strange  Thursday night is a different vibe and definitely filled with hotties  I did resent being asked to give up my seat so a large party could be seated  At these rates plus  tinis NO ONE should ask me to move anything  They should be plying ME with drinks and stand over me with a fan  
P => Love it What a unique place  My room was fabulous although a little dark  Bathroom on the small side but on the whole   the room was superb  Huge comfortable beds amp beautiful crystal glasses for the well stocked mini bar  Bar was a great scene on Friday amp Saturday  Highly recommended  This place is cheaper than the St  Regis by far   and does not skimp on quality  Oh and the staff were extremely helpful 
P => Hated It Booked for  nights on expedia  The place looks nice but its like a movie set  Lots of pretty coverings but underneath  ecch  The air conditioner kept me up the whole night  When I told them I wanted to leave they said they would take care of the bill for the nd night with Expedia  I believed them  BIG MISTAKE  They lied  Plain and simple  Took me DAYS to unravel the whole thing and finally get my charge taken off my credit card  The people at the front desk were NO HELP when I called  As if I had never been there  GPH is a BIG RIPOFF  If youre  years old with tons of money to spare and no taste then you will like it  There seemed like a lot of partying frat types running around the halls  Save yourself the headache and have a drink there if they let you up to the roof garden  But dont stay there  
P => A superficial shambles completely lacking in style The one positive thing I can say is that this place and its staff look pretty and are situated in a great location for walking or taking quick cab journeys to the best bits of the city  I wish Id read some of the reviews on here before I booked    in retrospect I am not surprised by stories of people being served drinks in broken glasses in the Jade Room or being left to see in the New Year on the freezing pavement The Gramercy is of course priily a hotel so   before turning to the  extraordinary  entertainment facilities   here is what hundreds of dollars a night can buy you tiny bathrooms with brown running water that is intermittently too hot or too cold broken bathroom taps a heating system so noisy it wakes you up towel rails that fall off internet access at  a day and further unnecessarily extortionate charges just to listen to music on the in room entertainment system The Gramercy however likes to ket itself as more than a hotel with its  original and exciting  spaces with  unique  atmospheres The Roof Club The Rose Room and The Jade Room  We spent  nights at the hotel and the Rose Bar was booked out for private events every single one of those nights the Jade Room by the way is not a arate bar it is a small entrance hall to the Rose Room where you can get a drink  This meant no access for hotel guests although the concierge told us we would be able to get in after am which actually suited us  At am we returned to be told   quite rudely   by the doorman that there was no way we were getting in until later  We did have access to the Roof Club although on one night this closed at midnight meaning there was nowhere for us to go in the hotel for a drink  I m sure the Roof Bar is lovely in the summer but in winter it is totally lacking in atmosphere has a terrible soundtrack and is serviced by the Gramercy tradek of beautifully bland waiters  The Roof Club is the acting hotel restaurant  There was an extremely limited food menu and the pretty frosty waitress told us that this was because the menu was totally arate from the room service menu despite all of the items clearly being taken from the room service menu cooked in the same kitchen by the same people in the same hotel  We did stop by the RoseJade Room during the day for a quick post shopping snack to find the same deal a slightly different very limited menu again with everything appearing on the full Room Service menu and therefore being cooked in the same kitchen by the same people in the same hotel but with no flexibility in ordering We sat at the bar where the barman and a couple of staff talked very loudly about how crap their jobs were how boring it was working there during the daytime and how dull the guests were   a lhable error considering one of our party is a travel journalist for a national broadsheet  These miserable failed models could not care less that we were in earshot  Admittedly we were more interested in talking to each other than entertaining the staff   our mistake clearly  How this place manages to encourage people to continue to spend money for the privilege of staying there is simple it s got a very good PR agent that gets it onto  hot lists  and has a doorman that makes it difficult to get into the overwhelmingly disappointing bar in order to maintain the hype  In reality this place is both run and patronized by people who have no idea what true style is  There are many ways to spend your money in NY I urge you not to do so funding this superficial shambles of a hotel  
P => Dropped The Ball on New Years Eve The Gramercy Park is a gorgeous hotel and its roof club is perhaps my new favorite place to hang out in the world but they made a completely unacceptable error on New Years Eve  We reserved a package that included guaranteed access to the Rose Bar and double checked that this was the case but when we showed up at  on NYEve no one seemed to have heard of this package and we were refused entry at two different doors  We ushered in the new year shivering on the sidewalk in front of the bar The next day the hotel made several good faith efforts to recover from this lapse including comping our breakfast at the roof club but still    
P => Polished friendly and comfortable Unlike many boutique hotels I found the staff at the GPH to be extremely friendly and helpful  They were all young and cute but they had none of the attitude that you often find among the ranks of the stylish youth that seem to run the world of hip hotels The hotel itself did not disappoint either  Arriving for a long weekend right after Christmas the lobby could not have been cozier with a fire in the oversized fireplace and a beautiful twinkly Christmas tree  In fact all of the public and private areas of the hotel were not only stylish and beautifully orated with a great art collection but everything was in pristine condition  Perhaps it is the relative newness of the hotel but it is rare to find a hotel where all of the finishes are intact nothing is worn no stains or chipping or scuffing Trying not to spend a fortune on a hotel in NYC four of us stayed in a doubledouble which was surprisingly big and comfortable  Like the rest of the hotel the room had a quotdarkquot feel to it but unlike other dark boutique hotels there was plenty of lighting by the beds and the desk  where it is most needed  Nothing I hate more than not being able to read in a hotel  That was no problem here  The room was beautifully orated with plenty of closet space comfortable chairs big TV beautifully stocked mini bar with very nice crystal and other accessories The rooftop loungegarden is truly spectacular  Very cool comfortable or lots of different places to sit  although not much light to read in the interior lounges  a great place for a delicious but pricey breakfast or a delicious but pricey tini   The bar off of the lobby is also great space that requires reservations after  pm The fitness center is small but very nice and complete  Various free weights and weight machines punching bag about four cardio machines overlooking Gramercy Park Another perk of the hotel is access to the private Gramercy Park  Open only to residents on the square and guests of the hotel it is a wonderful green oasis  With an unseasonably warm  degrees on a ember day I spent a half hour sitting in the park with a book  Make sure you bring your cell phone however the staff not only have to walk across the street to let you in but they also have to come back over to let you out Although the rooms were very quiet we were on the th floor just below the rooftoplounge garden level which meant a bit of furniture moving noises late at night and early in the morning  It didnt really bother us much but light sleepers or the easily annoyed would probably have had a fit We booked directly on the hotel website using a non refundable advanced purchase rate saving a little more money  With no actual contact with the hotel staff I was amazed that all of my requests were honored high floor no feathers non smoking New York Times in the morning A great stay  
P => Light on Love heavy on pretention  But still a good brew  GPH is like an old girlfriend you still call at  am from the Star Bar after too many mojitos  She is always there and happy to have a good time  I wont carry on  Here is the deal I love this hotel and have stayed on several visits  But this time the pretentiousness of the check in event hovered at above normal altitudes  I was with my comely new girlfriend and tinged by nerves I confess  But I was so embarrassed by the complete lack of common courtesy demonstrated by the two people at the front desk  We walk up after a half days travel and neither woman acknowledged our existence  We stood there in disbelief as I was about to spend the dividend quotient of a large third world island and no one could even muster a quotbuenas tardesquot Anyhow one anecdote of many  Overall despite my better judgement I will return  The hotel is comfortable and tastefully designed  But the staff must improve doormen excluded    wonderful and helpful guys  The desk folks really must get over themselves  An air of sophisticated je ne sais quoi is expected in such high end mercantile  But being an ass is just never cool  Greet guests with warmth  Not garrulous chatter or saccharine fakery just warmth  All the best  
P => A Designed Experience From the spicy cedar scent that permeated the lobby when I first arrived to the blue velvet throw strewn purposefully across the foot of the bed my whole stay felt designer chic and artsy  I will echo some of the other reviewers and laud the staff at the property for their casual professionalism   the bellhops are the friendliest Ive encountered in NYc I had an opportunity to enjoy GPHs  bedroom suite and would return to the dark moody Absinthian room in a heartbeat for an extended stay  Even though some of the artwork within the room could qualify as creepy rabbit headed man in suit anyoneThe aesthetic of the rooftop terracebar is simply amazing   you eventually notice that there is also a ent view of the city but realistically that plays second to the or Gramercy Park itself is cute even though the gates and fences make me feel more hemmed in rather than any sense of privacy Now for the caveatsThe Rose Bar is a disappointment  Though it was crammed full of people I found the atmosphere stodgy and boring  Pretention of course is de rigeur and I enjoyed the artificial quotexclusivityquot of the guestlist Also lacklustre is their restaurant Wakiya   the flavours are uninspired and the menu lacks a signature  Not sure why it is fairly busy   PricesRates at GPH can beggar belief  If you have to ask how much then    you get the idea Gramercy Park Hotels beautiful property ent location at the end of Lex and friendly service combined for a positive and memorable experience  I would recommend this hotel for young professionals singles or couples not traveling on a tight budget  
P => The rooms are dark really dark Public areas the lobby the rooftop terrace the bars are kind of swank and the drinks at the bar are priced suitably high with pieces by art world celebs like Schnabel Basqiat Hirst etc  but the rooms though pretty spacious by NY standard are red by a poor color and orating scheme  Its all way too much chintz and velvet  And its way too dark in there You can barely read the papers without turning on all the lights and raising the blinds Clearly not intended for people who actually need to do work in their hotel rooms And everything is a bit overpriced in that nickel and dime kind of way  For instance they will charge you for Internet usage per device so my wife and I were charged for each of our laptops until we protested and they took one of those charges off  On the other hand being a guest at the hotel gives you exclusive access to the rooftop lounge a really nice place to have a late night drink or breakfast in the morning  Again its all good but pricey The neighborhood retains traces of the classic old NY like Edith Wharton and Henry James NY so thats a plus for anyone who wants to stay in a boutique hotel away from the mobs in Soho or LES  Its probably worth it to stay here once for the experience but not for return stays  
P => Small bathrooms great staff In the first room we entered pillows weren t changed we were immediately transferred to a new one   superior queen  After one night we ided either hotel has to upgrade us or we will change hotel  I haven t seen such a small bathroom anywhere in NYC  Absolutely nowhere to put your toiletry but nowhere  Light bulbs put around the mirror are great for photo session in fancy magazine but no use in bathroom they produce heat and give no proper light  Rest of the room was nicely orated in neo gothic style with very comfortable bad After we talked to very polite and nice front desk lady we were given king loft room  Room was very spacious with working area and huge bathroom same lights though  Hotel itself is very popular partly due to Rose bar  If you are guest of the hotel after  PM you have to put reservation no entrance other way  We had a drink around  PM  How fancy bar is well after we ordered drinks we waited for  min and one cocktail came in broken glass no drink napkins and no snacks some tables get them some not random order  One waitress for whole bar  We never came back One suggestion hotel is keen to use red leather in walk in closets my white shirt and vest were colored red due to that  Hotel cleaned them with no extra charge Hotel itself is very nicely orated though these imitations of a night club do have strong limitations   you hardly see numbers in the elevator for example with one of the best staff we encountered around NYC  Form bellboys to front desk and housemaids all of them were very kind and polite  If you go on published rate then I would say it is definitely overrated and not worth the money on the other hand if you get a good deal then try it just be aware   in standard rooms bathrooms your toiletries will have no space just like camping  
P => An updated review    Since I wrote my original review Ive had the opportunity to stay at the Gramercy Park hotel a few more times and my last visit was just plain disappointing  Ive always found the doormenbellhops at this property to be very friendly and really helpful and this time was no different  However on my this visit the man at the front desk who checked me in was extremely cold and when I asked for a room facing Lexington Avenue I was told that I would need to pay more for such a room  They have always accommodated this request in the past and I was surprised by how quickly he turned me down without even looking in to the possibility  Upon entering my room I discovered the wonderful view of an air shaft and the brick building behind the hotel  I also discovered that I could look directly in to other hotel rooms and realized they could do the same  When I went to close the blinds I discovered that one of the blinds was broken forcing me to pull the velvet curtains and make my small room seem even darker and smaller  The room was also half the size of the previous rooms I had stayed in and the trash can still had the previous guests trash inside of it The bathroom was ridiculously small with absolutely no surfaces on which to place a toiletry kit  To top it all off the shower curtain liner was moldy The only redeeming quality of the room was the closet which was a walk in closet and larger than any of the closets I had previously at the hotel The beds are definitely still fabulous and when in NYC a comfy bed is so important after long days of running around In the end I was disappointed  Disappointed that the hotel rewards frequent guests by lowering the quality of their rooms  To me it just seems unacceptable  Im definitely going to reconsider staying there on my next trip and will book myself and the crew that I am traveling with elsewhere  
P => An Instant Classic I am a New York native living on the West Coast and travel frequently for business  I generally stay in  and  star properties and ided to try the Gramercy based on rave reviews from various coworkers  I arrived quite early in the morning after a red eye and was pleasantly surprised that my room was ready at am  Bleary eyed and exhausted I was practically giddy upon entering the standard room  Hardwood floors an incredible bed a large sitting area with a full sized sofa and leather wrapped table wood paneled bathroom with an enormous bathtub and various other delightful features  The room was rather spacious by NYC standards and the space is extremely thoughtfully laid out  I was actually able to entertain people in my sitting area before dinner several nights  Again this was a standard room  The staff was both friendly and helpful and let me into the park twice  Access to the exclysive park is a major bonus as it is gated and private  The park location means peace and quiet are plentiful  If youre looking for a scene you can find it at the hotels Rose Bar  Just be sure to make a reservation if you plan on going after pm  I can honestly say this hotel has won me over and I will be a frequent guest  I was actually sad to leave the room upon check out  Now thats a first  
P => Dark and Musty   Service Not So Good We were recommended to this hotel by American Express Centurion Travel  This hotel is a member of their Fine Hotel and Resorts program  Normally this is a guarantee of at least four to five star category This was a business trip and I didnt research much  The room rate was in the s but AMEX had a third night free deal  Theres no way this hotel is worth this type of rate and by what we saw downstairs at the reception   everybody was getting upgraded quite a bit When we got there there was no bellman for the first five minutes  The one that came was very nice and he helped us go through there rooms before we found one we could stay in Room one had no bathtub Room two smelled strongly of cigarette smoke Room three was a suite The hallways and common areas can be described as a scene from Batman probably where the joker would live pretty much completely painted black but splashed with carnival color accents  The lobby smells of such dank dried in the walls incense that it reminded me of an old greek church  So imagine in your mind a dark dank lobby atmosphere with a booming subwoofer smelling of a monastery The rooms the three I saw all faced a really drab brick building exterior with firewalks and vents  Its no wonder that they paint the blinds black and keep all of the blinds closed  During the day I opened the blinds saw the creepy South Central Los Angeles looking view out the window and with the sunlight streaming in I could see all of the scuffs on the dark walls which normally wouldnt be visible  I closed the blinds and preferred the quotdungeonquot look The bed was very comfortable   great sheets  Room service menu is limited  There are two restaurants an asian restaurant and another one the asian restaurant menu is available only during limited hours In the morning breakfast is served on the garden rooftop  Its kind of like a greenhouse up there with interior seating areas that open to an enclosed but retractable glass area  You cant see how high you are simply because the walls and plants around the perimeter dont allow you a view of the city without standing on your toes  The glass was baked with a patina of city pollution anyway so I dont really know what the view looks like This hotel reminds me of those nights at the bowling alley when they turn on all of the black lights so that everything looks neon and up goes the subwoofer with all of the staff striking poses and trying to look hip If you like any glimpse of daylight you wont find any at this hotel  It is especially creepy during the daylight hours  My friends who live in Alaska tell me that the winters are the hardest   no sun during the daylight hours  Positives Our room was a suite with arate sleeping room   so the size was good  The bed and bedding were super comfy  Oh   you should know you only get one remote control for the two TVs in the arate rooms  When I called about the missing remote for the front room the front desk said quotthe same remote controls both TVsquot Oh  
P => Best Hotel in New York City This is an amazing hotel  The or by Ian Schrager is amazing and definitely makes the overall experience of this hotel a fantastic one My husband and I loved our room  It was a very spacious room with the most beautiful or  Unfortunately my digital camera battery was dead on this trip so I couldnt take any pictures of the room  I will be sure to post some on the next visit we will stay at this hotel every time we travel to NY The bathroom was ent sized and clean  The closet was good though there was not enough space to hang clothing The bedroom was very well layed out and plush  We loved the dark colored tones and the wood paneling on the walls  The flat screen tv could be pulled out and turned to face the bed or the desk  The desk was setup so that one side had a chair and the other side had the couch  A very inative way to arrange the furniture and well thought out The only thing we didnt like about the room was the lack of electrical outlets  Usually we like to plug our cell phones in on the nightstand  There werent any outlets around the bed or in the entire room with the exception of  outlet via the lamp on the desk I had to iron our clothing by plugging the iron into the bathroom plug and using the ironing board in the small hallway Other than that the hotel was fantastic  It is conveniently located off of Gramery Park and within walking distance to the  train  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Nice hotel with shortcomings This is a boutique hotel that has excellent furnishing the bed is amazing and the room or is top notch However the location is not ideal for business travellers as it is rather far from the business district and midtown  The hotel restaurant Wakiya is the weakest link as it is very very pricey but delivers sub par food and is very limited in its menu selection  The service was neither efficient nor firendly Too bad would have recommended this hotel but for Wakiya  
P => Perfect NYC Experience Everything about our stay was perfect  Amazing public spaces  I loved the design throughout the whole hotel including the two bars and the guest rooms  The service was very attentive and the staff was extremely warm and proffessional  The am concierge was stellar   All around this was a memorable NYC experience 
P => Overpriced and disappointing Positive things first The design of the rooms is great and they are spacious  The roof garden is by far the best that I have seen in New York and the overall atmosphere of the hotel are what I had hoped for  Location is excellent  On the other hand the hotel did definitely not live up to my expectations which admittedly were rather high given the steep price ever for New York  Staff are not very helpful service at the roof garden is painfully slow  Maid service is poor a dirty towel that apparently had been used for cleaning had been left in the sink soap etc was not re stocked etc etc  We had to call twice and it took the hotel more than  hours to have the safe opened that had been left open but with the bolts locked by the previous guests  Shower is absurdly small given the rather spacious bathrooms  Windows are old and do not absorb the outside noise  The roof garden was closed for a private function during  nights of our  nights stay  I did not have any trouble with accessing the Rose bar   as the bar was always empty we did not even intend to have a drink there    Concierge was very kind but in the end did not manage to secure us a table at one of their highly recommended restaurants even on a Sunday night All in all I thought the hotel was overpriced for what they offer service room and style can be found with other New York hotels Royalton The London NYC as well for much better value  I will not stay there again 
P => Poor Service Dark rooms    it just doesnt live up The Gramercy was quite a disappointment  The Roof top staff were unbelieveably slow with very few guests  Service is not a priority   they werent even friendly  Pour the coffee   after it took  minutes to make   and go  Our room   an upgraded suite   had a toilet and shower in one room   the bathroom door hit the toilet the room was so small  You couldnt open the shower door and the bathroom door at the same time   they would hit each other  Picture that  that is how small the bathroom is The sink which was in the hallway had a very bright light fixture on one side of the mirror and nothing except a dark brown wall on the other  Absolutely impossible for putting on make up etc  The Asian restaurant was excellent   the best part of our stay The mostly male hotel staff seemed more for looks than service  Most times I had to look for someone to help us with the door inout of the Hotel and I got my own cab most times too  
P => horrible service overrated and overpriced Horrible service inattentive staff non existent client customer relationship experience and not worth the price at all  Food is mediocre at best  
P => Awesome hotel This is our third visit in  months and we cant get enough of this hotel It exceeds our expectations each time we stay  It is not the typical sterile New York hotel  The location on Gramercy Park is perfect for most everything you want to do in New York Everything about the hotel is unique and interesting  It starts with the unique or and terrific artwork but the most outstanding part is the customer experience  From the greeting of the door man to the check in concierge and room service everything was perfect  The entire staff has been expertly trained in making sure you have everything you need and are happy with your stay  The roof top bar is a wonderful place to have a cozy cocktail and the Rose Bar is a happening place to be after PM  The food isoutstanding at Wakiya as well The total experience created here is one that we enjoy and can highly recommend  
P => Loved Staying At Gramercy Park I just returned from a three night stay at this hotel  My son and I were visiting New York University and wanted to stay at a hotel that was different from the every day hotel experience  This hotel did not disappoint Yes the hallways and or are a little dark  I loved it Theres a nice aroma to the lobby and elevators    it smells like cedar wood and perhaps a perfumed oil  We both found it to be very pleasant The actual rooms are somewhat lighter    although definitely not bright  The walls of our room were light blue which brightened up the or    plus there are plenty of lamps and one can always open the blinds during the day  The bathroom was very nice as were the toiletry products  Theres an in room safe and a refrigeratorbar area The television in our room was set to the left of the beds but that didnt really bother us as we stayed out all day and evening and by the time we landed we only read a bit and then went to sleep The hotel front desk concierge and doorman were all very helpful and friendly  Housekeeping did an excellent and timely job The location was great and I highly highly recommend Sushi Samba which is just a block down and about a block over from the hotel  It was delicious and very trendy sushi restaurant If I were to list any cons    they would be The rooftop restaurant is lovely but  each for a breakfast meal an omelette and fancy tasty hashbrowns along with  orange juice and  coffee was a little much  We did enjoy it one time however and the food was delicious  In the opinion of a caffeine addict there should always be a coffee pot and coffee provided as a free amenity in hotels    especially a hotel of this class Other than that I have nothing negative to say about our experience at the Gramercy Park Hotel 
P => Almost loved The Gramercy Park Hotel This was my first stay at Gramercy Park and I love the or the vibe and the furniture  The room set up is wonderful with a king size bed big dining table that has two end chairs and couch so you can work entertain etc in your room  The restaurant is wonderful and the roof top garden restaurant is great for breakfast and lunch  There were some problems the heatingcooling system was not reated so the radiators are VERY loud and clank any time the heating element kicks on the thermostat was a constant problem even after being replaced with a new one  The bathrooms are very small and the room although very cool in design is as dark as a cave even with all the lights on  With all that being said I enjoyed my stay here and will stay here again on my next trip with ear plugs  The location is perfect service is excellent food is fabulous room service is great and quick  
P => A lot of problems especially relative to price We spent a weekend at the hotel  For  we paid for the quotdeluxe loftquot room we expected more First the room itself is very very dark  There arent enough lamps and all the furniture is dark too  Its a bit depressing  The hotel is also dark in general   the corridors are almost black The prices of everything are exaggerated   the mini bar the hotel restaurants the room service and especially international phone calls   we were charged about minute for an international call and a small glass of orange juice is  We didnt go to the Gramercy Park itself since we saw it from our room and in the winter it looks like a cemetery not a park  Its also very small The service in the hotel isnt very good  We requested early check in came at  and had to wait an hour for our room  I also asked for Champagne to be put in the room before we arrive and it wasnt   I had to remind the hotel staff and wait additional time for that  We did get a complementary chocolate cake for the birthday we were celebrating however it wasnt tasty  I also emailed the hotel before coming about the champagne and didnt get a reply In addition when we wanted to use the quotbusiness centerquot a tiny room with a printer to print something it was always busy in the lobby only one person can use it and in the upper floor the printer didnt work  The location is good   quiet but still close to Union Square Broadway etc To sumize   were not experts in NYC hotels but I think for this kind of money we couldve found something better be less quotstylishquot but with better value for money  
P => Style with feeling This hotel is all about style so if that annoys you well gosh stay at the riott quis  With that out of the way the Grammercy Park is one hotel that really pulls off the high style look but in a comfortable even homey downtown way  Our King room done in rich colors and lush fabrics was ample almost large with a super bathroom sink and walk in shower  The flat screen TV and I pod sound dock was really appreciated and the bed was huge firm and ked out in fine cottons  We didnt hear a peep from neighboring rooms or the street we were on the th floor  Loved the rooftop garden and it makes a great nightclub    The guest breakfast was a little meager and with sub par fruit hope they can spruce that up  Loved the bars downstairs with lovely waitress nice bartenders and a well behaved local crowd  The concierge and doormen were outgoing and easy on the eyes If you dont like it here sorry there is something not right with you  I We could have stayed inside the hotel all weekend and feel like we really did NYC   
P => Elegant but naive The hotel is superbly furnished in the common parts and in the rooms although our bathroom was really small  The two bars are fantastic and very popular as well as the Chinese restaurant apparently one of the best in NY  Negative comments on the service concierge and bar staff not as helpful as expected essentially little experienced and made arrogant by the quotpopularity of the hotelquot  I hope some further practice in customer hosting will help filling the gap between image and substance  
P => Very Chic We chose this hotel to celebrate our th anniversary and were ultimately pleased with our choice  We stayed one night  We arrived at  AM and our room was already available  We had read on this site that the noise from the bar was distracting to guests on the lower floors  I never heard the bar and had no problems on the th floor  The hallways are extremely dark must be part of the glam or but the room was very nice  The furnishings and prints were very eclectic and well coordinated  The room was clean and comfortable  We went up to the rooftop enclosed bar for a drink before dinner  Evidently only hotel guests have access to this bar  It was very nice and had a great view  Since we told the hotel ahead of time that it was our anniversary they provided complimentary champagne  a nice touch The neighborhood was very nice and convenient Overall a pleasant and worthwhile experience  
P => Cool and different We booked this following a recommendation for our wedding anniversary  I was arriving after  hours of flying and looking forward to some relaxation  My wife was there for the shoppingThe entrance is very impressive warm and dark filled with the exclusive scent of the GPH candles   We had booked a standard room which was typically New York and tiny  I hurriedly upgraded to a Loft room which was great I booked a massage at the spa and relaxed completely while my wife went shopping The bar is not bad and crowded after ten but the rooftop area is really great with views around Manhattan I would definitely stay here again although it is not cheap 
P => what a cool spot My husband and I were in town for a wedding and ided to stay at theGramercy Park Hotel after reading that it was a cool spot  I have tosay it was one of my more memorable stays and for good reason  Thestaff was always on hand for any and all needs we had  My husband hadnever seen a broadway show so the concierge arranged us tickets  Ourcar service was always on time  Really felt like a true VIP  Oh anddid I mention the celeb sightings in the Rose Bar Definitely aneexperience  
P => Disappointing I agree with the negative reviews below  I feel the hotel tries to be too many things to too many people  Its a fashionable nightclub type place for New Yorkers and attempts to be a hotel as well  We stayed in a room just below the roof top bar and the thumping from above was just dreadful  We had just flown in from Europe and wanted a rest and there was a private party going on above us  The way I see it youre either a hotel or youre a nightclub not both  OR at the very least sort out your noise insulation  And pls pls pls repair the screeching lift   its embarrassing   We left at am on our first night  
P => Great Experience I had stayed at a few of Schragers hotels Mondrian Delano and the Hudson but this looked nothing like them  The Gramercy Park has more personality to it which I like and more interesting orations  Theres some serious art in the lobby bars and even in the rooms Basquiat Twombly Hirst Warhol Schnabel so the overall feeling is more bohemianthan modern  Theres a garden bar on the roof for hotel guests which is really beautiful and a Chinese restaurant from Nobu that opened right after my stay there  The staff was very attentive and despite my short stay managed to remember my name the k of a great hotel  Its a shame that tourists dont normally get to see the Gramercy Park area so Id highlyrecommend the GPH for anyone that wants a completely different type of experience  
P => Treated Like Royalty From the moment the handsome doorman opened my cabbies door and I was ushered into the art filled lobby of the Gramercy Park Hotel I knew that my weekend stay at Ian Schragers hotel was one I would remember forever  I was impressed with the size of my bedroom as I remember hearing stories about how small Schragers hotel rooms were known for  I felt immediately at home in the unique room    though my home certainly wouldnt compare to the glamour of the space    The drinks were amazing in the Jade Bar   I love the intimacy of the little bar   the perfect place for a sneaky afternoon glass of wine    and the roof terrace was gorgeous    Im surprised there werent busses of tourists trying to get up there as it has to be the best view in the city I would recommend the grammercy park hotel to anyone who needs some TLC for weekend in new york  
P => loved the public areas hated the rooms The Rose Bar and the Private Roof Club are great    very enjoyable and lovely atmosphere especially the roof club which is wonderful for afternoon drinks but even that doesnt balance out the rooms which are so anticlimactic I felt I had to leave the rooms to appreciate being there Roomservices was disappointing and my morning coffee was always so cold when it arrived  Despite booking multiple rooms I traveled with a big group of friends when we tried to reserving a table at the Rose Bar the staff was uncooperative  Worse yet they gave us a problem at the door when a few friends joined us that werent guests of the hotel    and by problem I do mean they were quite rude Id definitely recommend W the Court over this any day    their rooms are bigger their bar is nicer and all their staff is much friendlier  
P => non pareil incredible Incredibly chic incredibly beautiful and aesthetically pleasing in ALL ways  Anything you needed in a hotel room was already there beautiful crystal luxe cotton velvet draperies io badescu bath products in the bathroom hand set ceramic tiles deep english bathtub   exquisite color scheme sage green and claret walnut floors  NO NOISE whatsoever in room  Attentive and gracious staff  All of these things and more will make this my hotel of choice in NYC  So beautiful one could come to the room and never leave to see the city  Jade bar and adjoining salon very romantic   stars  
P => Beautiful Hotel not so beautiful service I ll start out with the good points    the bellmen were wonderful and inviting  The bellman we had were engaging and professional everytime we came in contact with them  The lobby is beautiful and original with a royal feel to it  The rooms are very English feeling with dark colored walls and rich fabrics I thought the room was amazing and the bed was very comfortable  The location was close to just about everything and the neighborhood is pretty quiet and very posh  The roof top bar has a wonderful view and a charming atmosphere  The bad side of our hotel stay had to do with the placement of our suite on the third floor we very unfortunately were right above the bar which at night on the weekend can stay open until  am  I called three times about the noise the first was around  and was told the music would be turned down  We left the hotel for about an hour and a half because we could barely hear the movie we rented We came back and the noise was still very loudcontinous thumping of the bass I called the front desk again and was told the music would be turned down  At  I called one last time saying the music was too loud and was told by the front desk that my complaint had been brought to the managers attention and that they had turned down the music already  At that time I was also told we only had about an hour and a half left before the bar closed and that it was very late so we could not change suites at this time  I have a hard time being diplomatic about noise when the main reason people go to a hotel is to have a place to sleep and at   a night I do expect to be able to go to sleep before am if I chose  The lack of hospitality at the front desk and the room attendant vacuuming outside our door at  the next morning just added to my dislike of the serviceremembering we were awake until   I spoke again with the front desk the following day inquiring if the bar would be open till am again on Sunday night they said quotNoquot but when I explained about our sleepless night I got a shrug and an quotOh Reallyquot  but not a sorry or is there anything we can do to make your stay more pleasant  I feel this quotbeautifulquot hotel should invest in some hospitality training and also they have been open awhile they should know not to place people in the rooms above the bar due to the noise on the weekends  No matter how nice a hotel looks it should feel even better     
P => excellent gramercy park hotel gramercy park is a new gorgeous hotel in new york trendy sophisticatedwith a beautiful lobby mix of contemporary and gothic and a stunning terrace where you can have brekfast or have a evening drink rooms are not too big but good size for ny with very confortable bedsservice is always attentive and the restaurant at ground floor really excellentwith a tuch of newyorker social life we found this hotel much better than the oldest fashion trendy sohos hotel as mercer and soho grand only the consierge is not too friendly i defintly suggest gramercy if you like new fashion chic hotel  
P => Grand Hotel with an eyeblink to Art It is a Grand Hotel  I want to say that first  But the more you get to know GPH the more it will surprise you I had stayed three nights at the NY Palace between th ampMadison and changed hotel for my last night in NY This hotel is a  star NYC Hotel but you can easily understand that is different Its not where grand hotels are  Its in the Gramercy District where Lexington finishes just on Gramercy Park  Great location if you want to visit SoHo or TriBeCa It has not the staff that luxury hotels have  The management must have organized sort of a competition among the nicest girls and guys of NY to find its employees  Beautiful girls at the reception or goodlooking bellmen in black tie different uniform form hotel luxury hotels will welcome you on your arrival  I have to mention even the friendly and helpful Concierge Staff Beyond the entrance door in the lobby Warhol and Basquiat paintings make you step back  Everything in that lobby tastes of art Have a drink or play pool onthe red leather pool table in the Jade Bar  Youll see NY moving in that place   Ive personally tried a One Suite Bedroom  Great As many amenities as a modern luxury hotel should have and more be    iPod nano with ready to go playlists and JBL On STAGE II Speakers will give a rythm to your stay  I also appreciated the   inches LCD TVs the io Badescu Lotions the design bathrooms with Frette bathrobes and the great italian Linen Once youve seen your room you have to know that it is a Bazar   YOU CAN BUY ANYTHING YOU SEE IN YOUR ROOM not the beds I mean but umbrellas ipods crystal glasses and prices are often too high Poor Breakfast  I had breakfast included rate and so I got it but theyll charge you  for a Cappuccino that is pretty unfair as we had to pay for hot beverages and no one form the hotel had mentioned thatPrices  I got a deal for the suite at  as there was an offer for ust but prices are about to raise vertically    the normal rate for that suite goes from  to  Try GPH at least once when you go to NY  Im sure you wont regret your previous Grand Hotel  
P => Fabulous hotel My husband amp I stayed at the Gramercy Park hotel over the weekend of y st  We booked our room through the hotel website which has special weekend rates  Part of the deal included a free upgrade based on availability  We arrived early in the morning on a redeye and were able to check in to our substantially upgraded room early  I cant say I would have been as pleased with the hotel had we been given our quotentry levelquot standard superior room as Im sure it was significantly smaller but we loved our loft category room  The rooms are a bit dark and the lighting isnt that functional but the beds are wonderful bathroom products are great and the or is truly unique  The rooftop bar was closed for a party saturday night be we did wander up during the day and could see it would be a great place to have a cocktail at night  If you plan to visit the Rose Bar after pm be sure to make reservations it is a hot spot in NY  If I had a complaint it would be the food from Room service food which was expensive no surprise for NY and not that tasty  All and all the hotel is beautiful with an attentive staff and cool vibe  
P => Best hotel in NYC Really there should be more than  stars to rate the Gramercy  It is exceptional  Much more than a hotel To give you an idea of this reviewer my husband and I have been fortunate in our work to have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world  Hands down   Gramercy Park Hotel is our absolute favorite and this was our first stay The reviewer from Barcelona said it best   the place is phenomenally gorgeous the staff offer service and a graciousness as if Gramercy is their own BampB and everything about it is top notch  Worth every single penny  Every single employee at the Gramercy has a warm attentive relaxed vibe  Philip and Max at the door were prompt gracious and fun to chat with  David eno the manager at the concierge is delightful  David the driver yes you get a free ride in a  class Mercedes up to  blocks anywhere Book with concierge was very kind and remembered our names and lives from the first ride  I regret not remembering all the front desk staffs names but each and every person we encountered were incredibly generous and kind We booked a suite at the last minute and it was everything we could have hoped for  Gorgeous very roomy nice lighting and details  We had booked just a suite without preference so didnt have a park view to which the front desk offered us complementary upgraded for the nd night without our asking we brought our baby this trip   who wants to move  Perhaps not mentioned in other reviews is that you have full access to Gramercy Park   a highly coveted private park which unfortunately happens to have museum like stuffiness  Ive known life long New Yorkers whove never entered this gated park  Just ask the door guys to let you in and call them to leave  Get the picture It is lovely however   The roof is wonderful and the drinks  food are expensive but the real selling point of Gramercy is its people  I cant go on enough about them  I finally had to ask one of the door guys about it   really everyone acted if they had ownership in the place   he said working there is as comfortable as a family and most have worked together for years even before the Gramercy  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO UPTIGHTNESS ABOUT THE PLACE  Its comparable to coming home  Truly  This is important to mention because in our stays of some other beautiful places youll run into a snooty bellman or stuffy front desk  Perhaps you request extra toiletries and attitude arrives  At the Gramercy however housekeeping brought a bagful of soaps with a smile I could go on amp on about the beautiful interiors but other reviewers have described the Gramercy immaculately  Simply put   we returned relaxed like we had spent our days on holiday instead of  hour workdays and meetings We made friendships here and cannot wait to return to our home in NY  I immediately booked corporate rates for our frequent trips  Well never stay at another hotel in NYC  Does that convince you 
P => We loved our stay at the Gramercy Park My husband and I stayed the week of th of y and to be honest we were weary of staying at the Gramercy because of the bad reviews I had read on this site  A week before checking in I called the concierge Thomas and he got us reservations to Nobu and Peter Lugers and tickets to two plays we wanted to see  His service was great and once arriving at the hotel we were treated really well by all the employees there  We loved our room and would definetely recommend this hotel  The last hotel we stayed at was the Soho House and although we enjoyed that area we overall liked the service and the rooms at the Gramercy  
P => Sexy beyond belief the Gramercy is worth every dime  The excellence of the Hotel Gramercy Park began the moment we walked through the revolving front door into the sumptuous delightfully fragranced lobby Immediately upon our super early arrival at am on th of y we were accommodated with a room  Phillipe the bellman was solicitious to us as well as running interference between us and a  colorful neighborhood type  who apparently visits the lobby quite often  We were brought up to our room on the th floor a  Deluxe Loft Room  at a price of  for  nights including all taxes and daily breakfast for two   approx  per night  However it did not have a view  I requested that we have a view and in a pleasant manner I called down to Jamie at the front desk  I explained to him that this was my boyfriend s first visit to NYC and that we would really appreciate a view  They moved us to room  arguably the best room in the hotel with an entry with two double windows on to the park and then a arate bedroom with glass door and lovely velvet drapes everywhere into the bed area  I later found out that this is the  Park one bedroom suite  and usually goes for twice the price of the room we had booked and paid for It was amazing in every way  The rooms are wonderfully photographed on the Gramercy Park Hotel website so I wont bother with the descriptions too terribly other than to say the everything was in excellent condition clean and well maintained  There were literally stacks upon stacks of fluffy white towels in the bathroom  And as has been explained before the toiletries are amazing At night the turn down service lights a special scented votive in a lovely red cut glass hurricane lamp  I believe it is the same scent that they have in the lobby   wonderful and the candles can be bought from the hotel for   Worth every penny to remind me of this place This is a special hotel sexy beyond words  The gym and spa are microscopic sure but they are very well laid out and maintained  The two treadmills have a view to the park and the two elliptical machines have a partial view  The massage I had with Ernst was one of the best in my LIFE  There is a refrigerator full of pint sized bottles of water also with a bowl of apples upon it   so you can stock up and save if that s important to you  It s not a priority to my man and I as we splurge on room service often  The room service food itself was fantastic  We had on different occasions the salmon and caviar plate super good with generous amounts of smoked salmon and salmon roe toast points and cr me fraiche the tuna tataki tasty fresh bright red tuna but unfortunately with chopped bits of   why oh why   watermelon   mixed in the macaroni and cheese fantastic swirls of mac with just enough cheese to coat the spirals and with toasted breadcrumbs on top the cookie plate sort of  meh  other than the fresh baked chocolate chunk cookies which were better than average but not spectacular  Breakfast is where room service is the way to go if you can t make it up to the AMAZING roof terrace  We did the breakfast included and he could get his favorite American breakfast with eggs a meat toast potatoes coffee and juice  I got the continental the usual coffee but they allowed me to substitute a double cap for no extra charge the fresh squeezed juice breads   including dang good pain chocolat   and then I would add on yoghurt every day  The food always came super promptly they warn you when you call how long it will take and even one busy night it only took  minutes when they said it could be up to  and at the appropriate temperatures The mini bar they call it the  English Bar  is simply fantastic  Yes the prices are typical mini bar high but few mini bars have such good stuff I won t list it all but my favorites were the bottles of Diet Coke in little old school mini bar bottles the Godiva liquor the Dean and Deluca cheese straws and the Orangina  Lots of goodies to buy in the mini bar as well though  for the hotel signature candle seemed steep  Also in the bar is a spot that you can insert your iPod or the hotel will loan you one but don t lose it or you are set back  and it blares tunes out at a suitable loudness for the entire room The rooftop private club is the best reason to book this hotel  We loved it and spent nearly every waking moment there as we are pretty much homebodies when it comes to traveling  There are a variety of environments up on the roof and you  bring a guest or a few guests to enjoy the experience with you  Of the various seating areas two of them have massive flat screen TV s with CNN playing all day  I would prefer to have something else playing and the volume was off anyhow but I never bothered to ask  The help was always accommodating in every way quickly serving us food and drinks with very little wait even on busy Friday nights and Saturday cocktail hour I found in fact the service to be quite good if not utterly flawless in all departments  For example everyone was always pleasant and checked back with you to see if you needed more of something or another  On the other hand on evening I ordered a glass of Veuve Cliquot rose along with my late night cr me brulee dessert and it was not the right champagne  They sent something blonde not pink  I called room service and was told they would send up the proper glass of bubbly  Then they called back and said they needed the other glass of the wrong liquid returned  It seemed a bit cheesy to ask for that though of course we obliged  On another hand we sent two shirts out on y th a holiday in the midday and asked if we could have them back the next day by the evening and they actually got them back by mid afternoon  The shoeshine was also quickly turned around and was as such things should be complimentary On another service note there were some discrepancies in the attention to the replacement of toiletries in the room  When we initially checked in there was no conditioner in the shower  Sometimes we got new shampoo and conditioner as well as replacement facial wash and lotion  Sometimes we did not  We never got fresh soap after the nd day which I found oddest of all  Occasionally we would get two shower caps and no cotton kit  But that I had to ask TWICE to have the mini bar restocked was a bit of a shame as we would have happily gobbled down more to the hotel s profit if they had stocked on a daily basis The concierge was helpful and remembered my request for nightly reservations to the Rose Bar  The door boys none old enough to be called door men were not always in sight when we exited but then they would appear outside to hail us a cab  One evening we were fortunate enough to be able to utilize a town car that happened to be in front of our hotel  The cost was only about   more than a taxi and pleasantly luxurious As a side note if you can secure a reservation Again American Express Platinum concierge helped with this try to eat at Per Se  It was divine To sum the experience up I would definitely stay at the Gramercy Park hotel again if I could afford it  It is certainly not inexpensive our bill for the mini bar Rose Bar and room service was equal to our  night room stay but the value is superb in comparison to for example our stays at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris or the Hotel San Clemente in Venice  Also it is sexy and chic   a place to certainly brag to people about and which like its mate the Delano in Florida has a glitz unequalled to nearly any other hotel in the Big Apple  
P => Style no substance      Gramercy Park Hotel was i hoped different to the other Schrager hotels that typically age badly and have awful services and rooms The communal areas downstairs and on the roof k are the highlights of this hotel   As is typical with all Schrager properties its a great place to visit for a night out but theres zero reason to stay here  For an evening out call ahead and book access to the bar downstairs or the roof k  But definitely stay elsewhere  All the money has been spent on the bars downstairs  The hotel itself has cheap shoddy rooms shower didnt work properly wall paint was peeling room   For  a night thats unnacceptable  Breakfast was ordered and never arrived  Staff were apologetic and i wasnt charged  Errors do happen  Unfortunately it confirms the GPH as typically Schrager all style no substance  
P => Great friendly athmospere In short the vibe at the hotel is great  As soon as you walk into the lobby you are greeted by the nice musky smell emanating from the fireplace in the back of the lobby The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly and the service at the rooftop restaurantbar was great  I was immediately made feel welcome by the young concierges and the rest of the staff who were all helpful and cool to talk with  So often at these more hip hotels the staff just doesnt seem to care about the customers but thats definitely not the case at the Gramercy I didnt try the bar on the ground floor which is one of the hottest places in NYC right now and the queues in the evenings proved that  The or did look very nice from the outside  Unfortunately I didnt have time to check the bar  The breakfast was great at the roof top as was the view The room   was very small  The or and everything is top of the line and the bed is very comfy but while you have a tub in the bathroom you have no space for toiletries  Also the chic design lamp in the bathroom obscured a bit of the mirror so stupidly enough shaving was a bit difficult since I had to squeeze to the other side of the mirror  All the provided toiletries are great and theres plenty of towels etc My room was also very dark with a window to an alleyway  The hotel seems to prefer dark since all the hallways and the lobbies were pretty dark too  I know my colleagues rooms were also very dark The comfortable and hip vibe and the friendly staff will definitely make me comeback to the Gramercy  The location is great too with everything quite close by but theres also enough peace and quiet  
P => Sensual Textures and Colors From the richly painted green red or blue walls in the rooms to the splash of the royal blue throw on the bed this hotel is a sensual experience   oh and the pillows are amazing  Really I emailed the hotel to find out where I could get them  It took them about two months to respond to me but the email was about pillows for goodness sake so no big deal  After having stayed at The Hudson Hotel another Schrager creation I was shocked at the size of the spacious rooms at The Gramercy Park Hotel Indeed The Hudson is not designed to be spacious  I think I read somewhere that their goal is to get you out of your room  Anyhow the bathroom was fantastic at The Gramercy Park and could double as a sauna with the deep rich woodwork and the shower is huge Fantastic toilettries as well  definite plus  Back to the rooms I love that the rooms have iPod docking stations but certainly the biggest draw of this hotel would be the textured fabrics and richness of the colors in the rooms and common areas  I havent seen the rooftop yet but I hear its fantastic  Also the Rose Bar is a must but be forewarned that the cocktails are obviously crazy over priced  
P => Good looking but dumb We spent  nights at GPH  The look and feel is carefully crafted packaged quotcoolquot which Schrager is a genius at  The design is great and unique  Where they fall very flat is in service  My husband said it best They just dont have their act together  Room service is just awful   the food is what you would find in missouri and it takes up to an hour just to get ice  The staff is polished charming and incompetent  They promise and dont deliver  All this would be reasonable if i werent in a  a night suite  The member of the family who liked GPH best was our  y ear old dhter because she is not interested in a good hotel she just wants to feel hip and grown up  If you need that head straight to GPH youll have lots of company  If youre looking for a top tier hotel go elsewhere  
P => Best New York Stay of my Life I always love visiting New York the culture that it has to offer is like no other city  I make a point to seek out the newest and most unique sites hotels and restaurants My past trip to the city I stayed at the Gramercy Park Hotel and was blown away by the ambiance and their service  The or was so plush and comofortable that I had a had quite the time pulling myself away from the hotel All I wanted to do was luxuriate in my room and visit the spa for a little TLC If you are looking for an incredible and one of a kind experience this is the place to go     There are original Warhols and Schnabels hanging throughout the hotel and are focal points of the beautiful Rose Bar I felt like New Yorks art scene was brought to me I know that not everyone is interested in people watching but part of the fun in staying at the Gramercy was the stream of celebs that came to party at their new private roof club  I do believe that I saw the Olsen twins this past Tuesday Next time you are in the city check out the Gramercy Park Hotel     It is seriously an experience in of itself  
P => Its a Special Hotel I stayed here with a friend il    I thought this was a very unique hotel spotlessly clean and luxurious  Staff was friendly  Hotel and area are very quiet We took advantage of going into Gramercy Park to enjoy the flowers and have a look at the velous residences surrounding the park  While at the park a local lady told us how to get the best photo   looking down Lexington towards the Chrysler Bldg If youre looking for something different this is the place I hope to stay here again  
P => Attention to details location and friendly employees I stayed at the Gramercy Park Hotel on il th  Checked in around pm with no problems at all  A fire was burning in the lobby real and there is this very distinct smell  Earthy    pleasant  Almost familiar but not completely I loved it Later I found out that it is a custom blended fragrance and you can buy the candle to take home So anyway    the bellman took me up to the room and gave me the grand tour  Once he was gone I had the chance to really take it all in I travel a lot    I see a lot of hotels  I see a lot of fancy hotels that are furnished with Pier One type stuff which is ok  The GPH is furnished with artisan creations  I had to admire the quality of the rug bed leather desk chairs art and other furnishings  There are plenty of lights and large windows so I did not have any problems with the room being dark during the daytime  At night it was a tad on the dim side but not that bad  There is a huge plasma TV in the room and crazy luxury items in the mini bar  The mini bar had everything from Coke to Remy tin  MampM s to luxury bath products  And it is not one of those annoying auto charge systems  I was able to keep my  special  water chilled without any problems The big fluffy bed was very comfortable and after a long day of travel I was happy to see that I was pretty much guaranteed a ent night sleep It was warm outside and I had no trouble adjusting the temperature of the room to my preference The big windows faced the front of the hotel with the park to the right  I thought it was a nice view    Obviously this hotel attracts a lot of interesting people  I wish I could have seen the people coming and going better from my window but I was just beyond the point of face recognition  The room was absolutely silent  No noise at all  Possibly there are noise ordinances in this part of Manhattan It is a very quiet area in general  No sirens no trash trucks nothing There were  floral arrangements in the room   next to the bed  next to the sink and one in the bathshower Which brings me to the bathroom  I LOVED this bathroom I only wish I could duplicate it at homeIn the center was a lovely brown ble counter with a huge Corian sink  There was a beautiful floral arrangement next to the sink  It looked like Asparagus with flowers To the right was a room with the toilet with a frosted glass door  To the left was the custom tubshower combo  At first I was disappointed that there was no tub but then I noticed that the enclosure was a huge roman looking tub  Made of tile the  bathtub  is about    deep  feet wide and  feet long  I could be totally wrong about those dimensions but it was big  There was an overhead shower head a hand held shower head and a faucet  All operate independently and all had good pressure even when using at the same time There is a large bench built in to this showerbath and one side is shaped like the curve of your back so you can lay down in a reclining position There is a large functioning window and a vase with fresh foliage Obviously I was quite taken by this  in less than  hours I used it  timesThe bath products are also impressive  Hamadi hair products Hakansson liquid cleanser Lather bar soap and io Badescu lotion  It was like someone hand picked the best products at hora The products are all oz which meant I had plenty to bring home There was a little card in the bathroom that mentioned that they used a selection of products listed as the  Best of  in Allure magazine  I am not sure if these rotate or change periodically but I suppose you can t go wrong with any selection There were  Frette robes slippers and plenty of soft towels  Also I noticed one linen hand towel  A nice touch and it was soft not over starched The slippers are in a cotton drawstring bag the laundry bag is cotton the shoe bag is cottonAgain  details Now hopefully I am not out of space   The Park The hotel gave me a key to Gramercy Park and I could not resist the urge to check it out How anyone could say this is not a nice little park It is simply beautiful  There is a wide variety of blooming plants squirrels robins and other songbirds  The park has a walking path in the shape of an oval and it sort of crisscrosses the park in the middle You are not allowed on the grass but there are many benches available It is clean and peaceful  A perfect place to watch people walk by inside the gate and out  I took my camera and took photos of the various varieties of flowers  There were lots of toddlers playing in the center section and people spending a sunny afternoon reading  I adored it I took a stroll around the perimeter and wondered what sort of people lived in the grand lofts and apartments that surround the park Now THAT S a neighborhood where I would like to liveThe next morning check out was a breeze    and the lobby still smelled really good  I can only hope that I am lucky enough to stay at the GPH again  
P => We loved the Gramercy My husband and I got ried at the Gramercy Park Hotel on the th il  We had a fantastic time  We stayed there for a week  The staffwere excellent especially David Eddie and Adrienne the concierges  They were really helpful prior to our stay when we were emailing them constantly about our future wedding and during our stay too  They just couldnt do enough for us whether it was for booking a table at the restaurant organising my hair and make up or checking availability for tickets to see The Knicks The porters too were also extremely friendly The location is excellent make sure you go to quotPetes Tavernquot around the corner for a drink or two and stay for the biggest steak youve ever seenIt is true that our room was a little dark but it was fitted with the best equipment  Dont forget to bring your I Pod our room had its own docking station We were staying at the Gramercy on a room only basis and it is true that breakfast is expensive we had it a couple of times and it was lovely but walk out of the hotel across to Irving Place and youll find a fantastic coffee shop where we spent a lot of time The toiletries by Hamadi in the bathroom are amazing I would definitively recommend you buy some whilst over in NYC  Housekeeping staff were also very friendly and efficient  You could also benefit from a turn down service at night if you wished The Rose Bar were we got ried is excellent but again you should expect higher than average price for drinks and food  The music is always fantastic and after ten it becomes the place to be for young and trendy new yorkers they also have a DJ playing some excellent music If it is quality you are after which we were the Gramercy is the place to go  We will absolutely stay at the Gramercy again and would recommend this hotel to anyone going to New York especially if you are looking for somewhere really different and special  
P => Lovely hotel We stayed here for a week with our  and  year old and had a great time  We originally booked a small suite and found on the first night that our sofa bed was broken  They brought an airbed for the kids but in the morning when I called the front desk and explained that I didnt want to deal with the airbed for the whole week they upgraded us to a park suite which was great Plenty of closet room a great shower plenty of windows which was great   from previous stays in this hotel  Ive noticed it can be a bit darkThe neighborhood is great quiet with plenty of places to walk  The staff was friendly and professional  We would definitely stay here again  
P => Great atmosphere nice people but dark and sometimes over expensive Nice hotel great bar nice people good service location ok the rooms are extremely dark and cold the bathroom are too small and have no bath in the suites but love the Hamadi products Breakfast is good room service are fine but extremely expensive The rooms are confortable but dark and noisy  We stayed with our three children and the staff was helpful and easy but we would have needed more space and light  
P => NYC gem  We had an excellent weekend at The Gramercy Park Hotel  The room was comfortable and well appointed staff were very professional and friendly  The in room dining was very good especially chocolate truffles upon arrival   Housekeeping was very nice and all of the maids were really professional and super fast while making up the rooms  The door people are great and made us feel welcome at the hotel  I will absolutely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone heading to New York for either business or pleasure  
P => Gramercy hotel Schragers losing it    The trouble with this place is that it relies to heavily on image and the name Schrager  Staff are very young and although sharp simply do not have the type of experience required to make guests at their hotel feel in any way special over ordinary members of the public visiting the hotel  This is reflected by their attitude towards reservations for the Rose Bar by hotel guests and also in general when in our case there are problems with the booking itself  We made a reservation  months in advance  We specified a smoking room with a bathtub  A week before we received an email enquiring what sort of time wed be arriving and our flight details  Impressive  However when we arrived three hours later than the informed time after delays from london to nyc we were given a non smoking room with a shower instead  After speaking to the front desk at some length and waiting minutes we were told taht a room to our specification would take a while to prepare  By now it was am london time and we were ready to drop  However we had to have drinks in the bar while waiting  No one came to keep us informed and another hour later we enquired and were shown our room  The room was very nice but we ended up in one of the nicest rooms of that level room    The night manager offered us room service on the house but when we ordered our  courses each we immediately got a call from him to say taht the limit was  bucks  I cant remember the weasels name but mate  if you are going to offer something dont be cheap about it otherwise just dont bother  Whats  bucks mean in a  a night room The guy was  years old or something with clearly a long way to go before he learns the ropes of sophisticated customer liason Anyhow we liked the hotel itself and the behind the scenes staff like room service house keeping were very industrious and helpful  Front desk were a little on the hopeless side  I agree with the lady who wrote about false advertising  We too expected the roof bar to be open and yet it was still being built  NOBODY mentioned that it would be closed  I suggest that anyone who goes to this hotel lodges a formal complaint and applies for compensation as its bordering on unlawful to obtain money for a misrepresented product or service in any country let alone the U S of A  Schrager must really be losing it if hes resorting to this sort of keting  its really below the belt and not simply slipshod  By law you are entitled to damages for loss of enjoyment or disappointment especially for example if you say you were there specifically to photograph on or from the roof terrace or that this was the main reason for your staying at the gramercy  I am appalled that this sort of advertising is not regulated in a country where people sue someone for sneezing in their direction  Having said that the roof terrace will be completed soon  Anyhow the thing is the hotel is cute to look at and the Jade bar which I personally preferred to the Rose Bar for its more vibrant atmosphere is pretty cool  But people want and should be able to expect more bang for their buck from a hotel that presents sucha high end image  And I think the Gramercy just falls short of that  Sorry guys  
P => A Different Kind of Ian Schrager Experience I have loved Ian Schrager hotel ever since i stayed at the Sanderson Delano Mondrian etc  so I was dissapointed to find that he wasnt working with Phillipe Stark again  While I dont think the design of the Gramercy Park is up to par with say the Sanderson it is still beautiful and unique  There really isnt any other hotel like it in New York  The mix of wood modern paintings and luxurious furniture creates an atmosphere that is sophisticated but still trendy as all Schrager hotels are  The Jade and Rose bars are elegant but fun and serve great fooddrinks at a price that is almost justified  The whole hotel is pretty dark   a little gothic be Some people would definately not like that   big change from the stark white of his other hotels  But I didnt mind that  We were upgraded to a suite with a arate living area which was very nice loved the blue chair  The HD tvs bathroomamenities service were all also great   no faults  The bed was heaven   as i expected it to be  The location is also pretty good but the park is kind of dull in the winter  The hotel should get even better when Park Chinois and the roof garden open  The gym area was very nice but the spa was not so much a spa   just  treatment rooms  
P => A very unique experience Enough has been said about the paintings the Rose Bar and the designers  Suffice to say that it is less full of itself than many lessor boutique hotels but still has enough attitude to give you a buzz  Id like to point out some plusses and minusses which have not received much attention The lobby is actually quite small with a very pleasant wood burning fireplace  Its a really nice touch   unusual to have actual wood burning instead of gas and fake logs  You are greeted in a quite friendly manner  I expected it to feel snobby and arrogant but in fact all of the people I encountered were extremely pleasant  Some have written that the concierge is like a gatekeeper to the quotpreciousquot Rose Bar reservations but they were actually quite accomodating and even chatty  By the way the Rose Bar becomes a kind of cliche scene late at night the usual NYC club posturing and pricing  During the day you see husbands schlepping their wives Barneys bags to the tables which later at night are reserved for those silly enough to pay  for a bottle of Absolute The room is a very different sort of place  I had a small suite and it was definitely odd  The living room area had a table and a bunch of chairs around it  There was no couch or other type of comfortable seating area  There is a flat screen tv in both the living room and the bedroom  The bedroom is not entirely a arate room   the whole suite is one long room arated by french doors  The odd touch here is the red velvet floor to ceiling drapes which you can wrap around most of the walls and windows of the bedroom A really silly aspect of this suite is that there is almost no way to plug anything in to the electrical system The only accessible outlet was at the base of a table lamp in the living room  There were no reachable wall plugs in the bedroom at all The bed is quite comfortable nice linens nice bathrobes and very fine lotions and potions  As has been said everything in the room is for sale but quotsalequot is not exactly the word Id apply  Prices are insanely high  I have never understood why hotels reveal such greed so openly  woudlnt it be a better move to charge a premium but not to an offensive magnitudeRoom service is very nice quick and hot It is also quite expensive around  for breakfast for two  Location is awesome a wonderful part of the city which many tourists never see  You can walk to Union Square in a few minutes and there are many restaurants groceries and clubs nearby  I would stay there again for the location the ambiance the professionalism and perhaps for the artfullness although I found the taste to be a bit dated  Bare lightbulbs screwed in to hardware store recepticals is not exactly a new idea  Regarding technology the lcd screens are fine but you would expect they would have gone the extra step to install surround sound speakers  This would have been a special touch as would have been a better Ipod speaker system  In fact i would say that ultimately technology has been given short shrift and because of that I dont think you could actually say this is a true   star hotel  
P => Money better spent elsewhere I know this was supposed to be the hot new hotel but I thought it was really disappointing The rooms are orated in an quoteclectic gothicquot style which translates into blood red carpeting blood red drapes and blood red velvet shower curtains  There is almost no lighting whatsoever in the room and even less in the bathroom  I took a shower in pitch darkness because the little light there is is then filtered by the blood red velvet shower curtain  The specially selected beauty products was really the best part of my entire stay The breakfast buffet was awful for a hotel of these standings  It looked like they brought everything in from the deli across the street  And theres no proper restaurant so if you dont like the deli food at the buffet   your only other option is the coffee shop two blocks away  The worst part about everything was that despite the  per night room charge for a single I had to argue with the hotel bar doorman to get a drink with two friends  Apparently staying in their hotel only buys you one spot in their bar  
P => Not the best in the area for the money I stayed at the GPH ten years ago and to say that it is improved would be an understatement  The lobby Jade Bar and Rose Bar are beautiful  Was not as impressed with service or rooms  It was raining when we arrived and the staff seemed very stressed out  Rooms were spacious yet extremely dark  Almost oppressively dark  The restaurant and the roof top are not open yet  One can order light fare during the day in one of the bars  I believe service stops at  or  pm  Had room service Fri  night Sat  morning and Sat  evening  The food is shockingly expensive as are drinks in the bar    for a glass of wine and that was the least expensive Room service was average  Unfortunately we did not have reservations at the Rose Bar and they could not accomodate us  We settled for the Jade Bar which is very small  Its unfortunate that guests of the hotel who are eager to spend time and money in the hotel are not priority  The doorman told me they are trying to create exclusivity by requiring reservations in the bar  Too bad  The gym was spotless and very bright and the equipment was new  No water in the mini fridge in the room and they dont leave a bottle at turn down  Bring your own  Heat didnt work in the room and they were unable to fix it  A guest on our floor was smoking the entire weekend  They sent a staff member up to spray air freshener and they lit a candle in our room but he smoker continued to smoke  Last but not least it took  minutes to get our car from valet  We called the front desk and they assured us it would be  minutes  When we inquired again they apologized and said they forgot to call it in for us  There were several angry guests experiencing the same thing  All in all not a terrible place  Ive stayed at Gansevoort Soho Grand and the Mercer in the last  months and for the money I think the Mercer is the best choice  I might give the Gramercy another try when the restaurant is open but I doubt it  I felt like the service and food was better at the Mercer  
P => A very unique hotel with lots of extras I stayed  nights  days at the Gramercy Park Hotel in late uary  This is a really unique and interesting hotel  The or is certainly different than anyplace else Ive ever stayed  The lobby is just as it looks online and really dramatic and lovely  In the hallways the walls are blood red and the lighting is so dim you can barely see a thing  My room was painted a dark sage green with red velvet curtains red velvet chairs big queen beds with purple velvet throws and artsy photography on the walls  It was like some sort of crazy high fashion bordello I really enjoyed the or but my big and perhaps only complaint would be the darkness  Even if you turn on all the lights in the room its still dark  It didnt bother me for the amount of time I was here but it might have for a longer stay or if I was trying to do business while there  The bathroom was large  Theres no tub but a good oversized shower  Everything was spotless The room also had two large closets a mini bar and flat screen TV  The mini bar is a thing of beauty  There are several shelves of goodies in addition to the bar  io Badescu beauty products special candles designer t shirts full bottles of wine champagne etc  Crystal glasses to drink from  Theres even an iPod docking station and you can borrow an iPod from the front desk if you didnt bring your own  The hotel will lend you DVDs to watch in your room  The list of available titles is several pages long   very nice selection  I really enjoyed all these little touches Guests at the hotel are allowed to borrow keys to Gramercy Park which is a private park  I did go over and walk around in the park since its not every day you get to do that I did not spend time at the bar or restaurant but the people I was traveling with did and on both nights they saw some pretty big celebrities  I never noticed any kind of crowds or extra security in the lobby though on Sunday and Monday nights  I didnt eat in the restaurant but I did order room service  It was jaw droppingly expensive  for a cheesburger and bottled water with tax but delivered very quickly and the food was delicious The staff at the hotel really went above and beyond  Once you get out of a cab in front of the hotel there are multiple staff members to greet you take your bags and walk you to the front desk  The staff who are all really ridiculously good looking for some reason were wonderful helpful polite and gracious  I was thoroughly impressed by the service I really enjoyed this hotel  It was definitely a splurge but Id consider staying here again  I wish the rooms offered additional light but in all other respects I was very satisfied  
P => Gracious Gramercy     Ian Schrager has done himself proud with this hotel and we experienced nothing but courteous and efficient service whilst we were there  Great bar with a pool table excellent recommendations for dining and the cool scene you associate with his hotels  All in all would highly recommend  It was pouring with rain one day so the doorman insisted we take the hotel limo   thats what I call servcieNote that the restaurant isnt open yet   but there are loads of great places to eat nearby  The bar serves lunch  
P => Beware dated ecor and lack of customer serice Had stayed at the old Gramercy many times and though it was down on its heels and in need of refurbishing I appreciated the low rates the old world charm and in particular the warm and charming hotel barwhich was a destination unto itself I was appalled at Ian Shragers out dated and hideous quotdesignquot   I mean honestly   a turkish theme in  Sponge washed walls and velvet curtains Most distressing was the emated lobby bar transformed into two hideous and uncomfortable spaces  The quotjade barquot with its  tiny and uncomfortable table crammed up against the bar was quotgenerouslyquot open to hotel guests  The exclusive quotrose barquot was not  The quotrose barquot was another shocking display of outdated or   its patronized by the uncoolest the boroughs has to offer  all in all a conglomeration of everything bad about the s  The fact that we as high paying hotel quests in an otherwise empty hotel were turned away from a sparsley occupied crowd on a wednesday night was the final idignity The poor service completely unhelpful quotconciergequot and outrageous prices for quotextrasquot hidden   daily internet service rates unparalled room service and mini bar rates think  for a bottle of jack Daniels the most surprising think about the hotel remains the outdated and ridiculous or i cannot imagine this hotel will ever last through   
P => wonderful boutique hotel in NYC This hotel definitely deserves better reviews  First I had not originally planned to stay here for a New Yrs Birthday celebration for my  yr old and myself because of location and reviews  However when the hotel offered a great rate I changed my mind  We were upgraded to a lovely  bed deluxe room on a quiet floor  The amenities were great  plentiful towels robes slippers and the bellman explained how everything worked  no problems  However what makes this property exceptional is the service  The staff was courteous and responsive to this middle aged mom and her dhter  They even treated my dhter to a small cake for her birthday  As to the bars and as one who never made it to Studio  I preferred the egalitarian Jade Bar where I could still reflect on the ian Schabel painting on the wall but I could have gotten in the Rose Bar New Yrs  Yes prices are high but this is NYC  The lobby art is incredible as is the or in the room  Loved the photos in ours esp  the one of Warhol  Only downside is the location  you need to take cabs and NY cabbies are the worst  Some insisted on dropping us off a few blocks from the theater or a restaurant  This happened to other tourists I talked to as well  Within walking distance is a phenomenal restaurant  BLT Prime  well worth the price and deserving of its reputation  Best part  I got chefs famous recipe for Popovers   Gramery Park was a lovely boutique hotel with the latest in amenities internet and the best in service  I highly recommend this propery and hope to return when I am in NY  
P => An Experience As with all Schragers hotels I have stayed at two others I must say that it is an experience  Costly but fun  I found the staff very helpful and polite  They were responsive to all my needs such as changing rooms to accomodate my last minute change of plans concierge staff was wonderful with reservations and recommendations for dinner and very attentive to my lost luggage tag and need for a nail file  I found the rooms tasteful with nice touches such as tassle Do Not Disturb signs  Linens and beds were fantastic  Lobby bar and lobby or was fantastic  The only negative was the lighting throughout the hotel  Very dark in the hallways and unless you are looking down and realize the room numbers are on the floor etched in the carpets it is very difficult to figure out which room you are looking for  Also the lighting in the bathroom and room is not great for most individuals over  years old  All in all a wonderful experience

P => Great location large but friendly That rare thing   a large hotel with the personal touch  As we were registering in the imposing lobby someone let slip that it was my birthday  Two hours later wine chocolates and a card arrived in my room  You cant buy that sort of PR  Wed arrived three hours ahead of check in time but were accommodated without fuss theres no underestimating the value of such flexibility to a weary traveller  The concierges and traveltour reps  were equally helpful  The hotel has a great location on nd Street with many sights within comfortable walking distance  And if youre going farther afield in NY state Grand Central Terminal is right there  The room was large and clean and the bed comfortable  The bathroom was surprisingly small even to an English guest and my wife bemoaned the lack of a ently lit and magnifiable mirror for contact lenses make up etc  Also there seemed to be just one place to eat in a hotel with around  rooms  But these are small quibbles  Overall terrific  
P => Nice Thanksgiving in New York I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for six nights during Thanksgiving week  Overall it was a nice hotel with just a few minor glitches which in no way diminished a wonderful week in New York Upon check in the front desk agent informed me I had been upgraded to a quotLexington Suitequot  It was a nice big room overlooking Lexington Ave  and the Chrysler Building was right next to us  Beautiful view from room  The bed was absolutely wonderful comfortable and luxuriously soft  I normally have trouble falling asleep in a strange city especially New York with all the horns honking  but no problem in this bed  There was a nice flat screen TV which swiveled so you could either turn it to face the bedroom or to face the TV area  Great touch  Other nice features were an in room safe an iron and an ironing board  The bathroom amenities were also unique and plentiful  The following are a few minor problems I noticed during my stay The walls are thin but arent they all in hotels these days  My next door neighbors room  were a bunch of loud guys who were banging around and yelling at all hours of the day amp night  To make matters worse they were smoking up a storm in the room  The rooms are non smoking and the smell permeated the hallway and sometimes even came into my room  Nasty  There was plenty of hot water but it takes FOREVER for it to come out  hot  of the faucet  I had to let the water run for several minutes before it came out hot  I guess it had to travel a long way  After a long day of sightseeing and walking my back hurt so I ided to take a quotsit down bathquot to relieve my aching muscles when I realized the tub stopper didnt close  I tried and tried but it didnt work  So I used a washcloth to plug the drain but it didnt work very well  I didnt bother reporting it to maintenance since I didnt plan on taking any more baths  Oh and wireless internet is   for  hours  I used it and the connection was fast amp easy T Mobile Hot Spot  Dont bother eating in the restaurants or using room service in this hotel  I cannot comment on the quality because once I saw the prices I stayed away  Nine dollars for coffee for one person only Thirty Four dollars for French Toast Really that is ridiculous even for New York  And these were the restaurant prices not the quotjacked upquot prices for room service  Do yourself a favor and grab breakfast or any meal in Grand Central Station  It is right next door and you wont even have to go outside to access it  Just take the corridor on the lower lobby level and make a right  It will take you directly there  Theres also a Starbucks in that corridor which is actually less expensive than the quotcoffee cartquot in the lobby of the hotel  My favorite place was called quotHot and Crustyquot  I was able to buy  large coffees a bottle of OJ a bottle of milk and a wonderful croissant for a total of  dollars and change  Honestly I dont know who would ever pay those extravagant hotel prices  I am still in shock Heres another money saving tip If you are coming from an airport go online and book Super Shuttle  Yes it is a shared van that makes several stops but it is a lot less expensive and easier than a taxi  My ride from La Guardia was only   plus tip    I also used it to go back to the airport  You can save a few more bucks if you book it round trip Overall a great hotel just a little bit away from the major noise and crowds of Times Square  I would return especially now that I know how to get around the pricey add ons  
P => Very nice hotel The location of this hotel is great if you are looking to do upper and midtown new york city also easily connected to elsewhere via grand central station  Not the cheapest hotel to stay at but it is a very grand building  The staff are a credit to the hotel and are really helpful polite and friendly  The rooms are adequate size and very quiet with a good view from all sides I would however agree with a few of the other reveiws on here saying it is very business focused  The conference and business guests seem to get slightly preferential treatment whilst in house  
P => you get what you pay for here   worth it I was very pleased with my recent four day stay  Requested and received a two double room at a great promo rate less than  a night   at holiday season  They let me check in early nice check out late really nice gave me free breakfast really really nice   came with the promo and were rekably accommodating to our every need GREAT concierge staff  Room was quiet th floor overlooking Grand Central Station and location cannot be beat  The room was not brand new and showed some wear and it would have been nice to have an in room fridge but overall comfortable convenient and very classy  Well worth the bucks  
P => Lovely Hotel   perfect trip Having read a few of the comments on this hotel I was slightly apprehensive as they seemed quite negative however we need not of worried  We were greeted by very pleasant staff on the front desk and were made to feel very welcome  My mother and I stayed in the Hyatt for  nights and every one was without complaint  The room was lovely and bright  Cleaned to a very high standard and the view over GCT was brilliant  The added bonus of being able to check in on line for our return flights meant we could leave later for the airport and squeeze in abit more shopping  The hotel was really well situated for all we wanted to do   visit Central Park  Bloomingdales Times Sq Empire State Building Rockerfella Centre and of course just shopping  On the Sunday Madison Ave was closed to traffic and a HUGE street ket opened which was lovely  Bryant Park which is just along to the right of the hotel was a real hidden gem  We spent lots of time just sitting and watching the ice skaters and looking in all the little units that sold everything from christmas orations to elty soap  It was a great place chill and just get away from the hustle and bustle for a while  Also the toilets were beautiful and so well looked after by a lovely lady who really takes pride in her job  She put Starbucks at the Empire State Building to shame DONT use the restrooms at this coffee house as they were the most disgusting I have EVER come across a  foot high pile of USED toilet tissue on the floor under the baby changing unit and the most worrying thing was that the staff used them tooWe found the EuropaCafe on Madison Ave to be excellent for breakfast and lunches   Great value for money  And Mulldoons Irish Pub on Lexington served great meals in the evening All in all a fantastic but very tiring trip lovey hotel with great staff and some brilliant memories  
P => Nice but noisy Staying here for the week  The hotel is in an excellent location thats hard to beat  Got a great deal off the internet that couldnt be ignored  Had a great first night until what sounds like a room of  drunken boys moved into the room next door that played rap music cursed and shouted into the small hours of the morning despite my plees for them to quieted  So dont get room  if you want a quiet nightRooms are immaculatley clean with everything you can need from a iron to a ipod dock  The TV is a bit oversized for the room but some people like that  I hear people say that they find the bathrooms here to be too small but its not  Ive seen smaller bedrooms  Lobby is amazing I want a waterfall in my home  Not to keen on all the brown ble and precarious looking giant flower vases but it gives the place some class  Food is so expensive here its a experience to just read the price list to make sure its not a mistake  Which is why I can guess that noisy rabble in the next room feel they have to go outside buy a buffet and then get most of the population of NY into their room for lh giggle and snort all night  Its all so cheap outside  
P => Great Location dont use the room service Location is fantastic in between Grand Central and the Chrysler building was lucky enough to get a conference rate which made it relatively cheap in new york terms but still in excess of  for  nights  Its a big place and tries hard but it is rather soul less clearly designed for business travel Didnt come across many of the staff as used auto check in and check out facility lady selling the sightseeing bus tickets and theatre tickets was very helpful concierge did his job but felt like he was doing me a big favour when asked to reconfirm shuttle booking back to airport  Room was large enough well presented and clean bathroom was tiny but functional Good fitness centre used it each morning and wife and I always managed to get a running machine for mins at peak time Dont be tempted to use the room service sky high prices for mediocre food used by the corporate suits on expense accounts probably bankers spending our tax dollars because they are too lazy to go next door to the wonderfull Grand Central Food Court and Lexington Passage ket also in Grand Central  The only way these large chains will get the message on their overpriced room service menus is if we all stop using them so come on suits walk next door and sample Grand Central Would stay again as it is a great location walking distance to many of the key attractions especially the theatre district 
P => Amazing This hotel was amazing it features in the film definatley be with ryan reynolds it is so grand and right next to central station so the hussel and bussel is definatley there i loved the shop in grand central station that sold muffins bagels etc  it was lovely and definatley reccommended for a breakfast on the go The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful and the rooms were lovely  
P => Very good hotel in a great location The Grand Hyatt Hotel is very well located in the heart of Manhattan and just by Grand Central Station  The check in and check out process was painless  The hotel lobby is huge and just very grand Our room was on the th floor  We didnt have a view but didnt care as we didnt spend much time in the room anyway  The room was of a very good size the double bed was big and very comfy  The bathroom was clean with some toiletries provided  Cant fault this hotel and would happily stay there again  The room service is very expensive but with so many places around for food you dont really need it  Oh and by the concierge there is a computer where you can do your online check in and print your boarding passes for free very useful 
P => Great location good Priceline price We stayed over a Friday and Saturday night in tember  The location cant be beat  literally inside Grand Central Station  We had a quiet room that was well orated and comfortable for our stay  And we only paid night plus taxes and fees  Hotel valet parking is expensive but there is street parking available on weekends at least in residential areas within   blocks  
P => Loved every minute of NY  Great Location Great location fantastic staff and awesome rooms  I loved this hotel so much and would definitely stay here again The staff all over the hotel were amazing in particular the bar staff  They were so friendly and helpful and made staying there that much more enjoyable  The Grand Hyatt is perfectly located to see everything only a short walk to Central Park an even shorter walk to awesome shopping in particualr HampM which is just down the road and there are also really lovely restaurants nearby  I thought it was great value for money and would recommend it to anyone  New York is an awesome place and I am sure you will love it no matter where you stay however if you want a centrally located base which is great value for money then you really should stay here  I will stay here again for sure   TIP make sure you go to the Hotel Gansevoort roof top bar   it is amazing and the crab pizza is delicious 
P => Great location and good value You cant beat the location in midtown  The rooms were nicely remodeled  I was not a fan of the stall shower only room however the size of the bathroom was adequate and the furnishings of the room were nice  I was happy with the free coffee or water coupons received upon checkin given the lack of coffee making abilities in the room  The service was accomodating given my early morning check in and the rooms were overall quite sound proofed  Given this was only  blocks from my conference this was a great choice  Plus the bus to Newark being a block away was a breeze  
P => great priceline hit I like to use Priceline for the best deals in NYC  Having stayed at the Grand Hyatt in the past and knowing that Priceline customers do not get the quotprimequot rooms  For  dollars a night we got a room with  doubles clean and acceptable Having experienced their far better rooms at a much higher rate This is a well located property that is getting a little worn around the edges  but bedding was great and everything worked  Even though our room was opposite the elevators remember this was a priceline win  it was quiet  This is a good hotel in a fabulous location  
P => repeat visit on the cards       Just returned from New York stayed at the Grand Hyatt and what a great time we had Arrived early evening on Monday th ober and were greeted by friendly check in clerk  Even more delightful was the fact that we were upgraded to a King suite on th floor which was very spacious clean and comfortable  I agree with other reviewers that the location is superb and the Grand C terminal must be added to everyones itinerary  The range of dining options underground is brilliant given the fact that the hotel food is very expensive Tip shuttle bus to Newark airport located on st street min walk across the road  per person   
P => great location good hotel This hotel is in a great location making it easy to get to times square etc         We travelled with our two children aged  and  and found the room to be of good size for all of us  The rooms were clean and looked ok  We didnt eat at the hotel as it was really expensive   especially the room service  Overall a good hotel in a great location  
P => Nice Hotel I selected this hotel as part of a package trip to New York through Thomas Cook  So I am not sure of the exact price I paid for the accomodation It really is in a fantastic location especially if you can work out the subway system The hotel is situated between Grand Central station and the Chrysler building The Empire State Building is a  minute walk around the corner Time square is a  minute slow walk plenty to see on the way though I was in New York with my two dhters aged  and  and although initially worried about walking at night need not have worried as there are plenty of people around The hotel room was a good size and the beds were very comfortable on the th floor we were not disturbed by traffic noise I agree with previous comments that the rooms are tired but only in the yellowing of the paint work and the bathroom is on the small size but both were clean enough if you dont look too carefully in the corners and above door frames grout could do with a little cleaning too The meals in the hotel are expensive but for breakfast we followed previous advice and went down into Central Station food court you can either eat down there or take it back to your room  There is not a kettle in the room and despite e mailing the hotel before hand to ask if I shouldcould bring a travel kettle I did not recieve reply from them However in the hotel lobby there was a drink station for use on a morning the prices there were not too expensive There is a booking desk in the reception area where you can buy tickets for the bus sight seeing tours  This was helpful as I did not like the idea of getting my credit card out on the street to buy tickets off the vendors I would not buy theatre tickets from there though as you can buy them after pm for that nights performance at a ticket booth in Time square for up to    off  Unfortunately we had already bought tickets for Shrek through Last minute before we went  It was a brilliant show but we could have got them cheaper if we had waited in the line at the ticket booth  However I think tickets for shows such as Wicked are more difficult to get hold of so my advice would be to book up with Last minute a couple of weeks before you go to avoid disappointment All the staff in the Hotel that we met were helpful and polite having said that I didnt really have any contact with them apart from checking in and out We had a late return flight and the hotel will mind your luggage for  per case after you check out at AM this is also helpful I would stay at the Grand Hyatt again but I would take my travel kettle and teabags with me next time  
P => Excellent location mediocre hotel I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt where I attended a conference  Ive stayed at several Hyatts worldwide and this was the first to disappoint On the positive side the location of the hotel is hard to beat  I appreciated the easy access to the subway many major attractions and the excellent food court at Grand Central station  The bed was extremely comfortable with a great mattress and excellent quality linens Generally I found the hotel shabby for a Hyatt  The public areas were dark my room was long overdue for an update and the bathroom was dingy  Most of my experiences with the staff were positive but it took me over a day of chasing down house keeping and front desk staff to finally get a non functioning safe in my room replaced Usually Im willing to pay a premium for a Hyatt hotel because Im confident Im getting a quality product  This hotel did not meet my expectations for this brand and Ive stayed at much less expensive hotels in Manhattan that far exceed the standards of this hotel  
P => Fantastic location Stayed at the Grand Hyatt week of      Beautiful Hotel friendly staff comfortable beds excellent location  The location made our trip so much easier to getaround and see the sights  Loved that Grand Central Terminal is connected and thatwe could go to the food court anytime to get reasonably priced meals try iorsrestaurant to get great cheesecake and sandwiches  Would stay at the Grand Hyattagain  
P => Superb location Should be Hyatt Flagship hotel    I stayed there for  nights on Hyatt Points  The best of this hotel is its central location just at Grand central Station  The lobby is massive and impressive but everything is a bit outdated  The hotel needs a massive reation and could and should be Hyatt Flagship Hotel  We stayed in Long Island a few days later and our Hyatt Regency was much betterThe room are OK Small bathroom but as always with hyatt the bed was good  As a Diamond member i had access to Grand club where I could get free breakfast snacks and a dedicated concierge  This was excellent  Overrall if you get a good rate it is a very good and comfortable place to stay in NYC as you are not likely to stay a lot in your room The room was okay Bathroom very small 
P => Good location   shame about the let downs The Grand Hayatt is in a great location  The public areas are impressive if you like fountains in the lobby  The staff were mixed  Ulysses in the bar was excellent  Simone as the breafast greeter was rude and surly  The rooms were very dark  It was as though they either did not have enough bulbs or were using very low energy ones  The food was expensive  There were no teacoffe making facilities in the rooms so you either had to order room service at  or wait for the coffe eshop to open in the lobby at am as this closed somewhere between pm and pm it was not much help after a day walking the city either The hotel seemed geared up for Corporate business with fat expense accounts paying  We would not choose to go there again  
P => Average hotel perfect location poor value I stayed  nights at this hotel in conction with attending a conference in NYC and I was somewhat disappointed with the value  The price was around  USD per night and especially the room standard did not live up to this price  The room was small dark and the bathroom in a disappointing standard  The guest rooms could definately need som refurbishment  When asked whether I had had a nice stay on checkout I stated that I had been somewhat disappointed and without hesitation the woman at the fronk desk without hesitation credited me some extra points on my freqent guest account which I found was a good gesture  It was not all bad though staff was overall very friendly and helpful especially at the concierge desk where everyone we spoke to seemed to have enourmous amounts of information to share with guests  Furthermore dont get me wrong   the hotel is still quite ok it just seems more like an average   hotel rather than how I would normally regard hotels under the Hyatt brand and then the price is not in line with the standard What is definately the best thing about this hotel is its location  A few blocks from th avenue and shopping everywhere around this hotel is the perfect location for visitors to NYC  Actually just the location might be enough for me to stay here the next time i go to NYC especially if the hotel would rent out rooms for just slightly cheaper prices  
P => A bit over priced but well worth it We stayed here for  nights in e  We had a fab time and I thought all the staff were helpful polite and could not do anything more for us  The bell men at the front door are excellent and had no problem hailing any cabs  the location was super you could not fault it  Every thing is just on its door step and although it is an expensive hotel it was worth it for a treat 
P => Very nice hotel in the center of mid town NYC We stayed at the Grand Hyatt at Grand Central Station for a wedding in y   The hotel is beautiful and is nicely located  We were fortunate to book the hotel early and saved about  per night  The rooms were a nice size although we had to change rooms after the first night because they initially put us in a room right over nd Street which was extremely noisy all night  The second room was very large and quiet with a nice bathroom and walk in closet  The beds were comfortable with good pillows which is always important The only thing I need to mention is that if youre hoping for a cozy quaint hotel in the city this is not the place for you  There were massive numbers of people going in and out of this hotel  The hotel is very large and can accommodate an extensive number of guests  We did not have any problem with noise from within the hotel though  Overall we had a very good experience at the Grand Hyatt  
P => Average Hotel    great location The lobby was beautiful and extravagent but the rooms were fairly small and ordinary  We arrived  minutes early and were not allowed to check in early  Also there is no coffee in the rooms  If you want a great location though this is the place to stay  
P => Great Location We stayed at the Grand Hyatt NY in  for the girls trip booked this hotel through priceline and enjoyed our stay we had two double beds and I thought they could be slighly larger  I believe we had just two full beds  The rooms are rather small but super clean and nicely orated  When youre in NY there is no reason to spend time in the rooms anyway  The lobby ws gorgeous  Pretty busy area so if you are coming to relax the place is NOT for you  For those seeking busy NYC experience   this is the place to be Located right at the Grand Central Station walking distance to many great touristy attractions  
P => Great for business in perfect location We needed a place near Grand Central  Priceline got us there for night and the quoted price at the hotel was over   Midtown   East for business this was perfect  
P => Fantastic Hotel Ideal Location Spotlessly Clean Large room Next door to grand central station across street from Chrysler building perfect location  Walk north up th ave takes you to Central Park or walk south down th ave takes you to Stattan Island Ferry port you could not be more central  Hotel was great lovely big room  queen beds quot plasma bathroom big enough with bath spotlessly clean maids in everyday quiet room not ajoining overlooking chrysler building although buildings are really close together  Room Number    Good street ket just outside hotel on a Sunday  Hotel Expensive for coffee and food but plenty diners and starbucks around grand central station  Advise getting Hop on Hop off Double ker guided tour bus we got the  for  days includes ferry ride to Liberty Island and Empire State building or Top of the rock observatory  Observatories open at am go early to avoid queues  They are both great views but make sure its a clear day when you go up There are other tours available if you dont have  days  Its Impossible to walk it all  Century  or Loehmanns for designer shopping at half the price  Expensive for taxis from airports they wanted  from Newark international  miles away so we used public transport  I went onto New Jersey Transit trip planner website put Itinery in and they found the quickest way and cheapest   pp  minutes on train and two subway stops couldnt have been any easier  Hope you have a brilliant time we did its a magical city and we felt very safe police on every corner  
P => Great Location Is there a better location than Grand Central NYC NoHotel lobby was impressive and room was huge  Bed was super comfy great for jet lag Really enjoyed my stay here 
P => disappointing stayed at the grand hyatt in tember with my husband and dhter who was celebrating her st whilst we were there  We booked one room for all of us but was very dissapointed with the size of the room for the price we had paid  It would have been quite small for just the  of us but with  it was horrendous  There was no teacoffee making facilities in the room   i have stayed all over europe and this is the first hotel without this facility  it was a room for  but everything was geared for  people ie  glasses and hardly any shampoo soap etc  We mentioned to the hotel on booking it was our dhters st you would have thought the hotel could have made an effort and be could have put an extra glass in the room  The only plus for this hotel is the location   
P => Its simply not clean  Great location   dismal service  Unclean hotel that could be much better Arrived on Friday afternoon for a medical conference  Our rate for four people in a room two teens and two adults was nt  Astronomical rate and they would not budge from it  Since this hotel was where the seminar was held we really didnt have a choice  We will never again attend a conference at this hotel Check in was smooth  We were ushered to room   Directly across from the bank of elevators  As it turned out the room was huge and the elevator noise was not a serious problem The room itself was in poor condition  On the bedskirt on the bed nearest to the door there was a huge liquid stain of some sort  Disgusting  Every single lampshade had holes and was bent crooked like a brawl had taken place at some point The carpeting was ancient  Ancient to the point of pulling away from the walls and cobwebs and dust and food had settled into the cracks  I was VERY happy I had brought my slippers  This is the kind of hotel that makes you cringe everytime you look into a nook or cranny  Behind the tv set Thick with dust and crumbs Most unfortunate was the fact that this room was connected to other rooms on both sides by reed thin doors  Forget about getting a ent nights sleep if you have a neighbor who likes to watch television  We were kept up until am on a Saturday night by our neighbors television The Grand Hyatt touts their E Concierge service  They have a link to it on their website  However I sent two different requests to their E Concierge before we arrived and both requests were completely ignored  The first request was for dinner reservations  Ignored  The second request was for extra towels in our room    an option that their E Concierge offers  That request was also ignored  We had to phone housekeeping for the extra towels  Every single day  We were promised a coffee machine and a fridge in our room  We had to phone housekeeping for those as well  The maid refused to stock the coffee maker with coffee and cups after the first day   Forget about getting any glasses in the room  We were drinking out of our hands from the bathroom tap while brushing our teeth If you would like  wine glasses delivered to your room the charge is  We knew in advance thanks to TripAdvisor that the room service charges were astronomical so we stocked up on juices and water and bagels from the shops down at Grand Central Terminal  One morning we did order breakfast  One ham and cheese omelette was  with no toast and no juice or coffee  The omelette was dry as dust and cold   for an omelette  Astounding  One small box of Fruit Loops was  with no toast and no juice   mini pancakes from the kids menu was perhaps the best value  I would strongly advise people to order from the kids menu to avoid being absolutely gouged by the lhable prices  And make sure to order a pitcher of ice water  Its about the only thing that is free in the hotel All of these complaints aside the thing that really bothered me the most was the filthy condition of the glass in the lobby  There are several revolving glass doors and a couple of regular glass doors and every single one of them is literally covered in slime  No matter what time of day or night the lobby was thick with the finger goo and faceprints and palmprints of the hundreds of people who go in and out all day and all night  Its absolutely disgusting  One employee armed with a bottle of Windex and some paper towels could solve this problem by cleaning the doors once an hour  But this hotel doesnt seem to care about germs or cleanliness Try it for yourself and you will see that this is a hotel that simply does not care  If you want to get gouged    stay here  
P => Brilliant hotellocation   would use again  I cant think of a better location for a New York hotel  Within easy walking distance of Times Square and most of mid town  Hotel adjoins Grand Central terminal so just about everywhere is accessible via the underground train system   and at a reasonable price  We were right next door to the Chrysler building too   beautiful We didnt eat at the hotel though   bit pricey  However plenty of choice nearby    ent Irish barsrestaurants nearby Annie OBriens amp Patrick Conways   good food and atmosphere  New York is amazing   cant wait to go again 
P => Grand Hyatt perfect location  Entrance on nd street right next to Grand Central Station was the perfect location to get around the sites  Most within easy walking distance  Very grand opulent reception area so large that  night part of it was cordoned off for a wedding reception  Rooms good size for mum  amp I   We took our full allowance of  cases each and large hand luggage amp still had plenty room to spare  We were opposite the Chryslar Building too which was an added bonus Hotel kindly provided us with complimentary breakfast tokens for each day of our stay  This saved us around   Very busy bar too  
P => Location location location I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in early ust  The main reason I chose this hotel was its amazing location  Times Sq Broadway that is the beating heart of the City that never sleeps is within walking distance  Gran Central Station is connected to the hotel via a passage  so you dont even need to leave the premises to get to the train station  Our room on the th floor was quite big clean and quiet and we were given a fridge as soon as we asked for one  The bathroom was ok but i would have expected a more state of the art shower  I was disappointed at the non availability of shower caps  I had to get one from the Duane Reade in front of the hotel  BTW There are a couple of Duane Reade stores nearby one staying open  WE didnt go for the breakfast option considering there are plenty of places to choose from nearby  I appreciated the Starbucks stall in the Hotel lobby even if it was pricey  one tall hot milk cost  while in any other Starbucks outside it was one  lessWe did not take advantage of the fitness centre located on the top floor  there is a PC with a fax service and a printer in the main lobby which proved to be very useful  Checking in and out was quick and the staff were very helpful but you have to pay for left luggage i absolutely loved the magnificent lobby with its awesome fountain and the sight of the Crysler building at night reflected in the hotels facade  
P => I couldnt have asked for more  I spent one night here to have a medical procedure done for which I needed to be in Manhattan early  I am a New Yorker who now lives in the suburbs First off   I got an amazing price on Priceline   under  a night which is unheard of in manhattan much less for a  star hotel  Checkin was fast helped along by many self check in machines and somewhat surprising given that we checked in exactly at check in time and the place is huge  We went to the counter though because we needed to request a refrigerator and a late checkout  Both were done without a problem and without additional charge  Ive stayed in other hotels where the Priceline rate rooms were less pleasant than other rooms not so here   our room was very clean comfortable and well maintained and while small by the standards of other cities it was a perfectly good size for midtown Manhattan  Plus it was far from both the elevator and vending machines and on a highish floor Throughout our admittedly brief stay the staff was friendly helpful and accommodating and nearly everything was just right The gym is amazing for a hotel gym  The equipment is new or at least well maintained and there is a lot of it  There is a hot and cold filtered water machine in the gym and they have both dry towels and colddamp towels for after your workout  I have access to three other gyms in my day to day life and none is as nice as this one I wouldnt have minded in room coffee a luxury ive grown used to but in the middle of NYC you can walk  seconds in any direction and find someplace to get coffee so that wasnt such a big problem  And the doors slam kind of loudly which isnt great if you are a light sleeper but aside from those two things   I was completely satisfied  
P => excellent the hotel location is excellent  it is also reasonably priced if you look for a good deal two of us ended up paying  each for the night  and the staff was very kind  highly recommended  
P => Good Location   Good Hotel for NYC low standards If you want to be really midtown Manhattan this hotel is perfect  Just  min from Times Sq   min from Fifth and Bryant very close to some main subway stations The hotel itself is quite good for Manhattan generally low standards  Its not the newest hotel in town it shows its age but it is well tended  We booked on their website a standard double queen room and got a very good deal because we booked a  nights offer  At check in we asked for a higher floor room and we were given a thirtieth one facing the main street nd  The room was ok it seemed clean and comfy but even if smoking is forbidden it smelled terribly of cigarettes and so we complained about that  They were really sorry and upset about it and immediately upgraded us to a little suite  Nice customer care  Internet is not free in the rooms but in the lobby they have a free PC workstation dedicated to flights check in and boarding pass printing  Id recommend  
P => I was bit by bed bugs Overall this is a fantastic hotel from rooms to location  BUT I received bed bug bites on my back when I was there in ust for  nights stay  I was in a room on the th floor and woke up in the morning with over  bites on my back  I know this is a risk of travel and NY has had some problems with this this summer  I am hoping the hotel had this issue resolved because it really is a beautiful hotel and very nicely appointed rooms other than bug issue  
P => Awesome Stayed in the Hyatt for five nights in y  The hotel is right beside the Grand Station which has an excellent selection of grocery and good for ATM access  We had a room facing the inside of the hotel so didnt suffer the noise others have described and found the room to be of a good standard  The room was modern and bright   The lobbies are n large expanses water fonts  Staff were excellent and extremely helpful  
P => Excellent location  Great location just next to Grand Central Station internal passage connects the hotel to the station  Very large rooms nice or cleanliness could be better  Ive stayed in this hotel  more times in the last  years  Size of the bathrooms and even rooms vary greatly in the same category  Go for the cheapest room you  end up in a large one for the same price  Service is fast and effective but they charge you for everything even storing your luggage once you check out and want to leave later  
P => Staying at the Grand Hyatt for our anniversary weekend proved to be money very well spent  Exceptional service by all staff especially front desk and concierge and a clean spacious and comfortable room really helped make our weekend in New York a very enjoyable experience  Upon hearing it was our  th anniversary a bottle of wine and strawberries materialized in our room and breakfast vouchers were offered for the next morning  Robes and slippers are always a welcome touch and the staff at the concierge desk were particularly helpful  Location could not be better in terms of airport shuttle access to tours and Grand Central Station  While too expensive for a simple getaway weekend a hotel we would visit again for a special occasion  
P => Incredible location and friendly staff I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for four nights during the U S  Open  I was pleased with this hotel  The location is incredible   attached to Grand Central Terminal  My first night was spent in a small room with just a double bed  For the next three nights I moved to a huge room  with a king bed and lots of space and a large shower  Nice d cor  The staff was friendly the ballroom had just been reated and they showed tennis on TVs in the lobby  Perfect I also liked the handy computer in the lobby designed just for printing boarding passes  
P => Great Hotel Great location My wife and I stayed here for a special birthday recently  Check in was a breeze at the automated KIOSK no waiting Staff courteous and competent  Bell staff was good until right at checkout we did end up loading our own car  Good overall experience  
P => Fantastic Trip I travelled with my aunt and mother to New York for a short shopping trip in    We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel which was a little pricey but excellent overall  The room was average size not big enough for  though   we did ask for a larger room but for some strange reason the next room was even smaller so we stuck with the st room but was tastefully orated and very clean  Our room was cleaned everyday with plenty fresh towels replaced daily  The hotel itself is situated next door the Grand Central Station which is the ideal location as the links are fantastic  The only thing i could say is that i felt the restaurant was over priced but there are plenty of restaurantsdelis in the surrounding area  We are heading to New YorkGrand Hyatt again this coming ember  for Thanksgiving and of course the fabulous shopping sales    cant wait 
P => Nice hotel but too expensive to eat or drink there Booked  months in advanced requested quite room with  double beds and view   Subway at doorstep was one of the main reasons for booking hotel  Hotel lobby opulent with plants and large water feature   Checkin was quick and easy   this was due to arriving late    pm Staff were nice and friendly  Although room very clean and reasonable size we had the smallest room in hotel it was quite with  double beds and view of another room  Bathroom was reasonable size with combined bathshower  TV kept losing reception reported twice and still NOT fixed   Due to works which would affect our room management suggested that we be moved and offered similar room  I requested an upgrade and we were moved to a suite   Suite consisted of bedroom lounge studydining room and two very small bathrooms but was near elevators noisy   could clearly hear all conversations and the bing when elevator opened on the floor which was often  No coffeetea facilities in room nor was there a fridge   could have one   a cost of day  Could not afford to eat or drink at hotel with room service too expensive  for coffee and coffeetoastegg  and the one restaurant which was opened was over priced  Tried coffee at the cafe which was   and passable  We were saved by the Grand Central Dining Concourse which provided a fantastic selection of reasonably priced food and wine  Due to works by Transport Authority we kept losing hot water and on one occasion and without notice it was during peak time ie  pm to  pm Friday night Checkout very lengthy took at least mins If you need to do business with front desk like a simple matter of exchanging currencyyou need to line up with checkincheckout people   this could be a very lenghty procedure so make sure you pick your time  Using internet in Business Center costs  for minsI probably would not recommend hotel as there are too many negatives 
P => Need to upgrade the  Grand  franchise First the good bits location is as good as it gets for business in Mid Manhattan the breakfast is good and overlooking nd street is a good place to eat it    erm sorry no more good bits Got there at  o clock after long flight what seemed like an even longer immigration line and protracted taxi ride with a sullen driver who needs to learn some manners if he s looking to get a tip from me btw only to be told that the check in time was  o clock and that I would have to wait    not classy service as far as I m concerned  And when the room did become available it was hardly worth the wait it was small dark and in need of maintenance    there s lots more no restaurant in the evening bar like a  s gentleman s club lobby reminiscent of an airport lounge etc    etc    etc It isn t by accident that this hotel has such a poor rating on this site and that the good ratings that they do get are in the main from people who ve managed to blag a  deal off priceline If I d paid  this review might be a bit different But when you re paying   for a   hotel   this just doesn t cut it 
P => Bed Bugs Two friends and I took a girls trip to NYC and stayed at the Grand Hyatt  Me and one friend shared the same bed all four nights and both of us came home bitten by bed bugs  I received a medical diagnosis and have pictures of the bites  The first day home my friend called the front desk manager to tell him of the situation  He was non chalant about the problem and said hed look into it  I called the next day to file a formal complaint and upper mgmt said that hed first have to remove the occupants from the room this should have been done the day before  They did a formal inspection of the room with their company of choice and sent me after two requests a simple report that stated no bed bugs were found  The insurance agency would not help us as well  All that we requested was to be reimbursed for our hotel stay and medical expenses  They refused all requests  This hotel not only costs me  a night but time off from work medical expenses and time lost re washing every piece of clothing that I had taken with me  I strongly recommend that you DO NOT stay at this hotel  
P => Central location yet typically NYC rudestubborn personel Good things first extremely central next to Grand Central Station  Not so great no pool with kids a definite low  Now seemingly the Big Apple has gotten to them  I have stay in other Grand Hyatts where they practically bend over backwards for you  These other stays had been as an Executive living in Grand Suites with all perks  I had therefore accumulated quite a number of quotMilesquot Platinum Member for years that I wanted to use This visit was not made as an Executive and thus I was also treated like the usual Joe who is trying to cut corners and score free bees  More specifically there had been a misunderstanding that for my stay using my Miles the breakfast was included as it normally is as a Grand Club Member the GC breakfast is more basic as they tell me  At check in I was offered a upgrade to the GC for USD  something that in my mind since it was the first time using those Miles should have been complementary  Well I figured I was going to take advantage of the NYC diners and eat out always anyway so I did not ask for the upgrade  I was given some coupons for coffee that ended also being a joke because it did not count for any of the coffee I was having We ended up having breakfast once with the kids and there came the bill USD Well all the dicussion with the waiter trying to enpower him did not work complaining with the front desk trying to enpower them did not work Obviously GH does not empower their employees  I never complain and thus expected that they would reason with me yet the held me for a guy who always takes advantages  Too badI still like GH yet not this one it s a bad Apple Should I go back Ill make sure Im on Exec Duty and then Ill vote with my feet  
P => one of the best deals in NYC Ive stayed at the Grand Hyatt a few times now amp Im always satisfied  Great Location  Sure its a bit old in spots but i dont think its any huge problem by any means not like the Intercontinental Barclay   dont get me started on that place    If you are paying  yes you could probably do better but for what I usually pay usually around  total on priceline it cant be beat  and the rooms are always ent size unlike The Paramount or some other rip off places In terms of inexpensive food  dont order room service  dont go a across the street    go right below to Grand Central Station and their Gourmet Food Court on lower level    anything you want is right there   this was especially convenient when I went in uary   theres a door in the lobby that will lead you there without ever having to go outside  and all the major subways are there etc    Im not a fan of super huge hotels by any means but Ive never had a bad experience there and I will be staying there again in a few weeks 
P => The rooms are too OLD UST  The rooms are too OLD UST Location goodI paid   per night VIA pricelineI think that the hotel is not worth the money I would prefer to take a smaller hotel with free wireless this one  per day including breakfast the quotbreakfast place across the road is awful  dont go there you are all the way out dont pay so much  and the location is good but you need to take the sub  stations to get to timesquare 
P => Great deals can be found We recently took a trip to New York city and stayed at the Grand Hyatt  The location was fantastic   literally next door to Grand Central Station any location in the city was a quick Subway ride or walk away  We managed to find a great deal on the room through Expedia   paid less than  per night normally the room would have been nearly   The receptionconcierge services were very good and the location couldnt have been better  Avoid the hotel restaurant and do not buy the  per day convenience charge for breakfast     the food at the hotel was the biggest rip off   cup of coffee for room service  omelet  The restaurant wasnt much cheaper  The good thing is that there are many many restaurants and of course Star Bucks located within easy walking distance of the hotel The room was clean bigger than expected and comfortable  I wouldnt have wanted to pay  per night but for our deal of less than  it was totally worth it  
P => great location very nice staff restaurants a bit overpriced I wrote an email to the hotel long before arrival with the request of a non smoking room in one of the upper floors  I never got a response  However they were able to fill in my request at the time of check in  We had a nice room in the th floor  The room was big the bathroom pretty tiny with no space to put your own staff  There were some stains at the bathroom floor and in the tub  They could have vacuumed the room a bit better but other than that it was clean  There was also a walk in closet  The bed was very comfortable and we had a good sleep the room was very quiet The view from room  is a bit blocked from the building across the other side which is pretty close but since there was no street between the buidlings it was also very quiet Internet was wireless for  extra a day We had breakfast every morning in the restaurant Commodore Grill  It is a bit overpriced but good quality The staff was always very nice reponsive and helpful  The location is excellent  Next to Grand Central Station and withing walking distance to Empire State Building Rockefeller Center The United Nation Headquarter Time Square and other interesting points I would stay here again 
P => Excelent location I loved to stay there Great location beside The Grand Central Station   All hotel staff was very helpful and courteous  I will go back certainly 
P => Grand Hyatt NY Gets An  F  For Accommodations I just returned from a business trip to New York where I gave a presentation to a group of travel industry professionals  The conference went well but that is not my reason for writing this  The problem was with the Hotel The conference hotel was the Grand Hyatt in New York City  This is a very large business hotel located right next to Grand Central Station on nd street  I was excited about staying at the hotel as I really enjoy the Hyatt brand   I arrived at AM in stead of PM as my flight was late from Chicago due to weather in the New York area  So I am now very tired somewhat wet as it has been pouring rain for the entire trip from Newark Airport to the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I had to wade through the rain to get to the Super Shuttle Bus  I walk into the lobby of the Grand Hyatt and proceed to the Registration Desk  Now remember it is AM on Thursday morning and there are at least  people waiting in line to check in  Now that would not be so bad but there is only one desk clerk handling the check in and to add insult to injury there are approximately  self service check in kiosk that all say  OUT OF SERVICE   SEE DESK CLERK TO CHECK IN   So now I am very tired I have a bad headache and I am standing in a line that is not moving at all    minutes later I make it up to the desk clerk  I give him my name and my reservation number  He types it into the computer and then I see that look on his face that I have seen to many times before  You know the look of bad news at  in the morning  So he tells me that the room I reserved was not available  My heart dropped I said you have to give me a room  He tells me that he has a queen size smoking room  I said to myself  how bad could a smoking room be  So I say to the desk clerk I just need a room to sleep in I will take the room   So he gives me the key card and I proceed to the th floor room I was assigned  I get to the room and open the door and walk in and then it hit me  This room REAKED of smoke Oh did it stink it just knocked you over  It smelled like someone chain smoked no stop for a week But again I was so tired and I had this terrible headache and I just needed so sleep  So I climbed into the bed and fell asleep   When I woke up I really look around the room for the first time  The window shade was all stained and looked as if someone threw a cup of coffee on it  The lights on the night stands did not work properly  The Desk lamp shade was broken and had a hole in it  There was a floor lamp that was leaning over like someone bent the base  And the final straw the wifi in the room did not work  I walked into the bathroom to take a shower  The bathroom look pretty good so I get into the shower close the curtain and turned on the water  I adjusted the temperature and then the tub started to fill up  Ok so the drain was running slow  I hit the shower button and the shower turned on  It started to spray nicely around the curtain and on to the floor  I could not get a good flow onto me but it did a great job of making a puddle on the floor of the bathroom which I could not stop  I was really frustrated by this time  I got out of the shower and threw two towels on the floor to soak up the water  I then dried myself off with a third towel at least they gave me  towels and they were not the usual fluffy Hyatt towels they were very scratchy and thin towels  The service was just fair throughout the hotel  The public areas were very nice but the service was poor at best  I stay in lots of hotel rooms during the year and this was a stay that I want to forget  I cannot recommend the Grand Hyatt in New York until they do something to improve the quality control of the rooms and the attitude of the staff  
P => Great Hotel and Location My husband and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a long weekend in e  The rooms were a good size by Manhattan standards clean and stylish  The hotel is located right next to Grand Central station so it was super easy to take the subway all over the city  I highly recommend this hotel especially if you can get a good rate  Try Priceline  
P => Ive had grander PRICEWe booked our holiday with Virgin which included the flights transfers and hotel so I cannot give a complete accurate guide to price but I would say from looking at their website and the amount we paid its safe to say its about   a night for two on a weekend and about   a night on a weeknight for two  LOCATIONThe Grand Hyatt is in an excellent location if you wish to explore the whole of New York as it is situated next door to Grand Central Station but not so great if you are only there for the shopping as were we  It wasnt as much the distance to get to places it was the volume of people you would have to battle to get to the places you wanted to be  To get to Times Square you would be looking at a  minute walk at night but early in the morning about  minutes when there were less people  To get to attractions such as the Empire State building and Th Avenue it wouldnt take as long or be so hectic as you could walk across a block and down were there were a lot less people so it didnt take half as long if you were doing it on the main drag Being next door to Grand Central Station had its perks for us to though because if was raining really bad you could get to anywere in the city even just a couple of blocks up you could get the tube for  which is amazing value for money  If it is raining it is great as you just come out of the station and you can run right into your hotel When staying at The Grand Hyatt you find the areas around very interesting to the sides you are surrounded by huge offices and on the main road you are about  minutes away from a local ket and the famous library featured on Ghostbusters The hotel looks out on to a main road which has some pretty spectacular views as you can see all the yellow taxis going up and down and its just like a picture you expect to see FIRST IMPRESSIONSFrom the outside you can see the hotel from the top of the street it looks really tall and looks like it is all made from glass as it shines very brightly and is very noticeable as you can see the large Hyatt sign about  miles away When you walk through the large revolving doors you are met with a large open carpeted space and an escalator up to the reception area Once you are in the reception area you are met with a large reception desk to your left were you check in a bar on the next level next to the reception and a huge open seated area were anyone can sit and believe me anyone does I sat waiting for my transfer home and some Americans were having a book club meeting The reception area was big but it didnt have the wow factor for me sure it had large pots of flowers and a huge fountain but the atmosphere to me resembled that in a shopping arcade it had no natural light and was very much for show  On the right hand side of the room there was a huge Piano with table and chairs which I think were for special occasions but sitting in a reception area to me is not very special Straight ahead are about  lifts to take you to your room  These were a little more sophisticated with a large mirror behind you and a monitor with an image of concierge on talking you through all the floors  The lifts had a red carpet and golden features very plush CHECKING INThis is a very painful experience to say the least when they are busy  As we travelled at Christmas time I suppose it was a lot more congested but the staff just werent up to the volume of customers  When we arrived there was a lot of argy bargy going on with some Americans who did not have the right room bookedPictures of Grand Hyatt New York New York City reception  and were arguing with the staff and amongst themselves you then had others trying to push to the front and people who were just wondering around like they didnt have a care in the world  We as British people must have looked liked headless chickens because we did not have a clue what to do there was no help and if you stood around too close to the stairs the staff got annoyed and told us to move not very pleasant Once we arrived at check in we were told we had  rooms between  of us which was fine but they were all doubles no three bedded rooms You tell me how  people fit in  beds it just wasnt going to happen  However we couldnt be too annoyed as there were people being told they had been overbooked and they didnt actually have a room after all on the th ember to say tempers were frayed was an understatement  Once we had checked in I was not in the mood for letting one of the bell boys take my case for  not that mattered because we were not even asked they were too busy running around fussing over everybody else  So we hauled our cases into the lift and headed for the th floor Once we arrived in our rooms a concierge dumped a fold away bed in our rooms with no bedding or even an apology  This made my aunty who booked the holiday very angry so they went to complain and we were told two proper beds would be brought in and we could all have breakfast for the  nights we were staying and considering there were  of us and it was  a head we were quite glad  Needless to say they did bring another put me up bed which was exactly the same as hard as nails and about cm from the ground We were quick to realise the hotel was full to the rafters and we were not going to get better beds until some of the other guests shipped out so we didnt bother mentioning it again THE ROOMSThese were nice enough they were of a good standard quite large at sq ft but only what I would consider a business class room by this I mean a standard hotel you would stay in on business had gone enough facilities was clean and had modern d cor  It wasnt the sort of room I would call luxurious but what did I expect for the money I was paying Thats the problem I didnt know what to expect and I suppose I got what is average in most US hotels clean modern and just a place to lay your head The rooms were quite large with a  door wardrobe large desk with draw storage and a free computerised safe You then have your standard inch TV iron and ironing board radioalarm clock hairdryer telephone and complimentary toiletries In each room you can either have one king sized bed or two double beds in all rooms we had the standard king sized beds  Each rooms has its own heat controller so you can have the air conditioning on when you want and the heating on whenever you want  Well that was the idea but you had to put it on at least an hour before you were going to get cold because it took that long to warm up but at least if you were too hot it took about  seconds to return to an ice box I am a bit fussy when it comes to heat I love a nice warm room and this just wasnt it  The room had two large windows that opened which was nice if you wanted a quick blast of cold air but really something I didnt understand as air conditioning doesnt work when you have windows open and on the th floor you didnt have much to see unless you wanted to peer right into someones office A nice feature was that all rooms got a copy of the New York Times free of charge ok we didnt ever read it but it was a nice touch The bathroom was a huge disappointment it was clean and had ble features a toilet sink and regularly changed towels but the shower was terrible it was just a shower head and a horrible shower curtain  I think that sort of setup is far from   it is the sort of thing I expect in European   hotels but not American   hotels I would at least expect a ent shower or even shower over bath there was enough room for it but they just hadnt seemed to have bothered  The temperature of the water was also very hard to get right it was either freezing cold or boiling hot  On the first night we had to call the reception as the water was stone cold and we thought it wasnt going to heat up but after  minutes of being continuously on it finally heated up In all the Hyatt has  rooms  The rooms we stayed in were just the standard rooms which was the only choice given to us by Virgin but reading about the other rooms I dont think I would have bothered to pay any extra as none of the rooms seemed like they were any better they just had more seating areas  The choices were ior suites which were  sq ft and had a dining table work area and parlour VIP suites which were sq ft and had the same areas as the ior suites but with a view of the street and a ble and granite bath and now the Lexington suites which are a bit in the middle of the ior suite and the VIP suite as the rooms are  sq ft and have the same areas as the other to do but the Lexington also has the views The only upgrade I would have considered and obviously never would have afforded was the Regency club it definitely has the WOW factor if you stayed in one of these rooms you would be on the restricted area known as the st floor This floor is only for the guests booked in as regency guest in the price you get a continental breakfast and evening meal in the exclusive private lounge known as Hors Doeuvres  The floor also has it is own personal concierge and amazing views of New York City THE D CORIn and around the hotel everything is quite traditional to look modern chic like the ble floors cream carpets leather and upholstered chairs  You then get your gold finishes and bright lighting to make up for the lack of natural light The rooms are mainly finished to a good standard which are lit with about  lamps to give an nice relaxed feel with the furniture being a dark brown wood and a nice white crisp bed with gold and brown accessories COMFORT FACTORIn each room you get a high bed with nice fluffy pillows and quilt which feel really nice and comfortable when you get in especially when you get in from a long day  You also get a nice comfortable chair which doubles as a clothes rack every night if you are me and there is also a nice comfy twirly chair at the desk which is nice also for draping all your clothes overThe seating areas in the reception were also comfortable a little worn feeling but comfortable having to share the lobby with a bunch of people who arent even staying in the hotel is a bit weird but you get used to it WERE TO EATMost hotels in the US are based on a room only price and for anything they mess up they offer a free breakfast so most people end up getting a free breakfast  So your ok there but when it comes to lunch and your evening meal it is really difficult to find somewere nice yet cheap as in my personal experience you cant get it  The immediate area around the hotel is not the best place to eat but when it is raining you dont really have a choice opposite the hotel you have a burger bar type place from the outside and when you get in there it is very different with a very formal sit down dinner area and for  soups and  soft drinks you are looking at around  and that wasnt because we were feeling tight we just wanted some thing warm in our bellies if we had gone for the full courses we would have been looking at about the same per head There is a nice large Mc Donalds  minutes down the road if you fancy it cheap and cheerful  The only place nearby that I found acceptable to eat was at Grand Central station n the lower floor they have a very large food mall with about  different food outlets selling all kinds foods that you could rake away or eat in the large seating area  You can get a Chinese meal in there for around  with a drink and you will get to sample  different dishes If you prefer to eat in the hotel you can make a visit to theMANHATTAN SKY RESTAURANT BARThis really is a very informal restaurant overlooking the busy New York road and is well known for having the best breakfast menu on nd street and I cant disagree The restaurant is set out very nice with the main buffet area at the front were you walk in and then up a couple of steps a large area full of large tables and comfortable chairs next to  very large ceiling to floor windows so you get an amazing soundless view The restaurant is open for breakfast everyday from am till am I would advise to go really early or really late as the restaurant gets rammed after am  When you arrive in the restaurant you will be seated by a waiter or waitress who will then get you any toast hot and cold drinks  Now it is down to the buffet my favourite part once you have grabbed a plate the world is your oyster the food looks amazing and you always take far too much than you can eat The first area is the hot area were you can choose from bacon tomatoes eggs and black pudding and if you dont fancy any of that there is a chef on hand to cook you a fresh omelettes fried eggs and pancakes  Next is the cold area which was a selection of cheeses and different hams I always avoid these areas because I hate ham and not much of a cheese person especially in the early morning  Next to those you have a cereal area were you can pick any sort of cereal your heart desires even a bowl of hot porridge if you fancy it is all on hand The end part was my favourite part and was very much a weakness for me one table was covered in fresh fruit strawberries melon grapes oranges apples you name it they had it and I know your all thinking wow she is so healthy I couldnt help but feats my eyes over the next table filled with Danishes Oh my god they were good croissants apple Danishes orange Danishes muffins and blueberry buns  They were gorgeous a girls dream and you could eat as much as you want The food was excellent and I suppose if you were paying  a head you would expect that but the service was really good the staff couldnt do enough for you and the view is really amazing  Every other morning everyone would also get a small shot glass of a fruit smoothie which I thought was a nice touch didnt always taste great but a nice touch If you happened to be around the hotel at lunch time you could go back here and enjoy a selection of sandwiches and entrees unfortunately we never did this as we were out for most of the day and grabbed a bite in a subway or burger bar what ever was closest at the time  However I think if the food at lunch was as good as at breakfast it would have been delicious The restaurant was open am till pm for lunch In the evening if you arent out sampling New Yorks nightlife and too tired to drag yourself out you can make a reservation at THE COMMODORE GRILL This was a much more sophisticated atmosphere open pm till pm the commodore is a place you need to make a reservation at and this can be done at the hotel or online when we went it was Christmas time so we couldnt go and had to go to the riott in Times Square which was quite a bit more expensive but had a better view  Once you have a table booked you can look forward to full waiter service and a wide American continental cuisine menu  The restaurant is obviously upket and you can expect to get a meal there for around   a head which isnt bad as you cant get a really good meal in an upket restaurant for that ROOM SERVICEIf you dont fancy leaving your room for a bite to eat or your thirsty in the night you can order from the room service menu which is ok if your desperate but is very expensive and not really worth shelling out for although a lot of people seemed to have as when they finished it sometimes took the staff a while to come and get the trolleys from outside the rooms You could choose a simple soup for about  a steak for  or a basic curry or lasagne for  a tea or coffee for  and the a   service charge and    room service charge on top It isnt bad as far as room service goes but if you were really that thirsty you could just nip to the end of the corridor and get a free glass of water from the water machine and a couple of ice cubes or you could feed the vending machine  and get a can of pop OTHER FACILITIESThe hotel is very big and has facilities for all different types of people on the first level you will find about  different gift shops selling over priced souvenirs and toiletries just in case of emergencies  Which unfortunately I had to purchase I wasnt expecting a period and ended up paying   for an average pack of always sanitary towels which can be purchased here in the UK for about    I was disgusted but when you are desperate you have no choice  The concierge theatre and tour desk which was open from about am till pm and was very helpful you could book any trips here and the staff were very helpful in helping you make isions there was also a wide array of leaflets you could take to your room and make isions over The Commodore Lounge which was open from pm till am and could be found opposite the Commodore Grill this is the best place to hang out in the hotel it is very comfortable and sophisticated  You can get light snacks cocktails and a good selection of wines and beers that were priced reasonably ish after all you are on holiday but a beer usually sets you back about    and a glass of wine anything from   upwards Grand Caf  barThis was a nice reasonable coffee bar which mainly opened and closed whenever it was busy because when ever we seemed to go there it was closed  The coffee here was really nice and it is a very relaxed area despite being just above one of the busiest areas of the hotel For those who are interested here are the other facilities the hotel has that I did not take advantage of  Valet Parking Business centre and conference facilities Internet access Large gymCHECKING OUTThankfully for us and a lot of other checking out was pretty painless ish  We used a self check out machine which was very simple at the end of your stay you swipe your key card through the machine press on the names that are sharing that room and then confirm that there is no charges for room service or anything and you post your swipe card all done However we were not getting picked up until  that evening so we had to check our luggage into the luggage room  This was pretty easy we just handed over our cases and were given a slip to collect our cases later there was no charge for this and they didnt even expect a tip Checking out was all well and good but it had to be done by am and there was no other option such as a day room or anything  I know you are in the middle of New York and must be plenty of things to do but when you have spent all of your money and it is chucking it down with rain you dont really feel like wandering around so by about  we thought we would go back to the hotel have a sit down and a bit of a rest before out flight  How wrong could we be the staff are so strict you cant get away with anything  I was very tired and closed my eyes for about  minutes when I was told to get up and sleep with my eyes open I know I was in the middle of a hotel reception and am sure you guys are thinking what the hell was she doing but this reception was huge and more like a public area and was definitely not filled with a   standard snob  I then took my shoes off so I could fold my legs I mean  hours is a long time but obviously this was a big no no and was told if I didnt put my shoes on right now I would have to wait outside That is hospitable  OVERALLAfter a nice few days the treatment of staff really left a bad taste in my mouth I was a customer and had paid good money to stay in this hotel and they were going to throw me out To be honest given the choice I wouldnt stay here again I would go more up ket and stay in a more luxurious hotel in a better location and that actually looked like a hotel and not a shopping arcade I would give this hotel about Staff  except the maids they did a

P => Good deal Booked this hotel on priceline for night  Great location and nice room although a little on the small side  The walls were pretty thin in our room however as we could hear the people in the room next door  The hotel was the perfect distance away from the rucus of Times Square while being a walk away all the attractions  WARNING DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST AT THIS HOTEL  It costs  per person for a very average breakfast     I strongly recommend eating breakfast at a resto nearby instead    what a ripoff  Would stay here again only if I get a great deal again  This hotel is definitely not work  a night 
P => Terrible stay    small and dark room unfriendly staff  Great location though    I booked three nights at the Grand Hyatt through priceline for  a night  It seemed a fair price for a   hotel in NYC  Well    what a disappointment    the room was tiny and very dark  We were on floor  but it didnt help  There was just  small window and just enough room to move around but not much else  oh well a huge walk in closet  I dont have much to stay it was a terrible stay  The check in was fast because we used the quick automatic check in  We were assigned a room with a double bed  There was no complimentary tea or coffee or any kinds of hot water  Everything was for purchase downstairs  I was surprised its the first time I dont get such service in a quotgoodquot room and I travel a lot The first evening I became really sick and couldnt move  I had the worst headache of my life I couldnt do anything and it was really late  I called front desk asking for help I needed some advil or any kind or medication the kind you find at any store  They replied with a cold quotIm sorry we do not give meine to our guestsquot even though there was a Duanes Read right across the road and I really couldnt move at all  I dont mean they should do so but it would have helped   Anyway I didnt like the hotel at all  Too big too cold literally too it was freezing cold in the corridors and lobby no personality the staff barely does the minimum  Youre just another number to them not a guest  I didnt feel welcomed at all Its sad because I had planned on staying at the Hotel Chelsea for the whole stay but after reading a few bad reviews on tripadvisor I ided for one night at the Chelsea and the rest at the Hyatt expecting a lot from a   hotel  Well it ruined my stay  The Hotel Chelsea was just incredible one of the best hotels Ive ever been to  Hyatt on the other hand was one of the worst   Location is great right next to the Empire State Building and Grand Central station metro and all  Not my favorite area but recommended if youre just passing by    and staying out most of the time One good side is the room was very quiet  No street noise at all  I expected otherwise 
P => Nice very convenient location excellent hotel Nice clean spacious Connected to Grand Central  Great Location Definately will stay there again  
P => SMALL ROOMS We were here on a businesspleasure trip  We were here for  days  We had  double beds in our room  For the first  day there were only  of us so the double beds were fine  We each slept in one of them  However my cousin and here friend came to spend the other  days with us and these beds were really small then as well as the bathroom The hotel has a great location next to grand central but the price for food is outrageous here  We went next door to the food court at grand central to eat   Also one of the security guards told us about a small coffee shop located a couple of blocks away that was very reasonable that was open  hours a day  The front desk did give us coupons for coffee or water everyday we were there  We did have a problem with housekeeping  We had to request clean towels every day or you didnt get them  Also if you were not out of your room by  a m then you got no service  I dont think I would stay here again  The hotel was very old and too small  
P => needs to be reated i lived in nyc for  years and recently moved but i still have business in nyc and travel back once a month  last week I stayed here for  nights   it is a company choosen hotel  its a great location right next to grand central so its perfect for my work or for tourists ive stayed here  times this year   each time in a different room  this room was the worst of the bunch I wasnt impressed with any room yet  all rooms that ive stayed in were older with a few cosmetic updates such as new bedding a ent tv and a new sink  all rooms tend to be dark with poor lighting and uncomfrtable pillows in my opinion last week i got stuck with room   the room was basically the same as before with a ent view looking west  the room is older and had a musty smell  the carpet was OLD  it was held down near the bathroom with electrical tape  shocking in my opinion  Not sure why they dont replace it instad of using tape to hold the frayed edges down  then the st morning I got a shower the shower is old amp doesnt drain so i was stuck standing in dirty water  on my way out to meetings   i asked someone at the front desk to have the tub fixed and was assured that they would  the next morning   it was somewhat better but after  minutes the water filled up again  on top of that   the drain plug wasnt even attached to the tub but placed on the side of the tub  again i asked for this to be fixed  the final morning   another shower the plug still sitting on the side and the tub filled up yet again  im not sure how many times you have to ask for something to be fixed but for the price I or my company paid once should have been enough overall i think the hotel is in need of serious reation not just a cosmetic one  next month when i am in town   i am staying at a different company preferred hotel  it just isnt worth the price to me  
P => Wellcared for at wedding trip Staying at the New York Grand Hyatt during our wedding trip was a nice and comfortable experience  ONE man reason the staff I enjoy staying at Hyatt hotels whenever I can afford to  It is not too luxurious but it feels like a home  Concierge bellservice and front staff extreamly serviceminded and seemed almost genuinly caring about their guests That is really unique in a city like New York  At the Hyatt Regency in Jersey City the staff is also very kind and attentative but I would not have expected the same in the Manhattan hotel happily we were surprised  At our arrival somehow our booking had been cancelled but in no time we got an even better room with a smile Lan the wonderful girl at the frontdesk gave us good time and descriptions to make us ide on whether we would prefer a nicer room with no view or a nice view with a room next to elevators  Explaining our purpuse for our trip getting ried at city hall we even had the pleasure to recieve wine and snacks in our room compliments from frontstaff initiated by that sweet girl Lan During our stay we had the pleasure of the concierge service at many times  I am the type of person who usually find out everything myself online and on the phone but here the service was so nice and efficiant that we used it everyday instead of paying for wifi and phone in the room  Especially the girl Amanda did a wonderful job without giving the impressions that she was bothered which I often have the feeling when dealing with service people in NYC    And special thumbs up for her getting me excactly the appointment at the excact salon that I really wanted on the day of our departure back home The maidservice was not really that good even though we tipped generously and the rooms were worn cracks in the ceiling very dusty and the water pressure was really lousy  Still because of the wonderful staff and conveniant location we would consider returing here  
P => Great Hotel Great Location Loved It The hotel was wonderful  We arrived early and they kept our luggage for us until our room was ready free of charge  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and the service was fabulous  It is also connected to the tunnels of Grand Central Station so you can get great food shopping and right on the subway with out ever having to step outside  Without a doubt we will stay here again  
P => A few niggles but generally good If you can get this hotel through one of the discount sites then it would definitely be worth it  Unfortunately we paid full price which came in at around  for two rooms for a week  We had asked for two rooms together but were put on arate floors for the first night first niggle  However this was rectified the next day with a move of rooms  The rooms were spacious and clean and the beds very comfortable although as has been stated in previous reviews they could do with coffee  tea making facilities  The bathroom was also very clean although the plug for the bath didnt work and was not sorted after we pointed this out second niggle  The hotel is well appointed but feels a bit impersonal although having over  rooms perhaps this is to be expected  All the staff were approachable and friendly with one exception  On moving to our new rooms on day two we noticed that one of the televisions was damaged and reported this to the front desk  I later had a conversation with a member of staff who advised that all the TVs are checked daily the suggestion being that we had damaged the TV and were trying to duck out of accepting responsibility for this third and biggest niggle  However after some further dialogue he seemed to accept that I wasnt lying to him The hotel is in a great location and I would recommend it  However I dont feel that it is worth paying full price for  
P => Outstanding Service The hotel is very large and is connecting to central station  The location is outstanding  In walking distance to Times Square th Avenue and so on    If you would like to receive outstanding service at the reception ask for Blaine  She was a huge help and is very kind  She shows interest in all problems and tries to solve them as quickly as possible  The rooms are quite spacious and contain a plasma TV  The bathroom was on the smaller side  We took a clubroom  Its worth it  The Breakfast in the lounge was great and so was the dinner  The beds were very comfortable and quite large  I would recommend this hotel without second thoughts  We are deffinatly going to stay here again  Dont hesitate this is a great place and dont take any notice of the other bad reviews they are not correct  
P => Good Hotel in ideal location The Grand Hyatt is in an ideal location situated over Grand Central station on End St  We stayed for  nights in a king double room which was a very large room with an enormous super king size bed  The room was well furnished with plenty of hanging space for clothes and had a ent bathroom with quality fittings and freebies The hotel itself has a huge reception area with lounge type seating and a coffee shop with a bar a restaurant off the reception area  The breakfast room overlooks End St and offers a very wide range of breakfast foods all freshly cooked and well presented even if a bit pricy  We only ate in the restaurant once but it was very good The reception staff are very efficient with check inout taking less than  minutes and the rest of the staff are also very helpful and efficient I cant really fault the hotel on any aspect other than the very dim lighting in the room and bar   which is typical of New York where all the lighting is outside or in public areas We had dinner in the Bull and Bear one night attached to the Waldorf and that was probably the best steak Ive ever experienced  Try the surf and turf lobster and fillet if youre hungry  Id recommend the hotel for a short break   any longer and youll break the bank as its not a tourist hotel with lots of conference and meeting rooms  
P => Great hotel great location We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in   It was all you could ask for in a NYC hotel  We got the room from priceline at nt so that in itself was a miracle  The hotel could not have been in a better location literally connected to Grand Central Station and within walking distance to Times Square  We were never bothered by street noise  The room was very clean and had a large flat screen TV everything was new  My only complaint is that the sink in the bathroom was a pedestal style and had no counter space  But the bathroom was very large and clean  It also had a desk closet and ironironing board  The staff was very friendly and there were plenty of elevators so the wait time was always minimal  I would stay here again and again 
P => Wonderful This hotel is extremely elegant and the rooms are spacious luxurious and the staff were amongst the friendliest and most enthusiastic of any hotel staff I have encountered  From arrival to the restaurant staff each were personable friendly and gave that extra joy to staying in the hotel  The food was very well prepared and tasty as was the choice of places to eat  The conceirge was extremely helpful and it was the ideal location from which to wander around and get a feel for New York and for that reason would recommend it for first time travellers to New York as you are next door to Central Station located on Park Avenue a five minute walk from Times Square  You do not even have to leave from under the roof of the hotel to gain access to Grand Central Station  
P => Good location ok room  Stayed at this hotel at the beginning of y  We got a   off deal but even then it was quite pricey  The lobby is very grand with ble and fountains  The room compared to the impression the lobby left was a bit disappointing  The bathroom is very small and the bath is barely deep enough to paddle in but the shower is nice and powerful  The beds were comfortable  We had a room with two double beds so it was nice to have a larger bed to ourselves but it  be a squish if you end up sharing a double bed There were no coffeetea making facilities nor a fridgemini bar which was a bit disappointing but we lived  There is a lovely large television offerring a variety of services including TV internet     for unlimited use for  hours  We signed up to this as we had to book the next leg of our trip  Unfortunately the internet service kept crashing so we eventually gave up and asked for a refund Our room was not cleaned one day but thats not a huge problem  The staff at the reception were helpful The location is the main advantage of this hotel  Centrally located and right next to Grand Central Terminal so all the sites are within an easy walk or a subway ride away  I would consider staying at this hotel again if deals were available but definitely not if charged full price  
P => Good Hotel would repeat on next trip We stayed in the Grand Hyatt four nights   and New York was the first of four cities we visited  I only have  faults with this hotel  On a first inspection of the room we found the shower curtain covered with mould  Advised staff of problem and went out to eat when we returned almost two hours later the problem had not been resolved it took two more visits to the hotel staff in person before they finally changed the curtain   The only hotel in my visit to the states that did not have a coffee maker in the room a great inconvenience in the mornings  Lacks a small refrigerator to keep fresh water and snacks  Internet and local calls should be included in the price of the room   Apart from these three discrepancies this is a grand hotel staff is very friendly knowledgeable and courteous room is clean and spacious  
P => Nice but needs reation In the winter time Grand Hyatt is great to stay at since it has a direct passage that links it to Grand Central  That way you never have to go outside to get to the subway or trains  But the rooms are getting a little old and dirty  our last stay here we had to keep the bathroom door closed because to the mildew odor coming from it  We called and complained but were told that there were no more rooms available  Isnt that always the excuse But the location of the hotel is excellent  In the summer time the restaurant quotPershing Squarequot i think it is the name across the street and in front of Grand Centrals main entrance has outside street tables set up which is really nice So I would probably stay here again since after last time we complained with a letter and actually got hotel management to call and advise us that when we return to ask for him and he would make sure everything was great  Overall it is a nice hotel in a great location a little bit pricey but everything in NY is getting that way just in need of a little spring cleaning and sprucing up  
P => Great service My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a week in y and we had a lovely stay The location of the hotel is just right within walking distance of places like madisonlexingtonpark avenue and also within close proximity to central park and times square  And as Central Station is only next door the subway is also very close by  We were greeted by a very sweet and helpful member of staff at the front desk when we checked in and she was very accommodating when I asked for a quiet room without connecting doors  And when I came to realize that my booking only included breakfast for one of us she checked with her manager and then gave me six additional breakfast vouchers  I found her helpfulness and service to make a great first impression and like other people have written on this page when the service is so great it doesnt really matter if the rooms are a little bit dated  We will return for sure 
P => Great location   good service We stayed there for  nights and I have to say the location is pretty perfect  Right on Grand Central Terminal  mins walk to Times Sqaure   gernerally a great base for exploring the city  Rooms are good bathroom was on the small side but clean  Service was always good  Would reccomend this hotel  
P => Had a fantastic stay As always before heading somewhere I come to this forum to check out the reviews  Looking at the reviews of the Grand Hyatt I started to get a little discouraged  It spoke of small rooms lack of customer service noisy and no hot water  Well I must say I encountered none of these factors  My flight was  late but upon arriving quotMelissaquot checked us in with smiles  I had let her know that my luggage was lost my flight had been delayed  hours and things just werent going right  She promptly gave myself and my family a large back of toothpaste deodorant combs mouthwash and many FREE coffee coupons for starbucks which is in the lobby  She introduced me to the bellman who filled out a form so when my luggage was to be delivered to the hotel it would be sent right up  She also upgraded us to a larger room but that wouldnt be ready until the next morning  As promised by  the next day we had the larger room as promised and our luggage as there and life was good  Every morning we were greeted by smiles and our nights were restful no noise from any of the rooms and the hotel was pretty full  The shower pressure was strong and hot we were on the th floor  Now the rooms are smaller than other Hyatts but hey its NYC and larger by that standard  When you check in just ask if a larger room is available because they do vary with the same specifications you  request  The first night we had  dbl beds and the room and bathroom was small for the three of us but would be fine for  people  The room we went into the next day was perfect again with the  dbl beds  I just felt that I needed to write this so that you arrived less worried after reading the previous reviews  We were there for  nights and it was in walking distance to all of the attractions  The train station is right next door which offers shops food and great people watching  On a the corner is a store that is open hrs where you can get water juice snacks film underwear etc and get anything you  have left at home  The area is safe  Now I will say that the room service was a little more pricey for what i usually pay  I like breakfast in the morning and I am use to the service fees and price per person but the Grand Hyatt was so high that I just stepped outside and went elsewhere  Hey you are in NYC there are many places to grab a meal    When returning to NYC I will always stay here 
P => Excellent location We had a king size room with a rollaway bed for our dhter  Room was spacious bed was comfortable aircon worked fine room was clean fresh towels daily  I was surprised there wasnt a kettle to make a cup of tea or coffee but other than that we liked it  The location was really central  Approx  min walk from Times Square   what more could you want The foyer although impressively large needs a bit of updating its very brassgold eighties finish  I guess that it would take lots and lots of money to do this though as its so bit and as the economy is bleak Im assuming that its not top of their hit list to do  The only negative I would say is the prices on the menu are ridiculous  It was  for a bowl of cereal and about the same for fresh fruit  Needless to say we didnt eat in the hotel  
P => Nice Birthday experience As soon as we waked into the lower lobby my son thanked me for booking us such a great place  He has been to nicer hotels but loved this lobby area  With all the stone beautiful lighting bling etc the common areas of the hotel are very nice Between the fact we were staying on points and the hotel was sold out our expectations were low  Almost immediately we were delighted by our checkin staff member Jillian G  who saw we were  asked what the occasion was my birthday and then proceeded to make sure we had a comfortable room  It was a  room suite with  flat screens so we were very pleased  Right after our arrival Jillian had Guest Services delivered some chips and salsa and a bottle of wine  This was a very nice touch On the down side the bathroom was typically NYC small the walls are a bit thin and the room had just a hint of wear but as much as I travel this is very common these days  The room was clean amp roomy the staff was very friendly the localtion is very good and we wanted for nothing during our stay  
P => Large boxy room thin walls Ask for rooms without connecting doors   they were so thin I heard the entirety of quotley amp Mequot from the next room at amRooms are large and very s  
P => Jeremy is VERY kind Great service before I even stepped in the door I havent even made it there yet and Jeremy Front Desk manager already offered me great service  Ic alled at  on y  to ask for a small upgrade and if they could accomadate since my wife and I have not been alone and away from the kids in  years  By PM jeremy called back and offered an upgrade to a Suite  he was very kind and genuine and I just had to write a review before I even stepped in the door This shows some great committment to service and anyone should look at this if you want to feel welcome  Thanks Jeremy for your great and caring hospitality c 
P => Great Location and exceptional service As a solo traveler I found the Grand Hyatt in New York to be at a convenient location that offered any traveler the leisure of being able to access any point in New York without much difficulty Being next to Grand Central Station walking distance to Times Square and around the corner from Fifth Avenue the Grand Hyatt is located at the right spot for those who want to sight see and those that want to shop  While the rooms at the Grand Hyatt require some updating the staff were exceptionally accommodating in providing prompt and courteous customer service and went beyond themselves to provide a warm and friendly atmosphere notwithstanding the discounted room price that I had acquired through PriceLine com In my opinion the Grand Hyatt in New York offers and excellent location to discover New York City good value and an exceptional customer service policy  
P => Yikes    a waste of money  This hotel is not even close to being a  star hotel  While the lobby is beautiful it is truly eptive  The rooms are pretty standard  While they have large T V s  they also lack coffee makers or bar fridges  I have stayed at hole in the wall Super  motels that have both of these ammenities  The shower was moldy and smelled like urine the maid service really failed at giving it a proper cleaning  The walls are thin making it easy to hear others on the floor  Room service is horribly expensive as is everything else within the hotel  The worst part of our stay were the bed bugs we left with  After complaining to the front desk they informed us that others had complained of the bed bugs as well  They offered no compensation even after seeing the amount of bites on our arms and legs  This is a horrible hotel and should be avoided at all costs  
P => Nice hotel Better choices in NYC if you pay full price I will start by saying that I scored this hotel on Priceline for a great deal  So from my perspective it was a great deal  But if you pay the advertised rates not so much Location Midtown at Grand Central Station  You can access the hotel from the station  Its a great starting point for getting around the city Check in When I arrived there was a long line at the front desk  no one used the convenient self check in terminals  Not sure why  Bypass the line You can get your key from the machine request a king size bed and enter your Hyatt old Passport number right there  If you want to interact with a person be prepared to wait Room OK  Flat screen TV nice bed great view of the city  The bathroom was a letdown  I still dont know why a hotel will pay thousands of dollars to build out a room and neglect fixtures in the bathroom and the physical plant  It took a long time to get hot water in the shower and this was a lazy Saturday  Not sure how bad it would be on a business day when everyone is getting int he shower between  and  AM  The pull for the shower was very stiff  You  need help if you have arthritis  Amenities This is a full service hotel so they have everything and you have to pay for everything  Internet in the business center is not cheap nor is the in room internet  Breakfast from room service costs a fortune  Save yourself money  Go down the street to a nice deli for breakfast  Many of them have an internet cafe as well Overall it was a nice place  The staff was very friendly and helpful  At what i paid on Priceline this was definitely a good value  Not sure I would pay  per night for this place  For those prices I think you have better options  
P => Nice location little pricey Very good location across from grand central station first time in NY the rooms were a little pricey about  also when i checked in they gave me a smokers room dont check in on the kiosk did have the family package which gave you free breakfast and   food and drinks beers are   you have to pay  for the internet nice lobby and entrance but the rooms are not great stay for the location not the rooms or the price  very nice gym 
P => about what one would expect for a  star Priceline NYC hotel Which is to say quotnot a whole lotquot Moldy trim below shower door  Curtains which permitted too much daylight when drawn  No coffeemaker in room  No glasses or cups in room  Meh  I am in NYC about x annually and this was very average  That said  on Priceline in NYC doesnt leave much of an argument  Almost forgot     the ABSOLUTE WORST smelling soap and shampoo I have ever encountered  A scent which was a cross between commercial disinfectant and that of a urinal cake  GROSS 
P => Great Value and location Stayed for  nights in late e on vacation  This hotel was selected for me via Priceline bidding at a MUCH reduced rate  night otherwise Id probably rate this a  star  I requested a quiet room king bed and no smoking room  I was obliged on all accounts  Arrived at noon and they held our bags for free until we returned later in the day  Easy check in courteous staff  A bit small but it is N Y  If I had pain full price I might be a bit turned off by the room size though  Bathroom was very tiny and had an odd smell but had granite sink top and Kholer faucets  There was an odd clunking sound in the walls that was the plumbing valves we were told  As im a light sleeper I was worried about this but it did not affect sleeping at all  The or was modern though our rooms carpet was extremely worn and had a large gum spot  Nice quot plasma TV  Bed was very comfortable  Concierge was clutch for booking an outstanding value restaurant on short notice  Being on Central station it is EASY to navigate around the entire city  Really go ANYWHERE takes   tops in Manhattan  Id stay here again for the Priceline price but not the full room rate of you could do better im sure  Pros great priceline price great location attentive staff relatively clean facilities Cons Small room size and bathroom for face value odd clunking noise in bathroom wall 
P => Great Hotel Excellent Location Ive been at the Grand Hyatt for my second time Excellent room at the th Floor very clean excellent bed comfortable quiet I also experience a suite at rd Floor with two bathroom and all you need for an excellent stay Nice Staff and my special thanks to Jorge Lazo who make me feel at home a very special person who makes all to give you the best at your visit to this Hyatt I knew Jorge at the Hyatt Regency Miamiin  and now he is at NYC and I wanna make a very special mention for his incredible touch of warm and efficient work for my reservations and all my needs at a new visit to New York City  I also have access to the Gd Club for breakfast and Evening H  dEvre excellent food beverages  so once again Hyatt give me more than any other Hotel Thank you hope to be back soon  
P => location is tops Myself and my partner had a long weekend at the Hyatt booked the hotel thru priceline for   per night which is about a fair reflection to be honest its location would be hard to better being next door to Grand Central station indeed you can access the hotel from the concourse of the station Rooms are clean bathroom is ok large screen LCD with the usual channels however no ESPN Don t expect a view from your room here as it is overlooked on all sides despite being a consdierable size itself My only real complaint was that you can hear the slightest noise from the room next door thru the quotjoining doorquot indeed i had to ring the main desk after being woken at  am by two returning guests next door on consecutive nights however they were alot quieter on the third night I can t comment on the food or the bar scene at the hotel as i didn t once bother em i prefer the quotrealquot New Yorkquot eating and drinking experience On the whole it was as expected no better no worse Give Smith amp Wollensky s on rd Ave a wide bearth my th and final visit this trip it is trading on past glories and is too stuffy for my liking tip less than   and they won t even acknowlege you leaving a better bet is about  blocks north PJ Clarkes a really friendly bar mixed clientele food available til am and the yland Crabcakes are exceptional the olde world bar and the jukebox to match make it a perfect hang out 
P => Great location and what you would expect from a large hotel  I booked the Hyatt as part of a deal through Virgin Holidays  At check in I we were both given coffee cards which entitled us to a complimentary coffee tea or bottled water each morning from the kiosk in the lobby  This was great as it was Starbucks Coffee and there were also other snack items on offer  We only took the free coffee though as being next to Grand Central Terminal everything you could ever want is there  From Bagel bars to Hale amp Hearty Soups to Pizza and Chinese although you might not want Chinese for breakfast Having arrived at Room  on the th Floor if you hadnt already guessed it we were surprised to find such a large  double bedded room after reading some of the previous reviews on here  There was plenty of room for two guys who had packed far more clothes than was required for our  day trip  There was a more than ample writing desk a large widescreen LCD TV an iPod docking station safe and much needed air conditioning  The bathroom wasnt overly huge but then who needs it The only minus point for the bathroom was that the shower curtain had mildew on the inside which was off putting The beds were very comfortable and sleep was no problem whatsoever  I had the bed next to the aircon vent which if youre a light sleeper you might want to turn down or off at night  As for other noise which has been previously mentioned I couldnt hear it We couldnt hear any of our neighbours and barely heard housekeeping outside in the corridor either Overall the Grand Hyatt is what you would expect from an International Group and shouldnt disappoint with its facilities There is a very handy Duane Reade across the street Chrysler Building which sells bottled water confectionary pharmacy items magazines etc basically anything youve forgotten to pack A short walk gets you most places like th Avenue Times Square and the Rockefeller Center  I would recommend the Sightseeing Bus though as walking from one place to another can get pretty tiring as I found out   we did NOT take the busIf all you need is a clean ent sized room a good location and the knowledge that you have a ent brand behind you then you cant go far wrong with the Hyatt We took a Limo from JFK to the hotel which and returned to JFK in a Sedan  However a NYC Taxi has a flat rate of  to JFK plus the custoy tip of course  The guys on the doors at the hotel are fab and will help with luggage  We checked out at pm after requesting to keep the room on and after that we stored our luggage with the Bell desk  Be warned that a  per item is charged for storage so might be a good idea to try and avoid storing too much Didnt eat in the restaurant but did enjoy the bar on a couple of nights for a nightcap where the staff are very friendly and helpful Checkout was automatic and smooth   you dont have to queueWould stay there again without hesitation  
P => An okay hotel that should be better As a travel agent I stay in hotels all over the world  I would not book this hotel for a client  The best thing about the Hyatt outside of the stylish lobby although the furniture in it is very uncomfortable is its location adjacent to Grand Central Terminal  There are easy subway connections to everywhere in the city and a nice food court in the terminal to offset the outlandish food prices in the hotel  The standard room is quite small but adequate  There was a great view weest on nd street from the room  Internet is  per day which is not bad for a business hotel of course many chains now offer it free  The room came equipped with only five hangers and no soap for the bathtub  I called to have soap delivered and it never came  Later that night I called for soap and hangers we had clothes laid out on the bed and therefore couldnt go to sleep and was told they would be right up  After  minutes I called again  The hangers and soap finally arrived  The following day after the room was cleaned we were left with one hand towel and one washcloth  The ice bucket was not refreshed and was sitting filled with water from melted cubes  The shower curtain hung off its hooks in four or five places  Upon check out we had to store bags for a few hours  The Hyatt charges two dollars a bag for storage  This costs them nothing and is really a cheezy way to make money  Although these are small issues they go to the quality of a hotel and its care for its guests  There are far better hotel choices in NYC at this price point  
P => How is a lost umbrella worth  The selling point for this hotel is its location which is convenient to most things in NY  The room size was on the average to large side and although wallpaper was peeling and it was a bit dingy the white i e  clean comforter and comportable mattress meant I got a good nights sleep Two issues   I ordered a bottle of water from room service  It ended up costing over   It was  liter of Aquafina later learned   at Duane Read across the street and was    delivery fee  tax and automatic gratuity Even worse however is that it was raining during my stay and I needed to borrow an umbrella  There are none in the rooms and the bell men wont give any out  You have to get in line with the people checking in and out at the front desk and then they will let you borrow one only after putting a  charge on your room If you return the umbrella they take the charge off   if not you pay the   I said quotso what if I acidentally leave it at the restaurantquot and they said it would be a  mistake  Im sorry but this is offensive and absurd  Although it would be tacky I could live with them charging me the actual cost of the umbrella Im sure less than  in bulk from China if I dont return it  What I cant understand is how and why they would expect  
P => Stay here   the best location We were originally intending to stay in Chelsea but due to hotel complications we were switched to the Grand Hyatt at the last minute  This proved to be a happy ending after all  The location is great  I would highly recommend anyone visiting New York to base themselves here  The hotel although quite large has great customer service  We were upgraded at check in and then moved to an even larger room the next day without even asking  The only complaints I would have is that there was no fridge or coffee facilities in the room and the plumbing was quite noisy  Apart from that it was great  It also felt very safe walking around this area at night   always lots of people around  
P => Best location in NYC This hotel has everything It attached to Grand Central Station  I stayed on the st floor which is the club floor  The lounge has a complimentary breakfast in the evening hors doeuvre and desserts from pm to pm  The bathrooms are tiny  So if you need a large bathroom stay away  
P => Much better than last time Unlike my last stay see earlier negative review this one was much better because  there was a reading lamp next to the chair in the room  there was a new flat panel TV screen in the room although the movie system didnt have the clearest picture   kind of fuzzy  the room was very cleanthe housekeeping staff was friendly and  aided perhaps by the self check in kiosks the check in experience was fast and friendly  The lobby is still an anthill owing to great central location but theyve organized the people flow better and I appreciated the complimentary coffee coupons  The only discordant notes this time around The stiff pricing of the room service menu especially in the context of the sometimes long hold times in getting through to room service on the phone but the operators were always very friendly  
P => Hotel Lacks Many Amenities We stayed  days and nights at this hotel  The bathroom is very small and the hot water very slow  I did not find the bed at all comfortable  it sort of tilted to the side  The lobby is very grand and nice and the doormen and bellhops very accommodating as well as the receptionist  I found the food very pricey even for New York  The hotel is in a good location though to be fair and the room was clean but the bed and lack of dressing mirror was not good  I dont think I would stay here again  
P => Awesome Experience The hotel is in a great location just a short stroll along  nd Street toTimes Square where all the action is  The foyer is sensational room service was great  The rooms were roomy and very clean and the bed was to die for  I have recommended this hotel to other travellers  It certainly started my travel experience off on a good start Satisfied Aussie Traveller 
P => Great stay at the Grand Hyatt I booked the Grand Hyatt through the name your own price on priceline  Paid night  Couldnt ask for more in NYC for that price  Amazing location grand lobby quick check in quick elevators super comfortable bed no issue with late check out and very clean amp updated rooms  The walls are a bit thin and the rooms are smaller than other cities but its NYC   small rooms are to be expected and Ive seen much smaller  At night this was an incredible deal that I would recommend to anyone  
P => Pricey Clean  Check in was very quick and smooth and I received a double room  The rate was reasonable for NYC but still too high  The room was small but was quiet and comfortable  The bed was comfortable  Lighting in the room was good  The work desk was large and the office style chair functional and comfortable  There was a flat screen TV  The TV was had a lot of cable channels as well as a wide selection of pay per view movies  The bathroom was clean  Lighting was good the towels were plentiful and the shower worked well   immediate hot water with plenty of pressure  Bath amenities include shampoo conditioner lotion and mouthwash The hotel public areas were clean and well kept but could use an updating to the style of the rooms  There are some restaurants within a few minutes of the hotel  We ate at a diner on nd and rd  It was okay  There are many fast food outlets on the bottom floor of Grand Central Station  I recommend checking them out for variety price and convenience  During our stay in Manhattan we also stayed at the Affina Dumont on th and Lexington  For visits to Manhattan I prefer either the Affinia Dumont andor Residence Inn Times Square for better value   larger room kitchenette quiet variety of eating choices and location  While the Grand Hyatt is a very good property and has a convenient location its price and small rooms are were not a good value for me  
P => Great room great location great rate  Stayed in Room  for four nights in early   Asked for a quiet room and got one  Very impressed with the size of the room particularly in New York City  Nice flat screen tv ample desk and chair sitting chair and ottoman king bed two nightstands and still plenty of room  Window opened too with a peek a boo view of the street  The closet was huge more like a dressing room than a closet  The bathroom was fine not a lot of counter space but shelves on the wall and under the sink made it work  Paid  for the first two weeknights and  for last two weekend nights booked at the hotels website  Location cant be beat  Connects to Grand Central shops restaurants etc  without even going outside  Free tour of Grand Central on Fridays at  meets right across street at Whitney Museum at Altria Sculpture Court  Also shops right out the door  Only item wished for was a coffee maker in the room  Would definitely stay here again  
P => Paying For Location This hotel is what youd expect from a hotel in Manhattan  Very small and very expensive  What youre paying for here is the location and the location is pretty good  Youre right at Grand Central Station so you can get where youre going quickly  This hotel was not as nice as other Hyatts Ive stayed at but it was good enough  
P => Wonderful location but need to pay for almost everything I stayed in Grand Hyatt New York for  nights from  to   Its my first time to stay in New York  The lobby is amazing  The location is wonderful  Its true  Just near by the grand central terminal  Its good and safe for foreigners especially for Asian when we went back to hotel at late night  We dont have to walk for a while from the nearest station  The room inside is also good  A little old but looks good enough at least in Manhattan   Oh fortunately the beds are really good  Its also good for people who have serious jet lag such like me  When its pm in New York its am in Taipei  But there has one thing Im disappointed with  That is we need to pay for almost everything  For example I need to pay for breakfast wireless internet access     Even for the bisness center I still needed to pay   It wont be happened in most hotels in Asia  Only one thing is free for room guests thats fitness center  And there had no hot water in rooms either if I want to have hot tea by myself  And there has another minor thing I might need to complain  I had  different bookings one is from  to  another is  and the check out date is   Before checking in I asked the front desk that if I should do anything for the  different bookings For example should I check in again on  They said I dont have to do anything  But that truth is our room cards were expired on  and we had to check in again on   Fortunately the front desk at that night was very nice  She is a black woman but I dont know her name  Oh about the noise yes its a litttle noisy there especially at night  And the wall is truly thin as paper   Well so the keypoint would be the service and location  For me I might stay again there because I think the service from the front desk is not so bad  
P => Great Hotel Large Clean Rooms My husband and I stayed here on our long weekend trip to NY and were very pleased with the hotel  The hotel is huge and has a large really pretty lobby  The staff were helpful the rooms were fairly large and the beds were comfortable  We enjoyed our stay here  
P => Terrible accounting  Good luck if you need a receipt after your stay  My company participated in an event and getting the receipts for the charges post event have been beyond ridiculous  No one returns calls or emails  The company Hyatt uses for their accounting has NO CLUE what is going on  They arent tied into the on property system so are useless  You get passed around from one person to another and since their is no follow up youre screwed  Too bad because seems like the property is pretty nice but good luck on getting receipts after the fact Will never recommend this property for doing an event  
P => Best Location EVER Street noise a bit much  This was our third trip to NYC this year and booked this hotel on Hotwire for nt for  nights  There is no better location as this literally sits above Grand Central Station at nd and Lexington  The Chrysler Building is also on the same block  As you enter the lobby you are greeted by a very large airy space with gold columns and lots of plants  Once you get to the top of the escalator in the main lobby a helpful doorman greets you and the concierges desk is right there to the left  The check in staff was amazing  They pointed out all the restaurants in the hotel then gave us several suggestions for breakfast in the morning within a couple blocks the hotel  The rooms we booked were on the st floor and each had  double beds a safe desk large closet a long window that actually opened and small bathroom with next to no room to put your toiletries  The alarm clock is also an ipod dock which was great  We missed not having a small fridge however  Overnight street noise was our only complaint Even  floors up the all night honking or horns and over zelous horn and siren operators of the NYPD and NYFD made nights tough  Night  however was much different I wore earplugs  Room service is very expensive as are the restaurants within the hotel  There is a hr Duane Reade right across the street for a quickcheap beer run  All staff we associated with were a delight and very helpful  Hope this helps you ide  We are definitely staying here next time just because of the location alone  We always get the  Day Unlimited Subway pass for  so this location is ideal for us to get to Columbus Circle Union Square Bowling Green you name it  
P => no privacy what so ever The walls in this hotel are paper thin you can hear everything that is going on in the next room  Two nights out of our  night stay we were repeatedly awakened by people in the next room  Could not have appetizers only in the dining room  
P => Would absolutely recommend to a friend    Just returned having spent  nights at the Grand Hyatt impressive hotel from exterior and lobby  Room was spacious upgraded us to a deluxe king very comfy bed although room itself could do with some updating  Had no difficulty whatsoever with noise as we were located on the th floor overlooking a roof terrace  Location is A and with very friendly staff  Would suggest having breakfast outside of the hotel at one of the many streetside dinerscafes   fabulous selection with fresh fruit bowls etc very healthy had drinks at hotel bar on one night quite expensive so resolved to visit the local pubs thereafter which were much more of the norm in price  Would definitely stay at this hotel again for comfort and especially for location  
P => No frills but hard to beat Ive stayed here a few times over the last couple of years  Its true that the rooms are a little tired but Ive not had a bad stay there  The rooms are big particularly by New York standards and clean the service is efficient and everyone does what theyre supposed to do and the location is hard to beat  I dont normally go out much in the area but it is very central and has good connections on the Subway Nothing flash but what it does it does well  
P => Great   with a good deal We just got back from the Grand Hyatt  I had booked a room through Priceline for a great price  When we arrived  pm our room was still not ready so we had to leave the bags at the bellboy who charges a  fee per bag  Now Ive been to a lot of hotels around the world but its the first time ever I have to pay for leaving my bags  Could be a specific New York or US thing   honestly it had been a while since I was in the US So anyway   the fact the room wasnt ready didnt bother us a lot as the hotel is superbly located at Grand Central Station where you can take subway lines taking you to virtually all of New York City lines  and  are great lexington express line getting you uptown and downtown in  minutes  The Times Square Shuttle evenly great takes you in about  min  to Times Square  Not interested in the subway Not a problem it took us  minutes by foot to th avenue and another  to Times Square We got our room at pm as promised by the very friendly receptionist  We received a Deluxe King which is slightly bigger than standard room  The room is nice but could need a little make over old carpet old furniture etc   The bathroom however DEFINITELY needs a serious update  Its not worth a   at allWe never took room service waaaaay too expensive  youve got all you need on the streets  We took once the breakfast buffet   It is not worth it I would rather give this money to a cosy diner there are a few around the hotel Whats interesting though is the fact that youve got a starbucks stand located right in the lobby of the hotel  Very convenient should you want a quick coffee  muffin on the go in the event you are in a hurry The conclusion is that if you can get a good deal on the internet not more that  then its definitely worth it considering the high prices of the hotels in NY otherwise there are better hotels in NY if you are willing to pay the full price for  
P => Convenient location The hotel is a business class hotel room was comfortable though  need a little upgrading especially the carpet the size of the room more than make up the lack of space in the bathroom  Though its a very busy hotel check in amp check out is a breeze concierge is very helpful  Grand Central Station is connected to the hotel with a fantastic food hall where you can get great gourmet food  It is within easy walking distance to all the major tourist haunts  
P => Great Night in Manhattan The staff was very friendly and helpful and the common areas were very beautiful  The hotel room was a good bit bigger than expected and was well appointed although the style was rather minimalistic  The bathroom was a bit small but was still sufficient a mirror over the desk would have been helpful for my wife to put on her makeup Upon check in I requested an upgrade from an quotexecutive queenquot room to a room with a king size bed and the nice woman checking us in was happy to comply  Additionally there were copious elevators so there was never much of a wait  for floors lower than th  for floors above the th floor  The workout room seemed to have lots of equipment and looked clean  We never had help with our luggage it was offered several times never forcefully so I cant comment on the helpfulness of the bellhops A couple of minor demerits A the bed was not terribly comfortable because it transferred motion to my wife whenever I turned over during the night but it was still passably comfortable   we have a very comfortable foam bed at home so my expectations  have been too high B The room was near the elevators and everytime one of them stopped at our floor it would chime this was very annoying at AM so bring some ear plugs in case you are near the elevators or are a light sleeper  The only major downside to our trip was that parking was  per night we ided to pay it to save time since we were only in town one night and also since we could take it up with the hotel if the car was damaged   which it was notOverall the Grand Hyatt New York is a VERY NICE hotel and I would definitely stay there again if the price is right full disclosure I got the hotel room through bidding on Priceline com and the rate was only  per night  taxes and fees  If I had paid the rack rate I would have expected a little bit more but I would definitely lower my value score 
P => The perfect pre Christmas getaway We arrived by train for a four day rest  The weather was harsh but thank goodness for the Hyatt we just wheeled our luggage through Grand Central Station and into our hotel  We were greeted as if we were old friends at check in  The room was comfortable and quiet  Without having to go outdoors we had an excellent steak dinner that evening in the Station  The next day I was able to fill in on Christmas shopping from the enchanting holiday arts and crafts festival in the Station  Of course in the remaining dayswe also went to the theatre and the Metropolitan Museum and returned home agreed that well do the same thing next year  The Hyatt made it all easy and pleasant  its the perfect way to visit New York 
P => Great Location The location of the hotel is great i e walking distance to most Broadway shows times square and sight seeing pick up locations  Would recommend this as a place to stay for people who want to be out and about the central location gives you a lot of flexibility to get anywhere  
P => Perfect Location World Class Hotel You know what youre getting with a prestigious brand which was our reason for booking the Hyatt   it delivered Booked room only   U S hotels are often like this but we didnt mind   rooms were really comfortable and tastefully orated   pillow menu available etc and nice selection of bathroom freebies   hotel wasnt overtly design led or trendy so try elsewhere if you want this  I particularly liked the location   on Park Avenue   walking distance to everywhere So easy to hail yellow taxis and a stones throw from Grand Central station which has a brilliant food hall and food ket   you must check it out Selling a great array of fresh produce bakery and deli stuff etc  Had some great meals in NYC   notably Blue Smoke and Joe Allen   check out my restaurant reviews  Perfect hotel base for sightseeing  
P => Avoid this one if you want an untroubled sleep Ive stayed   Grand Hyatts all round the world   Im normally exceptionally happy with the service etc  This week I was given the option of staying   a W or a GH     I always stay   the W in NYC so opted for  nights   the GH instead Boy mistake My room was directly opposite the elevators avoid   Noise all night and early morning    including cleaning and security staff walkie talkies quotMORE TOILET ROLL REQUIRED ROOM quot     no one wants to be woken to that The issue is theres about  ft and thin door between the corridor and your bed But thats not all  The walls and the interconnecting doors are paper thin  I could hear EVERY noise and conversation made by my heighbours on both sides  Their blackberry alarms rang    and  respectively each morning  SO clear were the rings I thought it was my alarm tone in my room Oh rooms were very tired and on the bad side of run down AVOID  
P => Good Service Hard to Justify the Price I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a conference in ober   With the conference rate the room was still close to  night but I guess that goes with the territory since I could not find a cheaper room in the vicinity  The location could not be beat I loved being right in the heart of midtown right next to Grand Central Station  I walked all over the place any time I had a free moment  I felt that the hotel did a great job with the conference too   they were good at signage room set up food etc  Of course this is my perception as an attendee not a conference planner The great service part I arrived at am after a red eye flight from the west coast  I was planning to drop my bags at the hotel and explore but thought it couldnt hurt to ask if I could check in early  The very friendly person who helped me asked if I would like to check in now I did She checked me into a room with two beds instead of the one I requested with apologies but I was certainly not about to complain  She also suggested that I join the Hyatt Gold club because it would entitle me to as many free coffee and tea coupons as I wanted for the cafe in the lobby  This was great because coffee and tea were several dollars a cup there and I had some each day  The so so The room was a fine size and had what I considered a great view mostly of buildings but it all felt so New York for me who had only been to NY twice in my life before  My complaint was that it wasnt immaculately cleaned  There was dust on the counters and some light fixtures were tarnished  Internet access was an additional day and I thought this should be included  These things shouldnt be a big deal but somehow at NYC hotel prices I expected perfection  This was not perfect  It was a good stay though and again the location was perfection Service was great through and through  
P => Great location great value Great hotel great location and great value especially if you take advantage of the advance booking rates  
P => Perfect location We have stayed at the Grand Hyatt in New York on four different occasions   We typically take the train into New York arriving at Penn Station so the fact that this hotel is right next to Grand Central is extremely convenient  We enjoy taking the subway when we are in New York so the location is great  They have wonderful buffet breakfast  a little pricey but worth it  We typically stay on the club level so you receive a continental breakfast with your room rate they also have lite snacks very lite during the afternoon  We have not been there in the evening to enjoy the desserts so I have no comment on that  The staff is very friendly and helpful  The hotel is just a short train ride from time square  My husband and I enjoy going into Grand Central having a coffee and just watching everyone  Great place to stay  Very easy to find and get back to when you have been out walking around Everyone knows where Grand Central isremember it is right next door  
P => Couldnt have picked a better hotel in New York for the money It would be hard to imagine the New York experience getting much better than this  Rooms are massive foyer is grand terrific hotel all round Great shoe shine out the front and a couple of blocks from the centre of NYC or the UN Empire State and any number of other attractions  Walk to everywhere in NYC from here and on top of Grand Central Station to boot Terrific email for details if required  
P => Good location aging property RECOMMENDED price dependent Ive stayed at the Grand Hyatt several times in last  years  Hotel is well located for transit and getting around  Check in was prompt and friendly and a room change was handled in a friendly manner  The property is in general good condition  Rooms are fairly large by NY standards and relatively quiet  Furnished updated and tasteful  Internet while not free was only  a day  Negatives our bathroom was quite tiny and with no shower illumination meaning in the dark  No coffee or tea maker  Bedding is sub par for a   property  Room service prices were out of mind  The net is this is a fine choice if you get a good deal if you get stung by a high rate there are likely other nearby choices you  wish to consider  
P => Stay Here Just returned from a five night break at the Grand Hyatt  As the previous reviewer commented the location is perfect away from the manic bustle of Times Square but still within walking distance  We had a king deluxe room only slightly more expensive than the basic package  The room  was very spacious and spotlessly clean although the bathrooms in the hotel could probably do with an upgrade and there was no view  However this did mean that the room was very quiet and we had no trouble with our neighbours  We have high standards and were pleasantly surprised with the hotel expecially after reading some of the previous reviews  New York is very expensive as the exchange rate is dreadful but all things considered we cant wait to return A couple of tips   take the Staten Island ferry to see the Statue of Liberty as it is free and book any Broadway shows with the Box Office at the venue  
P => Perfect location Excellent service Friendly staff Just Beautiful We just got back from a week in New York City and I couldnt wait to write a review about our stay there First of all we were extremely impressed with the city overall from the airport JFK to the subways to every little part of the city  It is a very clean and friendly city It was our first time there we brought our two teenage children and we all had a GREAT time It was Easter week and toward the latter part of the week the city got crowded especially Times Square but still we were able to avoid the crowds for the most part  Which brings me to my review of the Grand Hyatt  Being as how wed never been to NYC before I thought that mYbe being closer to Times Square was the way to go but NO We found that the location of the Hyatt was absolutely perfect It is next to Grand Central Station which means that it is convenient to get to ANYWHERE in the city by taking the subway but it is far enough from the ridiculous crowds in Times Square which feels like Vegas We were always so happy to get back to our hotel at the end of each day  The lobby is BEAUTIFUL the staff are really wonderful and our room was great  The day we got there the front desk attendant Gordon wrote out explicit directions for us to get a quick little self guided tour of the city from our hotel  It was such a great walk around in order to see some of the famous sites around like Times Square Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall  As soon as I saw Times Square I was SOOOO happy that I didnt book a hotel in that area  Our hotel was convenient to everything you would want to see with the added bonus of being like a respite from the chaos of the city  We loved it and cant wait to go back We would definitely stay there again 
P => Wow Great hotel nice rooms and perfect location Highly rec 
P => Location location location first visit to NYC and got a good deal on the Grand Hyatt  Being in the center of NYC and on Manhattan it was perfect for us  Just perfect  And everybody were friendly serviceminded and helpful  I would strongly recommend this hotel to everybody that asks  Only thing why only  stars on rooms is that the room is rather small   of course you dont spend a lot of time in the room but it fitted the  double beds and a desk and that was it  But again wonderful hotel  
P => ent but nothing special This was my first stay at the GH in New York and I was only there for  hours  However these are my impressions  The hotel itself is very large and as such does not provide the quotpersonalquot style you get from smaller places or other hyatts I have stayed at I booked a deluxe king room and had a best room on the day guarantee through platinum status  The room was very plain and faced out onto another part of the hyatt no view at all  If that is one of the better deluxe rooms then I do not think much of their room ratings  I  be a bit harsh but I have assessed their rooms against other hyatts and   star hotelsThe gym is great and I did not use room service  The front desk staff were very polite and helpful but I could not believe that they charge a departing guest  per bag to hold your bags for you be this is common in NYC but I have never come across it elsewhere   its not the money that upset me it was the principle The location of the hotel was fantastic making it an easy walk to Times Square and also being right on top of grand central station so getting around on the train was very easy  
P => Perfect location when arriving in city by ground transportation  When arriving at Grand Central it was great to be able to enter the hotel without having to leave the station on such a cold night  The service was excellent and room quiet considering its location  The only negative is the bathroom toiletries   the scent is more like porta potty than the herbal fragrance they boast  
P => Great stay with only a few issues  I have to agree with others the walls are RICE PAPER THIN  If it wasnt for the noise and issues with the bathroom I would have give the hotel  stars  The front desk was amazing she was very accommodating and even upgraded us to a deluxe room  To be honest I didnt have high expectations because I got a GREAT DEAL through Priceline for   per night  I was treated as if I paid full price  The walls are thin and the noise from the street below at times kept me awake so next time I will bring ear plugs  The location is wonderful and the hotel staff were all very pleasant  I will return next year  
P => Fantastic location very good hotel After reading all the reviews we were a bit worried about this hotel  But we spent  night there and  the room was very big confortable and clean the bed was Hyatt standard the bathroom was a bit small  for NYC standard not so small   the room was facing the Crysler Building and was very quiet  the lobby is big and nice Starbuck is in the lobby so we had our breakfast there each morning  the people at the Concierge are very nice and helpful  room service is good   we tryed it twice as we were very tired   the food was good and they prepared us also things not in the menu in th minutes  the location is really fantastic The Grand Central Station with all the very good restaurants is some steps from the hotel the th avenue is really near Broadway is just three bust stops form the hotelOverall we are satisfied and we will be back again  
P => Excellent Site for Business Meetings Guest Room Walls are PAPER Thin I held an event at the Grand Hyatt in ch   The catering manager handling our event Lori Palencias was excellent  She made herself fully available to me and went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed  Not to mention the hotel is in the best location in Manhattan Everything is at your doorstep or a short trip away with all transit at a stones throw  The guest rooms had the necessary amenities and were a ent size for a NY hotel  I only stayed one night but could hear my neighbors as if they were in the room with me  LITERALLY  Some of my co workers that stayed had the same comment  Our President actually opened the door connecting the two rooms because he was certain the door on their end must have been open it was not  I will definitely use the Grand Hyatt NY again for business meetingsevents 
P => Not Grand  Expensive for price  Excellent Location  I stayed here at the end of uary in one of the Lexington Suites  I was able to check in at midday which were very accomodating  The front desk was polite and friendly and were able to give me a room with an excellent night view of the Crysler Building on the th Floor  The room was large for New York standards but it was suite so I was expecting it so  The bed was very comfortable and the room had an ipoid dock which came in handy  Large quot LCD tv a sitting area with a couch and closets  The room is fine the housekeeping terrible  The maids didnt bother to clean the carpets or the tables when they had some crums from some cookies I bought  They did not bother to change the glasses I had used the previous nights either  They failed to put out new bath contents various times which was annoying  The thing that bothered me the most was the security at the hotel I was stopped by one of the security guys probably because I am latinamerican but we are not all poor who asked to see proof that I was staying there  I ignored him and continued to my room and one of the front desk people must have explained to him I was staying at the Lex suite  I didnt priceline the hotel but booked straight on Hyatt com I feel that this Hyatt should not be classed   but instead a good    Location is excellent though the reason why I stayed there  Next time am in NYC I will stay at the Intercontinental or Sheraton  
P => Unbeatable location where subway stations are next to you Though Ive stayed at numerous hotels in New York City I couldnt be happier with the Grand Hyatt that is literally next to Grand Central Terminal which Subway lines      and S  I stayed here for business and needed to get to downtown Upper West Side Upper East Side and even Queens I didnt have trouble from my location The hotel itself is clean and sufficient to my travel  The rooms are small but its normal for NYC size  I do wish that Grand Hyatt offered free Internet service since I had to pay per day for connectivity  My room also faced the Chrysler building which was a nice treat 
P => Highly recommended Travelled to NYC with my wife for  nights after purchasing hotel on priceline  Check in staff were quick and pleasant  Our room was on the th floor and had a view down nd St  The room was a good size for New York and had a queen size bed  There was a walk in closet to store your clothes and bags a large LCD TV a small but functional bathroom with ent water pressure  Internet was reasonable at  per day and worked well  The room was clean and nicely orated  Loved the fact that hotel is next to Grand Central Station  There are some terrific economical restaurants in there and we chose not to spend our money on room service  The gym is open  hrs and the treadmills have personal TVs to watch while working out We loved the location a quick  minute walk to Times Square   access to subways nezt door    lots of meal choices within a few blocks Wouldnt hesitate to return here 
P => Good but not Grand Recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt for  nights on business to NYC  Got a great rate on Priceline  The hotels location CAN NOT be beat  It is on top of Grand Central and from there you can get virtually anywhere you need to go  The rooms are adequate but housekeeping is hit or miss  Some days they never emptied the trash nor changed the dirty glasses  All in all I would stay there again if the price was right but to pay rack rate is not worth it  Best part of the hotel is the workout room  One thing to beware of are taxis through the hotel  I needed a taxi to the airport and the hotel had one that was standing by  The driver refused to put the meter on and when I asked how he planned on knowing what to charge me for the ride he quoted an astronomical flat rate  This is an illegal scam and I was very disappointed to see it happening in the city I grew up in  A taxi from Manhattan to LaGuardia airport is based on the meter reading and anthing otherwise is a blatant attempt to rip off unsuspecting tourists  
P => Lovely Hotel I was taken here as a surprise for my birthday by my partner  Checking in was very swift so there was not much waiting around and the lobby was amazing  Our room was lovely and was very large and the bed well it was amazing it was huge and so comfortable The bathroom was also very nice and the shower was good and strong we also had our bathroom stocked up daily with soap etc  The room service prices were very expensive so dont order from there unless you are willing to pay a very high price  Our room was very clean and the staff were very friendly  We were at the front of the hotel but didnt hear much noise  We were high up and the lifts were very quick which was nice  Also if you are going to go and see a broadway show i wouldnt recommend getting your tickets from the hotel as they are majorly ked up and are very very expensive  We bought the New York pass and were very glad we did as you save money and can skip lines  The location of this hotel is ideal as it is very close to most things and we walked almost everywhere from our hotel rather than getting cabs and the underground but it was very handy being with in a  second walk from grand central station I cant find any fault with the hotel itself and would definately stay here again but on the last day i put my suitcase in their store room for it to be looked after and the porters broke the handle and then when i complained said it wasnt them and it was like it when they got it 
P => Wonderful Big City Hotel Had a wonderful experiance at the NYC Grand Hyatt  We stayed for  nights during the middle of ruary   Was able to get the hotel through Priceline for a great price  This is a large convention hotel attached directly to Grand Central Station  Made our transporation by subway super easy since the  lines run on one side of the hotel and the  and Times Square Shuttle line can get you over to Times Square and connect to multiple other lines there  Never had to go outside to get to the Subway  Also lots of good shops and food right in Grand Cenral Station  The hotel lobby is gorgeous   coming back at the end of sightseeing each day to the water fountain that dominate the east end of the lobby was a treat  The staff were very friend and helpful  No issue about getting the room on Priceline when checking in   even got some free coupons for coffee or tea at the lobby snack bar Our room was on the th floor  The room had no view to speak of   looked out to the another wing of the hotel  However for the price we were not complaining since the room was so well appointed and clean  Also given the location   the building is surrounding by lots of other tall buildings so I am not sure too many of the rooms have much of view but the buildings across the street  Nice comfortable queen size bed double closet desk  inch flat screen tv chest of drawers and in room safe  Also a chair and ottoman  We discovered that being on the backside of the hotel facing the another wing of the hotel meant almost NO outside noise from the streetI agree with other comments that the bathroom was small   but well organized   and I have seen much smaller in NYC Never had an issue with a long wait for elevators as other have complained   however I image the hotel was not comletely full given the time of year and current economic slow down  Other complaints about noise in the hall way or slaming doors are the type of stuff you find in most hotels   never was a real bother for us I would never hestiate about staying here again 
P =>  Nice  but needs double glazing My Wife and dhter stayed in this hotel with me from th   until th   for a Christmas break  The Grand Hyatt is a lovely Hotel and its in a great location for getting around New York  The only problem I would say this hotel has is the lack of double glazing to the windows you could hear everything going on outside i e  sirens car horns trucks etc even people shouting  After the first night it was earplugs every night  This was a shame really because the room was lovely and clean and the beds were very comfortable  The hotel staff were friendly enough when approached  The hotel restaurants are quiet expensive but the lobby coffee bar was very reasonable and well stocked  Id probably stay here again but not without earplugs    
P => Great Location We stayed in the grand Hyatt New York for  nights in ember     First of all New York is a great city this was my rd trip but my girlfriends st theres too much to see and do there but staying at the Grand Hyatt made it easier thanks to its fantastic location  Its very well located downtown a short walk from th Avenue and Times Square  A longer walk up to Central Park but thats OK because walking around is what we do in New York rightWe were lucky that we were upgarded to a suite thanks to a friend of mine who works for the Hyatt Group having made the reservation for us but I would guess that the quality of the furniture fittings bathrooms is equal throughout the hotel  And that quality is top class If there is a downside it is that the hotel is very very big and that makes the lobby a crowded and busy place at times but you have to love the multi cultural nature of New York and being in such a big place meant hearing different languages every day in the lift    Another downside is the costs of additions wi fi access in the room was  per day and a Starbucks coffee delivered to the room worked out at almost  including the room service charge Im no scrooge but clearly thats ridiculous a morning walk into the neighbouring Grand Central Station sourced the necessary morning kick off for a couple of bucks   We used the gym every day it is well fitted out and was never too busy  The room was great overlooking the Chrysler building from the th floor  The room was well cleaned every day and a good size  All in all we were extremely satisfied again as a base to tour all over New York the Grand Hyatt is an excellent choice  
P => Excellent staff accomodations and service You will want for nothing  First of all the staff evertyone is so helpful friendly courteous and accomodating you would think that you were the only guest at the hotel  The building lobby rooms and accompanying facilities are excellent clean and well maintained  If you are looking for a wonderful stay at a four star hotel in midtown Manhattan look no further  I would recommend this for everyone  
P => Great Room For Price Stayed on a Saturday night for  via Priceline  We called down for a rollaway and fridge as we were traveling witth toddler  They came within  minutes   no charge  We called downstairs at pm as neighbor was blasting music   heard it from the elevator   the hotel responded immediately  I do think walls are thin but the price and location served our needs  The bathroom is very small but it is what we expected from a NYC Hotel  All in all what we expected knowing Manhattan hotels  
P => Excellent hotel great location I stayed  nights in a big double bed room queen size it was perfect the people are friendly and helpful  The room was clean great view on the Chrysler building Close Times square mn walk and next to Grand central station very convenient I recommend breakfast at Comfort Dinner th street one block on the right after the post office Dinner Metro caf  same street than the hotel m direction Times square  
P => Room noise too loud Book the hotel through Priceline for  plus taxes  Not a bad deal but if I knew it was this hotel I would have book a  star and would have saved   I book  nights a year through Priceline com and this is at the high end of what someone should pay for this star rating  The hotel has little noise insulation and you can hear every door slam and noise from the room next door  If you require parking I suggest Central parking  East rd in from PM AM and out by  AM  plus Tax  Make sure not to go past AM if you do the rate soars to   
P => lovely stay at downtown NY Expensive but fabulous stay at down town NYC at Christmas time  
P => Better Experience This Year Stayed here with my teenage dhter for  nights at a discounted conference rate equal to about one half the retail rate  This year we were given a much larger room still with  double beds and the bathroom was far more comfortable and attractive  Very friendly and helpful staff  The only negative was that breakfast was delivered too early one morning before we were even awake  
P => Pretty nice and at the right price Great deal for Manhattan   a night through Priceline by naming my price  Very nice lobby great location nice rooms  Large by NYC standards  Only complain was thin walls in the room  I could easily hear my neighbors alarms cell phones etc  
P => The Best location Stayed in this hotel in uary  with my husband and two children in a one bedroom suite It is a short walk away from Times Square and connected to Central Station   Cant beat this location The rooms are big for NYC and very comfortable  The concierge desk was helpful with directions We loved New York and love this hotel  The cleaning staff were a bit noisy very early in the morning  
P => ent if not paying full price Ive stayed here three times over the last few months  Twice for business and once for pleasure  Every time I booked it through priceline  The location is good and the rooms are pretty nice for NYC  The only issue I had when staying twice for business was that the walls were so thin  I was woken up at am by someone elses alarm the first time  The second time I was woken up at about am with someone elses tv blaring Finally I stayed there with my husband for a couple of nights over the weekend  This time the room was not very clean  There was actually feces on the shower curtain next to the toilet  There was also part of a wrapper under the pillow  Since we had just moved rooms since they mistakenly gave us a smoking room at first very quick to switch us though didnt have the energy to do it again Given this I  ide to try a different area using priceline for next time  Im really not thrilled with this hotel and would not rate it  stars  
P => Good Location Out of the hotels I have stayed in within Manhatten I found this to have one of the best locations   just next door to the magnificent central station it is within very close walking distance of Times Square Central Park Empire State and the Crysler Building I asked for a high floor room and thats what I got  My room didnt have a brilliant view but only staying one night and not intending to spend alot of time inside I wasnt over bothered My room was spacious with a walk in wardrobe  with Iron    the bathroom was also a good size with hairdryer lots of hot water and complimetary toilertries  It would have been nice to have coffee making facilities in the room but you could buy it down in the lobby if you wanted to There was wireless internet access  extra cost from T mobile but I didnt manage to connect There was a very good air con system in the room   it was the first time in ages that I have managed to get a good heat balance in a hotel I didnt eat in at the hotel as I always think that there are so many places to eat outside    I usually have my  very big breakfast at the Park Cafe of th Avenue   have breakfast there and it will last you all dayThe lobby is very impressive with facilities for quick check in and out   I asked for an extended check out and they willingly let me have the room until pm  normally am The hotel also have their own cars  at the same charges as the yellow cabs    I used one to get to the airport and found it to be a bit more comfortable If you visit I hope you enjoy your stay 
P => loved this hotel this hotel is very nice and in a very good location  its right next to grand central station and time square was about a  minutes walk away  the rooms were really nice and clean and the beds were really comfortable  the only complaints i had was that you could hear the people in the rooms next door  also i made a mobile call for seconds from the room and they tried to charge me US  but the staff are very friendly and nice and are always willing to help you  
P => Best Location in New york city Hyatt of New York offers the most updated technology for check in an check out  Also you receive information via email prior to arrival  I have to say for a large hotel the service was outstannding  The lobby is wonderful very spacious  offering starbucks is a good choice  I had phoned housekeeping and found a efficient cheerful voice at the other end  hotel staff seeeemed happy and our every question was answered with satisfaction  quality the bathroom was a  star offering no counter space tinyhorrible toliet and tub  the room was a  star standard  For the location and price I will certainly stay at this hotel again be next time ask for a different room cat  
P => Great choice fantastic location It is a huge hotel in a huge city and be too impersonal for some but we loved it  You can be anywhere in the city and look up at the beautiful Chrysler building and know how far away you are from your hotel  and whether you are close enough to walk or should take a cab  We loved looking just outside our window to see that famous landk  The window was a bit leaky with cold air but the fastantic heat kept the room very toasty on the coldest nights  The room was very clean and every contact we had with any staff mamber was friendly and helpful  We heard nothing from our neighbors or the street  And the famous Oyster Bar next door at Grand Central Station is not to be missed  What a great city 
P => great location  The location of this hotel is fantastic  Its just a few meters from Grand Central Terminal  Price is not so good but this is NYC The room is small but well orated and clean comfortable bedspillows Hotel charges for wireless Internet access in the room  
P => Impersonal I stayed here on business  I am glad I did not do so on my own coin  While the location was good and the room ent the size of the hotel rendered it a pretty impersonal experiecne  The elevators were always packed to the point that they had people stuffing us in and it took forever to get on one on any floor  There seemed to be inumerable bus groups  The lines for anything check out baggage check cabs etc    were long  I never saw any staff member more than once  There were no real problems with individual staff members I think it was just a matter of scale  NYC is an amazing city and the people are generally very friendly   considering its size  The Hyatt had me feeling that I was in a run of the mill place  
P => Excellent Hotel in every way Excellent hotel in a fantastic location in Manhattan  The hotel is directly beside Central station you can take the tube all over manhattan and only a ten minute walk from fifth avenue braodway etc  The lobby is beautiful with a ble interior staff can not do enough to help you  The rooms are a great size large kingsize bed flat screen t v  good sized bathroom  I would definitely recommend this hotel in terms of location luxury and service  
P => Great location We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for  nights st      th     We checked in early but the room wasn t ready so we left our bags and went off to explore  this was free but there is a  per bag charge for this service when you check out When we arrived back the room still wasn t ready so we went for a coffee and when we returned the room still wasn t ready so they changed us to a different room   same type just one that was cleaned no upgradeThe room was nice nothing amazing it had  double beds a tv a desk and a bathroom  It was very clean and comfortable  The best part of the room was that outside our window was the Chrysler building which I was thrilled aboutThe hotel is in a great location   Sandwiched between Grand Central Station and the Chrysler Building there are lots of restaurants cafes etc around to  Although be warned of the caf  right opposite the hotel I forget the name it was very expensive and not so great either The Hotel is very grand hence the name I guess  the lobby is the most elaborate I have ever seen spread over  levels with fountains and lights everywhere and plenty of seating  There are  lifts so there is never a wait Also in the lobby is a ticket booth to book any Broadway shows etc aswell as a coffee shop and a few shops The only problem we had was that we purchased a phone card to ring England and we asked reception about using it in our room they said it was   for the first half hour per call and so many cents after that but the next morning they pushed a bill for  under the door We went down and complained and they said it was due to a code that we used and after a few words and the manager getting involved they cancelled it and charged us the correct price of  So be aware of this if you plan on staying hereOver all I would say this is great hotel for me due to its location we got it quite  cheap  via hotelclub but im not sure if I would pay full price to stay here but as I say we enjoyed it the room was comfortable and it was a great base for our trip  
P => A lovely hotel   so close to everything  I was a little apprehensive before arriving at this hotel because of the previous reviews  We arrived on the  and stayed for  nIghts  I was on holiday with my husband my two sons and the girlfriend of one of my sons  We had three erate bedrooms on the th floor  The rooms were clean and not small as some reviews stated  The beds were very comfortable  The rooms were cleaned everyday  The staff were always helpful on reception  The hotel is idealy situated for sightseeing right next to Grand Central Station  I really could not fault it and wish I was still there New York is a wonderful city to visit the people are friendly and the views are spectacular  We cant all wait to go back Be prepared to walk miles as that is the best way to see everything  We went all the usual trips Liberty Big Apple Helicopter Trip Spirit evening boat cruise with meal Movie Sites Tour and Hop On Hop Off bus loops  We visited Ground Zero which was very moving  I can also recommend Gordon Ramseys London Restaurant   the food was amazing  Well worth the extra money just for the experiance  We all had a wonderful time 
P => Love Being Central This hotel lived up to its standards  From the moment you walk in you are welcomed by a grand lobby  Being around Christmas time the orations in the lobby really made you feel the festive spirit  The reception is quite efficient in its processing given the number of people coming through the hotel  The staff maintain their friendliness as well even during times of difficulty  So that is really commendable  The room we got had a great view being the corner room  Apparently it was the Deluxe Room so it was slightly larger than the Standard Rooms they had on offer  This was very much appreciated  Not only was the room bigger but the bathroom was also more spacious as well  The room had modern furnishings in it with a big flat screen TV  A large desk is also available for use if you need it  The amenities provided in the bathroom are also top quality which is always appreciated  The beds are also very comfortable making it ideal for those coming off a long flight like we did  The fitness centre is at the top floor of the hotel  This makes for a great view and a good motivation for going to the gym  The hotel has a couple of bars and restaurants as well so plenty of things to entertain you The hotels location is probably its best asset  The hotel is right above Grand Central Station which means it is easily accessible from all modes of transport  Shuttle buses from the airport stop right out the front of Grand Central Station as well  So no matter what mode of transport you are taking except a plane of course you can easily get to the hotel  You are only a couple of blocks from th Ave  Taxis are cheap if you need to get anywhere in Manhattan since it is such a central location  Definitely worth coming back to if I am in NY again  
P => location location location this hotel was perfect for a long weekend getaway to NYC  it is nearly on top of grand central station there is a walkway which goes into grand central all indoors  easy and cheap to get to from JFK just hop on the air train then to the A then to the  line and we were there  if you want to see and do everything in a short time stay here  the room was clean nice by new york standards the bed was very comfortable with down pillows  have lunch at the oyster bar in the station  have dinner at tavern on the green  then for the best and most romantic lunch of all go to cafe sabarski on th across from central park  the place is not cheap but so lovely  a nice place to drink champagne eat german food and view the park  perfect trip 
P => nice place in a nice city stayed for a christmas week  location is absolutely superb grand central is literally the next door and from there you can go anywhere by subway  cabs are also very well available in front of the station lobby is quite grand indeed  lobby staff were nice without any specials  I got all I needed standard room was in th floor with not much views  after super comfy european hotels this felt only quite ok  without double windows a bit chilly breezes are what you get but effective heating helped us and that did not bother us  I read a lot about noise problems but that did not bother me at all  did not hear bad noise at all at first place  sleeped like a log every night  room was cleaned every day and was always clean  big tv and safe in room  different room for clothes was great i pod dock with radio was good one used it every day had one breakfast at the hotel which was good but typically for NY hotels overpriced  did not eat other meals at the hotel booked this from hyatt com for USD without fees or taxes  ok price for hotel of this quality  i recommend if one is looking for prime location and risk free basic accommodation  
P => grand hyatt nyc Everything was very enjoyable about this hotel except for the housekeeping staff  on more than one occasion the beds were not properly made and the bathroom floor was neither swept nor mopped for our whole stay we were there a week  But on the whole the location was brilliant and the room a very reasonable size for one in the city  
P => Loved the Hyatt We spent New Year in the Hayatt and thought it was excellent  It has the wow factor when you enter the hotel with the foyer covered in mirrors and a nice waterfall feature  Check in was very good polite staff  Stayed on the th floor in a business suite with comp breakfast  The room was huge with huge comfortable bed  The only downside was no tea and cofee facilities  With prices very high from room service use Starbucks next door and take out  Maid service was great  No problems with noise except on New Years morning about  am but that was expected  Continental breakfast was ok but  upgrate to fruit and cold meats or  upgrade to full was well worth it  Great views from breakfast restraunt easy un rushed atmosphere with good food and endless coffee  In all enjoyed the stay and would deffinately go back and recommend  The only downside to the holiday was New Year in Times Square very cold badly organised and not worth the  hour stand with no food or toilets  
P => Better than usual A vast improvement over recent stays this is the company approved business hotel  The front desk and coffee shop staff were definitely happier friendlier and less surly than past visits  The room was clean and yes a cup of room service coffee is Like someone else mentioned ask to stay on the high floors and in particular one of the side rooms overlooking Grand Central and nd Street  These seem to be the lightest and most spacious rooms If you are transiting through NYC for a night or two and the rate is good this Hyatt can be quite OK  
P => Excellent location Had a great New Year break at this hotel  Entrance to the hotel is impressive  Service was excellent and all the staff we met were friendly polite and very efficient Room was a ent size very very comfortable king size bed  Room also has armchair desk TV and walk in wardrobe  Bathroom was a little small but perfectly sufficient for our needs  Room or was typical quothotel brown beigequot and probably in need of a makeover  But the room and bathroom was very very clean and the maid service was excellent  Some reviews have mentioned the potential for noise due to thin walls  this was NOT a problem for us but can see this could be if you had noisy neighnours etc we were there over new year and the hotel was v busy and full  I would say avoid rooms near the elevators or the vending ice machine  There was no minibar but we had room service which was prompt and of a good standard  The hotel bar had a great atmosphere and was comfortable with good service  There are lots of options nearby for breakfast etc  theres a good food court in Grand Central Station  The Michael Jordan Steakhouse is a ent restaurant in the station but not cheap Times Square etc is about   minutes walk away  The location of the hotel is great and provides easy access to all the sights and even the most ice NYC taxi driver knows where Grand Central is I would return to this hotel and would recommend it subject to the notes and advice above  
P => Very nice huge hotel We had a lovely Christmas stay check in was great we are lucky enough to be Hyatt points card holders so we were give a club suite on the st floor great view of the city  Also had access to the club lounge which served a good continental breakfast afternoon tea and evening snacks  The room was very large with a sitting area but the bathroom was quite small cleaning service was excellent  This hotel is huge ive never seen so many people in the foyer or so many lifts but plenty of staff about to help and direct Fantastic location next to Grand Central Station did a free yes some things are free in NY walking tour of Grand Central its on Fridays at   meet in Whitney museum SW corner of nd and Park Ave This was my th visit to New York and I have to say its wonderful at Christmas with the orations Christmas kets and Ice rinks Radio City Christmas spectacular was fantastic bought tickets at the box office day before show to save ridiculous online extra charges Overall this was probably my best hotel stay in New York 
P => Great Location in NYC Went to New York for Christmas with my two girls for  days  Had a fantastic first time in NYC  The best thing about the Grand Hyatt is its central location and the fact that it is next door to Grand Central Terminal which all the cab drivers know  About the hotel the entrance and lobby are just spectacular and the desk and concierge were very helpful  However sadly as is common the guest rooms are a far cry from the elaborate public areas  Ours was basic pretty small and had few frills  The bathroom was tiny  There was a hairdryer iron and ironing board  No fridge kettle or coffee maker however and room service is astronomic so suggest you take a travel kettle and teacoffee supplies  The room was quiet and warm so no problems there  We had breakfast on Christmas day in the hotel again big disappointment food was cold dhter found a hair in her scrambled egg had to queue with people coming off the street no special treatment given to paying guests  Cost over   for  of us to have basic cooked breakfast which was pretty lhable  Across the street the Pershing Restaurant serves a fantastic breakfast so comes highly recommended however costly again at   for  of us to have their fab  pancakes  I was told that most New Yorkers grab a bagel and coffee from Starbucks which are on every corner  Apparently its only the tourists who pay the expensive hotel restaraunt charges for breakfastBack to the hotel the room service was good left a tip for the maid each day  Had to ask for a few things she forgot to replace such as shampoo etc  Take LOADS of  dollar bills because everyone has to be tipped  Heres an example  a bag   a day for chamber maid    tip for meals    bartenders cab drivers   of fare  Had Christmas day dinner in the Benjamin Restaurant which is a steak house within a short walk from the hotel  The steaks were the BEST we have ever tasted  The meal was memorable  This classy restaurant is highly recommended as a special treat  The concierge can book it for you  Allow about  per person for a steak plus sides are about  each  Weather   freezing Do not underestimate how cold it is in NYC in winter  We wore thermals and thick tights and hats and thick scarvesgloves are a must  Lots of New Yorkers wear North Face clothing especially long coats because it is SO cold  They sell ear muffs for  the NYPD wear them so they must be considered ok they are a must if you want to keep your ears from dropping off  Lots of guys wear dear stalker hats with ear flaps nice  Once wrapped up however with sensible boots you can happily trudge everywhere the NY grid system is so easy to follow   take a pocket sized street map with you and get the subway or a taxi when you are tired  Heres a link to help you plan     We took a full day tour   hours with On Board Tours which was a great day and we saw so much  Highly recommend this tour company  Professional tour guide lots of getting off the bus and seeing the sites including a staten island ferry crossing to get a great view of Liberty  This tour leaves every day from Times Square     Also make sure that you go up the Empire State Building and include the NY Skyride which is great If you want to go shopping who doesnt      sales are on everywhere Macys is great  Unlike rest of US the New York women are on the slim side so size NYC US small     UK medium     UK and large     UK  Any bigger and you need to look for womens in shops such as Macys and Old Navy There is great shopping in SOHO  blend of SO uth of HO uston Street no relation to SOHO London   There is also an out of town about  hour away shopping mall that is supposed to be great  Ask the concierge  Also go to China Town for the famous NY knock off designer handbags  All in all   what a great city  Next time I plan to stay somewhere cheaper why pay for a swanky entrance lobby if all the rooms in NYC are small Have a fabulous time and dont forget to try the Cosmopolitan cocktails they are SOOO Sex in the City 
P => Better than expected I had read reviews about the hotel being dirty and that the rooms were nicer on the higher floors  So I called the hotel directly not the  number for Hyatt and told them of my findings and asked for clean rooms on the higher floors  We had booked  rooms for the family and to our surprise they had upgraded us to what i assume is a superior room  All three of them were corner rooms and were huge by New York City standards  Our room had a bottle of wine cheese and crackers  We were pleasantly surprised  Also ask for coupons for coffee or tea when checking in  Having them was a bonus  The staff was very friendly the rooms are nicely appointed although I must say that the bathrooms are small the water didnt drain in our shower and Im just not into plastic shower curtains  All in all we had a great trip to the big A and enjoyed some quality time with our kids ages  and    I usually look for smaller boutique hotels when we travel however for a big brand Hyatt always pulls through 
P => Great location for sights and shopping We stayed  nights in ember  in the Grand Hyatt and we had a great holiday  The lobby was very impressive and the check in was very efficient   staff were always helpful and friendly We got the room for a very reasonable price so we were pleasantly suprised by the lovely room comfy king sized bed and cleanliness  It wasnt very big but all we needed  The room had climate control which was brilliant as it was snowing when we were there and absolutely freezing so it was nice to turn up the temperature when we got home to our room  Bathroom was small but shower was powerful and gave nice toiletries  New lcd flat screen tvs were getting installed during our stay but the work never bothered us at all and the satellite tv provided was great  We were on the st floor so werent bothered by noise outside but the walls were pretty thin and could hear the guests in the next rooms conversation  We were hardly in the room much so didnt bother us The restaurant food at the Commodore Grill was excellent although the menu wasnt very extensive and was a little pricey  The homemade breads were a nice touch and the service was impeccable The ket grill in grand central was great to grab breakfast in the morning for a reasonable price and the pizzas at two boots there were fab too Dont eat at the TGI Fridays next to the hotel or the KFC we grabbed some food from there on the last day for quickness and it was disgusting The location of the hotel is excellent   walking distance to all the main attractions inc Rockefeller Center Empire State th Avenue Radio City Music Hall Times Square Central Park etc etc  It was also extremely handy for getting the bus to the airport   buses to all  major airports just round the corner from hotel  This was very useful as it cost us  plus tip from Newark Airport at the start of the holiday which was a lot more expensive than we had hoped for and a bit of a shock to say the least It didnt help that the exchange rate for sterling pounds was pretty awful either  You can also grab the subway just next door to the hotel at grand central for  each way which was very handy   we used it to go down to take the staten island ferry  There are yellow cabs outside the hotel all the time if you are in a rush We had a great time at the grand hyatt and would definitely return  
P => Very pleasant and right near th Avenue This hotel is perfect if you want easy walking access to th and Madison Avenue  Central Park is about a  minute walk but pleasant  The staff were helpful  We stayed in a Lexington Suite which was costly and I must admit not worth it purely because you are given extra room including a lounge area but you do not use it you spend so much time in the city you only go back there to wash and change  If you go in ember ensure you wear thermals and gloves and scarfes as the wind makes it really really cold  The staff are lovely at the hotel and I would recommend it to anything  Right next to Grand Central but be warned if you want to go to Greenwich where the  site is ensure you get the tube underground not the train like we did and ended up in Greenwich Conneticut about  miles out of New York City  
P => Improved Service and Amenities I got an excellent rate night bidding on Priceline for a  night midweek stay  Except for the old TV the room though small was in excellent condition the bed comfortable quiet abnd clean  I was on the th floor and elevator service was always prompt  The room service menu was way overpriced even for New York e g  club sandwich    However one can avoid the mediocre hotel restaurants by walking indoors to the connecting Grand Central Station where there is a superb Charlie Trotters restaurant or contine up the north side escalators to the Met Life Building formerly Pan Am Building where there arethree good restaurant options  Alsowithin Grand Central Station itself is the Oyster Bar and Restaurant for superb fresh seafood  All these options can be accessed without having to walk outside should the weather be bad  Back to the hotel I found the staff to be uniformly curtious and helpful  
P => Great Location Stayed here for two nights on business  Pros The hotel is in a great location adjacent to Grand Central Station  It makes a good base to explore all of Manhattan  The lobby and common areas are nice and there is fast wi fi through T Mobile although not free Cons Once you get past the pretty lobby the rooms and hallways are rather dated  The place at least the th floor seemed a bit musty  Also no mini bar Overall would only recommend if getting a discounted rate ps   Grand Central ket inside the terminal is a good place to get tasty breads and pastries in the morning 
P => nice the grand hyatt is a nice hotel the rooms are averge size clean and comfortable the lobby impressivethe location is excellent   we have visited nyc five times and stayed in some awful placesi rate the hyatt expensive but in nyc you get what you pay for the only fault was the toilets in the lobby reminded me of some of the awful places we have stayed in nyc 
P => Nice hotel in a great location This was my third stay at this hotel  The past two time I booked straight through Hyatt com but this time on priceline  The room was quite smaller than any other room I have stayed in at this hotel  It was nicely orated and the fitness center is great  I would stay again if the price is right or if I can name my price on priceline  If you plan to travel via subway you can get just about anywhere in the city from this hotel  
P => Nice for the businessleisure traveler exploring NYC  I booked the Grand Hyatt through Priceline and saved significantly on the ExpediaTravelocity price  The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of Times Square Rockefeller Center and the shopping areas as well as connected to Grand Central  The rooms are small compared to other cities but probably on the above average size for NY hotels and are fairly well appointed and comfortable  There is a Starbucks in the lobby but not coffeetea facilities in the room which is a bit odd  As noted in other reviews the walls were somewhat thin   I was near the elevators and could easily hear the bells ringing though was able to drown out the sound by keeping the air running  All in all I would say this a great place to stay as a base for exploring NYC or doing business when you will spend most of your time away from the hotel and need a comfortable centrally located place to sleep  I had no problems with the room or staff though it did take a few phone calls to get a late checkout for  as opposed to the  initially offered  
P => Pretty ent mid tier hotel good location Cant say much bad here except make sure you dont get a room near the elevators I had one and had to ask for a switch which they graciously granted quickly with a room upgrade Gym here is fine nice view from the top of the building  Rooms are fine nice beds average bathrooms about what youd expect  All in all a very generic place to stay if you like that sort of thing  
P => Great location okay room The hotel is in an excellent location easy access to everything either walking or the great connections from GC station  The hotel has a very impressive foyer but unfortunately I wasnt particularly impressed with the room  Being NY I didnt expect a lot of space which was fine but the beds were the smallest doubles I have EVER seen We enquired and were told they were the standard size for the hotel  We are all petite quots so Im not sure what anyone larger would do  I would agree with the comments from other reviewers who said the walls were thin especially as there were boisterous kids in the room next door  The room was also very dark with no main ceiling light  The main reason to stay at the Grand Hyatt is the location which is excellent  The room was ok but at over  a night I would have expected a bit better  If I got a good room deal I would stay there again for a leisure trip because of its proximity to all major attractions  For business there are other hotels with better rates for the same standard  
P => Dirty and dated Now I normally do not write bad reviews of hotels as I am always looking for the positives in things  Besides the fairly ent location of this hotel and the gorgeous lobby this hotel was terrible  Our room was small dark dated and dirty  The washroom floor was that of a public bathroom I had to wear my sandals in the shower and that is something I have never experienced in all my travels through Europe and the Middle East  There is no fan in the washroom and no mini bar in the room   I do understand that it is New York and most hotel rooms in the city are small but I was not expecting THIS out of a Hyatt hotel  Upon returning to the hotel very well dressed I might add we were greeted by a security gaurd asking for picture IDs and hotel room keys  And then harassed for  minutes by the quotgaurdquot  Not what I would call quothigh classquot for the price we were paying  It would cost all of k to put in a key fob system for the elevators  I would never go back to this hotel even if someone paid me  
P => Macy Parade Get Away My husband and I stayed at the New York Grand Hyatt for the Thanksgiving Macy Parade week  As soon as you walk in the lobby your breath is taken away by the enormous breath taking view  We arrived at  am not expecting to get into our room right away and was pleasently surprised of being told our room was ready and that we were upgraded to a King Delux room on the th floor  Our room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable for the first time in months my husband woke up each morning without a backache  The bathroom had all the ammenities one would need and the showers had great water pressure  This beautiful hotel is connected to Grand Central Station and is conveniently and centrally located to everything Rockerfeller Center Times Square Broadway and even Central Park if you are willing to walk  We took the subway one day to China Town and Little Italy and spent the last four walking everywhere  The customer service of the registration desk and concerige was impecable  They were very helpful gave suggestions on things to do and provided maps on how to get there  The front desk offered us a late check out  pm at no extra charge  I became a Hyatt Gold Member this summer when we stayed at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco  This is the only hotel I want to stay at due to the wonderful service this hotel offers  
P => grand on the outside not bad on the inside For the location itself you just cant beat this  Got this hotel through priceline and it is joined to grand central station  so if youre sightseeing by foot and subway this is an ideal pick  the lobbyfoyer is truly breathtaking and huge  youll need to go up the stairs or escalators to get to the check in counter  they have self check in machines as well note the self check out took an excruciating long time for me  for self check in i got  queen but wanted  beds so i went to the counter and was lucky to change it to my request because they had an availability at the time  i checked in  pm or so on a saturday  we got a room on the st floor near the end of one of the long corridors and well away from the elevators  that was nice so less noise and less people passing your room  the room is fairly large for a new york hotel  its true the tv is not a flat screen but that was no big deal to me  the sink in the bathroom is on the small side as other reviews state  very little counter space for toiletries  shower is okay  what i did notice is the stains   saw a stain on the carpet in the closet a small stain on the outside bed cover that didnt come off in the wash and even a tiny one on  of the pillows  you can actually open the window and let some of the air in  there is an ipod docking station for the radioalarm clock but i didnt use it  there are like  or more elevators but only half go to certain floors and the other half goes to the rest  we once took one of the right set of elevators and found it wouldnt stop at our floor  p s  I won the bid on priceline for nt for  nights   great deal 
P => Very Nice My stay for my birthday was fantastic made me feel welcome and staff and location was excelent    i couldnt not complain and rooms were fantastic 
P => All in all pretty good for New York One of the better hotel experiences Ive had in New York Pros  excellent location right next to Grand Central Station  spacious rooms  looks recently reatedwell kept up a lot of hotels in NY are old and tired  very comfortable beds  quotreasonablequot for hotels WiFi rate  day with T Mobile HotSpotCons  paper thin walls you can clearly hear everything going on in the next room  shower not great takes a while for water to get hot  no fridgemini bar in room 
P => Great Location I travel to New York several times a year and for the past several trips have stayed at the Grand Hyatt on nd Street  The overall location is incredible  Adjacent to Grand Central Station most desitnations are typically only minutes away  Within walking distance of Times Square th Avenue Shopping and the NYC Library  Most rooms are nice but dont expect big spacious rooms unless you book a suite  Some rooms are nicer than others but all in all the hotel is really nice and very elegant  Security is tight so dont be surprised if you are approached by a quotjacketquot if you dont appear to have a purpose in the hotel  
P => wow Right in the middle of everything  Everything I expect from a Hyatt  Very attentive staff nice room Good stuff  
P => Great location average hotel We booked this hotel through priceline com so got a fantastic deal  It is in a great location on top of grand central station in midtown  The hotel room itself was average on th floor a bit like a run down hampton inn or holiday inn  The room was big but dark and dingy  There was no mini bar no teacoffee  We were travelling with a toddler so a fridge would have been useful but they charge  for one We had a king size bed which I found very uncomfortable hard and the sheets were too small they kept coming out from under the mattress  The pillows were also uncomfortable and not all the same some were too soft some too hard  We were provided a pack and play free of charge but it had a bumpy surface so we did not use it for our son  Room service menu was very expensive and there was a  delivery charge per person as well as a mandatory   gratuity charge  All in all it is a good hotel if you get very discounted rates like we did because the location is unbeatable and you probably wont spend much time in your room as a tourist in NYC  
P => A great experience with a little planning ahead I did my research and checked tripadvisor com before heading to NYC for the Food Network Wine and Food Festival with my husband  This was a package deal that included accommodations at the Grand Hyatt  I had read on this site about the noise issue with adjoining rooms    so I planned ahead I contacted the hotel directly  days before our arrival date and asked about the room that came with the package  I was informed that it was a Queen Deluxe Room which I knew in advance  The hotel reservations person on the other end of the line happened to be one of the Reservations Supervisors  I explained that I wanted to add my Gold Passport account number to my reservation and after doing so asked if I could change my room to a King without an adjoining room  The Reservations Supervisor was very accommodating and handled my request with ease  He told me that although I was blocked with other rooms at the package rate he pulled our reservation out and put us on the th floor in a King Deluxe Room see pictures without an adjoining room  I asked if it would be worth the extra money night to upgrade to the Regency Club Floor but with all of the activities of the events we were attending ie  lots of food and wine he didnt feel that the room would be worth the extra money  I really appreciated that  When we arrived Thursday late afternoon our room was just as promised    on the th floor on a corner away from the elevator and the ice machine and without an adjoining room   Although we had to deal with noise from a loud family across the hall in several rooms without adjoining doors the overall experience was very very good     Just a piece of advice my Gold Passport number had not been used in many many years so I re enrolled two weeks before we traveled and obtained a new number  Even if you dont plan to stay at a Hyatt very much in the future it is good to have a Gold Passport number as you will likely get better service as a loyalty customer Also I have to say that we have been to NYC  times in the last  years or so    we really enjoy NYC    and this has been the best hotel experience for us by far  The location of the hotel is perfect and by being attached to Grand Central Terminal transportation is easy getting a cab is easy and the Food Court in the Terminal is very very good when you want a light snack or a meal  We will definitely stay here again 
P => Great Location Nice Hotel Great City Just back from  night stay in Grand Hyatt with  girlfriends  Flew into Newark got the Liberty Express bus to st street just around the corner from the Hotel  Got to hotel at   no problem checking in no queues lovely room on the th floor  Did not hear any noise from the other rooms  Used the Concierge service only for directions and they were very helpful  Only problem is the bar is a rip off go outside to some of the bars in the area if you would like a drink   gin and tonic at  is a bit over the top by any standards  Did the Hop on Hop off bus for the first time would definitely recommend that  All in all a great experience and would have no problem recommending the hotel  
P => First Impression of Hyatt    Disappointed I needed a hotel room at the last minute and was kind of excited when Priceline gave me The Hyatt Grand for   Luckily my stay was only one night The hotel is in a great locationbut there are other hotels in great locations so if I were you I wouldnt use quotlocationquot as a reason to stay here  The reason is you dont get much value for the money The rooms are very clean sterile and have no feeling to them  The bathrooms are tiny with VERY little counterspace and the TVs are kind of outdated  The service was friendly but in a robotic quotjust doing my job and my job is to be nice to you punkquot kind of way and honestly I just got a creepy vibe from the place  I wouldnt stay there again  
P => In the heart of the city    My dhter and I went to New York for an overnighter to see The Little Mermaid on Broadway  Im a Hyatt Platinum Passport member so I was able to get a room at the Hyatt at Grand Central using my points  Considering how expensive rooms are in New York I was thrilled to get the room for quotfree quotWe had requested two double beds and because we checked in early we ended up getting a quotsmokingquot room  I didnt think this would be an issue but if youre not a smoker the smell is overwhelming  We turned the ac on and opened the window but it never really dissipated The room itself is smaller than average for a US hotel and the bathroom was tiny by American standards  I had asked for extra towels when I booked online and someone came up to the room promptly with an armful of towels  The room was clean except for the smoke smell but its obvious this is an older hotel  One of the lamps in the room didnt work in fact that outlet didnt work at all  So they should probably do some updating and fixing to the electrical The location is the best thing about this hotel  Located inside Grand Central you have access to the subways plus the dining area which is very good  Walking over to Times Square took about  minutes and was very doable The Little Mermaid was the highlight of our trip  My dhter has always loved the movie so it was a lot of fun going to see it with her  The theatre is older but so beautiful  Every seat has a great view of the stage Overall it was a fun trip  Next time Id wait for another room over taking a smoking room  Even when you think youve gotten used to the smell you realize that you havent  
P => great holiday Having stayed in The Casablanca last year and loving it I ided to come back again I noticed that the price had significantly increased so I looked around I got a really good deal for the Hyatt and it was   cheaper than the casablanca  saving for  for  weeks stay I have read some of the reviews on here and was worried  When we arrived  the lady on reception was lovely really friendly and she gave us vouchers for free coffee for every day of our stay I had booked a room with  double beds and the room was very spacious bright and modern The beds are really comfortable I was pleased to find an ipod dock and a huge TV The bathroom was average size with a fairly small bath but that wasnt an issue I never encountered any problems with noise at all and we were facing the road You did hear the odd door close but not at inconvenient times I cannot comment on the food as we never tried any There are numerous places to eat and drink nearby and all very reasonable  and huge portions Overall I was very impressed with the hotel It is huge and impersonal but so what you dont really spend that much time in there anyway  The lobby is impressive and very busy I would definately return and recommend it I thought it was a bargain compared to the smaller hotels and a great location too  
P => Mixed Feelings Mid ruary I ided to take my girlfriend to New York  Being a fan of the Hyatt Franchise I ided to book my  night trip at the Grand Hyatt  The lobby is quite simply beautiful with a nice bar and a good restaurant  We checked into our room and I very unhappy with what I found  There room was very small there was paint on the floor and a very small bathroom  But having just been on a  hour flight I was happy to find that the beds were very comfortable  One does notice that the doors really SLAM shut they will easily wake you up early in the morning   The location of the hotel is great you really are a walking distance away from everything  There are great restaurants and bars all around  There is also a superket around the corner important seeing as a bottle of water costs more than    All in all I really enjoyed my trip to New York but I would not stay at the Grand Hyatt again seeing as it cost me an average of  a night with two nights costing as much as  there are much better and cheaper alternatives around  
P => Great stay at the Grand Hyatt The location of this hotel was absolutely wonderful  It was convenient for walking many places and the subway was easily accessible  Our room was ent size for  people  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful  We enjoyed the Grand Central food court and the drug store across the street for snacks  Our experience was everything we had hoped for in a New York City hotel  R amp J Texas 
P => Great stay at the Hyatt A friend and I stayed here for a weekend and had a great time  The front desk staff are very efficient and even when we asked to change rooms for one with a bath as well as a shower this was no problem  Room was very large and tastefully orated  Location is great  You can walk to theatres Fifth Avnue Rockefeller Center etc and bearing in mind the location there was no noise Bar was great for a snacks and cocktails  Breakfast buffett was very good but quite pricey  There is a coffee stand in the lobby with a good choice of muffins pastries fruit etc which you can take up to the room Concierge very helpful as were all the staff we encountered Would stay again with no hesitation if able to get a similar rate  We paid  a night which I thought was fair for what we got My only negative was that the bathrooms are a little bit tired and smallish in comparison to the room but they are spotlessly clean  
P => Very Impressed I was a bit worried about this hotel after reading some of the reviews but I really really liked it  We had a two double bed room  Although it wasnt a massive room there was pleanty of space  I dont understand why people are complaining about the size   you surely dont go to New York to stay in your room all day  Beds were really comfy  Couldnt hear any noise in the corrider   apart from the occasional door The staff on reception were really friendly  The man on the visitor desk was very helpful too  We didnt eat in the hotel   but the restaurant and bar looked very nice   tad expensive for us though The hotel is in a perfect location   sandwiched in between the Chrysler and Grand Central  Minutes from the top of Fifth Ave a short walk to Times Square  I booked this hotel through E Bookers and with flights for  days the trip came to     Im suprised it was so cheap after staying in such a nice hotel  When I return I will definatley try an get in to this hotel We flew into Newark Taxis cost  with toll and tip  I believe its a flat rate of  if you fly to JFK  
P => Great Location Very Comfortable  Hotel is located in a great location above Grand Central Station which is spectacular Everything you want to see in NYC is either a cheap cab ride away or a short trip on the subway Rooms are comfortable clean and beds are great The service was also good    We had a few issues and spoke to the staff who happily assisted us and were very approachable Overall it is a great hotel    And if you get in early you can get a cheap price Cheaper than some of the  star hotels too    
P => Great location but several small problems I enjoyed my stay here  The location is amazing just like every reviewer says  Grand central is one of my favorite spots in NYC and I loved stopping by everynight when the crowds had gone and I had the place to myself  The hotel lobby is large and beautiful and always bustling with people  Check in was great as we were allowed to check in at amwe got lucky and I wouldnt expect to get early checkin very often  The rooms are hugenot just for New York but by any citys standard  King size beds were very comfortable as were the array of pilows of varying softness  Alarm clock had an ipod dock which was nice  Bathrooms are small but not tiny  The rooms are a little worn  AC was cool but never cold and the room had a faint musty smell  Our sheets were mildy dirty when we arrived but were promptly changed upon request  The doors that lead to the rooms are very thin and do not reach the ground so every noise in the hallway can be heardluckily Im a sound sleeper  These were all minor annoyances for me but could be problems for the pickier traveler  Overall I would recommend this hotel to al my friends and I would return  Just an FYI catching a cab in front of the hotel can be difficult at certain timeslike dinner time on a Saturday night it usually pays to walk around the corner rather than wait in the long lines  
P => Still Great This was my third visit to this hotel and my th visit to New York I love the place The Grand Hyatt remains my top choice of hotel in this city due to its blend of quality and location  The general standard of this hotel sets a general benchk that I use when travelling  In basic terms it does the simple things well and the obvious things very well  It meets expectation I love the fact that Cisz Henderson captured the hotel between Grand Central Station and The Chrysler Building in one of his recent paintings Top tip   If you are travelling on a budget or simply want to experience the real New York use the subway to reach this hotel from JFK  All you need to do is use the free airport bus that collects outside the arrivals halls and takes you to the Howards Beach subway station  Then take a train to the Grand Central Station  This is right next to the hotel  Very cheap and quite entertaining as a travel option  
P => Location Location Location As everyone on here has said this the quotlocationquot hotel for NYC  It sits above the Grand Central subway making connections easy for everywhere in NYC Otherwise the hotel is just a low luxury huge box hotel  Nothing wrong with it but nothing exceptional  We used it for a Yankee stadium base which was perfect for the subway line The Palace cafe across the street was good for breakfast after  a m  and the Gray Line tours are outside the front door There was easy check in and out and no glitches with the hotel website booking  
P => great location I stayed at the Grand Hyatt during the last week of ust  We had already paid for the room  months ago through the hotels website and picked a room on the executive floor  which offered continental breakfast and afternoon snacks in a arate room  Our room was spacious and the bed sooo comfortable  The bathroom was small with basic amenities  Our room overlooked  st   It was neat and tidy and was cleaned meticulously every day  The breakfast and the snacks were better than expected so you  want to choose this option while making a reservation  THe hotel is right next to the grand central terminal and within  minutes from th avenue  It has an impressive entrance  THe concierge staff were very helpful when booking restaurants and US open tickets  I cant say I was very impressed with the check in process  be Id expect a more detailed analysis of the room facilities and the accommodation details   Anyway its a hotel which is conveniently located and offers easy access to every place you  want to visit in Manhattan or somewhere else  
P => great location Great hotel and ideal location walk away from th avenue saks etc short taxi ride to macys  Next to grand central station making it ideal to visit other new york landks  The hotel itself is huge food is great the rooms are spacious considering its new york  found the staff very helpful and polite  
P => Ideal for a short stay Having just got back from a  day trip to NYC staying at the Grand Hyatt I now know why there are mixed reviews for this hotel  Its good points  centrally located   ideal for sightseeing and shopping   an easy walk to everything in midtown   nice looking hotel   good value for money if you can get a short stay deal   nicely orated   helpful staff   coffee kiosk in the lobby   easy to get taxis from and back to being next door to Grand Central Station   comfortable beds   nice clean bed linen   good sized closet for clothes and suitcases   iPod docking stationspeakers   cable TV   tour kiosk in lobby   walkway through to Grand Central Station Its bad points   very very busy hotel   lobby always full tourists business people convention people   room smaller than expected   bathroom much smaller than expected   little annoying things in or rather not in the room no bin in bathroom not enough towels for    some broken glass along skirting board   one of the lamps not working   the room doors dont close quietly no matter how hard you try take earplugs for sleeping Despite the bad points above   I would definitely stay here again  After weeks and weeks of internet surfing for a ent hotel at a good rate this was the best I could find and it is good value for money     for  nights for the room I would highly recommend this hotel for a short touristshopping stay in NYC   we literally only used the room for sleeping and washing in as we spent most waking hours out and about  
P => Loved it We stayed three nights at the Hyatt and had a great time  We will deinately consider this hotell again on our next visit to NY  Pros  location Great location right next to Grand Central Therminal  Easy axcess to the subway and walking distance to a lot of sights restaurants etc  Always taxies upfront as well  Friendly and helpful staff    We got a free upgrade without even asking for it and got a delux king room  The room was large extremely large for NY and nicely ored  Very clean  We would have appriciated one more armchair though    our room did not have a view but I would think that the rooms facing the street had an amazing view   aircon was quite and worked very vellCons  wifi  for h  The internet was slow and expensive  it annoyed me standing almost  minutes in line and paying  for each bagsuitcase to get our luggage stored a couple of hours the day of departure    The room was quite dark even when all the lights were turned on  It was raining really hard the first day and I asked the concierge where I could get an umbrelly  I was told the closest place would be at a store down the street which ment I was soaked by the time I got there  Our friends that stayed at another hotell nearby were offered free umbrellas Free would of course be appriciated but at least Hyatt should have some for sale   I found it strange that they only sold stamps for mail to be sent within the US 
P => great hotel loved it This hotel was great right in the middle of it Go down stairs and take a train anywear  a few blocks up was time squarean easy walk  the rooms were nice not huge but my wife and  kids did well for staying  days When we go back I will look at this hotel first  
P => Rooms dark and small for a family group Our family of two adults and two children stayed here for two nights  We booked a room with two double beds and unlike other US hotels we stayed in they were just UK sized doubles i e  minimum size for a double The room was the smallest we had in our tour of the USA and it was dark   reading at any time of day was impossible The bathroom was the tiniest we had as well However on a positive note the staff were helpful at all times and we liked the lobby which is a work of art in itself with its waterfalls  Best of all is the location   central for everything  
P => Great location and room bigger then I thought it would be Wow you just cant beat the location just far enough away from Times Square you can walk to times square in a matter of minutes that you dont hear much noise or have that ADD feeling from all the flashing times square lights and all the people The room was clean and allot bigger then I thought it would be  Staff was always very friendly and we were lucky to get an early check in as a room had just become available  Beds are super comfortable  We asked for a fridge for  dollars and it was great to buy cereal and milk and save on buying breakfast everyday The only drawback is the bathroom is super tiny  The toilet is butt up against the sink and you feel really crowded  I booked through priceline so got an awesome deal of  a night  If I would of paid the regular  I would have been bummed but for the price I paid the room was fantastic We ate at the comfort diner and the food was great and affordable  Also tried Serendipity  and the desserts were amazing  Stay away from Planet Hollywood way overpriced for just ok food  
P => A very good stay   an impressive hotel Because of the many complaints on this site about the standard of its rooms it was with some trepidation that my wife and I booked our stay at the Grand Hyatt in NYC  I have been a Platinum card holder with Hyatt for some years and I must admit that their hotels are not all of the same standard  Most are large and impersonal but that is the nature of that type of hotel which caters more for business travellers and in major cities airline personnel than holidaymakers  This hotel is huge The foyer is redolent of an airport terminal with high ceilings check in desks roped off areas and large numbers of seats  Cosy and bijou it isnt but it is impressive  There wasnt a time when it wasnt teeming with people and we were struck by the large numbers of school groups that were staying there perhaps thats why I keep hearing that some rooms are in poor repair     most young people I have come across are no respecters of others property  However I have to say that their hotel in downtown Manhattan was one of the best Hyatts I have stayed in  Admittedly I did use my points to upgrade to the Hyatt Regency floor st and I would have been extremely disappointed had any of those rooms been as manky as those described in some of the reviews here but in fact I was pleasantly surprised  Our room had probably been refurbished in the last year or so because although there were scuff ks around the lower edge of the bathroom door the general state of repair was very good with no sign of wear on the wallpaper or paintwork  The bathroom was small but not so small that it caused any inconvenience and the shower produced a good powerful spray with no blocked nozzles  I have always disliked the baths that the Hyatt group install in all their hotels at least in the USA because they are usually a bit short and always very shallow and the idiotic arrangement they have for the overflow   at a level no higher than your toes when youre lying down   means that even a reasonably svelte patron is going to have his or her belly uncovered  I find it impossible to have a relaxing bath in a US Hyatt so the good quality shower was particularly important  What the average corpulent American does for a bath in this chains bathrooms boggles the mind  My biggest complaint about this bathroom was that there was no extractor fan so a shower produced a room full of steam and a completely misted mirror  Not a major issue just a comment The room was about  feet square and well appointed with a slightly too soft double bed and a TV a bit too far away to enjoy properly without the aid of binoculars  Since we watched no TV other than the news it didnt really matter but the picture quality was poor and the TV had a fault that made it make a loud crackle and picture jump at regular intervals  Id have hated that while watching a film but as I say we didnt use it much In keeping with most Hyatt hotels in my experience the lighting was dismal  I have never understood why this chain is so miserly with its lights but with no central light fitting in the ceiling yes I know its pass  and what appear to be low wattage bulbs in the other lights the room always had the feeling of being dingy     which it wasnt at all  Window area is at a premium in New York so the available natural light was also limited  Not a problem and didnt spoil the stay in any way at all but its a comment for the Hyatt planners Let There Be Light  The room was also quiet and apart from one occasion when a gaggle of idiot women walked up the corridor outside our room conducting a shouted conversation at am we had a quiet stay  The real high feature of our stay was the Regency Club room which was delightful and something we made use of quite a lot  It serves a complimentary breakfast largely continental in style and theres coffee and sodas available free of charge all day  People were going out of that room with arms full of Voss still mineral water as if they were running a stall at the local ket  During the day there is free food available which changes as the day wears on  From the breakfast it changes to other salads and good quality dishes ending with pastries in the evening  I have no idea how they afford to do this but I have to say that its a superb and very welcome service  The best thing of all about the club room however is the concierge  This is a person on the reception desk dedicated to answering questions and helping club members     and my goodness are they good at it Each lady and they were all ladies was attentive intelligent eager to help and very efficient  She has a terminal connected to the Internet of course and she will research things for you advise you on places of interest places to eat ways of getting there and will make reservations for you  Of course the concierge down in the foyer will do that too but you have to queue for his attention whereas on this floor you have immediate and high quality attention  To give you an example I asked for the names of musical instrument stores in Manhattan because I wanted to see if I could find a second hand guitar a Gibson ES since you ask  The young lady told me to leave it with her and the following morning she had a list of shops their phone numbers whether they had that guitar in stock and the price ranges at which they held them  To say that I was astonished not to say extremely grateful would be an understatement  I hope to return to NYC in the not too distant future we like to go there every few years and there is no question that I will stay at this hotel and pay for the Regency Club floor if I dont have the points  A comment about the staff  At no time were we treated in an offhand way by any one  On the contrary we were well treated even down in the foyer by the desk staff who dont appear to have a moments rest most of the time  The mail room too had a very helpful guy there who assisted me in sending a package  Someone mentioned irritation at the fact that the Hyatt charges  per bag to store for the day and indeed this is true  But when I saw the military type operation they have to mount to store the bags that were being deposited on the day we left I would say that  is small beer  They must have a store room the size of an aircraft hangar as the queue to deposit the bags that morning snaked along the foyer and required two full time people to receive and ticket those bags  Finally a word about the location of the hotel its superb  Its a couple of doors down from Grand Central so the subway is a moments walk away and there s a very good food ket attached to GC station  There is a deli a few moments walk up the street on the opposite side of the road which serves a good breakfast  The hotel is also around the corner from what in my opinion is the worlds most beautiful building   the Chrysler Building   and is pretty centrally located for walking to the main attractions  Its also on one of those rare occurrences in Manhattan a two way street so taxis can approach from both directions making it easier to get to  And in our case the icing on the cake was that the airport bus to Newark stops just around the corner so we saved a small fortune by taking that rather than a taxi to Newark  Incidentally Id always fly to Newark now rather than JFK its not much further and its a smaller and more pleasant airport In sumy at least in Regency Club the Grand Hyatt is a very good hotel and one I would recommend unreservedly  
P => Cannot go wrong I stayed in this hotel back in ch and have meant to write a review for months  As a travel agent I spend my life looking for ent hotels and genuinely cannot fault this property People who complain about staff are really rather foolish   you cannot guarantee a persons mood what issues they  have behind the desk with computer systems etc  When I was there the staff were always helpful and often harassed by tourists with no sense of anyone but themselves The location of the property is ideal you can get everywhere on foot and if you do want to hop in a cab they are everywhere  We also had two double beds in our room which was brilliant as most rooms in NYC are particularly small so this was a real bonus and had no extra cost  The bathroom was clean and functional and the room completely soundproof  I would happily stay here again and have booked many clients here since my return with no problems whatsoever  
P => Not Acceptable I know what to expect from NYC hotels  You typically get what you pay for  Not the case here  Not worth the price  The staff is consistently unfriendly I dont think a vacuum had been in my room for a very long time the walls are so thin the next door cell alarm woke me up maids start banging on your door at   The TV is small the bathroom is very small  No coffee in the room so you have to either go downstairs or get room service and get ripped off via either choice  nd and Lex is a great location   too bad the hotel is not up to standard  
P => Grand Hyatt was a grand experience This is a little long but here goesMy fiance and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt New York between uly     Our first impression of the hotel was that it is indeed grand and beautiful  The staff at the reception desk were very helpful and when I needed something  from housekeeping reception or the concierge they were always curtious and friendly weather I contactd them in person or over the phone  Our room was nice with a very comfortable king sized bed  The bathoom was very small but I expected that as we were in NYC  The location of the hotelis great as it is close to Grnad Central Station next door and is a few minutes walk from Times Square  We booked the hotel at an amazing discounted rate and it was so worth the money  The hotel restaurans are pricy though  Breakfast buffet was  per person so we did not eat breakfast there  I must say though that breakfast is hard to come by in midtown Manhattan  We did go downstairs one night for some drinks and desert at the hotel restaurant as we were too tired to go out  It was quite pricy but a nce treat  The only complaint that I have is that all the rooms seem to be linked with adjoining doors that lock on both sides and the walls are super thin  We could hear our neighbours full conversations and they were not being loud  I was frustrated by this as I felt as though we had very little privacy  Otherwise our stay was great 
P => Avoid Front Desk if you don t want problems Excelent hotel perfect location good staff overall except front desk team aboslutely tragical I had serious problems to check in front desk team unprepared lack of understanding and really unpolite a complete headache  It seems that totally out of Hyatt usual first class standards  Too bad  
P => Great Location Not so great housekeeping LikesGreat location between the Chrysler building and Grand Central Station  Confortable and large beds  Great breakfast DeslikesWe ordered a triple room and the only options were a room with a king size and a small bed    or     two single large beds  Luckly I travelled with my sister and my brother The housekeeping is not so good  One day they forgot the glasses of water and another day they forgot to put the face towels   OverallA reasonable option for just a couple of days if you value the loaction  
P => Don T Touch This Hotel We actually never stayed at the Grand Hyatt NYC  While they advertise a rate of   for all weekends through ust st this from Travelzoos top  deals on y nd  when you contact them the best rate they can give you for the same room is     I do not appreciate lies or false advertising  Avoid them 
P => Not the most cheerful staff Service with a smile wasnt on the menu at this hotel  The or in the rooms was a bit tired looking  Having said all that the hotel was in a great location for us  Next door to Grand Central Station  Walking distance to th Avenue Madison Avenue and Times Square etc  We would stay here again despite the downsides  
P => Good not great VERY pleasant staff    every single person we met in any capacity was as friendly and nice as could be Rooms are tiny and very dark no overhead lighting The hotel overbooked and was very apologetic it wasnt the front desk staffs fault but they had to deal with it and went way above and beyond to accommodate for the inconvenience  My sister checked in late and all they had was the living room portion of a suite which was HUGE but only had a fold out couch  They put her in a king the next night and comped us both breakfast etc  for the rest of our stay They handle lots of large groups I was with a choral group and I think they get a lot of those  Its not a quiet place to be  Definitely bring earplugs  The street noise is considerable and our plumbing made a weird clunking noise all night every night The location is great    connected to Grand Central Station with an underground tunnel into the station  Tip save money by eating meals at the food court in the downstairs part of Grand Central Station  Its an easy  minute walk to Times Square or you can grab a pedicab if you dont want to arrive at the theatre sweaty for      
P => terrific place My husband dhter  her friend  and I stayed in  rooms in the Hyatt over a weekend  I asked that the rooms be on the same floor but made no other request  When we arrived we were told that the rooms were connecting  FantasticThe Proximity to Grand Central is really convenient  Not only can you access transportation but the shopping and food court were great  The shops on th are within easy walking distance as is the theater district although it is further away  Central Park is also within walking distance especially if you stroll down th Ave  The complaints I saw on this site were not a problem for us  For example our bathroom had a huge vanity for our stuff  The bathroom was very clean  Someone had complained about employee attitude particularly at the check in desk  Our staff member was cheery and professional   The room was spacious comfortable and quiet  I didnt hear a peep even from my dhter and her friend next door The only thing I would have liked was a view but in NYC I didnt expect it  Theres a coffee bar in the lobby that sells delicious muffins fruit and Starbucks coffee every morning  I would highly recommend Jacks for dinner before the theater  Its just off Broadway so you are very close to all the theaters we learned that traffic before the  pm shows is a disaster  They have a tapas menu and regular entrees all of which were excellent arrived right away and were reasonably priced  We went there on the advice of the Hyatt concierge who also sent us to SoHo for shopping another good idea 
P => mindblowing Well What Can i say  This was a great hotel  Not brilliant but nearly there  I will deal with the criticism first  Air   Con was tempremental   No pool facilities spa etc    Check in is a little hit and miss  The positives  Brilliant location   Large rooms by new york standards  Comfortable bed    Fantastic foyer   a visual delight   Great bathroom    Friendly staff nothing was too much trouble Firstly being next to Grand Central Station was a treat   the food hall in the lower area of the station is cheap and tasty  The pizza was especially good  There is no problem bringing food into the hotel it is so big that no one would notice  There are not that many places to eat out in the evening close by that are particularly charming its mostly tgis red lobster food  But it is near to everywhere and provided you dont mind a ten minute walk there are plenty of places to eat  There are alot of deli type shops nearby that do salad boxes etc  these were delicious and inexpensive  Being next to grand central station breakfast is no problem there are plenty of coffee shops  If you go out of the main door there is a fantastic diner under the railway arches  Breakfast is quite pricey but the pancakes were to die for  The front desk held bags on the last day of your stay and there are very good bathrooms downstairs in the hotel to allow you to freshen up  This hotel is enormous but the staff are lovely and when my ring disappeared down the sink the maintenence guy was there in minutes  The room was cleaned to a high standard  The main criticism was the air  con being a bit tempremental  We went in il and the weather was not overly warm but we had to sleep with the window open as the air con didnt work that well  New York is a noisy place i loved the noise but i imagine many would not  Did alot of shopping arond for the best price and the hyatt website was the cheapestBryant Park and the Library are a few minutes walk Times Square about  or  minutes  The Empire States Building about ten minutes  It really was brilliantly located  Although you miss the bars and restaraunts of greenwich location wise it is perfect for sightseeing  Please walk through new york its safe charming and i cant wait for my next trip  I would definatley stay here again the hotel to me summed up new york perfectly big bold busy and classy 
P => Honeymoon Hotel We booked the Grand Hyatt New York as the hotel for our honeymoon  We wanted something central and fancy but not too expensive  On arriving at the hotel on a very hot ust day we were instantly cooled by the air conditioning and fantastic waterfall in the foyer  We checked in with ease and went straight up to the room  We had been told by friends that New York rooms are tiny but wow this room was huge Big double bed with loads of room for suitcases and shopping bags  Bathroom with arate sink and large mirror  There was a ironing board and iron in the room which was great as all my clothes had creased in the suitcases We didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment on the food but the room service menu looked lovely The hotel is right above Grand Central Station with easy connection  Great for getting around on the subway which we did We got a free paper every morning  There were ice and drink machines on each floor  We would fill the bucket and drink pepsi in the room  We both loved everything about this hotel and would recommend to anyone  We would definitely stay here again  
P => Well placed and impressive The Hyatt is a  minute walk from Times Square and within walking distance of the Empire State Chrysler Building and Rockafeller Centre  We found the staff great the hotel spacious and very clean and the air con a saviour The room was quiet and reasonably sized and the lifts were fast  Breakfast was expensive so we ate at a fabby diner across the street called Pershing Square  Excellent service and staff and a range of NY breakfasts to try with all the buzz of New York  The buses fromto the airports can be cht straight over the road opposite Grand Central  minutes from the hotel door  The subway is very close and we would definitely stay again  
P => A fun weekend in NYC My husband and I went to NYC with friends for a weekend getaway  We ided to stay at the Hyatt because of its price and location  We were impressed right from the start We took the air trainsubway from JFK into Manhattan which was easy but it took almost   hours  The Grand Hyatt is attached to Grand Central which made it simple to get to  There is an entrance to the hotel lobby from the shopping concourse at Grand Central  We headed into the hotel and found check in to be a breeze  They were very pleasant and quick at the front desk  We were given our keys and headed up to our rooms  The rooms are on the small side but most NYC hotel rooms are  The bathrooms were larger than most I have seen in other hotels in the city  The beds and pillows were super comfortable We found the location of the hotel to be perfect  It is only a few blocks from Time Square an easy walk or there is a shuttle train from Grand Central into the time square subway stop  Also being next to Grand Central made going anywhere in the city easy  Overall it is a great hotel 
P => OkK not more Typical  Star Rooms and facilities although we did not even have a minibar in our room  Rooms were very tired and old the whole hotel needs a fresh up and some paint  The Concierges Desk were very helpful and all staff were very friendly although the hotel had a distinct conference hotel feeling around it which is really boring if you are in NYC as a tourist The rooms were very loud the inter room doors in the rooms were thin and you coul clearly hear what was going on in the other room Location is good if you want to be in midtown good communications and everything you might need just around the corner  
P => Grand Rip Off Im a Hyatt Platinum member but I wont be staying here again despite the relatively cheap rates for NYC and heres why  The room was small and worn more like the Pennsylvania Hotel than a Hyatt  But two incidents really turned me off   we ate at the hotel restaurant on a Saturday night at PM the small adjoining bar to the pricey restuarant had been occupied by some thugs who were extremely intoxicated and were literally screaming at the top of their lungs  The waiter said this had been going on since mid afternoon and that the manager would do quotsomething quot Nonetheless they seated my family two tables away from the ruckus so I asked these guys and ladies to keep it down they then offered to quottear off my face quot management finally did restrain them but apparently at least two of them returned to the bar and was served again was waiting to thrash me when I finished dinner the hotel detective intervened but said it was my fault for talking to them  My position is Hyatt violates the New York Dram laws by serving obviously intoxicated persons  The next morning was treated to Hyattscontintental buffet two rolls coffee and juice for  and that was the cheapest option  Grand rip off and dangerous   stay away and pay extra to stay elsewhere  
P => Sex and The City We flew to NYC from Miami to see the premier of Sex and the City  The hotel was so nice friendly and super clean  WOW I loved it The rooms are very modern and clean  The bathroom is spacious  I just loved it You can also play your ipod on the alarm clock radio 
P => Ok overnight hotel I stayed in this hotel for  night and will recomend it for overnight stay  Also I will recomend it to people who wants to be in quotcenter of the worldquot in solid hotel close to many attractions for fair price  As I mentioned location of the hotel is very good but rooms and overall expression is quite quotdatedquot  If you get a nice price      per night  tax  than do not hasitate  
P => New York city in style My husband and I have recently been on a trip to New York to take in the site and sounds of the Big Apple  We wanted to do it in style so we saved up and booked Virgin Upper Class through booking agent Skyclub  Skyclub did an inclusive package for us for flight and hotel which saved us some money  The flight was brilliant and me and my husband had a few drinks at the bar before getting our heads down for a few hours  When we arrived in New York we got a taxi across town to the Grand Hyatt which was also booked through Skyclub as part of out package  This amazing building is smack bang in the middle of Time Square with great views over New York especially at night  The benefits of staying in Time Square are easy access to the city for shopping going out and visiting sites of interest  The downside is that it is constantly busy and congested and full of tourists like us hehe   The Grand Hyatt was a fantastic building with places to eat live music and big comfortable rooms  Its quite expensive but I think we expected this for a  star hotel in the middle of NYC  Our flight home was very pleasant I only wish I could fly Upper Class all the time  
P => Great location next to Grand Central Station I took my teenage dhter and sister to NYC for spring break il    il    This was our first trip to NYC  The Grand Hyatt is a good hotel with a great location  I felt   safe in NYC and at the Hyatt  The concierge was extremely helpful with sightseeing and specific subway train directions  They gave us great maps and ked them accordingly With Grand Central Station attached to the hotel we had great access to the subway system  An extra perk was the dedicated subway shuttle between GCS amp Times Square  The food court was good  Almost every morning we had a bagel on our way out  Also we bought snacks and soft drinks from the  drug stores that are just a few doors down from the hotel  I really think this hotel is great for business people and large convention or tour groups  Since we were on vacation Im happy we quotlucked outquot with what the front desk said was a bigger corner room with a King bed  and a quiet next door neighbor  My dhter slept on a cot but it wasnt very comfortable  With  people I thought the room amp bathroom were a tight fit  It was also very very dark  They really need better lighting in the room  Housekeeping didnt provide enough towels on  different days but they brought the extra towels promptly when we asked  We did hear lots of doors slamming and the hallways were noisy several nights with people chatting amp walking the halls  I think there was a large youth tour group at the hotel the first weekend  If I had been in an interior type room I would have had to move rooms to get away from the large groups  The front desk clerks were pretty generic   nothing special  Overall our stay at the hotel was good  Will I stay at the Grand Hyatt New York again That depends  Id stay here again if I could get a much better rate on a shorter   day stay  Of course Id again ask for an outside corner room that does not connect to the room next door  If not Ill find a quiet hotel thats not so quotbigquot and pricey I hope this review helps you so youll know what to expect if you are considering this hotel  Have a great trip to NYC 
P =>   Are you looking for a hotel with  unfriendly staff   small rooms  oldbut good situatedthen go there    
P =>  stars no frills hotel My husband amp I stayed for  nights     After reading much of other travellers reviews Id not anticipated much from it though wed chosen it as my hubbys their Gold Passport member amp for their strategic location  Upon checking in Im glad that id came with that mindset as it was truly an American style  star hotel  u pay for the room amp room only  No free internet access no mineral waters amp even room slippers  Id stayed at Hyatt in HongKong last month amp in comparison the NYC one definitely lacks all the bling bling to it  The bathroom looks dated amp time for a reation  Fortunately the beds still as plush amp ultra comfortable both of us slept like a baby every night  The walls are thin therefore u might be able to hear door slams or TV noise from next door  Be sure to avoid a room near the lifts  The hotel lobbys exceptionally large amp usually crowded with guests from all walks of life  Luggages are everywhere therefore keep a close eye on your belongings  The location is great for st timers to the city  The subway amp Grand Central ket is within Grand Central  Duane Reade drugstore is just opposite  Starbucks  block away th Aves  blocks away  Basically its walk able to most places  If u managed to score a room at USD like others did at other website it would be a steal  Anything more than that we paid USD after tax there are plenty of better alternatives more worthy elsewhere  
P => No problems at all We stayed at the Grand Hyatt in the beginning of    I read other reviews that the front desk personal were rude and did not help and that the doormen were not helpful but I did not find this to be true  I also read about the doors slamming all the time which did occur because the doors were very heavy  Overall our experience was pleasant  The rooms were very nice and had no complains about the beds or the bathroom The only thing that they need to add is a coffee maker  There is a store on the next corner that we purchased water snacks liquor and a coffee maker  The resturants in the area were costly but that is what you get in the area  Grand Central station is next door and has several places to eat  We ate at a Mexican place in Grand Central that was great  We found the Hyatt to be a nice place to stay and within walking distance of Times Square  
P => Great Location Myself and my husband stayed here th  and had no problems at all  We had stayed once before and everything was fine but there have been some mixed reviews so we were a little concerned   we neednt have worried We were a little early for check in but this wasnt a problem  We were checked in quickly and efficiently by the hotel staff  Our room was large very clean and comfortable  The bathroom was a little on the small side but again not a problem it was perfectly adequate We had room service during our stay   the order was taken by a very helpful lady and was delivered quickly  The food was great if a little expensive   for a club sandwich and friesThe best thing about this hotel is the location   Grand Central Terminal is quite literally on your doorstep We would definately recommend this hotel  
P => Great Stay at Grand Central Hyatt in NYC We stayed at this hotel due to a conference we attended on site but added a few days before it to see the City and visit family  Its conveniently located for Subways and easy walking in Midtown East next to Grand Central Station  Even though I obtained very good deal using hotels internet site paying in full in advance and nonrefundable upon check in the staff gave us a quiet room on high floor away from elevators  Standard rooms are small  sq  ft  but comfortable  No coffee pot or mini bar but had a big flat screen TV  Its restaurant menu was limited and the dishes uneven but very pricey as is everything in New York  Best deal was bar food in adjoining area just beyond restaurant and though portions were small the meals were surprisingly good  Had stayed here several years ago and enjoyed this stay much more  
P => Great location disappionting guest room Stayed  nights on the th floor of the hotel  The public rooms were very nice a great shame about the guest rooms  The room was quite large but had a tired feeling to it  The bathroom was very small and dirty  I complained about the mould growing in the shower cubicle they came and removed half   why half I complained about the TV with a serious picture fault and alarm clock wrong time and no instructions to change the time while we were out that turned the radio on the clock on but still displayed the wrong time and turned the TV on   I don t think the maintenance team quite understand maintenance  The noise from the street was loud and we were very surprised to find the windows single glazed  The breakfast buffet was good  
P => Great Hotel I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews of this hotel  The hotel is in a perfect location connected to Grand Central Terminal  The lobby is beautiful and check in was easy with very friendly staff  We had a normal King room on the th floor  It was much larger than most rooms I have stayed at in New York and even had a huge walk in closet  The room was clean and well maintained  There was a safe in the room and housekeeping did a great job every morning  We stayed for  nights and never heard any of the noise that other people complained about  The only negative about the entire experience was their tour assistance  Do not let Christopher gouge you Every play we asked about was the hottest one in town and tickets were     each  Give me a break We walked to the theater and bought excellent tickets to three different Broadway plays at face value  He also is less than interested in questions unless you are willing to let him take your money Bottom line this is a great hotel in a fantastic location that I highly recommend and will stay at next time I am in town  
P => good stay at the grand My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt il  prior to boarding the QE for England on the th  Check in was a bit chaotic but the staff very efficiently resolved our wrong room assignment  Not enough bellmen at check in lobby is quite a distance from the entry and on a different level  Concierge had already arranged for a car and driver to meet us at JFK via email request  Hotel has an awesome concierge Joe  He booked our car and driver to get to the cruise terminal on the th got fantastic restaurant reservations on the spot and even designed us a walking tour before dinner  Staff was efficient and courteous  Our deluxe king room was very spacious had a walk in closet but was very dark lighting and the bathroom was tiny  Great view from large window though  Room and bathroom were very clean and bed was supremely comfortable  Location just cant be beat connected to the Terminal and just steps away from Park Avenue and Madison Avenue  Forget breakfast from room service   for two eggs Go downstairs to the coffee bar and get super pastries and coffee for minimal money  Overall a good stay and I would stay at this hotel again  
P => Great Location Spent  nights at Grand Hyatt New York  Great location quite impressive lobby express check in and check out available  Comfiest beds some voices could be heard from the bedrom next door but not intrusive  Dont drink in this hotel the bar is expensive   even more expensive than the Campbell Apartment in Grand Central Station  For its location I would certainly stay here again bedrooms were spacious and comfortable  
P => Disappointed I went this past weekend to New York as a surprise trip for my partner for his birthdayour anniversary  I got a great flight rate so I ided to Priceline for a  star hotel in New York and I wound up with the Grand Hyatt I should have known I was in for a bit of a rough ride  And mind you I definitely know I got a good rate  I would however be rather more unhappy if I had paid full price for this place First I e mailed a request to Hyatt e concierge to see if I could pay extra and upgrade to Regency Club  Mind you I have done similarly in the past with Hiltons several Starwood properties and a couple of riotts the ones that dont close their      club lounges on weekends  Its never been a problem  I have also made simple bedding requests of other Hyatts and I have been treated well  First I got a flat quotNoquot  I then sent an executive e mail carpet bomb to a few Hyatt higher ups to see why in the heck I couldnt at least try for something so simple  I wasnt asking for free I was asking to pay for an upgrade  I actually got a phone call within  hours from the Vice President of the GH New York telling me the reasoning and promising that he would check availablilty for me and get back to me Needless to say he never did When I arrived at the Grand Hyatt I was greeted with a rather gruff young woman who was basically shooing a young couple away when they were asking to change rooms  Uh oh  I ided not to even ask about the potential upgrade  The young woman in question was fast but she was cold demanding and borderline rude  Great  star reception The room was not clean there was even trash in the bathroom trashcan from the previous guest  The bathroom wall tiles are plastic the grout is dirty and the general feel of the place is very very tired  The room size is actually pretty big for New York but the layout was a bit odd  And as previous guests have noted the noise coming from adjoining rooms is borderline intolerable  Oh and our next door neighbors left their room service trays in the hallway the evening we arrived and they werent carted away all day until of course we were actually drifting off to sleep the next evening  I knew the exact moment as they made as much noise as humanly possible taking them away  Room service by the way is hand over fist the most expensive I have ever seen and we travel a lot  yes even to New York  A base price of  for a continental not even including service charges which is juice coffee for  and a croissant muffin OR bagel is kind of well insane  Luckily there are plenty of reasonably priced options within a  minute walk in either direction right outside the door I filled out their survey during video check out  I did that once at the airport Hyatt in Orlando with a so so experience and they CALLED my room within  seconds to ask how they could make it up to me  I gave this place a pure thumbs down and heard nothing Heres the main problem I have  I got a  star room   star service and I was pretty much made to feel as if I didnt matter  If I had paid for a  star room in New York I would probably be thrilled  However this place is supposed to be  star and it just isnt  In any way except for the pretentious lobby No more Priceline for me in New York  Ill stick to my happy favorite the Hampton Inn Times Square North  There I get good friendly service a free breakfast big rooms luxurious beds and a stress free time  
P => Great Stay at the Grand Hyatt Overall a very pleasant stay  I got a king room via Priceline for  and initially I was a bit concerned after reading some of the negative reviews here  Fortunately my stay turned out to be great The room was relatively small but that is to be expected from a NYC hotel in the moderate price range  Other than that everything was perfect  Room was in great shape clean and attractive  TV with tons of cable channels including HBO  The iPod docking station and radio clock combination is great  Very small bathroom but with all the necessary amenities  And as noted in other reviews no mini bar  The location is perfect right on several subway lines and in walking distance to most of the tourist things in mid town  Every staff person I came in contact with was extremely helpful and upon request I was granted a late  PM checkout which is pretty generous in a busy hotel  Again I would highly recommend the hotel for a quick stay in NYC although the standard room rate of about  seems a little high  But if you can get a deal it s a perfect hotel for business or sigh seeing  
P => Not a very good experience My husband had called and made this reservation and used his Hyatt points so my niece and I could stay  nights for free  He had asked for  queens and a non smoking room  When we got to our room it had ONE double bed and smelled like smoke  We called the desk and they informed us that there were NO rooms available with the  beds but did move us to a King non smoking  They told us they would try to fill our request for the next night but when we called the next day they said there was still nothing available  We had checked in early in the day and my husband had made the reservation months in advance  We also had a bit of a problem with room service when we ordered a dessert and they brought  spoons one of which had coffee on it The rooms and bathrooms are quite small also  The lobby is impressive but probably will not stay there again  
P => Grand central was grand and central Beat our expectations We werent expecting much but were pleasantly surprised  Room was large clean very quiet bed was comfy and the hotel lobby was great  Right by Grand Central Station walking distance to lots of attractions  Would definitely stay here again  Tip is to watch their website as they post lock in specials which saved us about  a night  We were in a deluxe King and would probably stay there again  Great ket pharmacy and Starbucks right there as well you will need bandaids for your feet  Walk walk walk 
P => Costly fork My husband is in Manhattan one week of every month couldnt get into his regular hotel so booked the Grand Hyatt  He worked late one night so when he returned to the hotel he was tired so ided to have a cup of soup for dinner  He asked at the front desk for a spoon or fork  She said they would send one right up  My husband said okay although he hoped just to be directed to a plastic spoon or fork somewhere so he could go to his room have the soup and go to bed  When he got to the room housekeeping called to say they would be right up with the fork and it would cost    That is   for the use of a fork My husband was paying over   a night for the room and he couldnt get the use of a fork for free He did not use their fork his soup cost under  but quietly borrowed one off a room service tray and washed it himself and used that Things are out of control when  a night hotels charge for the use of a fork 
P => BEST NYC Location My family husband and  teens stayed at Grand Hyatt at the beginning of ember  It had been  years since Id been in the city and was concerned about getting around  The Hyatt worked out being the perfect lodging for the infrequent NYC visitor  Not only are the accomodations lovely small but still bigger than the Waldorf but it is next to the historic Grand Central Station which provided my family of picky eaters with a  food selection  Also being close to the subway came in really handy  The staff at the hotel were extremely nice and accomodating  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Great stay at the Grand Hyatt Spent a weekend night at the Grand Hyatt New York  This is not the type of hotel we would ordinarily choose since we prefer smaller boutique style hotels but we were traveling with a group and the hotel was chosen by others  Still we were pleasantly surprised  The staff was very friendly  When we were inadvertently given a smoking room after registering for non smoking the front desk clerk upgraded us to a deluxe king on the th floor which was really nice  I was prepared for noise after reading the reviews here but our room was perfectly quiet and the black out curtains did their job so well that we slept later than usual in the morning  The bedding was super comfortable and the room was very clean The location on nd Street was great  We walked to Times Square the Theater District and the shops on th Avenue and it was an easy subway ride from the train station next door to Chinatown for dim sum  The bellhops managed our groups luggage with rekable efficiency and we ended our short stay with an outrageously expensive but worth every penny drink in the nd floor bar before pulling out on Sunday afternoon If you like big busy glitzy hotels this would be an excellent choice  
P => Perfect Hotel The Grand Hyatt New York is a great hotel with a great location in a great city Our room was not as large as some I have stayed in but we were on the th floor it was quiet and perfect for staying in Midtown  The hotel is connected to Grand Central Station which makes getting to your train Subway or commuter a breeze  The location was the best part about the Grand Hyatt  We walked to Rockefeller Center and it only took about  minutes  We could have walked to Times Square but chose to take the Shuttle from Grand Central instead  The staff was very helpful including giving opinions and advice on what to wear and places to eat  If you are looking for a hotel in NYC with a great location and quiet with a beautiful lobby perfect for a romantic weekend the Grand Hyatt would be the perfect place 
P => Great location Great Service but called security TWICE I was at the Grand Hyatt from Wed il  Sunday il th  My parents were in the adjoining room from Wed il   Monday il st This is at least our th stay at this hotel because we love the location and the excellent customer service I regret to report however this was by far the WORST trip we have had in this hotel Thursday night shortly after midnight a large group of high schoolcollege students who were performing Carnegie Hall entered the next room and began lhing and talking loudly enough in the room next door that the sound was traveling right through the wall against our headboards  I called security at  am and security came up quickly and the room immediately quieted down to their credit Then the next night a large group of young women possibly from the same group stood in the area around the elevator and were literally shouting with lhter starting at   This time I called security within  minutes as it was clear they were going to use the hall as a social area I realize that as a hotel return business is important and the large annual traveling groups are a dependable source of revenue  But we are seriously considering moving to the Hilton at least for our Springtime trips if this is going to be an annual on going situation It is absolutely unacceptable to pay  a night and have to tolerate a situation akin to a college dormitory  The kids were walking around barefoot in the hallways wearing their flannel pajamas carrying smelly slices of cheese pizza on Friday  I would have overlooked this if they were not so noisy after midnight Otherwise our stay was wonderful as usual  Staff is polite well trained and responsive  The location is superb and the hotel is literally on top of  subway lines with a Delmonicos  a block away and several chain coffee shops for a midday break I love this hotel but I am not going to stay here in the Spring unless I get a guarantee from a manager that they will give me a room away from the school kids in il We did ask for a room change but they could not give us  rooms adjoining with double beds and we had already moved rooms to obtain the adjoining rooms shortly after check in Wed  
P => Fantastic time in Times Square y    My wife is originally from Long Island and wasnt sure what to expect  When we arrived at the hotel around PM on y rd we were greeted by a smiling faces that were more than willing to help us  She was pleasant and immediately noticed that I was a Hilton Honors Gold Card holder and asked if there was anything additional the she could do for us including free breakfast during our stay which we gladly accepted When we went to our room and wasnt happy with the view due to construction below we went back to the reception desk and asked to be moved to a different location and it was done immediately and without question    THANK YOU HILTON We were placed on the nd floor from the th floor and ended with a spectacular view of the surrounding bldgs and the Hudson River especially at night We immediately went to the TCKTS booth and got ticket for quotAll Shook Upquot and it was fantastic   I strongly suggest it for anyone that likes elvis music but doesnt want to see Elvis impersonators  The music was great and the comedy during the show was excellent     STARSWe had friends coming in from LI to visit us in the city and had to find a place to eat for the night  Several places were suggested by the staff concierce had left for the night and the operator even went out of her way to call several restaurants for us to see if they had a spot open for us  We ended up going to the Jeckyl amp Hyde Clud near Central Park and had a great timeThe breakfast buffet in the morning was more than sufficient for the two of us and we were always greeted with smiles and graciousness by the host  The food was delicious with no complaints we did not eat there any other meals The hotel was right on next door to quotThe Lion Kingquot and  block from nd amp Broadway   right next to everything  Theres even a McDonalds right next door for those with cheaper tastes and kids that want that quotHappy Mealquot  Its also only a  or  min walk to watch quotGood Morning Americaquot from the front door of the hotel I would definetely stay here again and again 
P => Location is a plus Times Square is the best place to stay so this Hotel is rated based on that for the most part  For the full paid price I paid as I stayed there on business it was just average  For in excess of  there should be more amenities especially for a gold Hilton member  The door men were just ok and seemed to take too long to get transportation  When you are needing to get to a meeting time is of the essence  
P => Not bad better choices nearby Not a bad hotel  About on par with most Hilton and Hilton Garden Inns  I dont think its worth the price regardless of location  I was a bit disappointed that there are no room upgrades available particularly since Im eligible  Bar is nice  Go for as high a floor as possible the views are the best feature  But for the money try the Westin across the street or better yet try the Waldorf Astoria which I research to be cheaper  
P => Great Hotel My husband and I just returned from NYC  We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from e    Great location is all I can say  Rooms on the pricey side but thats to be expected due to the location  We live near San Francisco so we are used to paying   Coffee maker and robes are nice touches and the bed was extremely comfortable  Walking distance to everything subway station is only a few steps  We arrived on a Friday and were able to enjoy a happy hour at the Times Square Brewery   only steps from this hotel  Pints were  off so two beers were less than  bucks  Yes there is construction but request a room in advance facing the nd street side  The cabs drop you off on the construction side and then theres the doorman security guard and the luggage guys  Super nice They were helpful in explaining where everything was located  Its weird but from there you have to take the elevator to the nd Floor   thats where the lobby and front desk is located  Not crowded at all  There is also a nice bar but from what Ive read   very expensive  We didnt eat or drink at the hotel   only because there are sooo many nice eating places and bars around the city  We were really here for location bed hot shower plus my hilton points  At night after seeing a show or going to a bar   you will see a few riff raff hanging around on the streets but thats too be expected once again because this is a tourist area and like any other big city   watch your purse and wallet  We felt very safe and realize why they have the lobby on another floor   its because everyone is screened by the security guard and doormen then HE presses your quotupquot button to go to the lobby  There youll find really only hotel guests   not just people milling around like other hotels  Plus theres another security guard by the elevators  All in all a nice conmfortable hotel close to many attractions  Oh ask about the TKTS place walking distance from Hilton Times Square for discount tickets to same day broadway shows  We saw a show for   off the rake rate  We stood in line on that Friday we arrived the window opened at  p m  and there was a line starting at  p m  My husband didnt want to wait in that long line but was glad we did because we got  tickets for  bucks versus over a hundred   each  They only take CASH so hit the ATM before you go  
P => Get on the quiet side of Hilton Just returned from the Hilton and a Broadway weekend   musicals in  days This was our first time staying at Hilton Times Square  To those of you who are going within the next few months be warned of the construction on st street  The noise is deafening and it starts early  We were put in a room right above it all  When we called to change rooms we were told that there was nothing available except a handicapped room  This really surprised us as we were there at  in the afternoon on a Thursday but we grabbed the room and the difference was like night and day  Even though the room faced nd street you would be hard pressed to hear anything and the view was great  From then on it was peace and quiet The room was clean and a good size the bed was ok  Because it was a handicapped room there was no large closet and only a small sink in the bathroom but we were only there for the weekend so it was no big deal The elevators were great very fast in and out and yes everyone is right this hotel is in the middle of everything  We had vouchers for breakfast but their so called restaurant is just a continuation of the bar area and was very noisy  The food we had the breakfast buffet was just ok  There are much better little cafes more reasonable too within a  block area of the hotel  We also had room service one night    bad hamburgers and fries  coke      If you are big into room service stick with the riott quis  The staff was very friendly    Franklin the concierge is wonderful and will help you with anything you need  There seemed to be quite a few business people staying there and we saw no children during our stay  Oh yes they also have a small workout room that seems sufficient  We love Broadway and we love New York and we go often  All in all the Hilton did not disappoint us  
P => Location Location Location Im giving this a three star rating based exclusively on the hotel itself   not the location  If you factor in the location it is raised to a four star rating The room was nice   had an quotadjoining doorquot which Im not a big fan of   I could hear people talking and lhing loudly in the next room  Fortunately it didnt last through the night  The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable  I thought the common areas hall elevator where a little unkept   but as long as the room was nice I consider that less important  Ice was available on my floor however there was not an ice container in my room  I didnt bother to call for one   and bought bottled water at a nearby shop  My room on the th floor had a nice view of nd Street very good air conditioning and was a very nice size It was a little tricky finding the entrance to this hotel from nd Street   its a narrow entry   very low key   to an entrance that takes you to two elevators that go up to the lobby on the st Floor of the building  The front desk staff were very nice and welcoming  As a Hilton Honors member I also had a quotwelcome letterquot upon my arrival The value was average for NYC standards   Ive paid a little less for a better room   but then again those rooms werent in the heart of the Theatre District and Times Square  
P => Location Location For first time travellers to New York there is no better location  Staying in Midtown means everything is easily within reach the subway station is only a minute away with cinemas numerous restaurants broadway shows all within walking distance  The hotel itself is suited to both the business and lesiure traveller  The rooms are a fantastic size and are very clean and comfortable  The bathroom was great although on my previous visit was a little dated  The service is top notch and the views are great  The cost of staying at this hotel is very expensive as is all of New York however for all the benefits of staying in such a great location I keep going back  If you require a fridge please email or ring ahead and request one I sent through the day before and they send me about  confirmation emails from various departments to ensure that my request was fufilled  Now that is service  I have not tried the food in the hotel and really with so many good restaurants so close by why would you pay hotel inflated prices to eat there is beyond me  There is no need for breakfast as there is a place across the road Pax Food thats great for breakfast and has salads sandwiches amp pizza for lunch  Highly recommended 
P => FANTASTIC HOTEL The Hilton Times Square is fantastic  Stayed there in il with our  year old son  The staff were helpful and friendly and could not do enough for us  Ten minutes after arriving in our room the cot crib was delivered completely made up  The room was spacious with a king size bed and the housekeeeping was second to none  Would not hesitate to recommend this excellent hotel  The location is unbelievable and the subway station is very close by  
P => An excellent choice in New York At the risk of repeating what many others have already said we had an excellent stay here  The rooms were large clean and comfortable and the bathrooms spotless  The staff couldnt have been more helpful especially the concierges and we met with no negative reaction whatsoever when we asked to check in early at  pm  With two teenagers in our party the location was superb and felt safe even at night and my partner was over the moon at being right opposite BB Kings club  We would and already have recommended it without any hesitation  
P => New Years Eve at the Hilton My son and I spent five nights at the Hilton Times Square  What a terrific location especially being that close to Times Square on New Years Eve  The view of the Empire State Building was fantastic  The rooms were quiet and very comfortable  Wed definitely stay there again Everything about the staff and service was excellent  I also ended up getting bronchitis and the concierge immediately found me a dor  I appreciated being able to know where to go for medical help especially in such a large city like New York  
P => Great Hotel We found the Hilton Times Square a perfect hotel for our first visit to New York  The bedroom was large and quiet  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom very clean  The staff were very friendly helpful and keen to pass the time of day  The location was great and within easy walking distance of many of New Yorks attractions  We would not hesitate to stay there again when we return to New York  
P => Times Square Hilton   Bang On The Times Square Hilton is an excellent base to explore and shop in New York City  Its location realistically could not be better not only are you right in the heart of the Times Square district but at each end of the block there are subway stations to take you just about anywhere in Manhattan The staff in the hotel particularly the security staff are possibly the friendliest hotel staff I have ever encountered and special praise should be given to U security Raymond security Henri doorman and Ernest reception as these in particular really helped make us feel welcome and valued which is nice Around the hotel there is a plethora of chain and tourist trap restaurants selling ent enough food but at a price but if you venture west towards eight and ninth avenues you will find some excellent great value restaurants and diners If you plan to go to New York City you must consider this hotel  
P => Fantastic time at the Hilton Times Square We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from ch  th   Location wise it cannot be beaten  Right on nd street  metres from Times Square  Port Authority Bus Terminal at the rear is where the Buses leave for the Outlets   Jersey Gardens and Woodbury Common  Subway stops within  metres of the door  Staff were very helpful and courteous  King size room was a great size well kept and well equipped  Stayed on the nd Floor with fantastic views of the Empire State Building and the Hudson River  My girlfriend has already booked next years shopping trip and is saying there Would not stay anywhere else in NYC  
P => Excellent Location Just came back from an amazing trip to NYC  Stayed a full week at the Hilton and really enjoyed every minute  The hotel is not  star luxury but it is still at a high standard the rooms are very spacious and the location is perfect  The breakfast is also worth including in your package  The views from the hotel are amazing try and request a high room at check in  I would definitely reccommend this hotel for every type of traveller  The staff were always very helpful and we were not charged for a late check out  I would definitely stay at this hotel the next time I am in NYC  
P => Great time in Hilton Times Square Just returned from fab trip to N Y  on the   Stayed with my teenage son at this great hotel After a tiring journey found that tour operator had messed up booking and not booked upgraded room  Receptionist at Hilton went out of her way to find available upgraded room we had requested  Room was on th floor with great view of Empire State Building  Very comfortable beds and good sized room and hard to get out of in the morningStaff very welcoming and friendly especially Raymond from security  Entrance from nd Street easy to see lobby larger than we expected and many members of staff around especially in the evening  Next to hotel there are cinemas restaurants and Madame Tussauds  Hotel located near Broadway and only seconds away from Times Square At end of trip found it difficult to leave Would certainly recommend hotel to anyone thinking of staying in NY  
P => Spacious with a great view We stayed here as a reward earned with the Hilton Honors American Express and found the rooms spacious particularly for New York  The view was amazing of the city and the Hudson River  The Lobby was bright and sophisticated once you took the elevator to get to it on the th floor  The location cant be beat for theater and was close to the subway and Port Authority  The nicest stay in New York Ive had in a while  
P => Fabulous stay at the Hilton Times Square After reading a few of the negative reviews of this hotel I must admit I was a little skeptical  However my stay at the Hilton Times Square ch   was nothing short of fantastic We arrived an hour or two before check in time and they put us in a room right away on the nd floor  While our window did not overlook Times Square it had a sweeping view of the Hudson River on the right and a gorgeous view of the Empire State Building at night  We could even see the Statue of Liberty straight ahead The room was immaculate and had so much room even more room than some of the hotels in the South The bed was comfortable and the bathroom towels were big and soft  The hotel staff downstairs in the bottom floor were always nice no matter what time we got in at night  Even the bartenders at the bar in the lobby were very friendly  Ive been to New York three times in the past three years and this was the best stay Ive had  Ill definitely be staying there when I return 
P => Great hotel Stayed here from the th of ch to the nd il   Had a fantastic time and didnt want to leave  All the staff were friendly and helpful  The room was large with two queen sized beds  Our room was on the th floor with views over Times Square and the Hudson River Couldnt have been better My only issue was with the price of the room service it is very expensive  But with Appleberrys restaurant directly below the hotel who needs room service anyway  If you do stay at this hotel then cross the street and but a sandwich from the PAX deli they are faboulousHave a great time and I  see you there as I will definatly be going back           
P => Fantastic Stay My mother and I stayed at the Hilton for  nights   ch  and had a fantastic stay  I mentioned to the lady at the front desk that this was my first time in New York and she got us a lovely room on the th floor overlooking nd street with views of the Hudson  I read alot of reviews and spent alot of time iding which hotel to book and I am definately glad I chose the Hilton and spent a bit more because I do believe this helped in making my trip to NY fantastic and memorable  I was prepared for a small room by most NY hotel reviews but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room was spacious with lots of room to move around  Every staff member I encountered was friendly and I appreciated the turn down service  The location was ideal for us exploring the city  I could not fault this hotel one bit and I will definately be returning to stay at the Hilton Times Square in the future  All the other positive reviews were spot on which made me book this hotel in the first place  And to the people who say why spend so much money on a hotel room when youre not even in it I spent about  hours or more each day in my room sleeping showering resting etc and Im glad I had a nice room to come back to with a great view that I loved seeing  
P => Big East Tournament Great Place We recently attended the Big East Basketball tournament during the second weekend of ch  ided to book a suite at an extremely reasonable government rate  Couldnt have been happier with the accommodations king bed plus a pullout queen sofa the treatment we received from the moment we checked our vehicle the location right in the middle of Times Square and the proximity to the Garden  The three of us have already agreed we wouldnt stay anywhere else next year  Bravo 
P => Great Weekend Absolutely Fantastic  Stayed in the Hilton      I received an early check in and an extended check out a st floor room with outstanding views of nd and the Hudson  The room was large clean tidy and comfortable  The concierge were excellent as were all the staff  Would definately stay again 
P => Loved Times Square Hilton Nice surprise  On nd Street  Times square is at your feet  Enter from the street and take an elevator up  floors to the modern minimalistic lobby  Friendly but not pushy staff  Great furnishing with unique local art in the room  Great views of the city  
P => Excellent  Especially w Priceline rate The people who complain about this place need to be staying at The Plaza or something Its clean  The rooms are large  Its central to the theatre district We had a relatively low floor but still enjoyed a view of the new Westin with the funky light and the river I paid  on Priceline  I guess if I paid  or something Id be underwhelmed I would definitely come again even at a somewhat higher price  
P => Perfect for what I needed I brought my fifteen year old dhter and two friends to New York for an overnight stay  This hotel worked very well in terms of the location and amenities  There is a parking lot right across the street from the hotel on st Street so self parking is an easy option in addition to the valet  The staff were all courteous and efficient from the doormen to front desk and security  Check in was fast  Despite being Priceline customers they were very accomodating to my request for adjoining rooms and gave us access to one room early am so that we could store our things freshen up and get on with our day  By New York standards the rooms are large  Facilities are clean and well maintained    nice bathrooms with ble sinks and ceramic tiled floor and tub  We were not on a high floor but the view was not obnoxious and there was zero street noise  Fantastic subway access and of course proximity to shows  Would definitely stay here again  
P => Great Hotel Have just returned from a weekend away ch    th  Our room was on the th floor and we had great views of the Empire State building and the river  The room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable Location is excellent and only a few minutes from the heart of Time Square  Would recommend this hotel to anyone and would not hesitate to stay there again  
P => Great stay I stayed here with my girlfriend for  nights from rd to th   and had a fantastic time  I ided on this Hotel having read the reviews on this website amp I wasnt disappointed  Staff were friendly amp our room was very spacious with the bed one of the most comfortable Ive ever slept in Cant comment Im afraid on their breakfast or dinner as we ate out every daynight  Hotel is in a great location and meant we could walk to a lot of the sights and shops  Only downside albeit small was our room was on a low floor so we didnt have a great view out of our window  Having said that we werent in our room long enough during our stay to really mind and we did go on a helicopter ride over the city which kind of made up for it 
P => Awesome with a capital A Recently stayed at Hilton Times Square  th th and had an unbelievably wonderful experience  We actually had a delayed flight and didnt get in until  AM but the staff was extremely accomodating patiently awaiting our arrival and had our extremely spacious room by NY standards warm and cozy when we arrived  The service was top notch and the beds were extremely comfortable  Both the location and the view of  StreeetTimes Square are incomparable  We stayed on the th floor and had enough peace and quiet while in the room even though the hotels location is in the happening district  The Hilton Times Square is definitely worthy of its  star rating and I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to enjoy the NYC experience with the convenience of New York at your doorstep  This is an absolute steal if you can score this hotel on Priceline as I was fortunate to do  Anyone who reports complaints about this hotel has truly had odd experience which is a deviation from the norm  I would stay at this hotel again again and again  Just Awesome 
P => Nice Hotel No Complaints Quite pleased especially since I obtained a discounted rate through Priceline  Nice sized rooms well appointed  Bathrobes in the room  ent work out facility  Professional staff  Fantastic location for leisure travelers and just fine for business travelers  Would stay here again paying published rates  
P => Great Location We stayed for six nights and were impressed  Good view from the room with Empire State to the left and river to the right  Large clean rooms with big twin beds  Everything you require in a room for a short break Neutrogena products ent hair dryer iron and ironing board cd player etc  Breakfast was too pricey for us but who cares when there are so many places to eat outside the hotel  Best thing was location though  
P => Nice hotel manic location I stayed here e  using part Hilton reward points and paying for the rest  My impression of the hotel overall was good   polite staff large clean rooms nice touches like leaving little chocolates on your pillow in the evenings The hotel bar was small but had a good selection of wines  I cant comment on the restaurant as I didnt eat there  My only qualm was that as another review mentions there is building work at a site opposite this hotel which meant that despite being so high up you were awoken with the sound of drilling   not ideal  Also personally I found the location despite being very central and easy to reach most places just too manic As soon as you left the hotel you had to fight the crowds of people to get anywhere Next time I would definitely choose a different location  
P => One of the Best I was wowed by the Hilton Times Square loved the fact that the lobby was on the th floor  The room was great and had an excellent view except for the fact they must have demolished something right next to it  I can tell you though at night the view of the city is breath taking  I wish I would have been higher than the st floor though    oh well you cant have everything  The staff was very corteous and helpful and security is tight    I dont mind that inconvinience   
P => Nice but noisy  We stayed in a room on the th floor  The view was very nice   looked across to the Empire State Building on one side and the river on the other   The room was spacious   a lot bigger than other hotels weve stayed at in NY  It was also nice and bright with a huge window  The problem we found was the level of noise   there was a huge gap under the connecting door between rooms which meant that we could hear the people next door  Also the noise from the corridor was quite bad  The worst thing though was the noise from the flushing toilets   constantly we could hear toilets being flushed in nearby rooms   by the fifth day it had become very annoying  Another source of noise was the new Plaza Hotel that they were building below our window which meant that diggers were working from about  in the morning  If you like a lie in Id ask for a room on the other side of the hotel  The Pinnacle Bar next to Reception provided a nice environment for a light meal although it took quite a long time to get served   one day it took them an hour to bring us a portion of fries  The quality of the food though was very good  The security at the hotel makes you feel safe   you need to show your hotel key before you can go in the elevator up to Reception   Overall a nice hotel but the level of noise I think would prevent us from returning   
P => Disappointing The entrance and lobby of the hotel are dulltired and need an update  Low water pressure in shower  Nice size room The lobbys bar the only bar in this hotel is not inviting the bartender a bit rough  Close to Times Square   so what NYC is much more than being close to Times Square  Compare to the general level of the Hilton chain   this particular hotel was a disappointment  Felt like I was in a   stars hotel  Got this hotel via PriceLine  per night so at least the cost was reasonable  Last note   In my view Hilton New York  Avenue of the Americas NYC is much better  
P => Fantastic Me My wife and my parents stayed at the Hilton for  nights over the new year and had a fantastic time  The hotel is really nice  Last time I came to NYC I stayed in the Milford Plaza so this was about  times better  The rooms are very large as are the beds and the view is fantastic If your looking for a bit of Luxury stay hereCant wait to go back   
P => Great central location My partner and I early s spent  nights at the Hilton Times Square and realy enjoyed our stay We booked the room through opodo com and chose the bounceback vacation package which we got for a great rate considering we checked in on   The package included breakfast for two each morning and the food was the only downside to the hotel The breakfast was buffet style but there was not a great choice and the food was the same everyday  We only ate in the restaurant for breakfast so cannot comment on other meals The location of the hotel was excellent could not have asked for better  It was central in Times Square with a subway seconds away and everything we wanted was close to hand  Our room was on the rd floor overlooking nd street and the view was superb The room was very spacious with a lovely large comfortable bed  The maids came every day and left the room spotless with fresh towels and bedding We didnt realy use the amenities in the hotel but there was not a swimming pool which we were a bit disapointed with as it was stated as having one when we booked The staff were very polite and friendly and helpfull especialy on checking out  We will deffinately use this hotel on our next visit to NYC  
P => room with a view This was our first visit to NYC  Having read the reviews on the Hilton Times Square ided to stay there for  nights from     Requested a room with a view  Will never forget opening the door and there before us glistened a city of lights  From the th floor the Empire State building was on one side with the Hudson river on the other  The rooms are spacious tastefully orated with the most comfortable beds to sleep in  Cannot fault security both inside and outside the hotel  The staff are extremely conscientious to ensure that only those staying at the hotel were allowed in  Would definitely recommend staying here and that New York certainly lives up to its name  
P => Nice Place Stayed at the Hilton Times Square for New Years Eve  Great location and big rooms for New York standards  I liked the fact that you had to show proof that you were staying there each time you tried to walk into the hotel  My only complaint is that the hotel didnt have a gift shop or a place inside it to get OJ and a muffin or magazine  
P => Nice Hotel in NY Wasnt anything spectacular but the location was unbeatable  Hotel is located on the same block and New Amsterdam Theatre which makes it the perfect place to stay if youre seeing the Lion King  Hotel itself is above average and I would stay there again  Didnt recieve any of the special treatment that I read about on this board  Stayed  nights right before Christmas   Look for deals  I payed  a night by going to their website directly and paying in advance of my trip  Considering the season I was very pleased with this hotel for  a night  
P => Fabulous Stay with Great Views Stayed here for  nights     ember   this hotel could not be faulted  Ask for a room on a high floor   we were on nd floor with views over nd Street  Rooms extremely spacious and orated to a high standard and fluffy bathrobes and toiletries provided along with coffee making facilities  No problems with lifts   speedy and efficient  Staff could not be faulted   concierge and reception staff pleasant and helpful as were the doormen  Not keen on restaurant and bar area being open plan but good for people watching   will definitely return here 
P => Great hotel    for the most part  We stayed there from     It had a bit of a rough start but in the end a very nice place to stay  We had booked a two double bed room on the rd floor and ended up with a King size bed on the th and had to fight with some young man at the front desk over the phone to get our room changed  He said nothing was available and it was our fault so we were fuming    but as soon as we left the room there was a hall monitor who immediately asked what was wrong and called the front desk and got our room changed in a second by the time we got down to the front desk they had our new keys waiting for an even better room    Rachel and whoever that hall monitor woman was were perfect but the young man on the phone was horrible and needs a lesson in dealing with customers who just spent over a thousand dollars on their hotel  The other bad things were that when you were in your room you could hear a chorus of toilets flushing from all over the floor you were on  Our sliding key cards also stopped working for our door one night which we needed to exchange for a new pair The good things were the security and staff were all so friendlyexcept one the front lobby is beautiful and the room was a great size for a NY room  The place is very clean which was one of the reasons why we chose this hotel  The view was amazing as well    couldnt have asked for more we had a view looking south at the Empire State Building Madison Square Gardens and the Hudson River  The location was great just a half block from Times Square which was nice to kind of escape from right beside a subway entrance as well  We might try somewhere else when we return but always a great option  
P => Great location and service Stayed here with kids ember    Rooms are big by New York standards  We had a southern view with a great look at the Empire State Building  Lobby is small but comfortable  This is the biggest difference between here and the big name hotels which offer much more presence  Had a great breakfast buffet at the restaurant with smoked salmon and bagels  The concierge gave us a pass to s  which is fantastic if youre under  but worthless for adults  We have stayed in quite a few NYC hotels and absolutely loved this one 
P => Treated us like royalty My kids  and  stayed at this location   gt  It was fantastic  Clean great location great staff etc etc  They made us feel special and welcome We had a room booked at HOJO Park Plaza for about  less a night however that hotel is rated poorly on this site which worried me  So for about  more a night we went from   to almost    Great breakfast included too So close to all attractions in mid town Would stay here in a flash again  Expensive yes but worth it 
P => Fine time but some room for improvement Just returned from a fabulous wknd in NYC  The Hilton Times Square is very nice        not spectacular  The staff was very helpful  The rooms clean and comfortable  The view from the th was nothing to brag about and when I asked for a higher floor I was told nothing was available  I was disappointed with the entry  I liked the location but I did not like the quothallquot atmosphere as you entered from the street  There were always people in front of the doors     not allowing easy access  Once inside the staff was usually visible and secure  The lobby is small and not really inviting  The room was very nice     big and equipped with all the comforts necessary for a pleasant stay  Im just not sure if I will return       
P => Good though not Great We stayed in the Hilton at Times Square between th   and the th    I had booked a King Deluxe room almost six months prior to our visit and after reading all the reviews on this website I had probably developed overly high expectations  Good Points  All staff are very friendly and daily room cleaning service is excellent  Concierge excellent   Bed was one of the most comfortable we have stayed in   Location is excellent right in the heart of Manhattan   Hotel security very good you will be safe in this hotel Bad Points  The shower had very poor water pressure for a high class hotel the worst pressure I have had in a hotel of  stars or more  Although be it was just my room I dont know   I dont smoke my partner does  We took a smoking room  On opening the room door we were nearly knocked flat by the embedded stench in the room it was like walking into a giant ash tray everytime you entered the room got used to it after about half an hour each time  Although you expect the smell of a smoking room to resemble some element of stale smoke this was the worst I have experienced  We stayed in a smoking room at the Luxor in Las Vegas and it was   better    Even numbered rooms look downtown odd number rooms look over nd St Uptown  Try to get a room on a higher floor the reception is on the st floor our room was an odd numbered room on the th floor  A few floors below our room on nd st side of hotel were giant fans for the air con system  If you stay higher up you will get far better views and also be further away from the air con fans  In sumy I can see why all the good reviews have been written for this hotel I think a combination of my high expectations from previous reviewers and getting a room on a low floor with a bad stench of smoke put a dampener on it for me  Although taking a smoking room is a personal choice they need to sort the ventilation out for them  For the price I paid  for three nights I dont think it was worth it for the room we had I would stay there again for sure but for the price I paid I would insist on a room from at least the th floor and up and preferably non smoking  
P => Fab Fab hotel  Everything about it was great  From the minute we arrived the staff were great and instantly made us feel welcome  The rooms are clean and modern and the view from our room on the nd floor where we could see the Empire State Building was brilliant Originally we were going to stay at a hotel overlooking Central Park but Im glad we chose this hotel instead as the location cannot be beaten  We felt we were central to everything and there is such a buzz day and night in Times Square  It is also extremely near to Port Authority where we got the bus to Woodbury Common a must for shopaholicsWe will definitely be coming back to New York and without a doubt we will be staying here again  
P => Heart of Times Square      Brillient Loved the Hilton  All the staff were really nice and helpful  The hotel rooms are really big and the beds       Heaven after all the walking around the Big AppleWill deff stay there again when we visit New York Plus you feel really really safe as there are handsome mounted police right outside the entrance 
P => Loved this hotel We stayed here in tember for our first trip to NYC to see the Yanks play the Sox  The location was perfect right in Times Square  Although it is more expensive than most hotels we stay in we thought it was a good price for New York in the middle of Times Square  Next time I go to New York I will stay at the Hilton again  The rooms are nice and the view is great  We all loved it 
P => Terrific Hotel  Fabulous Location We just returned from a one night stay at the Hilton Times Square  I chose the hotel based upon the positive reviews listed here at TripAdvisor  The reviews were   accurate  Our room was clean large and had a breathtaking view  Our room looked out over nd Street directly above Madame Tussauds Wax Museum  We were in the heart of the theatre district and within walking distance to most of midtowns tourist attractions  The staff was kind courteous and extremely helpful  We arrived exceptionally early approximately  am and were immediately given our room  We especially liked that the lobby was above street level  We felt safe and secure the entire time  The Hilton Times Square was a great place to stay in New York City  Reserve without hesitation 
P => Reasonbly Priced Great Location for First Timers This hotel was a great find last minute  With a trip to NYC booked less than  weeks out in the fall there werent many recommendable options for less than     night  If youve been to NYC before and are interested in more than just the Square Id recommend staying somewhere else but if this is your first time you cant go wrong with this place The only negatives I have are not real negatives rather nit picky annoyances  First have to take an elevator up  floors from the entrance to reach the lobby then you take another set of elevators to your room  the elevators are fast and theres not much of a wait but if you get out to the street and realize you forgot something you gotta go back up an elevator through the lobby up another elevator then vice versa Next anytime you come into the hotel theres a guard asking to see your room key  Im sure this is to make sure only guests use the hotel facilities though it didnt appear there were many non guests attempting to get on the elevator I used the iron and ironing board the first night and housekeeping never put it away which I thought was kinda strange  Also housekeeping comes a bit early     ish or so  Its fine if youre up and at em but if youre out till  or  each night like we were its kinda early so remember to put out the DND sign  Like I said these arent really negatives but  be helpful to know for some folks  The other reviews have all hit on the positives so Ill just echo those  The hotel is immaculately clean  The staff is knowledgable friendly and helpful  Especially the guard Sarito  There are umpteen places to eat drink shop gawk etc within steps of the hotel  There are subway stations on either corner   ACE to the west BDNQ to the east  If possible ask for an even numbered room  There are no poor views   the odd rooms have views of the Hudson New Jersey Reuters Building and Theatre District  The even rooms have a view of the Hudson as well but also the Empire State Building and South Manhattan The only other thing I can think of is the price of the hot buffet breakfast     If you dont have a voucher for it theres no reason to pay for it unless you just love buffets  There are too many other places to eat in the City  
P => Great stay We stayed at the Hilton for six nights in ober priily as a result of having read many positive reviews here at tripadvisor  We were not disappointed the hotels location was perfect for a second visit to New York with shows and an opera booked Our twin room was large compared with a previous stay in NYC with plenty of room to move about  It was well furnished and had great views of downtown we could even see the Statue of Liberty in the distance in a gap between buildings  The housekeeping service was consistently good room service was very good but overpriced as always especially the chicken noodle soup The staff were informative and helpful and in fact we felt the only unimpressive feature of this property was the buffet breakfast for which we had received free vouchers for a breakfast for two each morning of our stay  Depsite having breakfast at a variety of times the eggs were invariably cold and there was only a small selection of items few of which appealed to us We will certainly stay here again and would recommend it  It was well worth the extra few dollars compared to Sofitel which is where we stayed on a last trip  
P => Superb Hotel We stayed at the Hilton for two nights in ember  having stayed at the iott quis for the first three nights of our trip The Hilton was absolutely perfect  Its not as glaous as the riott quis but it is located less than a minute away from Times Square and was every bit as neat and luxurious as the iott The room we had was large and extremely comfortable with a view that was simply magnificent  The hotel itself had an aura of real luxury and for the price it is undoubtedly one of the best hotel deals out there  Special mention must be made of the bed in our room  We had a King sized bed that was so comfortable that we had trouble re adjusting to our bed at home  If we ever return to New York the Hilton would definately be our choice for luxurious yet readily affordable accomodation  
P => Great Location and Price I came to NY   to   with my girlfriend and our college  My girfriend had to book all the rooms for the  students who went and had a great experience working with the management at the hilton  For her hard work we were rewarded with a suite on the top floor as well as champagne on ice and a gift basket when we entered the room  We only paid about  a night  Our room was very nice and clean the staff at the hotel is very friendly  The location is great  Its one block away from Times Square  ESPN Zone was a great place to watch sporting events and was about  blocks away  I would definetly stay here again  
P => Refreshing abundance of Quality My wife amp I recently stayed in Times Square   t rd   th   The Hilton is in a fantastic hotel tucked neatly away off nd street  Great location for NYC night life broadway shows central to tourist attractions and of course my wifes shopping adventures  The front office staff service was impeccable and the room had tremendous views over the NYC skyline  It is not often I am willing to recommend somewhere so if you are debating where to stay     Hilton Times Square is a sure bet  
P => Great new hotel great location pricier now though Stayed here when it first opened in e   First let me say that I travel all over the world and find that dollar for dollar the hotels in New York are the worst value in terms of how much cleanliness and newness your dollar buys you  In fact Ill go beyond that and say that for the average hotel room price paid in the average big city this buys you what amounts to a dump in my opinion in NYC Having stayed at one of these dumps during a trade show at the Javitz in e  during the last nights of my stay I searched for any hotel in NYC that was CLEAN and BRAND NEW This Hilton is all that and then some and is simply awesome  The views are great the location is great the rooms are beautiful and the service was good  I only rate it  stars because when I was there the lobby was full of people waiting for their rooms and they werent ready  This was probably because the hotel had just opened recently Anyways I thought Id found the ultimate bargain because I only paid  a night Well everyone else in the world must have discovered this place too because its hard to get a booking there for many consecutive nights now and good luck finding it a rate less than  or even less than  during peak travel times But if you can get the room youre guaranteed that its a real deal brand new hotel and not one of those NYC places where the lobby looks nice because they spent millions on it but the guest rooms are filthy  
P => Just outstanding My son and I stayed there for  nights in early ust  I can only echo the other reviews  The security was great  It had the feel of a small hotel with the amenities of a much larger one  Location was superb as we went to the theatre every night and we could walk everywhere  
P => Unbelievable Views The view from the rd floor of the Empire State building the Statue of Liberty all of Manhatten south of Times Square the Hudson River     was spectacular  Location unbeatable  Price good  Staff friendly  Room service reasonable  I will definitely stay there again  
P => Great Family Hotel Just returned from Hilton Times Square ust  th and completely enjoyed our stay  I was accompanied by my husband and  year old and  year old  The location was perfect close to everything  I had booked our room first several months ago and then booked tickets for Lion King several weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised to find it located just a few doors down Room was very comfortable with great big windows for my children to look out into the city at night  Family restaurants very close by   although my husband and I would have opted for more quotupscalequot cuisine    we needed to keep our kids palates and pocketbooks in mind I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again 
P => Great hotel great concierge We stayed at the hotel in y   We were very pleased with the size of the rooms and the great views  A special mention must be made of Len the concierge who gave us great advice about everything but especially where to eat and this really made our stay perfect  
P => Above expectation My friend and I went to NYC for the Tap Festival and we stayed in Hilton Times Square from e  to y   Before we came to NYC we have done so many researches on hotels in Manhattan and finally we chose Hilton Times Square due to all the good comments  Upon our arrival I inspected thoroughly throughout our room located on the th floor and was totally satisfied  The room is unexpectedly spacious and quiet our queen size twin beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is clean  The hotel staff are very helpful and the location of the hotel is just wonderful  All the Broadway musical show theatres are within walking distance subway station is around the corner and an internet cafe is right beside the hotel  As a frequent traveller I have been in many hotels around the world and for this one I would rate it   stars and will definitely come back again next time  
P => Go to The quis Instead Visited NYC on y     We got to the hotel and were told by the staff that there were no double beds available because they were expecting a quotlargequot group who had reserved the rooms  What about my reservation I am a  paying customer too They say that you can request a free refrigerator in your room because you will be charged if you so much as open the open that is in the room I got the rental refrig  albeit it had dents on it like it had been dropped from the elevator shaft For much better service and what you want the first time for the same price and better locale go to the riot quis Thats what we did and LOVED IT 
P => Cannot be faulted Just got back from New York  Stayed at this excellent hotel  Right at the centre of things but an oasis of calm after the hustle and bustle of Times Square  Very quiet due to lobby starting on st floor  Rooms large by NY standards  Security brilliant  Key check on entry made us feel safe  Dont stay anywhere else  
P => Best hotel in TIMES SQUARE This is a fantastic place to stay in NYC  You can get it for pretty low prices on priceline if you can wait until last minute but as far as TIMES SQUARE hotels its the best of over  weve stayed at Great location great security great FRIENDLY service from everyone Justly lovely  
P => Great place to stay My teen age son and I stayed here and it was great  Exceptionally clean good service and the price was what I call quotNew York City reasonablequot  I still cant get over how quiet it was  A great relief from the noise and bustle of the city  
P => School Group I brought a group of middle school students to stay here on e     The stay was fantastic  I really appreciated that there was hotel staff located on ground and then again in the hotel lobby checking to be sure that only registered guests were entering the hotel  The front desk staff housekeepers concierge security and porters were all very nice to the kids  The price of the hotel is on the moderate to high side but the location  block to the Times Square subway station experience and high quality made it worth it   
P => A great hotel in the heart of NYC We stayed at this hotel for  nights from th to th e  after reading about it on tripadvisor com  We listed all the hotels we liked then checked the reviews   the Times Square Hilton jusifiably received the best reports and to be honest we have difficulty in finding any faults  If we really want to be picky we could say that the housekeeping was patchy   like one bed being turned down and not two but this is hardly an issue  The de luxe rooms were large and quiet the beds exceptionally comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful  Our rooms were on the nd floor and the views downtown were outstanding  If you are looking for a great hotel in the heart of NYC close to the buzz then this is it  
P => Love this Hotel We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year  We were staying at this hotel last summer when the black out hit  The staff was incredible Our elevators worked because the hotel has a generator for emergencies  You can not beat the location right in the heart of Times Square  The rooms are large and comfortable  I highly recommend this hotel 
P => Great This hotel was great Spaceous Clean and the service was execellent  I got it on priceline for  a night so it was well worth the cost  
P => Romantic Getaway My boyfriend surprised me with a weekend in the city  Including a night at the Times Square Hilton  The staff was amazing from the second we pulled up at the curb to checking out everyone was super friendly  The view of time square and the setup of the bar area are awesome  Stop in for a drink  
P => Great big rooms Spent a week in il with two other couples in this Hotel  We were pleased with the size of the rooms plenty of space and great views of New York from the window  The rooms were well serviced and staff pleasant The buffet breakfast was the same every day and cooked food not hot enough  The hot food needs to be varied  We enjoyed several restaurants nearby Osteria Al Doge great Italian food Johns Pizzeria and Un Deux Trois great French food The Hotel is handy to Broadway shows action of Times Square and close to public transport  
P => cannot fault it My husband and i stayed here over Easter for  nights with our  dhters plus  of their friends  We cannot fault the hotel the staff were very friendly even the doormen the rooms were huge we were on the rd floor with great views from both rooms Excellent location and very quiet inside the hotel after leaving the noisy Times Square  We ate breakfast at nearby delis as there were such good value  Cant wait to go back 
P => Excellent Brilliant hotel great location friendly helpful staff  We stayed here for the Bank Holiday wkend in  for my husbands birthday  We arrived later than expected and shattered due to massive delays and they were understanding and upgraded us as it was hubbies birthdayClean good location large rooms  for New York City and excellent location 
P => Fabulous hotel We stayed at this hotel at the end of ch   Everything was perfect  We contacted the hotel prior to arriving regarding parking etc  the staff and management were very informative and helpful  Arrival and check in were a breeze   very friendly courteous staff  The room was spectacular   very neat very clean and very comfortable  The location was of course perfect  If youre into walking its central so you can pretty much walk everywhere in Manhattan we did or you can take the subway thats  seconds away from the hotel door  We have absolutely no complaints and will definetely stay here again   
P => Wonderful Hotel I cant believe this hotel gets any bad reviews This hotel is very clean safe and quiet It is in a great location right off Times Square  The security is excellent   they check for IDs before allowing anyone up to the st floor lobby  There is a great place for a quick breakfast right across the street as well as a Starbucks  We didnt eat at the hotel because we wanted to see more of the city but the bar area looked very nice  This isnt a super luxury hotel but its great for business travel or people who want a nice quiet place to stay  Ask for a room on the higher floors   we were on the nd floor looking right at the Empire State Building  Most mornings we just sat and stared out the window at the amazing view in awe We paid  per night   ask for a discount when you call because all of the online places were much more expensive than booking direct  This is BY FAR my new favorite hotel in NYC  We stayed at the W Hotel in Midtown last time and it was the same price but the room was  times smaller 
P => Loved it My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel in ruary  It was the first overnight in NYC for both of us and we were undure of what to expect  I found an excellent deal on the Hilton website   a night no cancellations  Since we had tickets for a Broadway play we werent going to cancel The hotel room was clean and surprisingly spacious  I found the service to be excellent although we only stayed  nights  It was a very convienent location and since the rooms didnt start until the upper floors it was very quiet  Nice beds and a nice orating scheme  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC  
P => Did Not Want To Leave This was our first trip to New York and we did lots of research on NY hotels  Wanted some place nice safe and without paying  or  a night  Booked the Hilton for il     and had a great time  We were lucky enough to be able to go on board and tour the Queen y  while it was in NY and our room looked right out over the harbor with a great view of the ship and city  Hotel bellmen concierge and front desk were all very helpful and friendly not what we expected from NY  The hotel has a great bar and breakfast area in the Lobby  Our room was extremely clean and very spacious  The bed and pillows were very comfortable  This is a fairly new hotel so everything still looks great  The housekeeping staff will turn down your bed at night and leave bottled water and chocolates if you want them to  Security at this hotel is great  You have to show your room key before you can even get in the elevator to go to the Lobby  At night you can feel very safe in the hotel area  Applebees is next door and has good service and food for a very reasonable price  Micky Ds is two doors down for a quick lunch or breakfast  Almost everything is within walking distance if you have the right shoes  Cant say enough good things about Hilton Times Square and were ready to go back We will definately stay here on our next trip to NY  If you have any doubts about where to stay you will not be disappointed with this hotel  
P => The Most Comfortable Hotel in NYC I went to New York for my annual Easter Holiday il  to il    It is so important for visitors like me who just came in from a very long long flight to have a comfortable hotel to stay in with  This hotel is simply REKABLE  The moment you arrive you would not even carry your own luggages  There is a bellman who will bring it up to your room  They are very courteous  The front desk is helpful and fast  Everything said here at the tripadvisor is true  The rooms are a bit pricey I paid about  a night including taxes  But it is worth every penny  The beds are soft and comfortable including the pillows  You are given a bathrobe  There is a complimentary coffee  An ironing board  There is also a safe in the room  A beautiful hotel indeed  The rooms are big  You wont feel cramped  And they prepare your beds at night time you get a sweet chocolate and complimentary mineral water  AWESOME HOTEL expensive but worth it  Hotels in New York are expensive so why not spend a little extra and stay in this hotel  Im a frequent traveller and what I remember during my travels is the experience of my stay and not how much I paid for it  This hotel is simply the best  
P => excellent stayed here for  nights from th ch i was in town for wrestlemania xx at msg  I have to say this is by far the best hotel i have stayed in if i were to go again i would stay nowhere else due to the fantastic location of this hotel  Spacious rooms polite staffwho even asked if i enjoyed the show when i got back and excellent security  What more could you want cant wait to go back        
P => Perfect Stayed there   you get what you pay for and this hotel is no exception  Expensive but worth every penny  The Staff right through to security were exceptional  The room and views are perfect remembering that the lobby is on the nd  Well done Hilton once again  
P => First rate but you pay for it This is by far the best hotel Ive stayed at in Manhattan there have been   It was very upscale and cozy compared to the older hotels even had a real thermostat not a radiator and wall AC unit  It was posh and modern and very quiet  The only noise I could hear in my room were loud people in the hall the doors slamming and the toilets flushing  Ive yet to find a hotel that keeps those noises out  Keep in mind I DID not pay for this room which was  the night I was there  It was a business trip  Would I pay that much if I was spending my own money Probably not because Ive found the Salisbury to be my best BUY in Manhattan  Ive stayed at more expensive hotels than this Hilton but it was the best value for that price without a doubt  
P => Hilton Time Square Stayed at the Hilton Time Square ruary   Lovely hotel with excellent staff  Great views from all sides  Didnt experience the foodroom service so cant comment on that but nothing too much trouble for the staff  Great size rooms  Applebees is ok for for somewhere to go when you havet much time to look as its almost next to the hotel  Roxys is VERY EXPENSIVE for breakfast  Theres lots of fantastic delis to eat at costing as little as   for an egg and bacon roll  Carmines Restaurant is good but you need to book as its always busy  However the portions are humongous so better to buy  meal for  people 
P => Couldnt fault it My husband and I ided to stay at the hotel on Honeymoon after reading many great reviews on this site and we were not disappointedThe hotel is slap bang in the heart of NYC and we walked most places as they were easily accessible  It is literally a couple of minutes from the centre of Times Square and there is plenty going on nd street where the hotel is located There is an adjoining door to a bar  restaurant Applebees where it is c for a beer until  pm weekdays and the food is reasonable too  Red Lobster around the corner is great too but give B B Kings Blues Club a miss   although there is a great atmosphere it was the most expensive yet worst food and service we had  The Creamery Ice Cream Parlour across the road was fabulousBack to the hotel we had a th floor room which had great views  The room was huge with a huge bed and the housekeeping was great An excellent honeymoon due partly to this excellent hotel 
P => Couldnt say enough nice things about this hotel We stayed at the Hilton Times Square from  ember for  nights through Thanksgiving and couldnt say enough nice things about the hotel  The location is fantastic right on nd street and only steps from Broadway theatres Times Square and the subway  Our room on the rd floor was spacious with two double beds and a fantastic view of the Empire State Building  Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff and the service was outstanding  As a regular traveller for business I am often disappointed with my hotel experiences but the Hilton Times Square met and exceeded our expectations in every respect  We hope to return again for Thanksgiving in  
P => Absolutely Fabulous My stay here was from  ember through to  ember   Arriving at the back entrance on st Street at pm was a bit off putting but as soon as I entered the lobby then took the extremely fast lift  floors to the reception all my fears dissapeared  My room was spacious clean had everything you could want or need including iron and iron board for the girls Staff were helpful and courteous room service was fab  The location of the hotel is spectacular right on nd Street with a  second stroll to Broadway and the subway so your never far from anything  Although the area remains busy until the early hours I never heard a sound from my th floor room and as a first time visitor to New York travelling on my own Ive never felt safer  Couldnt recommend this hotel hightly enought and cant wait to go back 
P => Great but not excellent We stayed here for  nights from the th of ember and the location of this hotel really is fabulous as are the rooms The rooms really are the biggest Ive seen particularly in the heart of the city and we were lucky enough to have a room with corner windows which let in lots of light and meant we had a wonderful view of both the Hudson and Times Square  Lots of storage and the bathroom was also lovely  However what I did feel let this hotel down was the restaurant and bar facilities  Fair enough when you go to New York youre not likely to be eating and drinking in your hotel when there are so many other fabulous places to be but when youve had a long transatlantic flight such as we did you just really fancy some room service I found their offerings quite limited  This was also typical of the buffet breakfast  Seating in the lobby area was also on the minimal side in addition to the bar area  However this is a fabulous hotel the staff on the front desk are extremely curteous and although youre right in the middle of everything dont worry about the noise  its not even an issue when staying here 
P => Oasis in Midtown We have stayed at the Hilton Times Square for three nights in ember  and have only the highest praise for it  The rooms are spacious compared to other New York hotels of the same category and the view from the room was just breathtaking  The service was very friendly and professional  Unfortunately we left a brand new sweater in the room when we departed and only realised when unpacking at home  Without any hope I called the hotel and very friendly Brenda from Lost and Found immediately agreed to send the found item back  So all in all an oasis in the middle of the hustle of Times Square  
P => Great Thanksgiving Stay Just returned from a stay here over the Thanksgiving holiday    nights  Very impressed with this hotel wonderful location for the sights spacious rooms super staff  Considering that its on busy nd St  this hotel is amazingly quiet  Security is excellent  If you want to be in the heart of things Id highly recommend the Hilton Times Square  
P => Loved the Hilton Times Square We had a wonderful stay at this hotel over the y th weekend  The hotel is amazing very cozy  The staff was very friendly and helpful always attentive  Our room had a fantastic view over the lower city  And we were able to watch fireworks played from  different locations through our large room window on y th evening  What a treat And it also has a great location convenient to everywhere in the city  After came back from sightseeing we were able to refresh ourselves and change dress before went to the Broadway show  Im so glad that I came across those hotel reviews at tripadvisor which helped me make the right choice  We will definitely come back to this place on our next trip to New York  
P => Perfect stay Look closely or you might miss the tiny entranceway on nd  Situated right next to the Wax Museum AMC Theatres and McDonalds youll still feel safe staying here even if the surrounding streets at night seem a little hostile  There are two security checkpoints and the rooms dont even begin until the rd floor on up so youll be far from the noise below  Front desk staff bell staff and housekeeping were all efficient and courteous  Rooms are exceptionally clean and well stocked and the turn down service includes bottles of water TV guide and chocolates  Loved the pre ordered breakfast option as well the free USA Today and Sunday NY Times the bounty of good cable channels and the usage of a robe  While the furniture was a little scuffed in spots emphasize little the or is very bright and pleasant the beds and pillows unbelievably comfortable and the blast of cool air conditioning awaiting you a welcome reprieve from the sticky stinky city air  Rooms were completely soundproof something that was a little worrisome upon finding an adjoining door in the room  The st floor facing south had a wonderful view of the lower city and Empire State Building to the left  There are multiple entrances to the Times Square subway stop both at east and west sides of the block and there are oodles of restaurants in close proximity if youre the chain restaurant type Applebees is right outside the front door and theres a Red Lobster at the end of the block  The Hilton hotels are just the best and know what theyre doing  I highly recommend this establishment

P => Small modern quiet rooms but awesome location My hubby and I took advantage of his miles for a night away from the kids  The location is amazing right in the middle of th ave shopping tons of restaurants and walking distance to many areas if u enjoy walking that is hello this is NYC The rooms r small no doubt about it but they r very modern clean and quiet  U can hear people in the hallways I have seen rooms in fancy NYC hotels that r rundown and noisy so this is bliss  The staff r very nice  There is parking at a indoor lot right side on th between th and th ave which u can get a discount from staying at the hotel  
P => just OK For the price it is hard to beat the location of this hotel  The rooms are the smallest I have ever had in the city amp I have stayed at many places  It is clean it is quiet and it is very convenient  
P => Good Enough Small hotel   rooms per floor  smallest hotel room I have ever been in  the king bed took up most of the space  we were there for only one night so it did not matter  the room was cleanpicked the hotel for the location  near the show we were seeing and the restaurant we were going to  Free breakfast was adequate  very small lobby  and very busy no parking on site  
P => Unexpectedly great property I normally stay in much more upket properties than Holiday Inn Express but this time ided to take a risk on this well located and priced property and was happily surprised  The lobby and breakfast area are quite cramped but the staff is friendly and professional  Lots of choice at breakfast including yogurt pastries lots and lots of pastries which I dont eat bananas oatmeal instant pre made omelettes again not too appealing hot beverages and milk and juices  Free computers including internet and printer at the lower level the staff describes this as a quotbusiness centerquot convenient for printing your boarding pass etc  Free wifi in the hotel as well  My room was small but otherwise just about perfect very nicely and efficiently fitted room with all sorts of premium touches in room coffee maker including green tea heavy wooden hangers in the wardrobe very good lighting in the room mirror at the desk comfortable bed with very soft linens TV with lots and lots of stations including foreign language  Bathroom immaculately clean and beautifully fitted if small with great water pressure and pretty much instant hot water supply  Full array of toiletries with offer of complimentary other items if youve forgotten them and Id forgotten a razor so just picked one up at the front desk where I was also offered shaving cream which I didnt need  Only two elevators so a bit of a crush in the late afternoon but they are at least very fast once youre in them  Some noise from people in the hallway but otherwise very quiet  
P => Perfect Location for two girls on the town I took my dhter for surprise  day trip to NYC for her th birthday  I actually got reservations at the Holiday Inn Express through Priceline so it was a really good deal  We LOVED staying at this hotel  The location is absolutely perfect   right off th Avenue for sightseeing and shopping  Just the right distance between the Empire State and Central Park  Really close to all the subway lines  The rooms were small   arent they all in NYC   but nicely furnished clean and comfortable  The free hi speed allowed us to blog our whole trip The staff were very friendly and helpful   no city snobbery in sight We had an truly wonderful time  It was so easy to see everything and get to everything from this hotel  We could easily stop off to drop off purchases or change clothes between activities  I would stay here from now on if I ever travel to the NYC again unless of course I win the lottery and can afford The Plaza  
P => Fantastic value Excellent location I was a first time visitor to New York and I stayed at the hotel for one week  The free breakfast which was included was very convenient  The hotel also has free internet  The hotel is very close to time square the visitor information center local bus tour companys the subway system and most Broadway theaters  It is also within walking distance of th avenue shopping the UN the Chrysler building and Grand Central station  The front desk staff were very helpful  
P => Awesome hotel would definitely stay again This hotel is in the perfect location   very close to Times Square Rockefeller Center Grand Central etc  I traveled with  college friends and we never felt unsafe in the area at any time  The staff always greeted us with a smile and were very helpful  When we asked for towels at the desk they were delivered almost immediately  There is a nice continental breakfast in the morning with more food options than most continental breakfasts Ive had  The rooms are a little on the small side but that should be expected in NYC and we were out sightseeing the majority of the time anyways  The beds were very comfortable and the room wasnt noisy  If youre interested in a nearby barpub there were about  or  very nice irish pubs in between the hotel and Times Square  If I ever go back to NYC I will definitely be staying here again  
P => Convenient to everything This hotel is in a great location for seeing many of the attractions of Manhattan  It is close to Times Square Rockefeller Center and shopping on th avenue  Other attractions are only a short subway or taxi ride away  The hotel itself is a typical HIE with clean rooms free internet and free breakfast  The only difference as noted by other reviewers is that the rooms are pretty small and the lobby area is fairly small  We did not have a problem getting a table in the morning for breakfast but the breakfast area is not as roomy as a normal HIE hotel  The staff was very helpful and friendly  Overall we found this to be a great hotel for the price and an absolutely fantastic location for our long weekend vacation away from the kids  
P => Good Value   Great Location Stayed here for one night with my dhter and a friend  The room was small as expected but completely adequate for the three of us  We were impressed with the cleanliness of the rooms and the comfort of the beds  We were on the th floor right next to the elevator but never heard noise from the elevator or the street  The breakfast was very crowded in the morning but you could use a tray to bring it up to your room  We just grabbed some juice and a danish and were on our way The best part of this hotel is the location  Just off of th Ave  for shopping a few blocks from Rockefeller Center Grand Central and Times Square We would definitely stay here again  
P => very small room and very crowded breakfast bar in the morning  The rooms are very small for the money and even though breakfast is included in the stay the breakfast area gets very crowded during morning  This is in the main lobby so you also keep bumping into travellers checking out  Overall not very impressed  
P => Fine value great location The hotel is at th Avenue and th st  There is a delistore across the street and one two doors down  We had a clean bedroom with king sized bed  The room is very small but we spent three nights so unpacked our case and put it in a corner  This is the best thing in such a small room  There is a hanging wardrobe and three large drawers as well as two nightstands desk and storage in nightstands and on top of wardrobe  You need to organize a bit to make it comfortable but we were fine  There is NO safe  There was no noise from street or outside our room but the air conditioner was noisy  The bed was very comfortable and the linens extremely good  They supply a breakfast downstairs and it is a bit cramped when busy but is adequate  During the day it makes a useful place to sit after you have checked out  Wi fi is free and fairly fast  The location is really great   walk to Times Square and most other places  Will definitely stay here again  We booked through the Holiday Inn website with no problems except they were full and our choice was a bit limited  
P => Be careful booking through Hotwire I booked through Hotwire  I indicated we were  adults  They booked us in a one bed room  The hotel never noticed that in the reservation it does say  adults  I even phoned holiday inn express to clarify this  week prior to departure  The hotel was full for  days and they brought us a sleeping bag instead of a roll in bed  Camping at this hotel yes at least for one of us  I paid more than  dollars and stayed for  days like this  I opened a case with Holiday Inn customer service  Nothing  No refunds  Same with hotwire  I am still waiting for another refund from them for another mistake  No news yet  Now I am in Boston  Hotwire and Holiday inn in the same situation  Booked in a single bed room  Fortunately there were other rooms available this time  Again Holiday Inn front desk person told me that when you get discounted rates you cant pre select your room  Thats why despite of my  phone calls before arrival the room was still single one because that is what hotwire did  times I would not use them when you are more than  adults  Period  Still    waiting for the other reund    and I dont think Holiday Inn will compense me in any way  Here you have the pictures  
P => Awful HOTEL I pre booked this hotel with  people and non smoking room  I got there and had a King Size bed and smoking room  I could not get my money back and they would not put us in a different room  Parking stated  per day but that is only for the first day and the parking is around the corner from the hotel  
P => Location location location a good value hotel that offers a bit extra  This was our first visit to New York and being unfamiliar with the area needed somewhere to stay that was value for money functional and within a reasonable walking distance of all the tourist destinations  Thankfully this was a first class choice based on the original criteria  Yes there were some blips very minor but this is to be expected as I did not expect five star service for two star costs  However all issues were always promptly sorted out by efficient staff who in the majority were courteous and polite  I would never expect or want gushing service in America especially in New York and with one or two exceptions reception staff   not the whole team   one or two individuals  most staff were fine and helpful  If you are looking for a base in New York that will not break the bank is clean comfortable and safe I would doubt that you could beat this hotel  
P => Very disappointed Customer service is very poor here No smiles and no warm greeting  Almost unhappy to see you there No wake up call recieved when asked for one  No extra pillows when asked Had to ask again the next day Asked to have sheets changed cause my friend spilt some thing on the sheet  I took the old sheets off the bed and the housekeeping made the bed with the dirty sheets They brought clean sheets after I complained and housekeeping said they would help ME make the beds The manager said the next day housekeeping said they didnt do that with the sheets So what is he calling me and my family liarsMade us feel very unwelcome   Choose some where else  I wish I had  
P => Great hotel great location great price I stayed in the Holiday Inn Express in e  with family  The hotel was in a great location and the main attrations were in a walkable distance from the hotel We arrived at the hotel earlier than the check in time and were immediately given  rooms  The rooms were a good size for a city hotel and were clean and well presented  The hotel also offered breakfast included in the price which was a good deal the breakfast was good and just what you needed before a long day sightseeing  I would also comment that the service in the hotel was very good nothing was too much trouble and the service was always with a smileI would definately reccomend this hotel as I think it was fantastic value for money and in a great location 
P => Location is great Subways are nearbyWalking distance to fifth ave n central park 
P => Awesome stay in the most awesome place   NEW YORK This hotel is really tiny and  possibly be a litlle hard to find  It is  stories tall and has the most amazing view of the city from up there  The room is small but the services you get there are simply splendid  The staff is great  It is fairly new so everything is really nice  Great gym business center and free access in your rooms if u have ur lappy  I think it is the only place you should stay at if you plan to stay very close to times square as thats is one place thousands of tourists prefer    Trust me on this one and go for it  cheers 
P => Very good Hotel Location is between th amp th ave th street  Me and my wife stayed there for a  nights  Overalle it was very nice hotel   breakfast included every morning and room cleaning every day  Rooms are small but as much as need  There is free Internet connection WiFi and LAN  Our room window was in the courtyard side and was almost quiet  Rooms had a air conditioner  There was a TV set with  programs 
P => A fantastic hotel We  adults stayed here for  nights and there was not one thing to complain about  The staff were extremely friendly helpful and knowledgeable  The breakfast every morning was a wonderful bonus   only once was it too crowded to sit get there early or take it to your room  Elly who works the breakfast area is very friendly  We were on the nd floor top and our room was at the front and it was very quiet   no noise at all  Anytime you asked for directions or suggestions from the wonderful staff at the front desk you got great answers and great directions The location is so very central to everything   Times Square and Central Park are both within walking distance as is Grand Central And yes the rooms are small   but they are extremely clean and how much time do you actually spend in your room I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone going to New York City  
P => New York City hotel We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on th between th and th ave  The location was excellent and the hotel was quiet The rooms are tiny it IS New York after all and the complimentary breakfast at all Holiday Inn Expresses leave a lot to be desired  BUT if you have safe things like cereal and yogurt it is fine  With kids it saved us a lot of money  The hotel staffespecially the desk staff are friendly and helpful  The rooms are clean  It is a functional hotel and a ent price  Not good for a romantic experience probably  But in NYC you spend little time in the room because there is so much to do  I would stay there again  Parking is near the hotel and  a day which is a bit less than most hotels  
P => Fine Mid Town Hotel The Holiday Inn Express is located on th Street and Fifth Avenue in mid town Manhattan  It is an unassuming and fine hotel that serves very well as a base while in New York City  Being centrally located you can walk to Times Square Rockefeller plaza and other notable places  I found the Rockefeller plaza subway station on th street to be the most convenient for me although you can easily also walk south three blocks to the th Ave nd St  subway station The rooms are quite small but meticulously clean with all required amenities  The bed which occupies the majority of the room is exceedingly comfortable and I had a very good night s sleep  My room on the th floor had double glazed windows so it was very quiet and I slept well  In front of the bed there is a large television with numerous cable channels  Close to the window is a small desk with a chair and tea kettle  Local calls are free  The shower is strong with hot water always available  The lobby is small crammed with dining chairs and tables and also serves as the breakfast dining area  In the mornings until am the lobby can be very crowded with people checking out and a rather long queue to the breakfast buffet  I took a couple of food items fruit yogurt and had breakfast in my room  The free breakfast buffet is upgraded and consists of fruit juices breakfast cereals bacon eggs toast muffins cream cheese milk  coffee tee etc   At the lower level of the hotel there are two free internet enabled computers with a joint laser printer  It was very handy for checking email reading restaurant reviews and printing my airline boarding pass Service at the hotel is excellent  The hotel staff is always friendly and helpful  The chamber maids do an excellent job of keeping the hotel tidy and reception is always efficient I stayed at the hotel in early il   Official rates were about  without taxes per night but I was able to book a week long stay at hotel for  without taxes per night via a non refundable internet offer that I had placed about a month prior to my arrival In sumy I had a good stay at this hotel and I recommend it  
P => Ticked all the right boxes and more Having searched through what felt like hundreds of hotels in New York we settled on the Holiday Inn Express New York City Fifth Avenue mainly because of the unbeliveable price available for our  night stay on their website at the time of booking  nights at  and  nights at only  plus tax   well we couldnt have been more happier with our choice The location of the hotel is superb   walking distance to Times Square The Rockerfeller Centre The Empire State Buliding Central Park Macys and Grand Central Station where we took the subway to the southern end of Manhatten for the ferry over to the Statue of Liberty Ellis Island and Staten Island The rooms are perfectly adequate in size people who say they are small need to remember this is New York City   all hotel rooms are small   you dont much floor space for your  dollar  We had a king bed which was really comfortable the room was exceptionally clean compared with other hotels I have stayed in   the bathroom sparkling All the staff at the Holiday Inn Express New York City Fifth Avenue are very friendly going out of thier way in some cases to make your stay enjoyable A great added bonus to this hotel and rare in New York City is the free breakfast and what a breakfast it was   cereals oats muffins bagels crossaints french and regular toast eggs yogurts fresh fruit and the all important bacon sausage patties scrambled eggs and english muffins This was buffet style in the lobby and served from  am you could either eat at the tables surrounding the buffet or take food back up to your room  There was also unlimited free tea coffee and fresh fruit left out all day and night in the lobby area In conclusion I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this hotel to anybody as it ticks all the right boxes and more   
P => Very nice stay As almost everyone have mentioned the rooms are very small and the breakfast area also  But for clean accommodation a ok breakfast and great location then look no further  Location cant be beaten my husband and I walked to all major attractions  Rockfeller was so close St Patricks Curch Time Square Empire State and so on Front desk people are excelent  congrats Natasha  you are so nice   And its very quiet even beeing so close to th Avenue no noise at all  
P => Best bargain in New York After extensive research on various travel sights and tripadvisor ided on this hotel  Chose it priily for location and value for money  As many others have mentioned yes the rooms are small the breakfast area also  But really if youre looking for clean accommodation great breakfast and location then look no further  Location cant be beaten and we practically walked to all major attractions  Save your money for shopping and eating as this is a very expensive city Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => Great Location and value for Money I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for  nights in ch with my dhter The location I found to be excellent    blocks from Times Square about mins walk   if that The rooms although small were very clean and of a good standard with very nice bathrooms and a powerful shower  There was a nice TV with a good range of channels and the free wi fi in the rooms came in very handyI found the staff to be helpful and courteous and had no problems The free breakfast was an added bonus for a New York motel and although there was not a huge range it was still well sufficient and set us up for the days shoppingWould definately recommend this hotel for a shopping trip as great value for money with all mod cons 
P => Good location   small rooms This is a nice Hotel with a very good location close to th Avenue  The Hotel have friendly staff and clean rooms  The breakfast is OK but the breakfast area is very small and there is free coff e all day  But keep in mind that the rooms are small  We were  adults and  child and the room was a little bit to small for us  With only  adults or  adult and  child the rooms would be fine  I did the reservation early with a fixed and rather high fare I assume you can get the room with a lower fare today  Alltogether a nice Hotel if you dont need space  
P => Great Location Staff were really friendly on arriving took our bags as we were early  Coffee all day and breakfast was a bonus  A short walk from Times Square and lots of other sights in a quick walk  Room was small but big enough for two adults safe area and a great pizza place a few doors down  
P => Great place Travelled to NYC for the very first time with three other friends and loved every minute of it  The hotel was extremely well kept  Added bonus was the inclusion of breakfast which set you up until lunch which should be taken in the cellar of Macys they do wonderful salads  Although the room was at the front of the hotel it was pretty quiet  Thank you to Skylar a most polite and helpful young man on the reception desk  I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to travel to New York  Centrally located very comfortable  It doesnt matter what size the rooms are you spend very little time in them as you are only using them to sleep in and freshen up so people should stopping moaning about this and go to a larger hotel  
P => Great central location Recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express New York City Fifth Avenue hotel  Was pleasantly surprised of the great location and fair price for two nights  Was able to book hotel online  Rooms are on the small side but comfortable for a short trip  Easy access to Times Square and theater district  If need to stay overnight again would certainly consider this hotel again  Rooms were generally clean and furnsihings updated  
P => Great Location Stayed in Mid ember with my wife and two teenage chilldren using Reward Points The Hotel is as the name suggets just off th Ave perfect for the Rockerfeller Centre Times Square Byrant Park Central Park  Grand Central station all in easy walking distance  The rooms are small but perfectly clean and four of us managed to stay in one room for  nights with no problems hey its New York what more can you ask I was a little worried about tables for breakfast having read other reports but this was not an issue lots of space to enjoy a tasty well stocked breakfast for free which was some saving on eating out The Hotel staff were very helpful and Friendly giving advice and being cheerful  This included all the reception staff cleaners and the Asian lady who stocked up the breakfast carts Free coffee hot water and Tea Bags were always available in reception the one occassion the coffee ran out it was soon refilled and the staff couldnt apologise more  UK Holiday Inns take note I arranged a car through reception for our return to JFK as we going onto Florida for  weeks we had lots of bags plus bags from shopping trips on th Ave so the subway was not really an option I was a little wary of hailing a cab at  AM so I paid  extra for a car which was worth it for the piece of mind and the service was very good Would definatley stay again need to start saving those Reward Points  
P => A nice hotel in the middle of NYC actions I stayed at this hotel for  nights about ten days ago  After a few days at a small budget hotel in the uppper midtwon east side I ide to spend the nd part of my NYC trip near the Time Square area so I can be closer to the theaters and all kinds of actions  Hotels in the NYC Theater District are generally priced higher and this one is no exception but I got a fantastic deal   quotstay  get  freequot so the price was unbeatableHotel premise is located on W in betwee th amp th Ave  of America  This is a great spot in town and convenient to everything including Time Square   only two short blocks away but without the hustlig bustlig of tourists coming ups and downs the street  Lots of eateries around the area and if you crave for shopping th Avenue is only less than half a block around the corner  This hotel is not big   only  to  rooms each floor throughout the entire building so there is no fancy facilitiies like gym or swimming pool on premise  Hotel receptionbreakfast area is cramped too  Its definitely a property designed for business travelers or tourists who wont spend much time inside the hotel  However rooms are in ent size by New York standard I had a room with two doube beds cozy and nicely furnished pretty much what you can expect from a typical H I  brand hotel  An armorie with a LCD TV adds a bit nice touch  Bathroom is clean spacious and is equppied with all amenities on the daily basis  The beds are incredibly comfortable  There is a little bit noise issue but really minor Hotel price also includes free in room internet acess free daily breakfast and all day free coffee and tea  For cities as expensive as NYCs these are absolutely big pluses for travelers  My hotel package included daily pizza delivered to my room but never got one  No big deal Overall this is a nicely located hotel with a lot of good features  If the price is right it can be a great hotel choice for out of towners  I will most definitely consider returning in the future  
P => Great little hotel I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express   th Avenue   from   th  The hotel was everything I expected and hoped for great location clean rooms friendly staff and a great price  I was traveling with my girlfriend so naturally I was concerned about the cleanliness of the hotel and safety of the location  The rooms were very clean and the location close to th Ave was perfect for us  No problems there  The rooms were on the small side as expected in NYC but even with the king bed taking up much of the room it offered enough space for  people  The bathroom was good size relative to the rest of the room  Most importantly the hotel served as a good quothome basequot for our stay in New York  The hotel has two computers you can use to check email along with a printer  In addition to a light breakfast each morning there was coffee tea and packets of oatmeal available all day in the lobby  Id recommend to any couples or single travelers who are staying in New York for a couple days  Not being familiar with the city I spent a lot of time trying to book the right hotel   at the right price   and couldnt have been happier with this  
P => Great location  Stayed here while the election was on  Whole area was buzzing  Fantastic location for sight seeing theatre restaurants bars etc  Room was fabulous with quality bedding and fittings very compact but great value  Immaculately cleaned and fresh towels every day  Reception staff very efficient and a ent self serve breakfast with a choice of fruit yoghurt coffee juices breads etc  Would recommend for a short budget stay  
P => Really enjoyed staying here Today    we are checking out after a two night stay  My wife and I really enjoyed this hotel  It is in a great location but the street is suprisingly quite which allowed us to sleep very well  If you are looking for an affordable hotel located near Time Square then you should check this out  This same weekend last year we stayed at the Intercontinential Barclay  The room at this Holiday Inn Express was a tad smaller but every bit as nice  In fact the bed was more comfortable and the bathroom cleaner  Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did  
P => Comfortable and ideally located hotel We found this hotel extremely comfortable during our short stay in New York  The rooms are quite small but there is plenty of space to move around store suitcase s and hang up your clothes   all you need for a city break as you spend very little time in your room  The room and bathroom are very well appointed and immaculately clean Although the breakfast area is crammed into the entrance lobby we never found this to be a problem during our stay  The continental breakfast was ample for a start to the day and we always managed to find a seat The location is perfect for a tourist to the area  You are right in the middle of it and are no more than a few blocks and walking distance from th Avenue Rockafella Centre Times Square Empire State Building and Central Park  Grand Central Station and a number of other subway stations are nearby although the subway system is a little confusing to start with If you re visiting in winter there is an ice skating rink in Bryant Park on th Avenue and nd Street which is a bit cheaper than those in Central Park and Rockafella Centre  This rink is still in a nice setting especially during an evening  
P => Excellent location and great value for money My husband and myself stayed here with my  year old mother  The location is excellent   walking distance to th Avenue Times Sqaure Grand Central Terminal Theatre district Rockefeller Centre  We had rooms on the th Floor facing the street  There was some street noise   but no enough to keep us awake  The rooms were very clean and well equipped   hairdryer iron and ironing board and a blackout blind to keep out the light  Not as small as I expected based on previous comments Whilst we did not use the the services of the hotel staff very much they were all without exception polite welcoming and super helpful   nothing was too much throuble  The breakfast is not haute cusisine but has a great selelction of food  from toast through scrambled eggs and bacon to donuts and is more than enough to set you up for the day All in all I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel and would definitely use it again  
P => ent Place Check in was fast and friendly  The room was very small smelled a bit stuffy and facing the back of the building which when opening the window we got a terribly greasy odor  However the air conditioning did solve that problem  The Italian tour group staying at the hotel took over the breakfast room so we skipped the free breakfast  No worries tons of great placed to eat within minutes  Loved the convenient location  All in all a ent place to stay in downtown Manhattan  
P => Great Location We chose this Holiday Inn mainly because of the ideal location  Our room had two double beds and was on the rd floor facing the street  The windows that face the street do not have room darkening drapes so the street lights gave the effect of having night lights on all night  Our room was clean and comfortable  And the breakfast in the morning was great  They keep fresh hot coffee flowing in the lobby all day and evening which was terrific The only down side for us was the small size of the room  With two double beds there was only a tiny amount of room to move in the middle of and around the foot of each bed  We were only staying for one night so we could easily deal with it but would not want a room this size if staying longer  
P => A good place to stay My husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express th Avenue for  nights at the beginning of ober  The hotel is in a fantastic location and its only a few blocks from eg Times Square Bryant Park New York Public Library etc The hotel is not very wide so you only get approx  rooms per floor  We stayed on the th floor I think there are  and couldnt hear much of the traffic on th Street apart from police sirens etc The staff were very friendly and helpful  We managed to get a seat at breakfast every day and the food is of an acceptable standard with both hot and cold food The bedrooms arent very big by US standards however they were big enough they were about the same size as UK hotel rooms I would thoroughly recommend the Holiday Inn and would stay there again  
P => Small  Rooms are small breakfast is very crowded its expensive  However the hotel is clean and staff are helpful  Its a great location and probably the best you can find for the price  I will go back again  
P => Make sure you dont end up on the executive level aka basement The title pretty much says it all  The basement is noisy   computer outside rooms which can be used at any time day or night which made me feel unsafe and the emergency exit is labeled employees only  Ive stayed at this location before   once before in the basement which is how I knew to request that I not stay in the basement this time  Unfortunately when I checked in there was no record of my request despite the fact that I called directly  Prior to this visit I didnt have a problem with this motel   its clean easy and has a great location  However this time the staff was not helpful and I was promised a call from the manager to discuss my issues and was never contacted  Bottom line Id say this place is fine if they honored committments made during the reservation process  
P => GREAT stay Very clean Stayed at the Holiday inn Express Fifth Avenue in NYC the last week of ust  I had never been to NYC and had no idea about where to stay  I booked this hotel based on the reviews from this website  I was looking for something affordable and clean  This hotel did not disappoint the rooms we stayed in were EXTREMELY clean  The hotel is located about half a block off th Ave Times Square is about  blocks to the east  The area we were in felt safe and we were comfortable walking around at night  The hotel is within walking distance of several attractions including Times Square and all the broadway shows Rockefeller Center Grand Central Station St  Patricks Cathedral etc  The complimentary full breakfast at the hotel was great  The only problem with the breakfast area was that it was small and tables filled up fast  If you want a place to sit I would say you would need to be down there before  AM  We ended up taking our breakfast up to our room most of the time but that was not much of an inconvenience for us  The lobby area is small and gets easily congested but this was not a major problem either  The other reviews about this hotel are correct when they say that the rooms are small there is not much room to move around  The corner room I stayed in was smaller than one next door that other family members stayed in  However we were really in our rooms only to sleep and the small aspect really didnt bother me much  The flat screen TVs are nice and there are LOTS of channels  The free wireless internet access is a huge bonus as well  I guess there is a office workstation area in the hotel but I never went there  The front desk staff was very nice and they were helpful  They quickly got us a cab the morning we left  Just an FYI the cab they got for us was not a yellow cab and was instead a private car service which was a little more expensive  But this was better than trying to hail a cab on a main avenue in the pouring rain at AM  If you are looking for a hotel with nostalgia I would look for a different place to stay  But if you are looking for a hotel with a great price location friendly serviceand more than adequate amenities then this is the place for you 
P => Tiny rooms but great location You dont stay in the Holiday Inn Express in New York if you want a large room or a spacious breakfast area  But its got location location location   on th West between fifth avenue and avenue of the americas with central park a ten minute walk away and radio city and the rockefeller centre a few minutes on foot too  Grand central station is a couple of blocks away and the excellent italian restaurant Resette is just next door  The rooms have free wireless internet access and a huge range of cable channels but they are very small  USA Today is free every morning  The breakfast room is chaotic at peak times with too many people trying to crowd into a very small space  But hot breakfast was included in the rate so I wasnt complaining  The staff were friendly   Jasmine on reception had a very cheery positive attitude when I checked in at midnight after  hours on a plane  So all in all a good experience 
P => Great location My wife and I attended the Fancy Food Show and we stayed at this hotel for  days  Pretty good place to stay  LocationHotel is very centrally located  Close to everything    th Avenue shopping center St  Patricks Cathedral Central Park Broadway theatres Times Square  StaffVery helpful and accomodating  Too bad I didnt get their names to thank them but theyre all nice Cleanliness Rooms are clean and since this is a pretty new hotel the bathrooms and furnishings are pretty new Room SizeEnough for myself my wife and my dhter  New York is not known for large hotel rooms anyway  Extra stuffBreakfast is free and they have scrambled eggs bacon and sausage danish pastry juice amp coffeee  Very basic but sufficient  I figure Im saving   day for breakfast  Great to have free wi fi as well I stayed at the New Yorker Hotel before and Id definitely pick Holiday Inn Express over the New Yorker hotel Would recommend it to others  However Id probably stay at another hotel next time just for a change  
P => Just wonderful I reserved a room in this hotel for  nights for myself my wife and our two young teen kids  The rooms are small but typical for NYC I think  It was very clean and nice and the shower was wonderful  That along with flatscreen cable TV was all we needed  The hotel staff was wonderfulespecially Skylar at the front desk  always helpful and friendly and got us a great SUV to haul us out to the airport We stayed on floor  and it was peaceful  The location was great as we could walk the three blocks to Times Square for food and fun and get to the subway easily as well  I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Little Gem We booked the hotel through British airways as a deal  We had looked at reveiws and most seemed good  The hotel is tucked away and appears to be a recent new build or recently reated  Firdt thoughts was that the reception is basic and small but acceptable  We checked in fairly quickly and the staff were very freindly  The bell boy brought the bags to the room which was good for such a basic hotel expect to tip  The rooms are quite small but thats standard in new york  They are clean and fairly new  Bathrooms are clean and small but more than adequate with complimentry toiletries The lifts are fairly slow so expect a min wait in busy periods  The breakfast in the morn was unexpected but very nice  They had everything to set you up for the day the only complaint would be the small eating area and the cold drht fromthe main street as the automatic doors were always open  Most of the time we took a tray with breafast back to our rooms The hotel staff were really helpfull and the concierge were always there to help with booking trip etc  They organised a limo style car to pick us up from the airport which was only  more than a taxi and well worth the extra  Overall i would definatley recommend this hotel and would return in a heartbeat 
P => Very nice New York hotel Very nice hotel  Good location but if you need evening life   choose other place   Chealsia Soho or Grenvichvillage cose everithing closed after  p m    cafe and restrans  Rooms are small but nice and clean  We choosed this hotel about good location and cose its new   everithing is fresh  
P => Super location nice helpful staff We traveled to NYC for a long weekend  We wanted a central location and have easy access to everything  This hotel fit the bill  The price was not to excessive especially since we would only sleep there  It was clean and comfortable and the AC felt great since it was a hot spell in NY    each day The rooms ere very small with full beds so if you need  to a bed you better be friendly They were comfortable though  We were on the th floor and didnt hear any of the noise from the street  The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly  Skylar and Carmelo were exceptional and always willing to help out with directions and recommendations  There were plenty of places to eat near by  The continental breakfast was good  Better than most  Plenty of selection  I would definitely stay again and I have already recommended it to a friend  
P => BEST LOCATION Just returned from  nights at this Hotel I have never been to New York   but this is a great location Room is small but very clean and the bed was lovely and soft Breakfast was great and saved time Would definateley stay here again You can walk anywhere fron this location  
P => Great hotel for the price This is a great hotel for the price  The location on th street between Fifth and Sixth ave  is excellent  near Times Square and Grand Central Terminal  It is a very safe area  The desk clerks were very pleasant and helpful  This is not a posh hotel  dont expect lots of pampering  The hotel is fairly new and the beds comfortable with lots of pillows  The rooms are small but serviceable with a large flat screen TV  Breakfast is included and it was substantial  Coffee is available for free all day and night  which was nice  There are lots of restaurants within walking distance  There was no room service but some area places will deliver to the hotel One caveat  when we checked out the doorman offered to get us a cab  He led us to a black sedan  not a yellow cab  I asked the price The price to LaGuardia was   I refused  A yellow cab costs   plus tip on a Sunday morning  a substantial difference  I would stay here again  this is a good place If you would rather spend money on shows than hotel rooms  
P => Small and Functional I was in NYC for business and stayed at the Holiday Inn Express  Conveniently located close to Grand Central and nd st stations and Fith Ave  Hotel staff was nice and accommodating  I had an urgent request to which they responded immediately Rooms are a bit small even by NY standards but I was only there to sleep  Although the prices are slightly steep for a hotel in this class I would highly recommend it for for its no nonsense no frills offering  With free wifi and free breakfast I saw no reason to complain about anything  
P => Pleasant Hotel Great Location Friendly Staff After waiting an hour over check in time we were taken to our rooms  The room is fairly small but with very comfortable beds  If you have more than one piece of luggage good luck finding somewhere to put it  There is one small rack that will fit one suitcase  Your only other option is the desk  There is no view but we were just there to sleep and take occasional breaks  The staff is very friendly and accomodating  Overall it was a good experience with an excellent location  Breakfast was good but a small crowded lobby  
P => Great location and very clean We loved the location  If it is your first trip to New York then this is the place to be  The front desk was helpful and it is SO central it is unbelievable  We are headed back for our second trip their this summer and we will pick this hotel again  
P => BETTER THAN EXPECTED Wow Awesome location Affordable price Clean room and very friendly staff The young lady at the desk Solange had a very warm and welcoming personality  I have NO complaints about this hotel   blocks to Rockefeller in one direction and  blocks to Times Square in the other direction  We parked behind the hotel on th in the garage for  reduced price for hotel guests  We arrived before check in and they kept our bags for free until check in and kept our backs after check out so we could walk around until it was time to pick up our vehicle  I will stay at this hotel every single visit back to NYC and will and have already recommended it to friends and family  
P => Very comfortable hotel  Hotel was great location  Very effective air con it was hot and humid in NYC at the time  Slept really well didnt want to leave the room at times  LCD TV with hundreds of channels good size room  Clean bathroom Very friendly staff  Pleasant and tasty free breakfast in morning   mins walk to Times Square seconds from th Avenue What more could you wantWell recommend this hotel to anyone Tom GriffithsUnited Kingdom 
P => Great location very central There is no doubt that ent NY hotel prices are excessive but we feel we got a good deal for our  day trip to NY  The location is perfect very central and easy to get to I would say this HI Express provides above average accommodation and an excellent buffet breakfast for a reasonable price  The only downside was the inadequacy in size of the entrance foyer breakfast area  Space at reception was only around  metres in width so customers at the desk were jostled by others coming in and out of the establishment When breakfast was not being served you could by pass reception around the dividing screen  But this was also the area where groups arriving or waiting for transport had to wait The room was fine  Two queen size beds nice spacious layout and a good bathroom all very clean  The view out of the window was just as seen in old movies 
P => Excellent stay and great value The hotel is very clean rooms feel new staff is courteous and very helpful and friendly  I suppose the rooms are small but what do you expect for  a night in Times Square You really cannot beat the location  I would highly recommend  
P => Heres why I rated it as I did     If you read through the various reviews on this hotel youll get a pretty accurate picture of the good and the bad  However one persons excellent is anothers average  Heres why I rated it as I did Staff   Very curteous and helpfull always responded to our needs   a quotquotRooms   Very clean and functional  Very small but youre not in New York for the room if you stay here  On its own   quotquot becasue its NYC quotquot Breakfast   Its free quotquot well stocked quotquot very busy in the morning with little room quotquot  Ran out of items because of the crowd quotquot Location   Not on Broadway but very close  quotquotView   We were on the backside of the hotel th floor  Nothing to see but buildings quotquot Overall a quotquot because the things we really wanted and needed out of the hotel   good staff free breakfast good location outweighted everything else  To call this a quotquot is similar to grade inflation  The property is not bad and Id stay there again in a heartbeat  However if I wanted something with more space amenities etc  Id need to look elsewhere  Knowowhat you want before you book here  If you plan to spend time in the room and want to be pampered  Pull out the wallet and spend more by staying someplace else  
P => smokey rooms We just returned  I agree with other reviews The hotel is well located and clean The rooms are very small even for New York  We asked for a no smoking room but were told the hotel was full and the only rooms were smoking  The room stunk The breakfast was better than expected but the area was packed every morning and they seem to always run out of some items  I would stay here again but only if they promised a no smoking room and the price was right  
P => Wonderful Hotel and Location My husband and I just stayed here and it was wonderful  The location couldnt be better  The members of staff were friendly and helpful  They always greeted us as we came back to the hotel or left to go out and always did whatever they could to answer a question or honor a request Our room was small but this is New York City  Our view was of an office building next door  But the room itself was great  The bed was very comfortable the new flat screen TV was great and had a lot of channels  Also the wireless internet worked great on our iPod Touch  The bathroom was a bit small but I expected that  However it was a nicely orated bathroom with great towels There is a business center in the lower level of the hotel with  computers  There is a printer available however I did not use it The complimentary breakfast looked great but we did not eat there  It was very crowded each day we were there so we had breakfast at a ket a couple of doors down great omlettes for a great price The front desk did add a nice touch for us since Im a Priority Club member and used points for this stay  They had  bottles of water and a little package of Pepperidge Farm cookies with a Thank You note on the desk  It just goes to show that a thoughtful gesture goes a long way with a customer My only complaint about this hotel is that there is no in room safe and the front desk staff told me that they did not have a safety deposit box available that could be used for a laptop computer  It seems silly to have complimentary wifi but no safe available to secure the computer I will definitely stay in this hotel in the future  And I will recommend it to friends  The staff did an excellent job  
P => Nothing More You Can Ask For Was staying at the HIE th Aven with my mum for  nights in early il  We only had  days to tour around New York and so really needed a hotel centrally located to Times Sq and the other tourist spots but one which didnt cost an arm and a legWe payed slightly over  for the three nights and to sum it all up   it was worth the money Great Location Just a   min walk to Times Sq  which is where most of the tour busses operate from to get you to the Empire state building Battery Park ferries to Statue of Liberty depart from here and all the other spots Walking distance to Macys and the Empire State building but we took a taxi because it was rainingThere are several places to eat next to the hotel   an Indian Vegetarian restaurant next door a burgur bar  doors away and a sandwich bargrocery store infront of the hotel  Just note that most of these places close at around   pm   which I think coming from London is very early The room The rooms are small   but not tiny  Me and my mom had  peices of medium to large luggage between us and we still had place to move around in the room   and think about it you arent going to spend a lot of time in the room anyway being in New York  The bed was very comfortable and there was a choice of two soft pillows and  firm pillows We had a room with one double bed   I like to go for  twins but the hotel was going to charge me extra The room also has a lap top table with a cushion stuck on the bottom so you can work on your laptop in bed   GREATThe bathroom was mainly ble orated   nice fluffy towels little hand and face towels too  A tub with a shower Breakfast and the Lobby Breakfast with several hot options in a tarriff like this one was great  Loved the scrambled eggs and bacon  Loved the muffins and crossaints  They also provide breads juices cereal boiled eggs yoghurts and the famous cinnamon rolls which I found too sweet and too greasyThe only downside is the lobby   which also is the breakfast area   its too small and gets overcrowded Front desk Very helpful staff helped us with directions kept our luggage for several hours before our flight  Hailed us taxis several timesIn sumy   A great hotel clean rooms great breakfast great staff great location and WELL WORTH YOUR MONEY Will definately stay here again 
P => much better than expected  will definitely return ASAP   Just returned from a spring break trip to NYC  Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express at th and th The hotel was great in every aspect  From check in to check out everything was smooth  When I addressed any need to the front desk it was handled right then  no waiting  From baggage storage need for toothpaste baggage retrieval and assistance with a cab  it was immediateThe rooms were very nice though small  The overall coziness though led us to stay in the room more than usual  we skipped getting show tix for Sunday PM in favor of watching TV  The variety of channels was excellent  The bedslinens are so comfy  The location is the best subways close by A good variety is offered at the complimentary breakfast  Also there is free internet service in the lower lobby  Ice machines on several floors No room service but plenty of dining choices within a block Also close to Rock Ctr  AND the Red Flame Diner is one street down on th  Cant wait to return  
P => Beware of the Parking The hotel was perfectly located at th off Fifth  We had a quiet room with a King bed on the th floor no view though  The bathroom was pristine and mostly ble  The mattress was comfortable and the linens and furnishings were clean  The hotel is only a little over a year old and it feels new  It is small but in NY most rooms under  are small  If I have a King bed flat screen TV and spotless bathroom Im happy  The free breakfast was good enough with excellent croisants but weak coffee  We were able to leave our bags when our room wasnt ready early at no charge Now the reason Im taking the time to write  BEWARE OF THE PARKING  We used the suggested lot behind the hotel on th street  We checked in the car at   We went to pick it up at  the next afternoon  We were charged   The cost per day is  plus tax which we knew  What we didnt know is that if you go over  hours you are charged for an additional full day  When we had our parking ticket validated at the desk we should have been told this  We would have moved the car to an hourly lot  When we tried to complain at the lot no one could speak English and we couldnt get the car without interacting with a credit card machine on the wall We had wrongly trusted that this was a good place to park 
P => Clean and Friendly We stayed for a week at this hotel  The more you shop the less room you have and there isnt much to begin with Very small tiny rooms but very clean also  Little room for hanging clothes especially if you have winter jackets  The breakfast is brought in and microwaved sausage muffins scrambled eggs round baconcinnamon buns toast cereal juice and usually bananas and oranges  If you are lucky enough to find an empty table to sit at bring a sweater  It is very cold in the lobby where you eat Food really cools quickly  Also many people linger on after eating reading maps etc  so tables are rare  Management should post a sign asking guests to leave once they are done eating in order to free up tables  It is convenient though nice not having to get dressed up for the day and leave your hotel before you have something in your belly  Coffee throughout the day is an added touch  Staff is very friendly everyone we met always had a nice hello or can we help you  No problems with the elevators or water pressure  Rooms were always cleaned when we returned from an outing with plenty of fresh towels  Very good location  Walking distance to all the major attractions Times Square Rockefeller Shopping etc  We also walked to Empire State Building and Pier  for harbor Cruise which we strongly recommend Food is everywhere cheap or expensive whatever you prefer  Free internet and two computers for guests to use  hrs  is great  Not everyone has a lap top to lug around We would definitely return to this hotel although another trip to New York isnt likely in the near future  Were thinking Paris 
P => very impressed all around This hotel was an all around quotwinnerquot in my eyes      I really cant think of anything to negatively criticize it on The location is really great just a block or two East of the craziness that is Times Square Broadway The hotel was clean and very presentable on the outside and in Check in was great      simple quick and pleasant  The elevator was fairly high speed so it didnt take much time to get to the top floor where our room was Our room had two double beds and was very spacious especially considering were in NY  There was a nice desk work space and a conveniently large dresser and closet  The beds were very comfortable and all linens and or was attractive amp up to date  The washroom was clean large enough had ample water pressure and an eco friendly low flow toilet to save water and reduce some of the flushing noise By being in and out of the hotel semi often I enountered a number of staff members and they were all very nice amp personable Perhaps the highlight although the entire hotel amp stay was great of the stay is the warm express start breakfast in the morning  Very delicious food as much as you can eat and good quality  From eggs bacon and sausage to muffins cinnamon buns and yogurt    as well as all beverages Checking out was a breeze as well and left a great impression on me  I would definitely return here and recommend this place to friends and family  
P => Great hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for  nights in ch  I picked it after reading good reviews and would highly reccommend it  Its ideally situated as its a five minute walk from times square and close to the subways  I felt very safe in the vacinity of the hotel Our room was on the inside of the hotel and our view was of offices and not very exciting  But I certainly didnt spend much time in the room looking out of my windowI found the hotel very clean the staff were helpful and the room although not huge was perfect for our needs The bonus is the breakfast that is provided free  I found that lots of hotels dont do breakfasts as new yorkers eat out  We saved a lot of money that we would have spent on breakfasts If I ever return to New York I will definitely stay here again  
P => Fantastic Hotel   Perfect Location We visited New York for a week at the beginning of ch  and booked this hotel after reading the good reviews on Tripadvisor and we are extremely glad we did We were so impressed with this hotel and have already recommended it to everyone we know who  travel to New York  It is ideally located for all the sights we couldnt believe just how close to Times Square we were Our room was comfortable and was cleaned every day with fresh towels and bedding  There is a complimentary breakfast each morning with lots of choice  There is free wifi access and the hotel provides two computers with free online access for all its guests to use which came in very handy for keeping in touch with people at home via email The staff are extremely polite and very helpful and approachable  They organised a taxi for us to the airport for our journey home All this at a very affordable price per night  If we were to return we wouldnt hesitate to stay here again  
P => One bedroom suites are good We stayed in a one bedroom suite at the Holiday Inn Express th Avenue and found having a arate living area with sofa bed excellent  The bathroom was small but functional  The room was at the back of the hotel so quiet   which is unusual in NY  As other reviews comment you cannot beat the location   and especially if you are in NY in winter you will be pleased that so much is within easy walking distance  The breakfasts in the lobby are bountiful and prepared by staff who take care  We would highly recommend staying at this hotel if visiting NY for a few days   as you will make the most of every day 
P => Great accommodation great location highly recommended My boyfriend and I chose this hotel based on the reviews it had got here on Trip Advisor from all the hotels we had read reviews for this always seemed to have far more good reviews then bad  We went for a  night stay over Valentines and booked our trip through BA com  This hotel and accommodation is very good value for money its location is fantastic The rooms were clean tidy and were cleaned and had fresh linen every day  The lobby for breakfast was small and we didnt use it as there are two Starbucks within  mins from the hotel which we chose to use The location is unbeatable its mins from Times Square Rockafellar Plaza Radio City Music Hall Grand Central Terminal Empire State Building to name but a few  The only time we used the subway was to go to Brooklyn so we could walk back across the bridge  We walked to Central Park from the hotel also and that took about   mins but its a fab walk along Fifth Ave past all the fab shops and you dont even notice the time If you are not fussed about having  star luxury and want a hotel that is good value for money clean tidy comfortable friendly and mins away from all the sights then I would recommend this hotel with no hesitation  
P => Great Hotel for location and clean rooms This hotel is in a great location just off th ave and  blocks from time square  The hotel is very clean and tidy and the breakfast is great although not alot of space to eat  Staff were friendly and attentive  Rooms were very clean and not as small as I thought they would be  
P => Good location no problems The th Ave  HIE is a perfectly ent midpriced property on th just off th Ave  walking distance from Times Square and Rockefeller Center  The small front desk was always busy when I was there and check in took a few minutes  At first I was told that my room wasnt ready at  PM but they went back double checked and found one  Friendly clerks no mention of PL Youll most likely need to use an elevator to and fro  There are two of them and they work pretty quickly The room layout  was a little eccentric   when I opened the door it seemed like I was going straight into the bathroom  Only when I opened the door all the way did I see my way into the bedroom which is compact but not too claustrophobic  The bed was softer than I usually get in hotels but I slept just fine  The TV had a zillion channels and I had to examine the guide pretty closely to find the one that matters to me The Weather Channel  as I recall  The other things you expect at this comfort level   coffeemaker iron hair dryer alarm   were all there  Ice machines are on floors   amp  You might want to check to locations of the light switches on walls and lamps before you go out because it took me some stumbling about to find them in the dark after returning from an evening out The free continental breakfast is downstairs   AM  In addition to the usual they have prefab cheese omelets which actually arent bad  One table is always available because its right next to that sliding front door and gets all the drafts so dress appropriately Theres a business center with two computers in the basement but no exercise room  
P => Not bad for Manhattan I have to class this hotel as the least worst hotel I have stayed in in Manhattan  Its not cheap at just under  but then nothing is in Manhattan  The location is excellent just off th Avenue and within walking distance of many sights and activities  The rooms are small but adequate and as you would expect from this chain theres no charm anywhere in the hotel  However all the functionality you need in the room is there  I was fortunately on the top floor and could see the sky from my window  The bathroom had a large shower though on one day in my stay they had a problem with hot water Breakfast is included in the room rate and is served in the lobby  Again its functional requiring minimal service but it was fine with me  The free WiFi worked fine throughout the hotel and theres a small self service business centre in the basement  Staff were pleasant and helpful  
P => Super clean Ideal location Friendly staff The Holiday Inn Express Fifth Avenue has the perfect location at a moderate to low price  We had a wonderful experience there and would be more than happy to return I should say first that this is not the right hotel for everyone so I will explain the drawbacks  In my opinion they are too minor to matter  The rooms are small  no larger than a good sized bedroom in a private home  The shower is even tinier  There is no fitness room  Guests can use a gym around the corner but it costs   And as other reviews have mentioned there is virtually no lobby  But the Holiday Inn Express is great on the important things  For starters it is absolutely clean  If you know New York City hotels thats not always the case in this price range  And the staff was helpful and friendly  In New York thats not always the case at ANY price range    Breakfast is included and it is real food  There are Items like eggs sausage and french toast along with the typical cerealtoastjuicecoffee  I do wish they had better bagels  After all this is New York  A free computer and printer is available for guest use Most of all there is the location which simply could not be improved  It is about mid way between Grand Central Station  blocks south and Times Square  blocks west  It is far enough from Times Square to be out of the noise and congestion but it is literally less than a  minute walk to Broadway shows  Fifth Avenue is steps away so the shops are also very close  If your idea of a good New York hotel means a uniformed doorman concierge services and a grand lobby like you see in old movies this Holiday Inn Express is not for you  But you wont go wrong here if you are looking for clean rooms well managed staff reasonable price and an ideal location  Id stay here again in a heartbeat  
P => Modern  I booked direct with intercontinental which probably wasnt the stest but i had to book in a hurry  I wanted somewhere close to times sq and a name brand hotel  The hotel itself is hidden away just off th ave  In sumyGood points Great location can be quite expensive and for the same money you could stay at higher star rated hotels but i guess they charge what they charge as its a newly refurbished hotel  Rooms are modern LCD tv etc nice shower quick elevators Staff ar every friendly as you would expect form an holiday inn  Breakfast was a nice variety of fruitpastriescerial Bad pointsits only a small thing but breakfast time gets quite cold down in the lobby as its only a small lobby with big doors and when someone comes in and out you do feel the cold 
P => Great Location We stayed at this hotel for  nights         The location is fantastic  esasy walk to Theatre District Time Square The Rock Grand Central Station  The breakfast is fantastic  lots of selection  The Hotel rooms are very small but extremely clean  We booked one night through Priority Points and paid for the other night  quite reasonable for the holiday period    Staff extremely helpful  
P => great staff and location My Wife and I stayed in NYC for a week in ember to enjoy the broadway shows great restaurants and the shopping  We choose the Express By Holiday Inn due to location close to Broadway and Times Squareand price its cheap compared to some other hotels in the Times Square area  The Rooms are a ent size for NYC standards and are very clean  towels and bedding are spotless and changed whenever you want  A Tea and coffee making machine is most welcome in the room  The staff are very friendly and helpful  A complimentary buffet continental breakfast is served from am to  am everymorning in the lobby if its too busy to get seats then theyll supply a tray to take anything you wish upto your room    never actually happended to us   but it was sometimes busy the quality of the breakfast is very good yogurt fruit cereals toast cinnamon bunsbagelsmuffins with tea and coffee  We both enjoyed our stay in the Express By Holiday Inn and will probably book again next time we are in NYC  
P => Great Central Location Stayed here from  to  with my wife and two children  aged  amp   Had rooms next door to each other  king size bed  doubles  All bedding towels and rooms in general were spotlessly clean  Rooms fairly quiet at night   very little street noise  Beds very comfortable  Breakfast of cereals pastries fruit juice fruit coffee plentifull  Staff very frendly and helpfull  Great location   easy walking distance to Times Square   mins Great Central Station    minsEmpire State    mins Rockafeller Centre    mins  Would definetley recomend stay here again  Try it   you will not go wrong 
P => Nice Hotel Stayed here with mother aunt sister and cousin for our annual girls shopping trip to NY from     ember    This is the first time we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and would definitely recommend it  The rooms were small but most of them are in NY  It was very clean and the staff was so friendly  We arrived early and stowed our bags with no problem and they had rooms waiting for us on our return later in the day  Have stayed at other hotels and this was not the case  I really liked the fact that they dont use bedspreads which made it feel cleaner  It also appeared that there were only six rooms on each floor and it was very quiet  The elevators were fast and ample size Deli across the street for pop pizza and very convenient to Fifth Ave and Times Square Would definitely stay here again  
P => Brilliant Location Stayed here at the end of ember with a group of   The location is superb and better than anywhere I have previously stayed in New York  The rooms are small but so are most in New York  Everything was spotlessly clean and the staff were all friendly and so helpful  We didnt intend taking the breakfast buffet but it was so good we ate there every day  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone  
P => ent hotel with a perfect location I have mostly good things to say about the hotel that I found to be great place to stay with small but nice and clean rooms  The location is almost unbeatable  The bad about this hotel is that being a part of Holiday Inn family it lacks any form of CHARM  It is not the kind of place I would select for a romantic holiday with my girlfriend  But if you just need a good place to stay for the nights the HIE could not be a better choice 
P => Our Stay at the Holiday Inn Express My husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express th Ave the weekend of ober th  The front desk staff was efficient and pleasant  The hotel is small   the rooms small but what they lack in space they make up for in comfort and cleanliness   from the bedding to the bathroom  The hotel is just a few blocks from time squrebroadway to the right and two blocks from the shopping district th Ave Madison Ave Park Ave  to the left so the location was perfect This hotel has is a NO FRILLS hotel but if you want a NICE place to say while seeing the city   ITs Perfect 
P => Excellent place to stay Booked this as a flighthotel package on Priceline  Couldnt have got a better deal  Great location as all previous reviewers have stated fresh continental breakfast incl and free wifi in all areas  Rooms very clean and neat   BEWARE though Despite pre paying through priceline the hotel have charged me again for the room they routinely swipe cards on checkin for incidentalsand I am trying to get a refund of just short of  They agreed it was an error and will rectify BUT suggest it  take up to  days    Other than that I will recommend the hotel as great  All the staff   reception breakfast lady cleaners bellboys are very smiley and friendly  
P => Wonderful Hotel    Wonderful hotel that is all we needed for a trip to The Big Apple This hotel had friendly staff and clean REALLY clean rooms  Yes the room was small but so is all of the other rooms unless you have an endless bank account to splur on the MORE expensive hotels  There is a beautiful bathroom that gives a shower or bath  The king sized bed was absolutely wonderful  The air was great after a long day of sight seeing and shopping  The breakfast bar is great  The negative is that there is little room to sit down  Whats a little standing I think we go the best hotel in the area  It is right around the block from Times Square all the Broadway shows and plenty of shopping  There is no view from any of the windows  The pictures that you view here or on the candid photos doesnt do the room justice  I wouldnt bring kids but is great for two 
P => Super The Holiday Inn Express is in a great location right in the middle of everything and a short walk or subway ride to wherever you  want to go  The staff was super helpful and whenever we asked for additional towels etc  they were at our room within minutes  Yes the room is small to say the least but the beds were comfortable and who goes to NYC to stay in the room all day I have nothing bad to say about the hotel it was clean great location and the staff was great 
P => Great Little Hotel Excellent clean Hotel  Location is very very good especially if you havnt been to NYC before  You walk around the corner and you are on th Av shortwalk to Empire State Rockerfellor St Pats Central Park Times Square Hells kitchen  Breakfast included rooms are clean excellent cable  Very good value  Tip tehre is a deli bottle shop pizza place across the road perfect for snacks or a cheap meal  The pizzas there are awesome  
P => Good hotel for an average price This hotel is located only  blocks from the nearest subway so I thought the location was good considering other hotels  The price was highly overpriced for such a small room I say small because I am comparing it to other hotels in NYC that I have previously stayed at  The breakfast area was ALWAYS crowded and it was hard to find an open table each day  We were only there for  nights and there was only  day that there was a free table for the three of us at breakfast time  We were usually at breakfast around am and considering the breakfast is only served from  am you would have thought it wouldnt have been that busy  This hotel only has about  rooms be  so it isnt that big  It the morning the normal wait for the elevator was  minutes so we ususally took the stairs to our th floor room  They only had  computer in the lower level and it was being used   of the time  Probably because it gave you free internet usage and a printer to use also  The rooms were very clean upon check in and the maids were more than generous if you needed extra towels shampoo soap etc  Overall I think its a good hotel if you are in NYC just for shopping or sightseeing but personally I wont stay here again  
P => Clean  This hotel was in the perfect location   close to many NYC attractions  The hotel was very clean and brand new  It was nicely orated with flat screen TVs in each room  Because of the quality value and location I wouldnt stay anywhere else in New York  
P => Worth the low price We checked into the hotel Monday morning with  bags in tow  They kindly held otur bags for us until check in time without hesitation  My mother requested a view but the clerk explained no rooms really have a view due to the fact the building is not as tall as others only  floors  So dont expect to look out and see Times Square or anything  The rooms are TINY Its NYC and we got a steal so we anticipated that  Still the beds are extremely comfortable which is the only time you should plan spending in the room during your stay All in all you cant beat the price for the location  Times Square is  blocks away  Make a right out the door and look over to your right at the end of the street and theres Radio City  The location is fantastic and anything that is not close there are plenty of Subway stations nearby As for eating if you are also eating on a budget look no further than your street  doors down has wonderful Paninis for about   Cafe Manhattan  doors down has an awesome selection  Milk and Honey across the street run by a Rabbi has fantastic bagels and unique pizzas  There is also a convenience type store across the street  
P => liked the Holiday My husband got there for a business trip since its NYC I tagged along  Initially we had a problem  we requested a crib and there was none the matter was solve in  minutes  The hotel is in the garnment district  Since now everything is made in China a large number of building are in reation The hotel is new and clean service quiet efficient   room very clean and quiet view i wont remember since i dont care bathroom very clean and loaded with supplies for   days Complementary breakfast the room looked small but i didn t care because I brought a big tray upstairs  generic food  but fresh and varied and buffet   Walking distance with a stroller from EVERYTHING   Chealsea Emprire State building Fith Avenue  With a Baby we were able to go back and forth hotel  attraction  And before tucking in pm there is a terrasse with fountain chairs   a little loud between the AC machinery and fountain but great for a baby workout before going to bed   Would I go back yesWould I recommend it  Yes Would I recommend to a family no if you have kids older than    there is really no space to run around besides the terrasse  
P => Great Hotel What a great find this hotel was It is compact but the rooms were a lot larger than we anticipated  New and very clean  Absolutely fantastic location   so close to my favourite avenue   th   with Times Square  mins away  Couldnt be happier this is selection and a great price as well 
P => Great location We arrived around pm  Bell boy Randy greeted us at the cab  Room wasnt ready so he stored our luggage for us  The reception area is a little small and if you are the only ones checking in than its ok  The breakfast area is just opposite the check in  Its the usual continental breakie with bagels toast fruit and cereal and pasteries  The one thing I loved were the hot cinamon buns offered at the breakfast  It can get a little busy and you  have to wait a couple of minutes for a table  The hotel was fully booked while we were there  The lower level has a computer with free internet servicewhich was great for checking emails  I also used it for airline webcheck in the day before and was able to print off my boarding pass  The rooms are small  We had a king bed  There are night tables at each end and that is all the room on either side of the bed  At the end of the bed there is a wall unit with a very nice tv in it  drawers and a closet to hang things An iron and ironing board are in the room  There is just enough space for  person to walk between thebed and wall unit  It was very hot when we were there and thankfully the air conditioner worked beautifully  There is also a small desk in the corner and a chair on one side of the bed  The bathrooms are also small but it has a full size tub and shower  There was good strenght in the shower and it had a nice shower head  The sink is very small and you cant really put out your toilletries  The rooms are kept nice and clean and housekeeping staff is very friendly and if you need something they will get it for you  The hotel is in a great location  Easy walking to everywhere you want to go  Only a few blocks to the subway which we used a couple of times  Even thougheverything is small I would stay there again  For the pirce point it was great  If you plan to spend little time in your room and dont need restaurants bars spas workout rooms etc then you will be happy with this choice  The photos on the website for the hotel are very true to what it is  
P => Find something else I requested a non smoking room and we were given a smoking room with a view of dumpsters AC units and brick walls  The hotel was booked and could not move us until the next day  When we asked about our new room the front desk staff said there wasnt a notation that we requested to move  Apparently the night manager wrote the wrong room number down  So we had to stay in the smoking room another night  Finally they changed our room on our third day  Thank goodness I brought travel candles  The breakfast isnt great but its complimentary so might as well take advantage of it  The deli next door has good paninis and the pizza joint across the street is also good  There is a bar directly across from the hotel so if you have kids you  want to request a room away from the front because it gets pretty loud  The only staff that showed any kind of concern or interest in us were the housekeeping ladies and the quotbellboyquot if you will  He stored our luggage andor hailed a cab for us with a smile  
P => Great things come in small packages Booked hotel for a week away with a few family members  The hotel in compact and new  Reception got a little awkward to negotiate with luggage but very pleased with room quality and fittings  Breakfast was included and consisted of a continental style served in area opposite reception  The staff were incredibly kind thoughtful and the service exceeded our expectations for a budget hotel  Location Location Location   says it all   you can walk everywhere Perfect I strongly recommend this hotel if you plan to be out and about exploring I will return 
P => Great Location We thought this hotel was great  Everything is new clean and just what you need  Its small and dont expect total luxury but the location is perfect  We walked everywhere a lot of the sights are walking distance from the hotel for example the empire state buidling the rockefeller centre the flatiron building grand central station bloomingdales macys central park etc etc   But be warned they dont accept travellers cheques as payment  
P => Blink and youll miss it We stayed at the HI Express on th Ave  ch through  il and had a really lovely time  The front of the hotel is very narrow and looks just like its been squeezed in between  buildings  Having said that there are about  floors we stayed in  which was a lovely room it was small I suppose but adequate for the  of us  Most importantly it was very clean and looked brand new  Breakfast was typical HI fare cinammon rolls fruit cereal and pastries bread and juices and it was complimentary  There was tea coffee and hot chocolate available in the lobby   I found all the staff very pleasant and helpful and the few times i asked for something they were prompt to deal with it  The elevators were a little slow but we never had any real issues on th floor theres stairs if youre that bothered Internet service and lots of attraction leaflets on LL which came in useful  There was no in room safe but a safety deposit box was available at reception which we used  The hotel was situated in a very central location and i always felt very safe returning to the hotel after dark  I dont think the   rating is justified i would rate it at least    I always select my hotels very carefully always using Trip Advisor and choose them according to fitness for purpose what ill need for a happy trip  You dont go to NY to sit in and admire your room swim in a pool or run on a treadmill you can do that at home so why pay extra for a hotel which has these things At  per night it was by far the cheapest rate I could find and it included breakfast a bargain in NY where room prices are sky high  Clean comfortable excellent rates central customer service and free breakfast book it now before everyone else finds out about it  If youre British like me and used to being ripped off for anything with a designer label on it then definitely Dont miss a trip to Woodbury Common Shopping Outlet www premiumoutlets com  Take a bus from Port Authority hr  to shoppers paradise  designer outlets selling discounted clothing take your suitcase and your credit cardyou wont believe your eyes and you wont ever want to buy things back here in the UK  There is no PRIMANI however Have fun 
P => Perfect Location The location of this hotel is really wonderful and centrally located to almost anything you want to do  I was worried that our room might be too small but it was fine  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was nice  The breakfast buffet had plenty of choices and I got hooked on the cinnamon rolls  I made a point of coming down early every morning and they were there every day nice and warm  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends  The staff was very helpful  We arrived before check in and they kindly kept our bags for us while we went out and they also arranged for our taxi to the airport when we checked out   
P => Excellent in every way It was hard to remember that this was only a Holiday Inn Express because it was just so good in everyway  The rooms are on the small side but in my experience that is how rooms are in New York City hotels  Everything in the room was spotlessly clean  The bathroom had a large walk in shower but no bath tub which  be an issue for some  However I can see from photographs that this is not the case in all rooms ours was a King Leisure  Our room on the th Floor had a view of an alley way  If you want a room with a quotviewquot of any sort you would have to request a room at the front of the hotel  The front desk staff could not have been more polite friendly and helpful  There are no in room safes but the front desk has safety deposit boxes free of charge  There is an extensive continental breakfast included in the price and  hour tea and coffee provided in the lobby  The breakfast consisted of a selection of fruit juices hot and cold cereals pastries bagels hot cinamon buns toast etc  The lobby area doubles up as a breakfast room and also a place where you can eat your take out food  It gets very busy and noisy at times and for this reason I would not suggest having a firstground floor room unless you really need one  There is a business centre in the basement which consists of just a computer printed and photocopy machine  In this area there is a stand with information about tours etc  The hotel is within easy walking distance of the midtown attractions and there are many bars and restaurants in the area  If you have a late flight out of NYC the front desk will store your luggage in a locked room you get a receipt for your luggage which you have to show too get them back  We use Holiday Inns a lot and this one is excellent in everyway  
P => Great hotel near everything If you are going to New York on business or pleasure this is a great choice  The rooms care comfy and modern with huge beds and nice LCD screens  It offers free wireless and theres even a PC you can use if you dont have your laptop  Our room was on the small side but apparently most hotel rooms in NYC are small While it was small the space was well used and there was plenty of room for the king size bed which was really comfortable especially after an  hour flight The hotel is near everything and just a short walk from Times Square and the Theater district  The staff are friendly rare for NYC and our room was spotless  Its a fairly new hotel and they give you plenty of fluffy white towels  The best bit was the free continental breakfast  We enjoyed hot cinnamon rolls bagels muffins and lots of other goodies  There are also some healthy choices if you are being good I was horrified when I found out my boyfriend had booked a  star hotel but I soon changed my mind  This is like a good  or even  star but smaller without the facilities of a bigger hotel  You will spend so little time in the hotel you wont miss having a pool etc I would highly recommend this hotel Enjoy your stay 
P => Stayed here with a tour group of teenagers We stayed at this hotel as part of a group of   We were with a group of th grade students and their chaperones  It was a great hotel for this purpose  There were several tour groups there at the same time so I can see why some reviewers were disappointed by the number of teenagers  Since this was our purpose it didnt bother us in the least The rooms are indeed quite small although we found them to be clean and the beds to be comfortable  Our beds were actually a bit firm  Because we were with a group there were  of us in the room    adults and  teenagers  Very cramped Only  person can walk between the furniture at any given time  You will wait for quite some time for the elevators to come during peak hours and then they  be too full  There are only  elevators for  floors  My dhter walked up the  flights of stairs to our room and arrived before I did on the elevatorThe location of this hotel is excellent  We were on the th floor and didnt hear any of the outside noises at night  One member of our group was on the th floor and reported hearing the trash trucks at night  We always felt safe even when we were out late at night Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for its location and cleanliness  Be aware that you  be sharing this hotel with many tour groups but I suspect this  be the case throughout New York  
P => Miserable The Holiday Inn Express Fifth Avenue is the worst property I have stayed in during my numerous trips to New York City  The ONLY positive comment I can make about the hotel is the location  It does have a good midtown location  The lobby is tiny with barely enough room at the front desk for one bag if no one tries to walk by  There are approximately  floors with two small very slow elevators  Unfortunately there were a number of teenagers staying at the hotel who thought playing on the elevators was a great pasttime  The elevators also did not always work correctly almost stranding me and a member of the housekeeping staff between floors  When I arrived at my room I had to kick a large bag of dirty linens to the side to even enter the room  The room was claustrophobically small even by New York standards  It was by far the smallest room I have ever stayed in anywhere  There was almost no room to walk around the bed  There was no closet  The entrance to the room was a tiny hall in which you had to open the door all the way walk into the bathroom and then close the door  The bed was so soft and lumpy it was like sleeping on lumpy shmallows  A two star it is not  You can find much better accomodations for a similar price with similar location even three stars in NY if you look  As a business traveler who travels to NY on a regular basis I have stayed at countless hotels in NY  This one is the worst and only  less than a number of three stars  
P => Soft Beds This is a newer hotel and I must first say is very clean and fresh compared to many NYC hotels that I have stayed in  The staff was very friendly and accommodating  However I must also say that the rooms are relatively small  only six to a floor  No closet just an armoire and a few drawers in which to unpack  It would be difficult for a long stay  My biggest problem was the fact that the bed was VERY soft  Not sure when Ive slept on one as soft so sleeping was very difficult  Location was great for going to the theatre  
P => Holiday Inn Express Clean NeatWell runGreat Locaction OK everything is relative in hotel rooms in New York City  Rooms are  to  times what you would normally expect to pay  The room is probably half to two thirds the size of what you are used to  And there are some nasty choices  Fortunately this is an oasis of what hotels should be in NYC The hotel is clean with the basic light color woods throughout  Kind of like a hotel done in all IKEA furntiure  The hotels footprint is relatively small and each floor has   rooms per floor  There is the front desk and the breakfast area just as you come in the door  Service was efficient they promptly called when my lost luggage was delivered to the hotel The room is small clean and everything appears relatively new  There is a flat panel television which has music choices available also  They also had bottle water and Pepperidge Farm Mint Milano cookies on the desk  I am not sure if they do thought for every room or was because of some status in the Priority Club that Holiday Inn has You are within walking distance of Fifth Ave shopping Rockefeller Center and St  Patricks Cathederal  Obviously there are no shortage of things to do  I am planning on taking my family to NYC and this is where we are going to stay  Stay here with confidence  
P => Holiday Inn Express  highly recommended We stayed in the Holiday Inn Express st th ch  The location of this hotel is ideal  mins walk from Times Sqloads of delis around the hotel plenty of choice for eating Rooms were small but had a nice kingsize bed and we had enough room for the  of us  Breakfast was a bonus cerelstoastbagelsyoghurts tea and coffee are available  hrs down at breakfast bar  I highly recommend this hotel and I would def stay here again   Carol Ireland 
P => Nice and New great location Stayed one night this past weekend and would definitely stay there again  It is a good value We drove up and parked at a nearby garage which honored a dicounted rate from the hotel  Everything at the hotel is new  but very very small  The lobby is efficient  They serve a complimentary breakfast which has the basics such as ceral and danish  Our room had all the nice amenities but is really only built for two people at most  The towels were fantastic and the bed was great  The key here is the location Close to everything   the theatre distict great restuarants Rockerfeller Center etc  Think about it how much time do you spend in your room All you really want is a great location at a reasonable price  
P => Great hotel great location great price My partner and I spent Christmas and New Year in this hotel and had a thoroughly enjoyable stay It is in the heart of Midtown a couple of blocks from Times Sq just off th Ave with the Rockerfeller Centre just around the corner along with a host of other attractions and shops Grand Central Station is a short walk away As for the hotel itself  we had a very large and comfortable kingsize bed in our room with coffee making facilities cable TV with some free movie channels free Wireless internet in every room and a fantastic shower  All facilities are modern good quality and in great condition  The continental breakfast in the lobby area is all you can eat help yourself     the cinnamon buns they heat up are lovely There were also coffeetea making facilities in the lobby area throughout the day  Also if you dont fancy venturing out for dinner you can order takeaway in your room from a few different places    we stayed in a couple of nights and had pizza pasta and a burger   expect huge portions Equally there are loads of restaurant options near the hotel  At New Year we ate at Churrascaria Plataforma in the Theatre District    a brazilian restaurant where they bring different cuts of meat to your table throughout your meal and you choose what you want sirloin flank chicken sausages lambribs etc   all fantastically cooked Wed definitely return to the hotel as the location is second to none and at no point did this hotel feel like a budget option  
P => good location Room was small but very clean  Small is to be expected in NYC  Nice mattress and the room was simply but comfortably orated  Absolutely no view to speak of  My room faced the street which was fairly noisy with an alarm going off constantly both nights  And on the second night my next door neighbor returned at  AM rather loudly and proceeded to put together something in the hallway that sounded like metal pipes being clanked together  Since there are only  or so rooms per floor Im fairly certain everyone on my floor must have heard this rudeness  Also I heard  voices  Dont know how they fit  people in these tiny rooms  There was barely enough room for the king sized bed in my roomBathroom was very clean and updated  Love the free wireless  People at the front desk were friendly and helpful every time I spoke to them  Would stay here again but this is really just a place to sleep  There is absolutely no atmosphere or charm at all  
P => EXCELLENT stay Location was fantastic Within walking distance to all the big sites in midtown Manhattan Rockefeller St  Pats Moma Times Square Grand Central Empire State etc  There are delis pubs amp convenience stores on the same block  The room was small but immaculate  Crisp white linen bedding  Cable tv was a nice touch and you pay for HBO and the movie channels  Bathroom was newly reated and boasts tiled shower wall and granite floor amp sink  Shower water remained hot which is always nice  Blowdryer also came in handy  Tip if you forgot to pack toothbrush amp paste the hotel will supply it for you  Just ask The best part of the hotel was the staff itself  I have never met a more cordial and pleasant front desk Shaniqwa who was more than willing to help with directions and answer all questions  The front desk always acknowledged us when we walked past  Even the cleaning staff made a point to say hi in the hallways or elevator  Tip If you need a ride straight to the airport the front desk will arrange for a car to get you there  The car is not part of the hotel so for a whopping  you can get straight to the airport without the hassle of hailing your own taxi to taking the dreaded bussubways  Our driver came  minutes early and got us there in no time Cons There is no on site laundry as the website claims  But there is a laundromat  blocks away  Other than that  Our stay was EXCELLENT Bottom line Dont be turned off by the  star rating we received  star service  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Hotel Is Ok   Good Location   Price Issue My wife and I were blessed with the opportunity to get into the mid town area of the city for a xmas weekend to see some shows tree etc  We could not find a hotel in the mid town area that wasnt booked and the remaining available hotel choices under night were very limited since we could not book many months in advance  So we chose this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews LOCATIONThe hotel is located on th street between th and th avenue  This was an excellent location for us since we wanted to do all the things in that area   i e  Rockefeller Broadway central park shopping on th  The walks to any of these places were not bad even in cold temps  There are a number of stores and restaurants on th and restaurant row up on  st is not far at all ROOMWe had a King size bed room  The room is small but all of NY is small from what you read   but its very small  We faced an alley so street noise was not a problem  But we had an orange security light from the alley shining in the window all night   they only offer shears on the windows so we had to jimmy rig a solution to block that out  The room itself was very clean   the bathroom was clean as well  The room had a small LCD TV in the room   no pay per view family movies for those on extended stays  It also had a dresser with closet for a several hanging articles  Room was ok for our  day stay  SECURITY AND AMENITIES The property seemed safe as there were people walking in the area at all times of the night due to its location  The staff seemed nice and we had no problems checking in  The hotel offers free internet and breakfast in the morning   some bagels toast juice coffee PARKING The only thing that we did not like is there is no parking on site IF driving  The hotel will tell you to park a block away in a Central Parking System parking lot on th between th and th which they will voucher for you at day  You park and then walk around the block to the hotel  If you are driving into the city during ember as we did and getting into the city between the hours of  pm   best of luck  Traffic is horrible in that area so please plan your route to the hotel carefully   you  want to verify directions if you are using or relying on a GPS   you need to know where you can and cannot make a right or left since some avenues prohibit you from turning down them until pm or because of the season  So if driving and paying  night depending on season   you will park your own car and walk   the hotel does not feel bad for charging those rates and not having a better parking service   this be a problem for some be not for others   just hope this helps if making your isions  You can always drop your party off in front of the hotel before parking but with all the trucks on that street at certain times and no pull in opening in front of the hotel   its up to you to find a space   we just parked and walked from the garage CONCLUSIONAll in all   the hotel is a mini version of your regular Holiday Inn Express chain  If youre coming in ember   you will pay Waldorf rates for a room here but dont expect any special services or anything more than a good but star hotel  
P => Great Location Great Central Location Friendly Staff Rooms Small but for the time you spend in it with so much going on around you it was just the job  We stayed in a suite it had one king bedroom and a sofa bed in a small lounge area  The sofa bed wasnt exactly comfy but it was ok  The hotels free breakfast is great if you are on a budget but you can get bagels and bacon and eggs next door for a few bucks Would stay here again but book early as you get the best rates the earlier you book 
P => Ideal New York Hotel This is an ideal hotel for a New York visit Almost on th Avenue  A  minute walk to Times Square Rockefeller Radio City Grand Central and Chrysler   minutes walk to Empire State Central Park Bloomingdales amp Tiffanys  It was on a safe street and felt OK even walking around at night Hotel staff were always friendly and helpful  Despite having a room only on the rd floor and at the front of the hotel it was very quiet and restful Rooms are fairly small but perfectly adequate for the amount of time anyone spends sitting in your room when visiting NY  Everything in the room is easily usable and with room to walk around and even use an ironing board  The whole hotel is exceptionally clean Breakfast is an added bonus   self service buffet so you can eat as much as you like  Tea amp Coffee is also on tap all day amp night in the reception area I would certainly choose to stay here during future visits to New York  
P => Great location   Nice room Arrived at pm and was told that one of our rooms was not ready  Still waiting at pm so ended up taking a ready room on an alternative floor to my family That aside the hotel is in a great location and the rooms   once you actually get in them   are very nice if small The staff seemed helpful enough and the complimentary breakfast was great A very ent palce to stay   Great value  
P => Tiny rooms but a great location Lets be honest  Most New York hotel rooms are tiny  This hotel is no different  My room would have been perfect for just me  It was a little cramped with my wife along for the trip Part of the reason its hard to move around is the room has an enormous TV so it has an equally large piece of furniture to hold it  Two people cant walk in front of the bed and theres not much room off the bed to open a suitcase  Each room has digital cable hooked into the enormous TV which you dont see everyday All of the upgraded things that Holiday Inn has been putting into the Express line of hotels is here the soft linens soft towels the showerhead the cinnamon rolls  The hotel is in a great location near Broadway  If you dont mind the cramped quarters its a great place to stay  
P => Great Beds and quiet Great hotel within walking distance to Time Square Grand Cental Station shopping and the Empire State Building  There are subway stations within   blocks in any directions  The beds are in great shape and bathrooms are clean  The rooms are small but if you unpack the bags it becomes much better  The only disappointment was there were no cinnamon rolls in the morning  There were muffins juice breads fruit yogurt and cereals  Weve had better breakfasts at other Holiday Inn Express hotels  The beds linens and location are well worth it  
P => Great location This is a very nice hotel clean comfortable and location is really great  Rooms are kind of small but who goes to NYC to remain in his room I would also recommend the Re Sette Italian restaurant close to the hotel  
P => Great hotel value in mid town Manhattan I booked this hotel after reading a favorable mention in spring in Arthur Frommers quotBudget Travelquot magazine on new value hotels in Manhattan  The splendid location off Fifth Avenue and walking distance to Times Square are matched by high comfort and amenities in the rooms  The room had plenty of refrigerated air to offset NYCs mugginess  Its an excellent value and I would stay there again The reception was friendly welcoming and accommodating  The continental breakfast included in the room rate had a couple of areas for improvement  After a first day with bananas the only fresh fruit was an apple  The emphasis was on sweetrolls croissants and high fat food though cereal and instant oatmeal are offered  A container of cool if not cold boiled eggs already peeled looked untouched  I saw the same thing served at a H I  Express in Hartford two weeks later leading me to wonder if this is a corporate formula  Finally the coffee was weak a surprising development given the availability of good coffee in NYC  In sum though this was a fine establishment and shows the results of hard work and attention to details  
P => Oh My Gosh So Good This Was a Really Great Hotel  Lovely Check In  Chose this hotel because of the really great reviews and was amazed  Free internet access in the basement and a great free continental breakfast everymorning   minute from th avenue and  minutes from Broadway  Couldnt have got any better for my money  
P => Very good would stay again Staying ust   I was pleased with this hotel  Yes the rooms are kind of small but well manageable  I guess its to be expected being in the middle of upper Manhattan  Times Square is a couple of blocks away and being a bit away is great because you can sleep at night The bed was an excellent king size nice pillows amp sheets very clean room amp very clean new feeling bathroom  The fixtures were elegant amp classy and the TV was a flatscreen LG with a ton of channels  Although it was a bit pricey  we had only booked the day before via the HI Express website  They checked us in around   but were cordial in the process  The breakfast buffet is nothing to write home about but the absolute essentials were there cereal milk juice croissants etc  The hallways were for some reason not air conditioned so it was a bit warm waiting for the staff or walking through but the room had a good ac unit  Overall  stars and would recommend anybody to this place  Have had good experience consistently from HI Express both in the US amp abroad and tend to look first to this chain  
P => Better than adequate The Holiday Inn Express New York City th AVE was perfect for our purposes    which did not include frills  The location is great room was clean although small like any other Manhattan room and continental breakfast free local calls and in room water bottles and snacks came in much handy My only complaint is that I requested an early check in knowing Id be there at am and they had no record of it  Even after getting there at am it didnt seem as though any accomodations were made for me and I didnt actually check in until     which was a pain  
P => Good deal well be back I spent  days and nights visiting NYC with my fiance and  kids from  to   The hotel is very clean and well appointed  We stayed in a room with  double beds  The rooms are small and space is tight especially for  people but we didnt spend much time in the hotel so that really didnt matter  The staff was pleasant and responded well to all of our requests  On the last day the staff allowed us to store our luggage after checking out as we did some last minute shopping  The hotel is just minutes walking distance from Times Square Rockefeller Plaza and other popular attractions in mid town  For the location you cant beat the price  If youre looking for a hotel with a view this is not for you we were on the th floor and our room was on the back side  All we could see was the alley below and the office building  feet away The continental breakfast was typical but well stocked and helped us get on our way each day  There are a number of restaurants near the hotel and plenty more just a few minutes away in Times Square  I hadnt been to NYC in nearly  years and I was very impressed with the overall cleanliness of the city  Everyone was polite to us and we had a great time  Im already planning my next visit I highly recommend the Holiday Inn Express 
P => Cool little hotel We spent  nights at this hotel   and were extremely satisfied  True the room was small but laid out in a fashion that made it seem larger with a small anteroom area when you opened the door so you didnt feel that the bed was  feet away  The bed was extremely confortable and the staff very accomodating our request for extra pillows was promptly filled  The room was extremely clean and the shower had great water pressure  The complimentary continental breakfast was a nice added touch with good pastriesbagels etc  as well as cerealhardboiled eggscoffeejuice and milk We go to New York at least twice a year priily for the theatre so this location is just ideal  Its an easy walk to Times Square and any other midtown location yet its relatively quiet at night allowing for a good nights sleep We would recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a comfortableclean place to stay at a reasonable for New York price  
P => Great little hotel Our st time in NY booked at short notice  This hotel was much better than expected considering the price AND it included a more than adequate breakfast  Staff were very pleasant and helpful room a reasonable size with great shower and room facilities The big plus is its proximity to th Ave Times Square restaurants stores subway etc  Would definitely stay here again 
P => Excellent hotel This hotel is excellent there was two of us who came to new york and we were given a king size room which was sapcious for new york  The bathroom had a huge shower cubicle that could of fitted about four people in although i didnt try The breakfast was brillant with buns croissants cereal coffee etc and even at am when the breakfast was suppose to finish at am they were still stocking up witrh food and drink The hotel staff were brillant and helped me in every way especially telling me directions to places  I would say the only thing you would have to do when staying at this hotel is put your privacy notice on your door before you go to bed bacuse the maid can come round about am and she will knock on your door unless you have the notice hanging on your door overall i would say if you are going to new york then stay at this hotelP S  The location is excellent round the corner from times square top of the rock th avenue etc 
P => Cant find a fault I was really pleased with my stay here  My room on the third floor was spacious for New York and incredibly clean  Despite being a smoking room the linen and air smelled fresh  I loved the supersoft kingsize bed  The bathroom was really well stocked and the shower was large enough for two people with excellent water pressure  All the staff I met were freindly and very helpful  The location is excellent too  I really cant find any negatives about this experience apart from that there wasnt any view from my room rd floor and the breakfast was a bit of a feeding frenzy in the small lobby  I will definately stay again perhaps next time I will try to get a room higher up to see if there is any kind of view from up there  
P => Good value at Holiday Inn For location and value cant beat it  Basic clean and safe accommodation  Easy walking distance of the great sights round the corner from Times Square  Not for you if you want luxury but if youre here to sightsee and want a ent place to stay its perfect  
P => Good Value at the Holiday Inn Express On our most recent visit to NYC we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for its cost and excellent location close to the Broadway shows  Although the rooms were very small our hotel room was clean our breakfast was included and the staff were exrememly helpful  They stored our bags for the day after check out and provided directions as needed  If you dont mind a small room in a very tall narrow building this is a great value for NYC 
P => A Great Bargain  Spent  nights with a family of  adults and  kids in one double bedded room  Paid  night thru the Holiday Inn Express website  Fantastic rate for this hotel and location   blocks from Rockefeller Center St  Patricks Cathedral Times Square  Much shopping and many dining choices all around  Super service  Everyone at the hotel were friendly and very helpful  CLEAN   CLEAN   CLEAN  Hotel is brand new so nothing to complain about at all  Felt very safe and very comfortable If there is a negative it is the size of the rooms  Cramped but average for NYC  Front desk reception aisle is literally an aisle way erated from the breakfast area by the buffet bar  Sometimes difficult to maneuver in or out of hotel on either side as its so narrow    peoople in the lobby area and its a crowd Forget it though    go and enjoy 
P => Clean Comfortable would book again Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn Express in NYC  My Mother sister and I stayed for a weekend birthday celebration and were very pleased  It is a great value for the price  The free continental breakfast was just the right way to start a day in the city and the location is outstanding  Walking distance to Fifth Avenue attractions Times Square etc  Very clean great showers and comfortable beds  Dont hesitate to book  Perfect hotel for a weekend shopping trip to the city  
P => Loved the location My husband and I and our two young sons stayed here in ember and loved it  Very safe and excellent location  Literally situated between Fifth Avenue and Times Square and just down from Rockefeller Center  Was able to walk to everything we did  Even walked from Museum of Natural History through Central Park and back down Fifth Avenue to hotel  Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone especially if travelling with children  Only negative was the small rooms and slow elevators but these were very minor cons compared to the great advantages of staying here  
P => Small elegant rooms with little closet space but an awesome deal I paid  a night and for that price this hotel is a complete steal  The inside is totally reated and new and modern and as others have mentioned the beds are very comfortable and the TV and cable is great  I found the staff to be incredibly friendly and responsive  Without being asked they provided me with large subway and bus maps  You can tell the hotel is making a point of giving good service perhaps to help keep word of mouth to drive business  Internet access is free which is great  Theres ice machines on every floor and my room king bed th floor facing street away from elevator was very very quiet The only thing I would say is that the rooms are small perhaps the main room is the size of a king bed plus  feet on each side  This should be just fine for a single traveller expecially since the beds are so comfortable but it might be a bit crowded for couples and probably intolerable for more The other thing you should know is that closet space is EXTREMELY limited  You have about one foot worth of hanger space  Anything more than that and you will need to fold the clothes and put in drawers Other than that this is a really nice hotel for the price when sub  a price that in NYC usually means a run down fleabag hotel As others have said this is a great safe location near th and th  
P => St Patricks Day in NYC Holiday Inn Express is thee hotel to stay in in New York city if you are on a mid low budget the hotel is clean amp modern  The staff are helpful and friendly  The hotel is in a great location from Times Square amp th Ave  which makes it ideal for St  Patricks Day celebrations 
P => ent hotel great price I stayed here on business and for a few extra nights vacation for  nights in ruary  Everybody has mentioned all the positives including nice rooms although small great tv channel selection and good breakfast  I would definately stay here again as the location and price cant be beat  Did have one small problem which over a month later has only just been resolved  I had a bathrobe go missing from my room probably taken away with the sheets and did get a bit of a run around from the staff and management for compensation  After many many phone calls reminding them I got  refunded on my credit card  They did want to give me a  credit for my next stay but I said that wasnt satisfactory  Anyway it was resolved so my faith has been restored in this great little hotel 
P => Super midtown hotel My husband and I just spent the weekend at this Holiday Inn Express and I must say it was a very pleasant experience  Check in was efficient and friendly although very small reception area  The rooms are tiny like a cruise ship cabin without the motion sickness  Everything was fantastic though with very comfortable beds cable channels just like at home nice ble bath mine did have a tub and shower combo and great soundproofed windows that open for fresh air  Rooms are fine for a weekend but dont know where you would put a couple of big suitcases with lots of clothes if staying longer  Breakfast was good but the breakfast room was very crowded  All in all I would stay here again if the price was right  
P => Good simple worth the price  Stayed this weekend   Very friendly staff  Clean rooms  Small for two beds but its NYC so its expected  Great price but be wary of how you are charged  I got a receipt in the morning for additional charge on top of my prepaid room  Staff took care of it  ent continental breakfast   beware of the milk if you are that adventerous  Location has a lot of selection for quick food  Would reccommend for a cheap no frills stay  
P => great location and price Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express the weekend of ruary th with my friends  The AAA rate with taxes was   The location was perfect and the rooms spotless amp comfortable  I had read a couple of reviews beforehand saying the elevators were slow amp the lobby cramped  SO WHAT We were on the th floor and never had to wait long for an elevator  As for the lobby how much time are you going to be spending there The breakfast was more than just cold bagels and coffee you could fill up on boiled eggs danish yogurts waffles hot and cold cereals  Hot coffee and tea are available  hours a day as well as free local papers  I cant say enough about the value and quality of this hotel  Will definitely be going back next year when we do the girls weekend in NYCgt

P => Pleasant central HI Express Times Square South We stayed at this hotel for  nites this past weekend  The hotel is squeezed in between  other affialiated hotels a candlewood suites and a hampton inn  Location is on th streetabout  feet from the corner of th ave    block walk to times square  th is better to walk at night to TS as th street is mostly businesses closed by pm and deserted  Rooms are compact on the order of a Eureopean hotel room with about two feet of space on the side of the K bed near the window  Breakfeast and free internet are available making for a nice savings on the rate  Rooms are quiet we were on the nd fl and heard no street noise nor from adjacent rooms  rooms to a floor  floors  Hotel is less than  year old so rooms are fresh and comfortable  One of the elevators seemed to be fast and the other slow  Staff is friendly and hotel concierge is helpful  Nearest subway is th  Good restaurant choices in Hells Kitchen arearestaurant row try our favorite Hells Kitchen for upscale mexican and Basiliica across the street for the prixe fixe pre theatre special  For theatre tickets   off tyr the Visitors Ino Cetner at th  All other things being equal  because of the location I would stay at the riott Courtyard Times Sq on thth as that hotel is better situated toTS and more amenities  See prior review  
P => Nice comfortable stay  In the heart of midtown Manhattan this is a great hotel to stay in  It has recently been reated so the rooms are brand new  Its a few minutes walk to the Times Square Tip Have your breakfast as soon as you can because it is only available till stocks last 
P => Great value  It was our first visit to New York and there were  of us staying  Check in was quick and easy rooms were very clean and attended to every day with clean towels etc  The wait for lifts was acceptable considering there were only two and the breakfast was excellent lots of different choices as we were just expecting coffee and muffins Location was ideal for Times SquareTheatresSubwaysPort Authority bus station etc  All within a  minute walk and as a group of all females we did not feel at all unsafe  There was no problem with noise on the street outside on either sie of the building we were on the th floor and could sleep with the window open without being disturbed  The staff on reception at breakfast concierge and bell boys all extremely polite and helpful and we would definately be able to recommend the hotel as a base for anyone visiting the city  
P => good place bad servicemanagement not far away from the times square good hotel overall one incident where i forgot   in the drawer and the housekeeper took it awayi informed the hotel manager who knew the lady but didnt do anything wounderful conceirge front desk 
P => The Holiday Inn Express is a very new hotel hotel close to Madison Square Gardens  The Holiday Inn Express is a very new hotel hotel close to Madison Square Gardens  I booked the hotel through Priceline  per room per night  The room allocated to me was on the first floor when asked if I could change it the gentleman at reception allocated a room on the th floor with the most amazing view at no extra cost The bathroom has standard toiletries   shampooshower gelshower cap  Hairdrier also supplied The room has a kettlecups and just outside the door is an ice machine and a snackconfectionery dispensing machine  The rooms arent a great size but has enough space to get ready  There is an ironing board and iron in one of the wardrobes There is no fridge Cleanliness   being a new hotel it is very clean Breakfast   good selection suitable for vegetarians you can also take breakfast up to your room  Would recommend taking extra teabagsmilk as they are not supplied in the room Noise   very quietStaff   very friendly and very accommodating Opposite the concierge desks are two computers for free intenet use and printers attached Location   Very good Penn Station is nearby but I walked everywhere it was about half an hour walk to Central Park Maceys Empire State building are very close  The street is dark and not very well lit Would defnitely recommend the hotel which is aiming to become a three star hotel soon  
P => perfect hotel hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful Rooms were very clean and beds were comfy Views from the room were just okay  I expected alittle better view overall the hotel was worth the stay and I would recommend it to friends and familyVery short walk from penn station and subways 
P => Quiet central hotel This was the quietest hotel Ive ever stayed at in NYC  I guess because its new   we stayed in rooms on the nd and rd floors and never heard traffic or other room noises  The rooms are very small as youd expect  The beds are comfortable as others have said The elevators are painfully slow to use so we were glad to be on lower floors so we could take the stairs  We didnt eat the breakfast   with Hot amp Crusty Cafe bagels nearby we gave the typical Holiday Inn Express breakfast a miss The front desk staff were pleasant and helpful  I wish wed gotten this on Priceline but the rate wasnt horrible for NYC considering there were  adults in the room The biggest quotminusquot for me was the size of the bathroom   very small and very few quotsurfacesquot to place towels items on more of a problem because there were  of us I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends especially if you can get a good price on the room  
P => Best Value in Times Square This hotel was clean and affordable and best of all just a few blocks away from the heart of times square  I absolutely love their shampoo and conditioner  
P => Pleasantly Surprised I had to make a last minute reservation for a business trip during the week of all of the UN meetings and the city was booked I stayed here as the prices were very reasonable considering the situation  You could tell the hotel had been recently remodeled like all of their TV commercials say and the room was great The bed was super comfortable and I slept like a baby  This is NYC so the room was fairly small but much bigger than other comparable hotels that I have stayed in  They had WIFI in the room that was very easy to access all in all it was a great stay for the price If you are looking for something convenient to the Times Square area this is a great option 
P => Excellent choice REally impressed with this hotel and location  Staff was very friendly  Arrived early about  am and were able to check right in  Rooms were small as expected for NYC but very very clean  No long wait for elevators as posted before  Breakfast is repetitious would be nice if they alternated one day omelets and sausage and next day scrambled eggs and bacon but it did the trick  Free internet to use in lobby if you can get on it  Street is busy during the day but a little deserted at nighttime  Safe though  Liquor store and drug store on corner of th and th st so that was handy  Cute restaurant around the corner on th st Westway is the name  Great breakfast and so reasonable  Turn right out of hotel lobby go right at corner turn right and its at about rd st on right hand side  Excellent 
P => so so value for money First the positives  My friend and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Times Square in tember for  nights  We booked the holiday through expedia ca and got a great rate by booking our flights and the room together it cost about CAD for return airfare from toronto to new york and included three nights at the hotel  For that price it was a great deal   The room was small but functioned exactly as we needed it to   private bathroom with showersinktoilet and a bed   The room was clean   bedsheets carpet bathroom were all clean and well kept   There were no bugs   no bedbugs no cockroaches no creepy crawlies of any sort that we saw good news as North America is beginning to have a bedbug problem again   The location was great about a five minute walk to Times Square and about a three minute walk to the nearest subway station   Theres free computers and internet in the lobby I never waited more than  minutes to use them   The free breakfast was ok but not very healthy or vegetarian friendly but still it was nice to have a glass of orange juice and a bagel to get going in the morning  Each room has its own air conditioning and heating unit a bit noisy bring earplugs if that kind of thing keeps you up at night as well as a television Negatives  if booked just on its own this hotel is not worth the night for the cheapest rooms available theres definitely better finds if you check around a bit more  The front desk staff were rude and messed up our booking it was eventually sorted but the girl doing check in was no help whatsoever and after an hour of talking to people on the phone being put on hold and given the run around it turned out the front desk girl was at fault and had made an error checking in someone by the same last name as me   There are only two elevators servicing a  storey building during the day and at night its not too much of an issue but around breakfast timecheck out time we waited for  elevators to go by before just lugging our suitcases down the stairs Over all I would stay here again if I got a good cheap rate with flight and hotel rolled into one  Clean rooms that offer a place to sleep at night shower and store our luggage was all we were really looking for and this hotel fulfilled those needs well  For the price we paid it was a great value right in the heart of Manhattan close to the subway and touristy things  
P => Great for the price  Rooms are small but with this being an almost new hotel you would expect that and unless your throwing a party in the room dont let that bother you  Spotless inside and the bed is SOOOOO comfortable My wife was checking the comforter to see who made it lol Great water pressure also took a nice  min hot shower  something ya never do at home It was about a  min walk to Times Square but Ill walk the  or  blocks to save  a night Elevators were somewhat slow but it aint the riot  Get to the free breakfast by am and theres plenty of food and coffee to go around Only negative thing is the parking  We had called and were told that there was parking for  a night  Not bad by NYC standards  On our first call we were told that we could drop off the car and they would park it in an off site lot  Then we were told when we got there that we would have to drop it off at IMPARK lot  min away and walk  Weather was nice but u might want to call and see if it was just us misunderstanding or a bad policy So if your looking to save a couple hundred dollars a night stay in a nice clean hotel thats close to TS then this is it  If your looking to stay in TS and like to spend  or more for a room to sleep in then pass on this  
P => Good basic hotel  While not luxury this hotel is a solid option for NYC  Its not super close to the action of Times Square or Theater District but both are just a short walk as is the subway  Great breakfast service and cleanliness  Room are on the smaller size but we had three people in our two double beds and were completely comfortable  I would definitely recommend 
P => Great stay and confortable stay I stayed at this property labour day weekend and I had a wonderful stay the staff was very helpful and very nice  The room was not to big but the size was good for a Nyc hotel it had free High speed internet  Breakfast had good choice Cinnamon roll amazing bagel English muffins cereal yogurt eggs stuffed with cheese etc    breakfast room was a comfortable size    I have to say it can get a little crowded around am BUT theres always a staff member to refill whatever is missing Location is perfect only   min walk to Port Authority station and Time Square  
P => Good location free breakfast no complaints Stayed here on a recent Saturday night by using a free stay I had earned with Priority Club  Priority Club gave me a choice of several locations in NYC and I was glad I chose this Holiday Inn Express  It is a new hotel ust  located on W  th St  between th and th Aves it is right next to a Candlewood Suites and Hampton Inn  We arrived in NYC at Penn Station and found walking to the hotel from there very easy probably less than  minutes  Traveled through the city quite a bit using the subway and the hotel is near Times Square Station took the    train to Grand Central to travel east then the    downtown to Little Italy  Also took a cab from SoHo back to the hotel which cost about   Check in and check out had no problems  I was even able to check in a few hours early  When I checked out I was able to store my bags at no additional charge which allowed me more time to explore NYC  The hotel is tall and narrow   there are  something floors but I know that my floor only had about  or  rooms on it  The room was clean and somewhat small but that is to be expected in NYC  We had a pretty full schedule planned for our NY trip so we really were only in the hotel when we first checked in while we slept and for breakfast so a small room was not really an issue since we spent so little time there  We slept very good with no outside noise issues while its called the Holiday Inn Express Times Square this location is a few blocks away from the major hustle and bustle  Our room had a partial view of the Hudson River  As with all Holiday Inn Expresses you get a free breakfast which I found quite good pre made omlettes bagels juice  muffins etc  I thought there were plenty of tables at breakfast but I suppose it could get busy at certain times of the morning  I would definitely recommend this hotel to people looking for a location convenient to Times Square Broadway Port Authority and Penn Station  Id like to stay there again although I doubt I will unless I get another free night if I had paid for the night I stayed for free would have been   
P => Great location for budget minded traveler Great location just a couple of blocks from Times Square and the theater district  Since the hotel is new the rooms are modern clean and bright  The beds were really comfortable  The lobby however left a lot to be desired  When we arrived and saw the tiny somewhat dirty and crowded lobby we were afraid of what our room would be like but the rooms were fine although quite small  The free breakfasts were adequate again a great moneysaver  The customer service was not up to par with other Holiday Inns however  There were only three hangers in our room and we called down for more and no one ever came  The front desk crew seemed inexperienced and only ginally helpful  But the price is right if you are willing to forego the amenities another hotel might provide  
P => You Get What You Pay For If you are looking for the usual Holiday Inn Express experience you will be satisfied with this one  A good value considering location room or comfort and services provided  If you want to be a bit closer to the action Times Square a larger room and more services you need to stay elsewhere  
P => Brand new hotel affordable many amenities This brand new hotel offers   for a fairly low rate   large clean rooms free wireless internet a business center and breakfast  Its centrally located not the cleanest part of town just a couple of minutes away from Times Square  Staff was ok  The only downside that I can think of are the elevator although fast there are two of them to serve the  storey building  Getting downstairs at check out rush hour might take some  minutes  
P => Great Value Very clean good location no complaints except the elevators  there are only  for the almost  floors  Ice machines only on every    floors  Beds great  
P => unfriendly hotel in good location but dirty business area newly refurbished hotel has clean air conditioned rooms near to madison sq gardens and penn station location in business district which is very dirty and hot in estaff unhelpful refused to store luggagebreakfast room tiny but food quite good and tables outside if no roominternet in tiny foyer which is very busy and not very cleanone of the best things about the hotel is the outside tables in front and behind the hotel where you can sit with a bought drinkconcierge never there and you need to ask if you are meeting a group as tiny notice displayed late in front of his tiny booth there are maps available but you need to ask as staff do not bother volunteering any information 
P => Consigliato  
P => Aamazing  
P => bon rapport qualit  prix  
P => 
P => Clean and friendly I arrived in New York by train and the hotel is located only a couple blocks from Penn Station so the location was convenient  The price was reasonable for staying in the city  The room was clean always my top priority The front desk staff was very friendly  Breakfast was included with the room and included a buffet with cereal fruit bread pastries coffee eggs etc  It was busy during the breakfast rush but I had no problem finding a table  The wireless was free and worked great in my room My only complaint is the noise level in the room  I could hear everything in the hallway  My neighbor was in and out of her room all night and I could hear the door open and slam shut every time  
P => Convenient Clean and Comfortable Stayed here for a night  Small room but had everything we needed  Its amazing how everything fitted in that small room  Breakfast was complimentary and good  Free WIFI available  Only con was that the vending machine did not work  The receptionist was helpful and gave me change for my dollar to see if that worked  They even hold your bags for you which was really convenient for us as we checked out in the morning and took a tour of NY The parking lot that they validate the parking for is about  blocks from the hotel     for a day   Central parking  There is a parking lot right next to the Hotel   Icon parking and is about  a day  
P => Basketball trip Our reservations were messed up at the Penn so tried the Holiday Inn Express MSG  Just a couple of blocks away and although the room is small it was clean and the bathroom looked to be newly reated  Price was right and you get a ent breakfast  Overall was satisfied with experience  
P => very good  remember you are in NY I liked in stay here  The room is really short but remember you are at ny The price is good you have a free continental breakfast and you are so close to Macys Empire state and others attractions I payed U dollars for  people with breakfast Its amazing   
P => Fantastic hotel spotless brilliant service  We stayed here for  nights in ober  The staff on the reception desk were all unfailingly helpful and polite happy to answer any queries  Our room was compact but spotless  A small bathroom with showerbath but also exceptionally clean  The hotel is ideally situated for walking to the major sights many places to eat nearby Would recommend and happily stay there again  We were both very impressed and felt it offered excellent value for money The only negative would the lifts     lifts for a ish story very bust hotel made for long waits to and from our room  
P => Be prepared to hear everything in the hall    Nice hotel and great location  Courteous staff  Nice breakfast Allow me to explain the layout of this hotel as it was very different than what I had expected  The hotel has a VERY small footprint  There were only  rooms on our floor Upon our arrival my husband needed to sleep  I found that I could hear every conversation that took place in the hallway as well as the elevator opening and closing  I heard children cry in another room as well as friends who had just arrived and described in detail their plans for the evening  It was remedied slightly with a towel against the bottom of the door  We had a fan in our luggage to provide some white noise which helped but without it well     It would have made for long nights  
P => Amazing impeccable service in a beautiful hotel We stayed here after the New York athon  The hotel appeared to be at   capacity but you would never have known that from the service  Every single person we encountered treated us like royalty  Gloria at the front desk was especially helpful and gracious  The housekeeping staff was friendly and helped us find a great Mexican restaurant in the area  The breakfast staff was busy but kind and deferential  I cant properly convey how overwhelmed we were with the staffs care  It felt much more like a  star hotel than a HIE Breakfast was great and ample  We went during the thick of it  There are  chairs arranged around  tables in groups of   or   I counted because it was a concern after reading some of the previous comments  It was the expanded HIE menu including biscuits and gravy sausage and pre made omelets  These were quickly refilled as necessary  Coffee is available  hours  Priority Club members can have their breakfast delivered if they like The hotel is located a block from the   line or   blocks from Madison Square GardenPenn Station  Its a block the other way from the Fashion Institute of Technology  The neighborhood is okay and felt safe walking alone at night there was a crazy on the street but its New York and there are crazies on most blocks  There is a parking lot next door day I think  Taxis frequently come by and can be arranged at the front desk The business center consists of  computers in the lobby  They are at standing level with couches near them  I brought a chair over which didnt seem to be a problem  There is a nice and fairly large fitness center in the basement where the ice machine and vending machines are also located The rooms are compact as youd expect in NYC  They were very plush immaculate and had upscale furnishings and bedding  Two doubles fit and still allowed room for a desk table and tv area  There is no view to speak of except for from the top floor ask for it if youre a PC member  The price was great about half as much as most of the other hotels in NYC  I dont know why and Im certainly not complainingThough we have family a short train ride away weve ided that this hotel is so reasonable and wonderful that well always stay here instead  
P => Excellent Stay Will Definitely Be Returning The Holiday Inn   Maddison Square Garden was one of the best stays in NYc I have had  I have stayed at many hotels in the city and this one was the best location and service for the money  Times Square Herald Square the Empire State Building and Chelsea are all within walking distance  So is Central Park if you dont mind a bit more of a stroll  If your more in the mood for taking the subway to get where you need to go you can jump on within a block or  in either direction  Only a few minutes ride to Times Square and from there you can catch the subway to just about anywhere you could want to go  The hotel itself is in great condition  The rooms were big enough to have  queen size beds and my sister was still able to sleep on the floor in between them  The hotel was ok with having a th person in the room but was just unable to provide a cot due to fire regulations  There is a nice continental breakfast in the morning so if your on a budget it saves you having to pay for breakfast  I would definitely stay here again and would reccomend it to anyone wanting to stay in the city Oh yeah there is also free wi fi and a fitness room if your interested  
P => Get to Breakfast Early New York hotels within the range of the average traveller are expensive with small rooms  Bottom line  The Holiday Inn Express was reasonably priced with ent sized rooms and incl  breakfast Breakfast is quite literally a bun fight  GET THERE EARLY or you will be waiting aimlessly for a table and the food will be well and truely picked over  That being said its great value for NYC and a nice quality hotel  
P => Great location Stayed there for a week in tember  Rooms are small but clean and bed are comfy  Gary the Manager was F A B U L O U S The best I have ever encountered Could not do enough for us We have stayed in HI hotels for years and no one is a great as Gary  The hotel is within a  min walk to Times Square  Close the Pen Station  Free internet in Foyer  Breakfast can get busy so go early or take the food back to your room  But for a short stay in NYC  Great value and great service  
P => Comfortable hotel   great location We stayed in this hotel for a weekend in NYC  The location is excellent within walking distance of Penn Station we had taken the train and several subway lines  And the price really couldnt be beat it probably helps that we booked our room about  months in advance Our room was small but had all the usual amenities of the hotel brand including free Internet  We didnt spend much time in our room anyway  Still a comfy bed and nice shower go a long way  And the room was immaculate  One minor complaint is that the hallway can get noisy I could hear people talking loudly in one of the rooms while waiting for the elevator  Free breakfast is a nice addition at this price point though we did opt to eat at a restaurant one morning so we could enjoy a quotrealquot New York breakfast  Id definitely stay here again  
P => Good value for money in New York Nothing wrong with this hotel  Great location being close to Empire State Building  Penn Station and subways  Madison Sq  Garden  Contrary to a previous reviewers comment there are more than six tables for breakfast  There are probably around twelve tables plus more tables outside which some  consider preferable  Yes it does get busy around  to   a m  Why dont you go down at    There is a good selection of food including cereals hard boiled eggs yoghurts bread and bagels for toasting pastries ready made omelettes and sausage patties fruit and probably more besides There are three computers in the lobby with free use of internet  All the other hotels we stayed at during our trip charged for their quotBusiness Centerquot The bedroom and bathroom were fine and perfectly clean The price for midtown Manhattan was more than fair given the fact that breakfast and internet use were included   
P => Dont leave anything valuable in your room I thought I was being st by hiding my jewellery in a small jar with my makeup bag but even then it went missing When I think of how much snooping was no doubt done thrugh my stuff it makes me nausous I didnt file a report with the New York poice while there big mistake  And the hotel has not responded to my phone calls and email  Without these reports I cant claim the   loss with my insurance company There are no safes in the rooms so I would strongly recommend that you leave your good jewellery at home 
P => Perfect Hotel We couldnt have picked a better hotel It was close to everything  The front desk was helpful also  The rooms were awesome clean the beds were very comfortable Timesuware is in walking distance the Empire State buikding is  blocks away  The boarding area for the double ker buss is only  blocks away the hotel also has free internet in the Lobby with  computers and a great breakfast its also  block away from a GREAT chinese restraunt called Home on th you must go there Stay at this hotel you wont be disappointed 
P => Couldnt have asked for more This hotel was perfect for what I was after  The location is superb within walking distance to everything  The staff are friendly and courteous and the cleanliness is exceptional  Nice big comfortable bed and a great shower my  key criteria to a good hotel room  The breakfast is great   make sure you get there early though to avoid the stampede The free internet is a huge plus and the gym is really well equipped with nice new cardio equipment I shopped around so much before I booked my accommodation and Im so glad I settled with this one  You cant beat the value for money for this hotel in New York City 
P => Great location hotel amenities fine  I stayed here with my girlfriend and another couple for a long weekend trip to NYC  We werent planning on hanging around the room very much so the fact that the room itself is quite small wasnt a big deal for us  The  of us managed to fit in comfortably though we are close  No complaints about the the hotel save that the elevator is slow everything worked out fine there were two places to park next door the one not associated with the hotel gave a better rate day I believe there was light breakfast available on the main floor though there are many better options available nearby and its very centrally located in a good neighborhood  I would stay here again  Good for what we needed it for  
P => Outstanding Staff Clean and a Good Breakfast We just stayed here this last week very affordable hotel very clean with very friendly staff  The staff was extremely helpful we were travelling with a baby and they made us feel very welcome  The breakfast is also good elevators take time in the morning but try to stay on a high floor so when they get to you they are empty  They have only one ice machine no microwave or fridge in the room but they have a common on the main floor which can be used at anytime  This is probably the best holiday inn Ive ever stayed at and usually we never stay at these hotels but I was very pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms  I would most definitely recommend it   it is close to all train station and close to shopping and the rest  
P => Great value and good location Located close to the city centre Holiday Inn Express Madison Square Garden offers a good location for a tourist visit to New York  The rooms are on the small side but clean and tidy with ent linen Breakfast for Priority Club members can be served in room but unfortunately only very basic items can be delivered not even bread is included  The breakfast though served in the busy area next to reception is more than satisfying for a budget hotel No major complaints at all well recommended 
P => Cant beat the value of this hotel in NYC My husband and I have traveled to NYC several times and have stayed at a wide range of places from the W to the etel Affinia and a tiny little scary place somewhere in Times Square  For the value you cant beat the price and cleanliness of the Holiday Inn Express Madison Square Garden  Its just steps away from the subway   and in easy walking distance to Times SquareBroadway  I have not stayed in a room with a cleaner bathroom in NYC period  The rooms are small but again for less than  a night in NYC its an incredible value free high speed internet   and  computers in the lobby for guests to use for free  Also   the morning breakfast just wish the hours were longer is unbeatable as far as selection   more than just cold cereal and bagels the breakfast included mini omelets and hot sausage patties as well as cinnamon rolls  If you are trying to save money for other things like shopping and great restaurants in NYC LArtusi in the West Village then stay at this hotel Oh   and they even let us keep our bags locked up for over  hours AFTER our check out time 
P => You get what you pay for My family wanted to stay in NYC after a cruise vacation  I searched for affordablecleanreliable accommodations  This hotel served the purpose  However you do get what you pay for  Ive been in bathrooms larger than our room  It was almost comical trying to navigate luggage around the room  If you have very little luggage go for it  We had four people three suitcases and four carry ons and utilized the top of the armoire and every other available space  Thank goodness we really just needed to sleep  On a positive note the breakfast bar is very nice  In addition they have a nice seating area in front of the hotel  It was nice to sit out there and enjoy the summer mornings and evenings  This hotel seems to be in a fairly nicesafe area  It is within walking distance to the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden  If you do the Grayline Hop on   Hop off tours you can hop off about  blocks from the hotel  Beware   ask if your room is in the back facing the alley  I listened to the thump thump thump of a club to fall asleep  Thank goodness I am not a light sleeper  Sound proofing was not a priority when building this hotel and I hope I woke my neighbor with the slamming of my door   Overall if you are traveling on a budget this will do  
P => Perfect stay I stayed there for the th y holiday and it was my second at this hotel  My brother and me had a lovely stay right from the beginning We had a lovely and clean room on the th floor facing the front entrance  There was no problem sleeping at night even with the little noise of the closing room doors  Breakfast was really good with a lot of choices As it is complentary you cannot ask for more The free wifi is perfect to check your Emails or even look for some directions I am sure we are going to stay at this hotel the next time well go to NYC For us there is no reason to stay at any other hotel in the city 
P => Good Choice for those on a budget I stayed in this hotel over Saint Patricks Day weekend  I got a great rate on Travelzoo  The Hotel is within an easy walk of Penn Central and is a good choice for those coming into the city by train  Their are two subways near the hotel and while it is not in one of the most stellar of neighborhoods we felt safe walking back to our room at night  The hotel features your standard Holiday Inn express breakfast which was kept stocked  There was helpful staff who could book events for you  Rooms were tiny but they were clean  The Hotel is in buisness area so their were few restaurants or other types of amentities close by but plenty within a moderate walk or a subway stop away  Had a good stay in a great city and would stay again given a good deal  
P => Two Sleepless Nights We arrived on Saturday night and our room was on the back side of the hotel apparently across from a club  The music boomed until about  in the morning  On Sunday night there was no music  I was asleep and the front desk called at   He told me they were working on the cable  He said the TV internet and phones would not work until  a m  He told me to leave the phone off the hook until  a m When I checked in they gave me a number to call to have breakfast items delivered to the room we are Priority Platinum members  Both days no one answered the number  I just received a message saying that the mailbox was full The people at the front desk were nice and so was the maid who fixed our roll away bed  The room was small but I expected that after reading others reviews  The hotel was clean and the breakfast was good crowded by good  If they put you in a handcapped room be careful of the inside of the bathroom door  The door closes hard and fast  There is a low towel hook  The door slammed on me and the hook bruised my arm  As other people said the doors slam a lot  The hotel is about a five minute walk to restaurants and shopping like Macys  It is close to Penn Station  If you are not used to taking subways Penn station is not an easy station to start with as it has several lines We had free wifi easy to set up  
P => Very nice Hotel centrally located clean room great breakfast  Stayed at the Hotel for three nights over the Fathers Day weekend  Even though the property was very crowded the staff did a great job of keeping the breakfast well stocked  This is a nice property  We will return to this hotel  
P => very good location I stayed here for one night on business  The location is excellent just less than a  min walk from Penn station yet very quiet  Rooms were good and clean and I appreciated the free wifi and breakfast not as elaborate as you have in luxury hotels but very good This hotel gives you an excellent location good rooms at a ent price  
P => Convenient Location This hotel is conveniently located and only  blocks from the subway  We never felt unsafe walking back to the hotel from the subway because the area is vibrant  This is a newly built structure so everything is modern and clean  We got an excellent rate and we stayed for  nights  The first night was a disappointment because the room was near the stairway and all night the doors open amp shut which kept us awake  We asked to have the room changed the next morning and Indira at the front desk was kind enough to arrange for us  We had no noise problem with the new room and we slept very well on a comfortable king bed  A ent hot and cold continental breakfast was included but at times the dinning area is crowded  be because of ch Break All in all a very pleasant stay  
P => Good location for exploring New York We found this a good value hotel and a great location for exploring New York  The rooms are small but when you are in a city like this you spend very little time in your room anyway  That said they are clean and the bed is comfortable  The only complaint we would have is breakfast  While there was a good selection to choose form the breakfast room was just to small for the amount of people there and it became a bit chaotic there  
P => great value great location nice hotel Nothing outstanding about the rooms small but the location value breakfast NYC    all made it a great choice The staff are top notch some of the best I have met Location is everything here and you are right in mid town Manhattan two blocks from the Garden  Great Breakfast too 
P => QUITE GOOD IN NYC Excellent locationVery quiet room nice bedsbut as mentionned in previous postsa bit too small for a family of   Good HousekeepingCool bathroom with tub but very bad hairdryerNice and helpful staffGreat breakfast but be down there before  AM otherwise you will have to stand in line and queue for a while until a table gets available    
P => Greate hotel near everything in New York City Good hotel near Madison Square Garden Penn Station and all kind of places Greate room greate people that work in the hotel It could be small for more than  people with lot of baggae  
P => Not Usually a Fan of Holiday Inns Pleasantly Surprised For the second time within the last several months I have stayed at a Holiday Inn property not generally my lodging of choice and I have been pleasantly surprised and pleased with my stay  The staff was very courteous and equally accommodating  Our room was immaculately clean and the entire hotel seemed to be clean and well maintained  The room was a bit small with a view of another building as weve often experienced in New York but it was well equipped and comfortable  There was a nice whirlpool bath that opened up to the guest area all of the plumbing fixtures worked properly no leaks no clogged drains the towels were soft and absorbent the mattress was very comfortable and the ventilation system worked well  There was a recycling bin in the room but I would have liked to have seen energy saving lighting There are some shortcomings to the property but not enough to detract from my rating  Other reviewers have mentioned the noisy guest room doors and this is true  If guests are not careful the doors will slam loudly echoing down the hall  Loud guests who engage in conversation in the hallway can also be disturbing but this only occurred once during the night  The breakfast area is a bit too small for the size of the hotel but I asked another couple if we could join them and we enjoyed a pleasant breakfast conversation  The food selection at breakfast was okay but could have been better  For example if the bananas are not ripe dont put them out Probably the biggest shortcoming with the property is the fact that the validated parking garage is about half a mile away  Really Depending upon the weather a guests ability to walk the distance or other factors this could be a problem  It certainly is not convenient  On the flip side the validated parking reduced our fee from over   for one night to the hotels   rate I have pointed out the propertys shortcomings and minor complaints but let me once again emphasize that we were overall pleased with our stay particularly the cleanliness of the property and the courtesy of the staff  
P => Life in the fast lane This hotel was chosen for two reasons   Broadway show and proximity The hotel is   mile away and a great walk  Driving to New York is hell and getting to this hotel by car was an adventure in itself  The hotel is great in terms of its amenities but they really should have a contract next door  Not wanting to park and drive anymore I ended up parking next door at which the guy told me  overnight  You can almost tell when a guy is lying just to make a living  To me that was okay  I did end up paying  the next day but that  extra was worth not driving a street over and  blocks away on rush hour traffic walking and doing it again the next day As for the hotel eat breakfast early  The place was so full of people that I just ate outside where there are chairs and tables despite the cool weather  There are only  or  computers down the basement and needed the printer to print my boarding passes  The room was cramped with  adults  seniors and a child but was worth the  special which equates to person  With the free breakfast this hotel was a deal  Our walk at midnight felt safe and did not feel threatened in any way  A street performer actually sang quotbring your baby homequot on our way to the hotel  
P => If again in NY It is my only Choice I chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and I cannot say how happy I am from this ision  The location is great The staff are great especially their supervisors called Gary and So helpful and welcoming  The breakfast eas the best on its range  It has every thing you need for a good hotel  unbeleivably great location near major atractions and metro stations The only weak point is that  lifts are not enough for a  storey building  
P => Nice choice Good location only a few blocks from Penn Station  Comfortable hotel with very helpful desk staff  Quiet clean nice room for NYC 
P => Surprise surprise   a NYC hotel that s nearly value for money We recently enjoyed a  night stay and were very pleasantly surprised at the high standard of this hotel  Features such as complimentary breakfast although best to eat before am to avoid the rush and internet were the icing on the cakeWe had requested a quiet high floor room and although we were initially allocated a low level room at check in our prompting soon had this altered  Our room was modern comfortable and well equipped  If only the door had offered better insulation from corridor noise it would have been perfect Location wise the hotel was greatWe found its central positioning enabled a realistic walk to many attractions although the subway or taxis were never far away As far as eating goes we enjoyed fantastic Japanese and Greek food in the immediate area  Next time we re in NYC we know where we ll be staying 
P => Loud Small Expensive and poor value Well after paying almost  for the weeks stay i expected to at least be able to eat breakfast until am  on  occasions during the week breakfast was packed up early  The rooms need some kind of sound deadening and the locks were so loud that when people were getting back to the hotel all night long we were woken up  Rooms wouldnt be cleaned until  pm th floor and we were almost always back at the room after a whole day in the city before the room was offered to be cleaned  Absolutely atrocious  The room was so small i was honestly feeling claustrophobic Seriously Im sure the value and clenliness and service would be better at a hostel     take my word for it Im pretty forgiving whn it comes to hotel and after staying in  different hotels whilst in the states for a month this was BY FAR THE WORST and MOST EXPENSIVE 
P => Great Value Location Accommodating Staff I was here with a group of  high school studant  There is not mauc in way of ammenities but there is a continental plus breakfast  The staff was extremely accomodating rooms were updated and very clean but they are small  Location is excellent if you are trying to stay in the middle of lower Manhattan couth of Central Park  
P => Great location very clean  fab hotel good location for subways buses and walking of course  BUT take ear plugs the corridors are very noisy or rather the people that insist in having phone conversations not in their rooms       The doors slam and someone ided that their dog neeeded a break it spent hours barking one nght non stop whilst they were out  Like others have said breakfast was busy but only near am get up early and youll have no problems  Safety deposit boxes behind the reception readiky available so was the tea and coffee  The rooms whilst small were spotless the bathroom immaculate  
P => Excellent location and facilities We stayed in this hotel for  nights and had no complaints at all  Very central location close to  tube stations and literally  mins walk to Macys and the Empire State Building  The room was not massive but big enough the bed however was massive and very comfortable  Nice touch having tea and coffee in the rooms and the toiletries were also very handy Breakfast was excellent and saved us a lot of money  Great choice always hot and tasty Try Amadeus pizza for excellent good value for money food  th ave a few mins from hotel try the old fashioned bakery opposite for desert and Brother Jimmys Barbecue was very good too We would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definately stay there again  
P => Better than expected In NYC for a convention at the Javits Center and spent  nights at the HIE  a fifteen minute walk  The room was small  there was about a foot of space between the corner of the bed and the wall which you had to squeeze through to get to the bathroom which in comparison to the room is spacious It was okay for me traveling alone but I wouldnt try to fit more than  people in that room  There is no closet just a little armoire  The mattress and pillows were really comfy  Really clean modern bathroom  The only thing that really bothered me was the fact that I could hear when anyone opened their doors at my end of the floor  Sounded as loud as if it were my own doors latch  Kind of annoying in the middle of the night  The front desk staff was pleasant  Breakfast was good  The coffee is suprisingly really good  Internet service wasnt that great  signal wasnt very strong  The neighborhood felt safe and Penn Station is about a  min walk  I will definitely stay here again when traveling to NYC  Clean up to date furnishings nice bathroom cheap parking around the corner and in a great location  Cant beat if for night for a weekend stay  
P => Central Location and Good Quality This hotel is very good if youre willing to walk shortish distances or to pay for very short cab rides  The rooms very extremely pleasant  A very good breakfast including cooked food waffles doughnuts biscuits cakes cereal   hour coffee urn in lobby  High quality gym  Internet in business centre worked but took a while  Wifi throughout hotel Really enjoyed stay  
P => Great value great location Great hotel  Just a few minutes walk from Penn Station or Madison Square Garden  Very convenient for Macys Hotel itself is on a quiet street so you get a ent nights sleep after all the sightseeing  The room was clean and comfortable  The staff were friendly and helpful  There were  PCs with internet access available which was handy  Free tea amp coffee was available throughout the day which was great  The breakfast buffet has cereal some hot food pastries yoghurt etc which saved us a lot of time and money  Overall we thought it was great value for money and an enjoyable weeks stay  
P => Good location for MSG pricey for HI express Stayed  nights with my wife and some friends  Was right at MSG for basketball and hockey games  A bit of a cab ride to time square although there is a subway station a block away  The rooms were the smallest I have ever encountered but be thats how NY is Breakfast was crouded but they had some ent continental and hot choices  Really no complaints except the price but NY is NY and location costs  
P => Great clean and good location Friend and I stayed here in ember  Was clean and staff were friendly  Fantastic location right near the train station th Avenue and  minute walk to Times Square  Room was small but hey arent all NYC hotel rooms tiny e got a great breakfast every day in with the deal and had free internet access  Would stay there again in a heartbeat Quiet and Clean and god location   and reasonable for NY price  
P => Clean affordable convenient Stayed two nights at the HIE MSG in e   Overall fairly pleased with experience  Room was of ent size around  sq ft for NYC  good for price paidquality level of hotel  Free hot breakfast was fairly good too although breakfast area was always overcrowded and very busy  Some issues with elevators while staying there  one of two elevators wasnt working at times so often resorted to taking the stairs or waiting a long while  Even with both elevators running often long waits at peak hours with a full house Rooms are clean comfortable with modern or  Nothing special but functional and attractive  Location is convenient to MSGPenn Station area and heart of Chelsea is just a few blocks south of hotel  Discount parking was available for day at a garage a few blocks away  a good deal for the area check with hotel for details Id consider staying here again if I could get a room at a good price  Rate in late e was around night  not a bad deal  
P => Overall a good place for a budget traveler but with some inconveniences I have stayed at this hotel  times and choose it when I can get a very good rate   they often have lower rates than other nearby hotels of similar quality and I have also landed on this hotel via Hotwire  The hotel is clean safe in a good location and the room furnishingsbedding are in good condition  Rooms are quite small even slightly smaller than typical Manhattan rooms with just a body wide space to walk around  sides of the bed  However there are a few moderate inconveniences First there are only  elevators for a larger  story hotel and there is no arate staff elevator    so expect long waits every time you go up and down particularly around check out times  It is particularly inconvenient that the elevator stops very often for hotel staff members getting on and off including housekeepers and their carts on multiple occasions we stopped at  different floors just for hotel employees getting onoff   at times hotel employees were in the elevator when it was full leaving guests to wait for the next one  Secondly we called the hotel front desk because the bathroom fan was running x and could not be turned off  We were told that most of their rooms on high floors are required to keep the fans on and nothing could be done  Even with the bathroom door closed you could hear a constant fan humming through the door which was a little annoying    the good thing was that on the th floor with every little NYC street noise   overall this will not prevent me from staying here at a good price but it does prevent me from giving this hotel a high score  They have an quotOKquot free continental breakfast    mostly pastries juice coffee yogurt etc     nothing special except the fact its fast and free So if you find a bargain rate and can live with the above inconveniences this is a good place to stay  I suggest asking for a room between the th and the th floor high enough to minimize NYC street noise while avoiding the highest floors to minimize elevator inconvenience and the fan problem noted above  
P => Wonderful stay Was extremely pleased with this hotel and the location is great  Every staff member encountered from the time we walked through the doors was very friendly and welcoming  This will be the first place I check for future stays in New York  Reasonably priced comfortable accommodations variety at breakfast buffet conveniently located to Penn St and great places to eat  It was an all around wonderful experience  
P => Really liked this place I stay in hotels    x a year and Ive stayed at probably  places in NYC  This visit was with my dhter for fun  The hotel was very reasonably priced  The room was tiny However we spent very little time there so the more important criteria were that it was well situated an easy walk to Times Square and very near the subway close to some fine Chelsea restaurants clean and quiet  The staff was very helpful  I did not use any of the workout facilities  Wireless was free and fast  The restaurant was vastly overpriced for breakfast so we only made that mistake only once  Overall a very good experience  
P => Great Location nice hotel Got a great deal on this hotel using Hotwire where you dont know the actual hotel until youve booked  The hotel rooms are fine although without any stunning view or anything our room looked down into a courtyard but we werent in New York to look out of the hotel window  The complimentary breakfast was good   the cinnamon buns were just the least healthy possible thing to eat Im sure but they tasted good  The breakfast area was too small to accomodate all the people but we got down to breakfast at around  and it was fine   a little after that and it became a nighte and just got worse until we left the hotel at about am The location was great within walking distance of a range of nice bars and restaurants on th street I think down towards Chelsea  The complimentary quotbusiness centrequot was some PCs with free printers so you could check in online if necessary very useful if flying with Delta   what a horrible terminal they have at JFK But thats another story Complimentary coffee is available all day which is nice when you get back from tramping round New York all day Overall very nice hotel and Id recommend it  
P => Excellent alternative in NY We stayed at this hotel for three nights and we were very pleased with it  Clean good rate for NY looked modern free breakfast good location very close to Penn station th St  etc The only tip I can give you is that you should go to the breakfast early in the morning otherwise you will end making a line to get it and you will not find a seat and will ahve to take it upstairs to your room  
P => Great Location Great Customer Service I was able to get a room for six nights with two double beds with my rewards points for our family trip  We found the location to be great  We have stayed at Holiday Inn Express hotels in quite a few states so we were used to the wonderful breakfast that they serve  At this hotel the space is a bit small but we never had trouble getting a table  Our room was very clean  The people at the front desk went out of there way to be helpful as did the gentleman at the concerige desk  The only thing I would probably do different if I was to go back is get two rooms  I had been warned by many friends that the rooms in New York were a good bit smaller than what we were accustomed to  It was true However a family of four managed to make it for six days with a little organization  A helpful tip I have used for travel would be to take a clear Over the Door shoe holder for the bathroom for your tolietries curling irons and such  It helps with the clutter and gives you a little more counter space  
P => will be back   Fantastic stay stayed here for a few days before thanksgivingSpotlessly clean and the breakfast was a welcome surprise 
P => Excellent Stayed here th th ember  My sister and I had booked two rooms and requested that they were next door to each other which they were  Check in was super quick and the staff were always helpful and friendly  We both had a double room and the rooms were lovely  Theyre not huge but not tiny either  Perfectly fine and cleaned very well on a daily basis  Breakfast was good and plentiful   lots of cereal fruit yoghurt toast and some hot items eggs sausage pancakes     but its true the breakfast area is small and does get crowded  But we did get a table every time we ate at the hotel so its not too bad  The best thing about the hotel is its location    minutes away from MSG and Macys  We did a lot of walking but also took the subway quite a few times and its a  minute walk from the Hotel  The basement also has about  computers connected to the internet which you can use for free  
P => Great Customer Service I enjoyed receiving excellent service  The room I was in was not to my expectation the front night auditor suggested another room and I ided to keep the one assigned and waited for my request  I received what I asked for and enjoyed my stay  The entire staff were very nice and on top of that the early breakfast was free hot and very enjoyable                  I loved the stay 
P => great location good price for NYC    breakfast Good price through Priceline for NYC  Rooms are a bit small to be expected in NYC  Hotel seems clean staff helpful  Ive stayed a couple of times with no complaints  The breakfast is very good  Pleanty of space  Free wireless internet  
P => Great little hotel This Holiday Inn Express is a terrific value located a couple of blocks south of Madison Square Garden  The neighborhood wasnt prime but within a few blocks are restaurants bars and shopping Macys Herald Square  We arrived super early in the morning were able to store our bags no charge and we hit the Grayline UptownDowntown Loop Tour a great way to get the lay of the land  When we returned to the hotel we checked in and went up to our room  The room was quite small but spotlessly clean with a nice new looking bathroom  We did have a slight bit of noise Saturday night sounded like there was a dance club nearby but it wasnt that loud and we were able to put in our earplugs and sleep away  The complimentary breakfast at this hotel is extensive  and delicious There are omelettes sausage biscuits cinnamon rolls bagels and the list goes on and on  Its not a  star but all in all a great place  highly recommended 
P => Great hotel great location HI Express at Madison Square Garden is a great hotel  It is conveniently located only  block from a red line subway stop and is near Macys Penn Station and some great restaurants  The continental breakfast is great includes some hot items in addition to bagels donuts muffins cereal etc  My only complaints   I had requested a cot when I made my reservation and called to confirm it and when I got there they told me that my room doesnt allow a cot only the handicapped accessible rooms  Also we were in room  and it was right behind the elevator shaft  I think this made the room quite a bit smaller and also somewhat noisy from the sound of the elevator  Overall it is a great hotel at a great rate I paid  a night during Columbus Day weekend  
P => Great Location I was a big fan of this hotel  First the positives breakfast was good with a good selection of food the location was excellent with the th street stop on the  train only about a block away and Penn Station about  blocks there are lots of food and bar options in the immediate area the rooms are OK sized by NYC standards the staff was great and the street is relatively quiet for NYC  Now the negatives I would reccomend staying on a lower floor as there are only  elevators for the whole hotel and the wait could stretch to   minutes during busy times also the breakfast area was terribly packed making it difficult to find a seat and get food  Overall a good value in a great location  
P =>  nd and rd  Breakfast was fantastic  Rooms were clean  All the staff was pleasant and helpful  Guests were quiet and friendly  We would highly recommend this Hotel  
P => Loved it My husband and I have just got back from spending  amazing nights in New York  We booked our stay with the Holiday Inn Express after a last minute cancel of our pre booked hotel   Hotel Pennsylvannia thank god   the reviews for this hotel are really bad  We were really happy with the Holiday Inn Express in Madison Square Garden  On the first night we were placed on the first floor right next to the lifts  This was unfortunately really nosiy especially when everyone came down to breakfast in the morning However after notifying the front desk of the issue they kindly moved us to the th floor which was a lot better The rooms are a great size and very clean They provide you with ample towels and nice little creams and shampoos  The TV is HUGE and has all the major channels which is a nice break after a long day of sightseeing and shopping  The added bonus of staying in the hotel is the morning breakfast  Whilst its no gourmet buffet some toast and coffee really hits the spot It also means you dont have to go wondering the city for breakfast in the morning  The location is good but considering we spent most of our time in Time Sqaure and towards Central Park it can be a long walk back  There isnt much around Madison Square Garden itself with Macys located some  blocks away  Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for those looking for a short break to New York  Whilst people say that a hotel is only a place to sleep it really makes a difference to have a nice clean room with a comfy bed and pillow  Enjoy 
P => Great but not for Business Travellers This is a very nice hotel just a few blocks south of Madison Square Garden  It is a block from the Red Line  making it extremely easy to get to Times Square Wall Street and South Ferry The rooms are small but clean and quite nice  Id give the beds a     for comfort The only problem I had was the advertised quotHigh Speed Internetquot never ran faster than k thats th dial up speeds for the non technical  Web pages would rarely if ever load under these speeds and technical support for us business travellers is impossible  I had to pack up my laptop and haul it down the street to find a coffee shop with a more reasonable connection and pay for it  It would have been nice if there was an option to pay for a faster connection INSIDE the hotel like many other hotels provide But as a traveller on vacation Id stay here again without hesitation and probably will during my next visit 
P => A Very Enjoyable Stay Ill try and put this in a nutshell  Customer service was exceptional throuhout the hotel  Staff were always curteous and never kept you waiting  Check in and out were fine with no problems  The rooms were very clean and well stocked with towelstoiletries  Good selection of TV channels Clock radio has an MP attachment which was a nice touch if you like to take your music with you  I would describe the size of the rooms as cosy  As long as your not planning to move in for a month or two the rooms have plently of storagewardrobe space for a weeks stay  Bathrooms are compact but no drama to use  We had a room at the back of the hotel which tended to be quieter at night  On saying that the hotel is set off a main road so theres not too much noise anyhow  The express start breakfast was a winner Just what you need to get your energy up for all your walkingshopping or business needs  We are early risers and there was no waiting on any of the mornings of our stay  Dont let the mention of cues by others put you off  They should have gotten up earlier After breakfast is over the coffeetea section is kept stocked all day and is complimentary for guests  For getting around you are in a perfect spot  Subway is  minutes away no matter which way you are heading  Empire state Maddison Sqaure Garden Times Square and Macys are all just around the corner  We had a long walk downtown to Brookly Bridge  It took a while but it was nice to take a look at Chelsea and Grenwich village on the way  This hotel represents excellent value for money compared with other hotels in Manhattan  A little tip I became a priority club member when I booked  Just for the seven nights stay I have enough points for a free nights stay somewhere already  Also as a priority club member the hotel will deliver breakfast to your room  You also get a paper under your door  Oh and nearly forgot  Hotel has free broadband in the rooms and if you dont have a computer they have three on the cellar level for guests to use  I would have no reservations about booking this hotel again  
P => Good Location Great Stay My husband and I were visiting New York for the first time in t of   We chose this hotel after much research  It really was a good value great location and very much recommended by other travelers  We got the the hotel about  hours before check in and they allowed us to stow our bags while we left to do some sight seeing  We came back at about pm and checked in  The staff was friendly and helpful  The lobby was clean and stylish  Check in was fast we were put in the room that we specifically reserved  Our room was clean and nice  The bathroom was a touch small but managable  If I were a high maintainance kind of woman I might be put off by the size of the bathroom but as I am I wasnt bothered by it  The bed was comfortable tv was good bathroom products were many and lovely  Lots of space to put clothes  We stayed for  nights and never once had any kind of a negative experience  The staff was VERY helpful  They helped us find the best way to get from point a to b and assisted us numerous times  The business centers internet was down while we were there  We needed to look up a time for an event we were attending and the staff actually looked it up for us at the front desk  I was very impressed at the customer service  We were able to stow our bags for hours after check out as well  The subway is just a few blocks from the hotel  The neighborhood seemed fine  We walked back to the hotel late every evening and never were worried about the neighborhood  Over all I was very impressed on every aspect  I would go back again  
P => Good find in NY We ided on this hotel after trawling through numerous brochures websites and reviews on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed with our choice  Situated one block from the nearest subway and a few streets from Penn Station you can reach anywhere from this hotel in very little time really  The best way to get around Manhattan is by foot however so make sure you take a good pair of shoes for walking  From the hotel you can be at Macys Madison Square Gardens The Empire State Building within  minutes or so  Times Square is a straight walk from the hotel up th Avenue in  minutes  As for the hotel itself it has everything you can expect from a Holiday Inn Express clean adequate accommodation friendly staff buffet breakfast  The breakfast area does get busy but you can eat anytime between   am so if you have to wait for a table its only for a couple of minutes  We had a family room with two doubles very nice and a large bathroom  The wardrobe space could have been bigger but there was plenty of drawer space  Our room had a view of the Empire State Building and the street was quiet on an evening the only noise was the air con which you control yourselves  New York is an amazing city and we are already planning a return visit for next year  I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again  
P => Agree with all the positive reviews This was a great base from which to see NYC  Subway station one block away took you uptown and downtown  Empire state  mins walk  Macys similar  Madison Square gardens  mins  Totally agree with all the positive reviews and would always recommend this  A tip for all the British visitors   US Holiday Inn Expresss I have stayed at many of these tend to be much better than the full service Holiday Inns rather than the opposite here in th UK  I would always recommend staying in an Express over a full service  
P => Very Pleased Flew to NY for a job interview and this place really had such a helpful staff  I needed help with the computer printer downstairs and they jumped fast to help me  While I was downstairs I told them a bulb burned out in my room and they were up and replacing it before I got back up the elevator to my room  The front desk people were always really nice  The room was nice  I loved the football leather chair at the desk  It was a nice cozy king bed room  The bed took up a good part of the room but it looked really nice inside and it served its function well for me  I appreciated the ironing board and iron and hair dryer  The breakfast was really nice and yes it gets crowded downstairs at breakfast time but it was a nice choice of eggs sausage cereal oatmeal coffee oj cranberry juice apple juice yogurt sweet rolls toast bagles whatever  I was so pleased that I chose this place  And there is a little mini Staples Office Supply and Copy Center right on the corner of the block    perfect if you forgot items for your business presentation    small things like paper clips notebooks printer ink sheet protectors tape pens whatever they had it right down the block from this wonderfullly located Holiday Inn Express  This place was comforatble    especially nice for out of town visitors who feel safer in a place theyve heard of before  I wasnt expecting much when I arrived and I was pleasently surprised  I will   stay here again 
P => Helpful Staff Good location   Very noisey over the weekend We stayed at this hotel either side of a cruise holiday  I have to say that as this was our first visit to New York the hotel was ideally located  The staff were very polite and helpful and I can only re inforce the other reviews I have read about the breakfast situation  Basically very crowded  The only real gripe I have was that our second stay was over the weekend thampth ust and after arriving late back at the hotel on both nights we were all awoken by load music from what i can only assume was a nearby disco  This loud thumping bass noise finally subsided around am  We were in room  on the side of the hotel This said I would recommend this hotel and judging by how busy it was the whole time we were there the message is spreading fast  
P => Great location in NYC I had read reviews ot this hotel before I left for NYC  They were mixed  I loved the hotel location and the people working there were the best Breakfast was great  If you like to walk as I do this place was perfect in Manhattan  I was centrally located with Times Square not far away and Penn StationMadison Square Gardens right around the corner  The rooms are small but perfect for me as a solo traveler  Two people would be comfortable also  I saw many families with children staying there The price was good too     location 
P => Nasty rude reception at  AM Me my wife and son stayed here for  nights  y   Small rooms but very clean and new and very well looked after  Very convenient location for us for the theatre district  Nice but to us overdone cooked breakfast with all extras bagelsl etc The breakfast room was crowded worse then Penn station Our only complaint was the surly receptionists one at  AM when we were heading for JFK airport to return to London the other when we checked in The African American at check out  am on th y was bloody rude and wanted to quotcomplete his auditquot whatever that means and asked if he could send our bill by fax after ignoring me for a fair period when we were rushing to JFK airport  I did get a print out before going but the rudeness at  am was something I could have done without  
P => Great find in NYC We stayed at the Holiday Inn express one night before embarking on a Canadian itime cruise  We needed two rooms as we were a group of  and there is no such thing as a room for  in NYC  My husband had enough Holiday Inn points that we were able to secure two rooms for points  A savings of at least  We had two rooms   both smoking  One with a king bed and the other with two doubles  Both rooms were immaculate although really small  The bathrooms were a nice size and there was enough room for storage for a night The front dest staff were very helpful and most pleasant to deal with  And the breakfast the next morning was more than enough  But its true what others said   it does get very crowded so have someone grab a table first then you can get food  We saw many people standing around having something to eat  Its too bad the eating area couldnt be a bit bigger All in all a nice stay in NYC   I would recommend it to anyone  
P => Pretty Good overall We are Holiday Inn Priority Club members and we booked this hotel using points  It is small many in NYC are but clean with a ent bed and bath  Front desk and concierge have been a pleasure to deal with and helpful  Parking is relatively inexpensive for this area at   per night with hotel stamp  The only real downside is the noise level which can escalate if you have ungracious guests or housekeping around you  Adequete breakffast is free with stay  All in all a gem if you are looking for a clean moderate place to put your head down in between fabulous activities in the greatest city in the world 
P => GREAT VALUE and GREAT LOCATION This was a quotgirls tripquot and our first time to NYC  We didnt want to spend all of our money on a hotel but at the same time didnt want to sacrifice our safety either  This was a perfect hotel to accomplish that  Its central location made it easy to get to the attractions quickly and it was also an easy walk to almost anywhere We walked from Ground Zero all the way through Greenwich Village and Soho just to see the neighborhoods and it wasnt too much trouble  Dont do this if you have somewhere to be quickly   it took a while We also easily walked to Times Square and the Theater District Rockefeller Center the Empire State Building and Central Park  The hotel is nice enough   comfortable and clean  The breakfast is a big plus   it is way more than a continental   in fact there are many hot items each morning and you can count on the cinnamon rolls to start your day off right  We ate such a hearty breakfast we could skip lunch and have a nice dinner  The staff was very helpful and friendly especially a male concierge working the bellstand the morning we arrived  He stored our bags and helped us with a map so we could go out and hit the city before we could check into our hotel  Obviously there are much nicer hotels in the city but if you would rather spend your money having fun and eating well this is a great find    and you could tell that the staff really want to make the experience pleasant to build its repeat clientel  As two women traveling together we never once felt threatened or not safe at ANYTIME while in NYC  Just be alert and st and everything will be fine  
P => Fantastic Stay We stayed here for one night on e   We were in town for a Broadway show and wanted an average place to crash after walking all over the city  We were pleasently surprised to find this hotel only  blocks from Madison Square Garden yet on a very quiet section of West th in the quaint hipster ville of Chelsea  The King size room was normal   nothing super fancy but clean and enough room to actually walk around without having to climb over the bed  No construction going on anywhere and a suprisingly low amount of outside noise The free breakfast was nice  Egg sausage biscuits with gravy toast cereal oatmeal juices and hot cinnamon buns  But the nicest thing was how long they agreed to store our bags even though we had already checked out They said they would keep bags until PM I know most NYC hotels will store bags but not for this long  They were very pleasent The number one reason we loved them was the fact that we called them from our second nights hotel after midnight to tell them we had left an I pod in the dresser draw and asked if they could check and see if it was still there  We didnt have high hopes that it would happen but the woman at the front desk went and got the I pod and took our address assuring us that she would have it in the mail that day Penn Station is right up the street as is a convenient subway line that will take you to ChinatownLittle Italy  Avoid the overly priced Stage Deli around the corner but do try Super Mac an awesome quotall varietiesquot of mac and cheese joint  If you love clothes you can walk up to Herald Square W th and shop at Daffys a designers discount store  
P => Nice stay great location   This was a really nice room and a little bigger than what you expect in NYC  Very clean and new  The only drawback is that we slept in one morning and the maids there start slamming doors at about am  Its really obnoxious so dont stay here if you want to sleep in til noon  Otherwise its a great stay  The contracted parking garage is about   blocks away  u drive u park u walk All staff were pretty pleasant and professional  One great perk was that there are three computers in the quotCquot level with internet  free All in all a nice stay and would have been great with the door slamming maids  
P => Great Location and Staff Loved the location  min  walk to Penn Station  mins to subway on th st  The staff was excellent hotel was very clean and comfortable  Breakfast bar was very crowded and too small for the amount of people using it though  
P => Excellent hotel tins Travel Rule No  well one of them anyway is never ever stay in a Holiday Inn Express  New addition to rule No   except this one  Its pretty good  Clean modern and my free upgrade room with whirlpool bath was large by NYC standards and very comfortable  be a little off the beaten path for tourists but Chelsea is charming and all the sights are an easy walk  It worked equally well for me as a business hotel with a workdesk free wi fi in the room and a ent enough business centre for a budget hotel  Reception was extremely welcoming fast and efficient as were all the staff  I will definitely stay here again especially as its just  m inutes from the office  
P => Great Location Great Hotell and Great Breakfast I thought this was a fantastic hotel  Okay the room was on the small side  However the amenities were great  The bathroom had a bath and shower and the free toiletries were extensiv and to a very high standard  The complimentary breakfast really set you up for that days exploring  I cant believe the variety and quality of the food provided plus there was free tea and coffee proviided thoughout the day  There was everything from fruit yogurt bagels and muffins to sausages hash browns and egg and this varied daily Madison Square Gardens was literally just around the corner and Macys about five minutes walk away which was good when transporting all the packages back to the hotel It would have been a  minute walk to Times Square Found reception staff to be good  One recommended a Chinese close by we arrived late at night which was really good  
P => Beat expectations Myself and two friends stayed here at the beginning of il and we were all very happy with our stay  We arrived an hour and a half before check in but were immediately told we could go straight to our room on the th floor with a nice view of the Empire State Building  The staff were all friendly and happy to help with any queries The location was the highlight for me a min walk to Madison Square Garden and the nearest subway station  We walked to most places anyway Times Square was around mins away Macys around mins Central Park around mins walk The room itself had everything you need was modern clean and had a very nice bathroom Breakfast being included was a bonus fair enough the selection was limited but its free what do you expectThere were also  computers which were free to use and very handy for things like checking in for your flight online On our final day our bags were stored free of charge for us once we had checked out which was helpful Overall for the price we paid this hotel was excellent value and is ideal for anyone visiting New York on a limited budget  
P => Disappointing all around Being fairly familiar with the Holiday Inn brand and its owning chain InterContenintal Hotel Group I unfortunately have to say that this location was not up to par Trying to remain objective and not rant this is a breakdown of the highlights of my recent stayThe room was not ready when promised at pm regular check in is pm and I requested an early check in amp Im also a gold member of the hotels frequent guest program Upon check in and interatcing throughout the stay and when checking out none of the staff were very pleasant The whirlpool in the room which I paid extra for was not working and took two maintenance workers about  minutes to noisily repair  Also the glass partition between the bathroom and bedroom rattled loudly  There was also low water pressure in the shower and the shower curtain was torn and mouldy Another few problems included the phone beside the bed was not working and the room was missing its quotDo Not Disturbquot sign  When notified the staff did nothing about this      which caused the housekeeping staff to wake me up while letting herself in around am Overall about the hotel though         the location is a bit quotoff the beaten pathquot so I would not recommend travelling alone at night in the area  The hotel is very close to Madison Square Garden but about a   min  ride on the subway away from the main tourist area Times Square The hotel lobby and hallways seemed to be fairly clean and well kept although the room needed a bit of plaster amp paint repair  The exterior and entrance areas were also very presentable One major benefit which is available at all Holiday Inn Express locations is the quotexpress startquot breakfast which consists of unlimited hot food and drinks for no charge  Another plus is that they stored my bags at no extra cost until the room was ready Overall I would NOT stay here again and would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I know  However I would highly recommend the Holiday Inn Express just uptown from this one at Fifth Ave  and th     it was far superior and very impressive  
P => Nice but expensive I was in NY to see Bruce Springsteen at the Madison Square Garden so for me the location couldnt be better The check in worked out fine so did the safe deposit in the reception as well as the baggage storage on the day of check out The room was as usual in New York not too big but had a rather big bathtub which actually was a jacuzzi   nice surprise The TV had the usual cable channels In New York you dont spend very much time in your room but it was a great bed to sleep in at least  So Im happy with that The breakfast included which is very rare in the city was one of the better I had  Not very environment friendly with one time use plates and glasses but apart from that good  Different breads cupcakes cereals fresh fruit and juices  The juices and coffee was available  so that was perfect when you came back after a long walk When I was leaving for the airport I was in a great hurry  So I asked them to order a cab which they gladly did   for an extra fee of  They told me taking a cab on the street would be cheaper but I didnt have time to chase one  That was really bad for a hotel with prices rather expensive even for New York  The hotel I stayed at in  called for a cab and no extra fees at all  This lowers my grading of this hotel but its great except from that  
P => good reliable base for New york tourists Hi this hotel offers good facilities and a great position for tourists visiting New York  as a single traveller the king size bed and room was plenty big enough for doing what you need a hotel room for  sleep  Bathroom perfectly adequate too and the breakfast whilst nothing special is enough to kick start a busy tourists day The situation of the hotel is very good with easy access to the subway system Talking to some other residents its quite clear that rates vary massively so check as many websites as possible before booking Foodwise just  yards down on opposite side of road is an indian cafe Sagwat first rate cheap indian basic food highly recommended  
P => great location good value Holiday Inn Express MSG NYC is a good bargain for those of you who wish to be close to everything while in the Big Apple  The location at th St is perfect for shopping and sightseeing and there are lots of interesting things around The hotel itself is above average  The rooms  be a bit small and the cost is high enough but its nice and clean and the building is all new  Also there is free internet access as well as free breakfast  Hot and cold food is served every morning between    AM and its a good breakfast  Cereal bagels yoghurt and fruit as well as omeletts sausages and pan cakes are on the menu I would definitely stay at Holiday Inn Express MSG again 
P => Clean and Friendly I was recently in New York City for a church conference  I received a discounted rate of  per night for a king bed  I took the M bus and then the   train to Penn Station  The hotel was easy to find only  short blocks down from Penn Station and  short blocks from Madison Square Garden  Although I arrived a few hours earlier than check in a room was available  The front desk workers were polite  The room was clean  The room had no funky odor or worn down furnishings  The bed was moderatly comfortable but missing a comforter  There was only a thin blanket to cover up with other than the two standard white sheets  The room was warm so the blanket worked out fine  The bathroom was small but clean  Housekeeping cleaned the room well during the afternoon  The hotel offers an okay breakfast in the morning  The breakfast consisted of three juices coffee biscuits and gravy eggs doughnuts and so forth  If you want something more there are plenty starbucks coffee shops around on every other corner almost  There is also a cafe called The Bread Factory located between th and th  The Holiday Inn Express is ideal for visitors who want a deal and do not mind a  minute walk to visit Time Square  If you need to be closer to Madison Square Garden there is a hotel called Affina that is directly across the street  The short walk from th to rd street was not bad  I highly recommend this newly renated hotel  
P => Affordable and Comfortable If you are looking for an afforadable hotel in a good location this fits the bill Rooms are small but comfortable The breakfast is not gourmet but it is included in the room rate convenient and has enough variety that it should meet most everyones needs  A little crowded and hectic but overall acceptable The staff seemed very friendly Location is great for transportation  Very short walk to Penn station and either Penn Station or th St subway We got the room for night which seemed like a bargain for NYC  
P => Exactly as described on TripAdvisor As I was looking for a hotel in New York within walking distance of Madison Square Garden I chose this Holiday Inn Express mainly based on the reviews on TripAdvisor  And I must say they were spot on  The hotel was relatively reasonably priced for the area it was clean nice breakfast rooms were ok in size the comfort offered was very nice  And the Garden was a very short walk away    If you need to be in mid town Manhattan this hotel is very much worth checking into    
P => Great deal good location easy trip Stayed at the HIExpress near MSG from    Received a rate of  on priceline which was FANTASTIC for the area because the massive dog show was in town and hotels were very pricey This is the nd Holiday Inn Express weve stayed at and I found the service to be quite good again We arrived early after flying the red eye and our room wasnt ready not until pm  They did check our bags for free gave map and suggested some places nearby to check out for lunch while we waited We found the front desk and concierge staff to be very helpful   we asked a ton of questions looking for good restaurants  HotelWell located not the nicest street    located in the middle of a bunch of fur wholesalers  Very central to  of the train lines perfect for sightseeing or getting to any other area of the city  Close enough to walk to MSG and many shopping areas  Walkable from time square as well The free business centre is really useful open all hours with free printing  Great for making reservations and printing hard to find mapsBreakfast was varied different combination of baked goods and a couple warm items eggs omlettehardboiledscambled and sausage  Good bagels the first day but I didnt see them again  Nothing too exciting and they dont really refill anything so if its busy and you arent there early you  miss out  But it does save you some Room was fine i didnt think it was as small as many people have mentioned  Ive seen MUCH worse    but yes it would probably be uncomfortable with   Big bathroom good toiletries  Iron in the room  Comfortable bed and bedding The only problem we really ran into had nothing to do with the hotel really   it was other guests  Due to the dog show there were many dogs amp owners staying in the hotel which was a bit noisy due to thin walls  We were woken up am by our noisy neighbours preparing to leave for the show  The hotel did try to help and posted signs asking people to curb their dogs Overall the value is very high at the hotel  If you get a good deal its completely worth it for the location alone  
P => Great value Stayed here for four nights night on Priceline   incredible for Midtown  Room was clean staff friendly   all good  
P => Perfect location  We were in NYC for an NHL game at MSG  Also took train from NY Penn Station to Newark Penn Station for another game  The Holiday Inn Express Madison Sq Gardens was perfect for us walking back at night after the games only  blocks Our room was on the small side as everyone says but Ive been in smaller  We didnt have big wheely suitcases so it didnt seem to bother us  Id say its a fair economical size  There was a desk and chair coat cubbardcloset and tv armoire with drawers along one side and beds with table between opposite It was clean and comfortable  Quiet except for the neighbors door  The doors slam and our neighbors werent considerate  The doors were right next to each other in a small hallway so that might have increased the noise a bit  The bathroom had shampoo lotion mouthwash etc  and a wall mounted hair dryer The subway   and   were round the corner on th Avenue and the ever popular Duane Reade pharcy across the street from that  We ate at two local Bar amp Grills Mustang Sallys and Harringtons  We enjoyed both dinners Will definitely return to this hotel  One suggestion for travelers using NYC transport   our drivers didnt know the location of this hotel make sure you do They seemed like they  have been more familiar with another Holiday Inn and when we said on th between th and th they seemed surprised  
P => Great value We headed into NYC from the burbs to see a band we love and wanted an affordable place to crash after a late night  This Holiday Inn Express fit the bill perfectly  Check in was quick and easy and as a priority club rewards member we both received complimentary bottles of water and chocolates  We paid    tax for a non smoking king bedroom on the th floor which faced th  The room was very clean and the bed was made up with the comfy upgraded bedding found in most Holiday Inn Expresses  The room was on the small side but more than adequate and the bathroom was super clean and perfect for our needs included all the usual amenities  shampoo conditioner bath gel bar soap lotion mouth wash and a shower cap  The complimentary breakfast included the usual HI Express items cinnamon rolls toast muffins bagels fresh fruit yogurt juices cereal tea coffee hot cocoa hard boiled eggs and a few hot items including french toast sticks hash browns and omelets  Even at am on a Saturday morning we still found all the choices readily available breakfast runs from am   am and the hotel was packed  The hotel is located a very short walk from a subway station at th and th and if you walk a couple blocks east you will find many nice dining choices  We also opted to park at the Central Garage on th between th and Broadway  With validation from the HI Express parking at this garage costs only  per  hour period  The hotel also checked our bags free of charge so we could roam the city unencumbered before heading home  It was a great deal in my favorite city 
P => Perfectly acceptable Hotel is located a couple of blocks from Madison Sq Garden so its a bit of a walk to Times Square  Subway picks up at the Garden though so you can still get around easily  We pricelined this for  and the room included breakfast for all buffet typical Holiday Inn which really isnt that bad and free wi fi  Parking was a bit of a mess  the hotel has a contract with a garage a few blocks away  its about  hrs  Theres a lot directly next door thats day  When we checked out we put our bags in the car and came back for it later in the evening so it was nice not to have to leave the bags with the hotel or roll them down the street to our car I would stay here again if coming to the city on the cheap  Hotel lobby was clean rooms smelled fresh but were very tiny  dont recommend for more than  people no major noise issues  
P => Great Hotel in a great location We were looking for a hotel for our New Years Eve Holiday  Most places were outrageously expensive but the Holiday Inn Express near MSG was just perfect It is spotless and the staff is very friendly The breakfast was great for the price and plentiful The location cant be beat  A couple of blocks from Madison Square Garden MSG lots of subway stations walking distance from Times Square Empire state and all the shopping areas you  need my wife loved thisThe staff told us about a shuttle that leaves from MSG and takes you to the buses for the JFK or Newark airports so you save a lot vs  the cab fare or the hassle of carrying luggage in the subway  We have absolutely no complaints and will definately stay there next time were in town  
P => Great experience    would definitely return Looking for a cheap place to stay in New York we booked a room on Hotwire for  and expected the worst  Instead we found courteous staff and a spotless room stuffed with all the amenities  Besides the free continental breakfast they also offered snacks and coffee throughout the day  The location was hard to beat with easy access to two subway lines and all the taxis you could hope for just half a block away I would also like to note the desk clerks were not phased in the least by us clearly being a gay couple  
P => Pleasantly surprised Very pleasantly surprised I got a great deal on priceline at  nt and I thought a HI express would be very plain The staff was very nice The rooms are nice very neat and clean and classya little small but typical for NYC They also have  computers with FREE internet for guest use downstairs  
P => Great Stay My mother and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Madison Square Garden and we enjoyed it  We didnt have the greatest view or the largest room but then again we were only looking for a place to sleep since we were out so much  We were only two blocks from Penn Station   which was great since we went into Brooklyn several times during our stay  We also enjoyed the free breakfast although it was a madhouse each morning because that cut down on expenses for us  There were even snacks coffee and tea waiting for us in the lobby when we returned each nightThe only complaint I have is that there were a group of high school kids that stayed on our floor one night  They were loud and obnoxious   but that had more to do with the kids than the hotel All in all I would stay again 
P => Clean and Nice NYC hotel My mom and I stayed here for a  night weekend  We found it to be a very nice place to stay  We only paid about  a night so considering that it was a great place for the money  The staff was quite icy and tried to put us in the worst room possible because we booked on priceline  I had to beg for a non smoking room  But once we got to our room it was a ent size for NYC and very clean  The beds were very comfy and the bathroom was nice too  It is located only a couple of minutes walk to the   subway line  The breakfast was good for a continental  I would stay here again if the price was right  
P => GREAT Customer Service My husband and I arrived on a red eye from the West Coast at around  in the morning and not only did they find us a room to freshen up but they had breakfast waiting and freeGranted it is not the best breakfast you have ever eaten but it is free or included in the room price if you want to look at it that way and very convenient  In addition to a large selction of muffins rolls and pastries they serve cereals juices toast bagels amp cream cheese and some hot items every day   scrambled egg or omlet bacon or sausage  I prefer bagel or cereal to the hot stuff Our room was lovely small as all New York rooms are but clean and comfortable  We had a jacuzzi tub which was wonderful after a long day walking around in the cold city The hotel is close to Penn Station and so with a short walk you can get anywhere on the subway or buses   buy a metro card  Free use of computers in the basement for checking out restaurants or tourist info  Everything we needed was taken care of quickly and courteously I would definitely stay here again 
P => A great place nice hotel rooms very clean cleaned every day staff very helpful and friendley breakfast excellent good selection of food hot and cold would stay there again well done holiday inn and staff 
P => A plus plus plus Great hotel for the price    in fact I felt like we didnt pay enough for what we got  Free computerinternet access downstairs w a printer free morning breakfast hot and cold hash browns toast muffins cinnamon rolls etc only thing is you gotta wake up early for the good stuff before its gone  Located right near the subway entrance on th street when you leave the front entrance of the hotel take a right then another right and youll see it right there  Also a Duane Reade drug store is right there  Great stay great experience would definitely stay there again in the future  
P => Better than Hudson Hotel or Club Quarters Downtown I stayed at Holiday Inn Express Hudson Hotel and Club Quarters Downtown and the Holiday Inn was my favorite For the price this place cant be beat Pluses  Newer rooms mine had a King sized bed and bathtub  The toilet did get plugged once but the service was very speedy   Free breakfasts get up early to avoid the rush and get doughnuts   Friendly staff    different people helped me with directions   Quiet rooms   The Hudson Hotel was very noisy in comparison  Regular TV without ads when you turn it on   Free coffee and juice all night  Subway  line is one street down Negatives  Only  elevators makes it pain to go up and down in the morning   The room was pretty small only two suitcases could be opened  Congested lobby during breakfast 
P => HI Express Madison Square Garden We stayed in this hotel from th ember to th uary  and found it to be clean and comfortable  The room wasnt particularly large but more than adequate for a weeks stay  The jacquzzi bath was a nice touch after a long cold walk in the city and the room had a big tv as well as hairdryer and coffee machine but no kettle although the catering area in the lobby had hot water and juice available hrs  The hotel stored our bags for a  dollar fee per bag and the staff were helpful although they didnt have a clue about how to contact a dor for medical advise  The hotel is within very easy reach of th st subway Madison Square Garden and Macys and several manned taxi ranks are a few blocks away  The only bad points were the crowded breakfast area in the morning   get there before  to get a table and the continual thump thump from a nearby nightclub that started at pm and didnt stop till  the next morning  Our room was at the back of the hotel so I dont know if the rooms overlooking the street were affected  Overall a pleasant stay but I cant help thinking that spending an extra couple of hundred dollars to stay the riott or Sheraton would have been a better stay  
P => Good Value First I have to admit that I used my hotel points for this stay so I think I got a fantastic value The hotel is in good condition and in a convienient area to get to any location on Manhattan  Taxis are readily available and the subway is a short walk away  The free breakfast was good but it was fairly typical of a Holiday Inn Express  The rooms are on the small side but comfortable well appointed and clean  What made this hotel stand out to me was the attentiveness of the staff  I travel for work regularly and it is rare to find Holiday Inn Express staff this enthusiastic to help tourists  The people offered the quotWOWquot factor here  If assistance in getting around town is important to you then you will find this hotel worth the money The parking garage is a few blocks away  If you have to park drop off your bags first it is a bit of a hike  Again I didnt pay for the room so I was more than pleased with the value  I think if I had paid more than  a night I would have felt like I didnt get anything special  
P => Excellent value location and service  I dont usually write a review after a holiday but after staying here I thought I should  We came to New York for a few days before christmas and it was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in The room was quite small but why do you need a big roomthat was the only slight negative I had We arrived about  hours early and they allowed us to go to the room early which a lot of hotels dont The location was great as it was near to most of the places people go to New York for Room was very clean Bed and TV were quite big  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff i e  safety deposit box directions etc Breakfast was great very good selection of fruits and cereals and sausage and egg Coffee and Tea available all day long When I come back to New York again I will definately stay here again GARY 
P => NYC Myth Buster This was an amazing hotel with amazing service  This was our families st trip to NYC and this hotel provided everything our little country crew from TEXAS needed  The staff was excellent and very courteous  Our visit was during Christmas and the front desk provided everything I forgot from a Phillips screwdriver to local directions  I even got advice about how to buy knock off bags while in the city  The rooms were small but extreamly tidy and clean  The bathroom provided me with the evening escape that I usually take at home with a nice bathtub for a warm bath The free breakfast was a great start but nothing major bagels toast sausage oatmeal and fresh fruit I will stay here again and again  
P => Good Location  Small newer hotel in a great location parking right next door for day   Very clean rooms and breakfast area   Inexpensive for the City night   Very short walk to Madison Square Garden areaPenn Station for subway   Nice employees   Very comfortable bed and pillows   Our only quotissuesquot Small rooms but who cares you arent going to be in your room much anyways and garbage truck pickup in the wee hours of the morning woke us up each night our room faced the front th  St  
P => Better Value Hotels now open in Chelsea Stayed here three times now and each time the hotel is losing its charm  When it first opened everyone was so friendly  Now check in will not try that extra bit  First two rooms we had were with the Whirlpool tub but this time they were sold out  The Whirlpool rooms have a glass wall in the main room with a door that can be opened so seem much larger than the regular rooms which I found tiny this time  Maids do not seem to care about what noise they make  this starts at about am  The rooms are also very claustrophobic  Fine for one night but if you are here for a week as I was you want some light  Breakfast is a mad house and although free I preferred to walk down the road and avoid the hem  This time staying at the Hilton Garden Inn on th Street just a block away and the rooms are twice as nice  Really comfortable beds flat screen TVs with hundreds of channels  Best still the Breakfast is possibly the best I have had in NY in this type of hotel  One big complaint is the elevators  only two for  rooms Service is also so much better than at the Holiday Inn Express  
P => Superb location but the bedrooms are only good for dwarfs The location is excellent  being only three blocks from Penn Station four blocks from the Empire State Building and well within just ten minutes walk to Macys Time Square several subway stations restaurants etc so theres no need to worry on this accountBuilt in  in a city where space is always at a premium the architects obviously figured on cramming in as many revenue generating rooms into as small a footprint as possible so its a compact hotel but with helpful and extremely friendly staff  This said typical for NYC the rooms are small  Very small  In fact they are so small that you can turn the light off at night and be in bed and asleep before the rom goes dark     but again this is NYC and therefore this is to be expectedThis said the bathrooms the small bathrooms are clean modern and well appointed the rooms are well presented the beds are very comfortable the elevators two are slow but they work and whilst the included breakfast  be Continental theres enough choice for everyone with all day coffee being a nice touch Affordable rates an excellent location great staff and high standards all go to make this a very attractive place to lay your head for a visit to New York even if the rooms are more than a little on the compact size Thats English for small Recommended for short people or those who if sharing a room know each other very well  Not recommended for anyone with claustrophobia 
P => Great Location   Better than most hotels in the area Small room but pretty standard for New York  When we first arrived our room had a foul smell but we were quickly moved to new room no questions asked  It turned out the foul smell was from the AC unit when switching from AC to Heat to AC etc  Bed was above average  Shower head was nice and high so those of us over  dont have duck under do wash our hair  Nice complimentary breafast every morning and usually had eggs and some meat sausage links or patties waffles or pancakes juices and coffee as well as some pretty good cinnamin rolls  Juice coffee and water was available for free  hours in the lobby Three block walk from Penn StationMadison Square Garden and restaurants of every ethnicity are within  blocks any direction  Local placed delivered which helped make up for the lack of room service We flew into Newark and took the trains back and forth and to wherever we needed to go  Path NJ Transit  and ABC lines of Metro and Amtrak all in one place   perfect if you want to skip the rental car   which we did Free in room wireless as well as a computer room next to the gym  Three computers with printers so you can print directions and boarding passes etc  We had associates staying at other hotels in the area and from their descriptions we made out way better especially with the newness of the rooms and free breakfast There was an onsite concierge but we didnt use himher   but they were always there in the lobby Definately a recommend for tourists and business travelers without a car  Didnt seem to have much for kids though but it was right in the middle of Manhattan  so not a kid friendly type of place anyway  
P => served its purpose but dont take the shuttle Stayed here Sunday through Thursday of last week  We arrived at the hotel early which we planned asked if we could leave our bags until we checked in no problem but it costs us  a bag  Came back at  pm and our room was ready  The room was clean and very comfortable a bit on the wee side but convenient for me because the class we were taking was directly across the street The breakfast was good you had your choices daily of pastries breads muffins fruit yogurt cereal there was always an egg of some sort like an omlet one day the next a scrambled one  Always a meat like the sausage  Its the first hotel Ive ever stayed at that offered all this for FREE One thing I would tell you for sure is dont take the hotel shuttle back to the airport when you leave  They tell you they will pick you up and youll get to the airport at a certain time but in my case they were late picking us up by  mins and then made  more stops for people and we got to the airport alot later than we wanted to Just call a car company we used one to get to the hotel and it was  for two of us Subway is right around the corner on th street  If I ever go back to New York I wouldnt have a problem staying at this hotel again  
P => Good location Basic Hotel We booked this hotel late so hotel price was quite high   about  per night  This however is a basic hotel and for about  per night I stayed in one of the best hotels in Tokyo right in Ginza  But this is New York and basic hotels at short otice command very high prices The location is very central however and places like Time Square would only be about  min walk away The breakfast in the hotel was basic and like all american food loaded with carbs   you had cereal but the yoghurt to put over it was sweet and the juices Cranberryetc  also came sugared  The bathroom in the room was fine and so was the room   quite acceptable as a place to stay but not in any way luxorious  However the awalls in these rooms are paper thin   you could waisly hear people coming and going or even speaking in adjoining rooms The area around the hotel is quite rundown but seems safe   I never felt uneasy around it evn though a lot of constructon was going on resulting in poor lihgting and scaffolding all over the palce If I were in NY again I would happily stay at this hotel if the price were considerably less Best Shopping is in Jersey Mall  
P => Good Value I just returned from a stay at this hotel and would have no problem staying there again It is a short walk up th Ave to Times Square and the Theatre Districtabout  minutes It is also close to many Subway lines so you can get around the city easily Rooms are small but you arent going to New York to sit in your room One drawback is only  elevators so at peek times you might have a short wait to get one Also no express checkout from your room I saw some long lines at times waiting to checkout Area around hotel looks a little doubtful but I had no problems during my stay Free hot breakfast is a nice plus Also staff was very helpful in answering any questions  Well worth what I paid  
P => Pricey but beautiful comfortable and very well situated  My husband dhter and I stayed at this hotel when we were dropping off my dhter at college just two blocks away  This hotel is beautiful   the rooms are very nice the beds are extremely comfortable  The staff was very accommodating   our room looked out over the back and was sooooo quiet     Its not a huge room but a good size for New York and keep in mind that we had five huge pieces of luggage in the room which did not get into our way at all  The hotel is an easy walk to Times Square but it is about  blocks away or so  Breakfast was great   we just had an excellent experience here  It is not the cheapest but you could pay a whole lot more for less also  We would definitely stay here again 
P => Loved it My husband and I spent  days and  nights at the Holiday Inn Express NYC Madison Square Garden  We loved it  The location is great   safe and fairly quiet even in the front of the building though you can hear doors slamming if other guests arent careful  The rooms are small but all you are doing is sleeping there  The rooms are updated and clean  Breakfast is great   hot and cold foods  Just get there before  a m  The guests have usually eaten most of the food and the staff starts clearing everything away  The staff at the desk are friendly enough and the concierge is helpful in pointing you in the right direction helping you book tours etc  We travel fairly extensively but our focus is always on the city not the hotel  If you are looking for luxury you wont be looking at a Holiday Inn Express anyway  With this little hotel you get exactly what you expect good clean rooms at a low rate we paid night through Priceline   which is a great rate for NYC a substantial breakfast with the perfect location to walk the city grab a subway etc  We highly recommend staying here and would do it again  Oh   and try the cinnamon buns   they are awesome 
P => Very impressed We have just stayed here for  nights and found it overall very good in many ways  Room was quite small but it was fine for what we wanted as we were out most of the time  It is well located for many things and easy walking distance for the subway  Breakfast was good too  Very good value for money  
P => Excellent service but tiny rooms We stayed at the Holiday Inn Chelsea     We booked a double room and it was tiny  even by NYC standards The pictures on this site cannot convey how small the rooms are There is a nightclub nearby and we heard the bass thumping until am  The location is very convenient to both Penn Station and the th St   train  The neighborhood is a little dodgy  esp at night some street people etc  Breakfast is free with hot and cold foods and coffee and juice is available   Not a bad choice if you are familiar with NYC and just need a place to sleep but for first time travelers to nyc I would recommend a midtown location  
P => Holiday Inn Express Chelsea is AMAZING I stayed at The Holiday Inn Express in Chelsea back in  of  for the New York City Tattoo Convention and believe me it is all its cracked up to be  The hotel was spotless and clean as was our room  Our room was on the th floor the only problem with this was they only have  elevators so sometimes you would have to wait a couple of minutes  The room was a typical city room pretty average size but really how much time do you spend in your room It had that just cleaned smell and it was spotless the bathroom was very clean as well  Right around the corner from the room was a snack machine as well as a soda machine with reasonably priced snacks and soda in case you got a craving for something in the night  The breakfast was amazing as well they had muffins coffee which was brewed throughout the night scrambled eggs bagels cereal toast pancakes orange juice and a few other things  Needless to say it all tasted great  Downstairs from the lobby is a computer room with  computers as well as a workout room If your not familiar with the city the hotel is located on W th street between th and th ave  You have  great affordable restaurants right around the corner as well as access to the subway This hotel really was everything I had read and I will definitely be staying there next year  
P => Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel from   with  friends  We had a room with  double beds  The room was very small only about  inches between the bed and the wall and  feet between beds  We werent in the room much so it wasnt a big deal I wouldnt want to have little kids in this room  The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable Breakfast was great as long as you dont want the hot items  The eggs were flavorless  The french toast sticks amp sausage tasted like cheap frozen food heated badly  That said the bagels toast cinnamon rolls doughnuts cereal fruit and yogurt are great  Having the juice available all day was nice As far as noise I could hear people when they were in the hallway but not when the were in their room  My room was in the corner near the stairwell so it wasnt too bad The area around the hotel seemed safe  It does quiet down at night though and gets a little dark  I would definitely stay at this hotel again if the price was right  
P => nd trip to Holiday Inn Express This was our nd time to New York City also our nd time to Holiday Inn Express Madison Square garden  This hotel is so nice clean the rooms are a little small but who cares when you are in New York City you will not be spending a lot of time at the hotel anyway  The breakfast buffet is awesome and they have hot breakfast such as eggs sausage ECT  They also have a juice machine that is in the lobby area that is available for free juice all day long it s nice to save a few dollars on a bottle of juice or a can of soda we just went to the lobby and got a cup of juice  The location of this hotel is great the subway station is just a block away  There is a very good pizza joint  block from the hotel its right across the street from the subway station if you stay at this hotel you have to check out the pizza place it s the best pizza and mozzarella sticks I have ever had  There is also a restaurant right next door to the hotel the left hand side they serve pasta but do not eat there they have horrible food and it is a bit pricy for what you get  Over all the Holiday Inn Express is a wonderful hotel and is very much worth staying here  
P => Great Hotel We group of three stayed in this hotel for a week in e and enjoyed it The hotel is in the fashion district between th and th Avenues in upper mid town Manhattan close to Madison Sq Gardens and Penn Station Macys and the Empire State Building  Its about a  minute walk up to Times Squarend Street There are two local subway stations   one on th and th Avenue where the  line will take you down town to the Battery Park area where the ferries for LibertyEllis island depart  Its only two blocks up to Penn Station on th Avenue where you can pick any number of lines that service different parts of the city The area is quiet in the evening because of the number of fur shops in this street but its very safe  Having said that the area around this area of th Avenue is definitely a bit quotseedierquot so I would tend to come ingo out via th Avenue which is far more attractive Getting back to the hotel itself the location is great as you will have gathered  The rooms are somewhat small if you have two beds in them  The beds  by the way are Doubles   not Queens  However the rooms are adequate if your intention is to spend as little time as possible in your room and get out early to explore the city  The rooms were cleaned every day and fresh towels left The clientelle seemed to be split between families on vacation and business people staying for short breaks The breakfast room is on the ground floor opposite reception and for a complimentary self service breakfast is very extensive   teacoffeejuices   toastbagelsmuffins   fruit   pastriesdoughnutsmuffins   cerealsporridge   eggbaconsausagehash brownsThe breakfast area tends to get busy between am and am but is good before and after this time  You can pick up refreshments anytime during the day  A nice cool juice drink is just what you need after a walk from the sub way There is an Internet room in the basement and a small gym beside it  I also found the terrace out the back which is quite sizeable and well laid out with tables chairs and parasols but no one seems to use it while I was there  The hotel could do more to advertise this nice little extra Having been there for a week probably puts me in a good position to see the positives and negatives about this hotel but I have to say in all honestly that there are little or no down sides in staying here  All in all I would recommend this to a group of  people willing to share a double room that require a central and safe location to explore the city  
P => Good location good clean hotel Small hotel in the centre of New York  The rooms are a bit small but very clean and well maintained   bathroom clean with lots of clean white fluffy towels  The reception staff were very helpful and friendly  My  year old son and I spent  nights there in a queen double which was very tight on space round the beds  But we didnt go to New York to spend all our time in our hotel room   we wanted to see the sights and the hotel suited our needs  The complimentary breakfast was good and you could eat as much as you wanted witih lots of fresh coffee fresh fruit salad as well as hot food  I thought the prices were a bit expensive but I would go back there again because of its location and cleanliness  Macys is just a short walk away and subway and buses nearby   you can walk to Times Square and Empire State building  Good internet business centre in the basement with printing facilities  I thought the area was very safe and would definitely stay there again  
P => fantastic location and breakfast We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for  nights while visiting New York  We actually picked this hotel after reading the reviews on travel advisor  The hotel is perfectly positioned for all the tourist landks   Madison Sq Empire State and Macys  Handy for the subway and just very easy to navigate from  First night we were booked into a ground floor room which unfortunately was near the kitchens and not far from the lifts  Being near the lifts meant the room was bit noisy and as they started breakfast early we were awoken early  So we asked to move   no problem  Next room on th floor was perfect   very quiet  The rooms are smallish but very adequate especially as we thought the room rate for New York was very reasonable  The inclusive breakfast was absolute bliss  The breakfast room can seem crowded but if you are patient you will get a table  Everything you could want for breakfast and more was available Coffee is available in the lobby all the time as well  Staff were extremely helpful  We had a fantastic holiday helped by staying in the right hotel 
P => NIce Stay I just returned from NYC  I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for the first time after many hours researching different Hotels in Manhattan  I got a fair rate of   USI stayed from e   The hotel staff is friendlythe hotel is nice and new The free hotcold breakfast is an awesome way to start any day exploring NYC The free wireless internet was nice but kindda slow I found the area of   blocks around the Hotel to bit a bit seedy I was not prepared to walk alone at night  Once you get beyond the Hotel I felt safer amongst more people The housekeeping staff leave things like bags of towels and vacuums and carts in the hallways quite an eyesore and clumsy to get around My room was small extremely small but that was okay since it was just the two of us and I prefer clean over a large room any day  I didnt really sleep well any night the ice machine and doors closing and people in the hallways kept waking us up  I recommend wax earplugs I would consider staying here again if the price were right and be if I were as far away from the ice machine as possible  
P => Good value but not a must return We stayed here at     e   We had a room on the th floor that was comfortable and clean  I would be willing to return here for a good rate but would probably consider other lodging first  The hotel was very full all weekend which made the elevators slow breakfast crowded etc   Despite the crowds we didnt have many noise problems  Slamming doors were definitely audible and I imagine noise could be a problem depending on your neighbors  Everyone raves about the breakfast but Im not so impressed  The hot foods are barely palatable the quotcoffeequot is brown water  I did appreciate the fresh fruit and yogurt though  And I also appreciated having beverages available at any time of the day  Location a very convenient location for sightseeing but definitely a business district that slows down as much as NYC ever does after hours  One last thing we were told that some aircon units in the building were not operational being a newly opened hotel they had just become aware of the problem and were in the process of replacing the faulty units  Fortunately ours worked but I overheard complaints from people in rooms without working aircon  
P => Nice enough Brand new facility in great shape Rooms are a little small but well furnished and very comfortable  I stayed here for  nights  On one of the nights a nightclub behind the hotel pumped the bass until am making it impossible to sleep  I reported this to the front desk they were aware of the problem and said they had contacted the authorities and the clubs owners but have not been able to agree to anything  I give the hotel credit for trying to remedy the situation  The hotel said that normally they would relocate me to another room however they were fully booked  The hotel delivered extra pillows and kind apologies to me  The other two nights were very restful  The location is good if you want to explore Chelsea or the Garment District  The closest subway is the   at th Street  Penn Station is about two blocks away I schlepped my luggage from there which was difficult but practical  I would recommend this hotel but be careful of room assignment  I think I higher floor or another room in the building would have provided relief from the club noise  
P => Great Hotel Overall it is a very nice and clean hotel front desk is friendly and they accommodated all my request My deal was about  per night and I think it is really a good deal if it is for a group of  traveling in Manhattan  Book it earlier and it should be a bit cheaper A credit to the breakfast different things everyday and many choices  better than any other roadside Holiday Inn Express I had stayed before Also they have snacks provided during the day and drinks for anytime    
P => Great hotel just spent  nights at this hotel on a weekend break with a friend and it was ideal for our needs  rooms are quite small but not a problem and from what i read about other hotels this is the norm for new york bonus is that hotel has only been open for six months meaning that everything is clean and new  we had booked a non smoking twin with two double beds  we ended up in a smoking room as we wanted to check in early   this was fine and even though the corridor smelt slightly of smoke the room did not  beds were comfy and room had air conditioning which was very welcome considering it was in the s F during the night and in the s in the daytimes iron and ironing board and coffee maker in room too which was added bonus  bathroom has bath and good powerful shower  clean towels every day and bed sheets changed every few days  free breakfast was a big bonus   although get there early if you want a bagel   they seem to go very quickly good selection   cereal toast bagels fruit teas eggs bacon fruit yoghurt   eat as much as you want it does get very busy so be prepared to take out or back to your room if you cant get a table  free internet available in the business centre downstairs  also there is a terrace somewhere in the hotel   we didnt have time to investigate though  location is very handy   very close to Penn station and madison square garden and a few minutes walk to Macys  easy for Times Square and Empire State Building which we could see from our windowall in all everything you would expect from a holiday inn express plus a little bit more  very helpful staff and great location made our stay a great one   i will be going back soon 
P => Great new Hotel I just got back from staying at this hotel it is a new hotel and is close to all the sights got a rate of   per night off their web site  you get a free breakfeast with your stay rooms are little small but nice and clean  
P => What a Gem I booked several rooms for a group of us attending a convention  We had waited too long to book and other hotels we traditionally had stayed at were booked i e Hilton  Everyone was a little nervous when I told them the Holiday Inn Express   what a surprise this place turned out to be  Yes the rooms are small but the place is immaculate and the staff is superb  The bathtub more than made up for only having a small cupboard for hanging clothes  I was lucky enough to have a room to myself so there were no complaints from me From the moment I hobbled in with way too much luggage these people went out of their way to make me comfortable  The hot breakfast buffet actually tasted ent in the morning and the hot snacks in the evening were an added bonus  I am a roamer and I felt very safe   sure there were some rather strange people on the streets but nobody threatening day or evening  Plenty of places to eat and drink around the corner in either direction  I cannot rave enough about the staff    What a pleasant stay it was  
P => Price is Right  Inexpensive and acceptable by New York standards Rooms are small but compact and nicely arrangedwith most of the amenities that you need for a shortstay  Since the halls are narrow and rooms close togetherthe slamming of doors is difficult not to hear especiallylate at night  If you are a light sleeper this  be a problemas it was for me Also this part of Chelsea near Madison Square Gardenis not the most desirable part of NYC  It is not close tosubways and not a neighborhood that you would care to strollin  But if you need a cheap place to stay and dont expect tolinger in the hotel then it is worth considering particularly ifyou get a discount rate e g  Priceline com Incidentially large tour groups are attracted to this hotel  which or  not bode well for the quality of this hotel  
P => Hotel fine staff terrible The hotel is fine  Its new    opened in ober  Room was tiny and a tad dirty Ive seen far worse in New York  Breakfast is very crowded hard to find a table Housekeeping leaves their carts in the hallway at all times if that gives you an idea of what kind of place this is My complaint in fact is with housekeeping  I was traveling on business I left my receipts on the desk in the room  Housekeeping threw them out  They were not near the garbage they were sitting in the middle of the desk  I spoke to the manager about this for my troubles the next day I returned to the room to discover the door to my room had been left wide open  Fortunately nothing was gone as far as I can tell  After all this silly me left receipts on the desk again shouldve known better and they were again thrown out  I even put a note on them to the effect of quotdont throw this stuff outquot    didnt matter  The crowning achievement was housekeeping also helping themselves to a small amount of cash that I left on the desk by accident less than   After speaking with the manager the first day I never heard from him again  Left him a couple messages Also really annoying is the fact that the street in front of the hotel was being re paved th St  They  started  work on it at pm and wrapped up around  in the morning  When youre on the th floor facing the street this is not exactly conducive to sleeping    I asked the front desk how long it would be going on and they just said they didnt know I went back outside and asked the workers  Youd think the front desk staff could at least take some initiative to do this and appear helpful    Id avoid this place  I certainly wouldnt stay here again  
P => Excellent hotel Just returned from a week in New York at the Holiday Inn Express Chelsea  Would fully recommend this hotel great location convenient for site seeing clean good sized rooms with huge TV great bathroom with a strong shower and comfortable bed  The breakfast is free and copious hot and cold eggs bacon pancakes waffles bagels muffins etc restocked every hour or so until  am  Coffee and tea available all day   very welcome after a days walking Very reasonable rates   much cheaper than uptown hotels  Only one downside the noise within the hotel at night   it was spring break and loads of high school students invaded the hotel hence banging doors etc and the ventilation heating system is quite noisy  However these are minor disturbances and wed certainly return  
P => Excellent place to stay included breakfast makes it more valuable  It was a last minute ision we were planning to stay at the DoubleTree off of Times Square but we are sooo glad we switched  The building is so new it doesnt show up in Google Earth as of il   Every thing was as promised    the room and bathroom was super clean the provided breakfast each morning was wonderful   filling tasty and offered a wide variety  The coffee and juices were available  hours so we tanked up a thermos for the trip home  Both bell hops we left our bags with were friendly and competent the front desk staff was both friendly and efficient and when we called down to request new batteries for the TV remote they came by to replace them minutes later  The hotel was conveniently located one short block over from the th street Red  subway station and an easy five short blocks to Penn Station  To cap it off the room with our AAA discount was night less expensive then the DoubleTree which admittedly offered a much bigger suite with king size bed  The bathroom soap miniatures were all scented with cinnamon and were a real hit    we would buy the shampoo for home use if the HIE would sell it in large quantities than travel size    If pressed the only thinkg we would point to as a problem is that the elevators were somewhat slow  Otherwise a stellar recommended place to stay  
P => Great Hotel in great location We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Chelsea during the period     and it was an enjoyable stay  The hotel is conveniently located not far from the subway Penn Station and Madison Square gardens a short walk to the Empire State Building  We stayed in a room with a KS bed a little cozy but very clean and very quiet  This is a popular hotel as during our stayed they were booked out  We were a little worried it  have been noisy but it was very quiet during the night  Breakfast was very good one of the best I have experienced at a HI Express which consisted of a hot or cold buffet breakfast  Service at the hotel was excellent I would recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to NYC  The cost was pretty reasonable compared to many other hotels in the location Well done HI Express Chelsea  
P => Great Getaway I wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a romantic evening  As I was searching for hotels online I came across this hotel which is Brand new  story hotel  It opened up sometime end of last year  I booked a king size bed that featured a jacuzzi tub  I spread rose pedals all over the room ran a hot bubble bath and lit a couple of candles  The night was great and I scored extra points with my boyfriend LOL The breakfast also offered FREE breakfast every morning from  am     which I given a tray so I can give my love breakfast in bed  Since I live in the local NYC area I was able to call my friends for FREE and internet was also FREE  Staff was friendly hotel was clean and I was able to check in before pm I am definitely coming back in a month or two  
P => Such a deal We got a great last minute rate of  for a one night stay in mid ch  This hotel really exceeded our expectations  As has been said the rooms are small and the showers are difficult to figure out but this hotel is such a great deal at this price  Everything was spotlessly clean the staff was very friendly the free continental breakfast was extensive and the location was perfect  I recommend this hotel highly for this kind of money in New York you dont expect a stay this nice 
P => Excellent Holiday Inn in Chelsea Outstanding location in midtown  Near Penn Station for most trains in NYC and theres a station only  blocks away to catch the  train  Rooms are very very small but BRAND NEW facilities make this a great place to stay  Beds are exceptionally comfortable showers are awesome  HOORAY for the coffee pot in the room  Free breakfast includes more food than typically seen in this type of place  Even hot foods Dining area is tiny and traffic flow is a headache but manageable on this budget  Business center includes  computers and printers  Doors unavoidably slam which makes late night arrivers to your floor an instant unwanted wake up call  Front desk personnel very helpful  Location is really awesome and was perfect for my trip with  high school kids  
P => Loved everything Have just returned home from a four night stay at the Holiday Inn Express  Great Location within a few minutes walk to all the local attractions and can easily get a bus or subway to lower manhatten  Rooms were lovely and clean and the bed was so big and comfortable  We had clean towels everyday and the room was cleaned to a very high standard  Complimentary breakfast is included and we had no complaints  A variety of food from fruit bagels cereals hot breakfast including omlettes sausages etc plenty to eat and also buffett so eat what you like  Although there was no coffee facilities in the room coffee was available throughout the day in the foyer which was free of charge so after being out all day you can get back and take a coffee upto the room  All the staff were so helpful and with the location makes a prime place to stay  We are planning another trip later in the year and will certainly be staying here  
P => Cannot stress enough   Stay at this hotel If you are looking for an affordable and safe good night s rest after touring the city then this is definitely the hotel for you My boyfriend and I flew in to Atlantic City from Miami and took the greyhound to NY  When we arrived to the Port Authority we WALKED to the hotel  It was about  minutes away  On the way to the hotel we passed Madison Square Garden which was fabulous  The hotel staff greeted us right away and we were able to check in  hours ahead of check in time The rooms are small  We had a king size bed a TV a desk and a very small dresser  If you are traveling for over a week then you might want to upgrade to a bigger room  The room was super clean as the hotel is new and the bathroom was a bit smaller than the normal size bathrooms  The breakfast buffet was delicious and FREE  There is a business center with about four computers for those who like to check their emails frequently  Most importantly the hotel is in a safe and prime location  We were able to tour the city and walk back to the hotel at AM with no problem  When you exit the hotel turn right make a left on th street walk three blocks and you are in Times Square  Or you can continue on to th street make a left and run into Times Square AND th avenue shopping We did not use a taxi at all during our four day stay  We walked to Times Square Rockefellar Center MSG it was right next door and walked over to the subway station to visit Brooklyn and Queens It was a great hotel and extremely affordable  We are going back in the summer and definitely staying in this hotel  
P => Awesome stay at the Holiday Inn Express Chelsea My friend and I stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Chelsea in ruary of  we had the time of our life  We had never been to New York and had a lot of questions the whole staff at the hotel was so helpful and seemed so pleased to help  I work at a hotel myself so I was really noticing a lot of things that were excellent about this hotel  The rooms were spotless the hotel is in a very convenient location within walking distance to a lot of restaurants shopping and the subway station  The thing I want to point out the most is the helpfulness of the whole entire staff at the Holiday Inn Express  I will stay here again in the future  
P => modern hotel with great value   hard to go wrong here Its easy to make a mistake booking a hotel in NYC  Some old reated hotels are not up to modern standards  In fact only the really high end reated grand hotels measure up to a good standard  If you dont realize this you can spend quite a bit of money and not get the greatest accommodations   That being the case it is hard to go wrong with the Holiday Inn Express in Chelsea  It is new in late  and is very convenient to Penn Station Madison Square Garden Macys the fashion district and the theater district  The rooms are not huge but they are functional and were very clean  The continental breakfast was much better than what I expected  Along with the usual beverages and pastries they also had omelets bacon cereal and surprisingly good cinnamon rolls  It was a great way to start the day and spend money elsewhere john r 
P => Loved this little gem We found this place by accident and it was terrific  It is in a great location the rooms are lovely the staff are helpful there is a ent free breakfast and a business center with three computers Would highly recommend it We found a great rate of   per night Date of stay     
P => Highly recommended We were most impressed  This hotel is easy walking distance to Times Square  Broadway  Madison Sq Gdns etc and only a block away from the nearest underground station  While the room was exceptionally TINY one must remember that you only sleep there you dont spend many waking hours in it  We were even pleasantly surprised that the price included breakfast eggs bacon hash pancakes etc   we thought wed get a bowl of cereal at best  Filter coffee hot chocolate and fruit juice is available free of charge  in the lobby  Everything was clean and in good condition  Wed come again 
P => Great Hotel  I visited New York during the Christmas week   The hotel is located nearby main attractionsapprox min walking distance to Macys subway station Their continental breakfast is great the quality of bathroom amenities are well above the average the staffs are very friendly They allowed us to check in  hr early without any extra charge The rooms is quite small but has all the necessary items  The bathroom is in great condition I really recommend this hotelGreat value and great price    
P => Fantastic Deal When two friends of mine and I ided late last week to go to NYC together I counted on getting a ent deal through priceline com hoping that low rates on other sites for this time of the year meant a promising search on priceline  We got a very reasonnably priced room at the Holiday Inn Express in Chelsea  and have not been disappointed  The hotel is in a superb location two minutes away from the  line that connects you with everything and in the middle of one of NYCs hot areas fashion district clubs Empire State Buildng Chrysler Building etc   The hotel is quite new and thus in great condition our room was small but since you dont come to NYC to stay in your hotel we didnt mind at all  We lucked out and got a corner room on the top floor without a view but also without neighbors and it was thus very quiet except for the central heating system that hummed us into sleep  I read somewhere that the bathroom is always a good indicator of how much a hotel wants to save  but the solidly tiled granite  counter tops metal porcellain bathtubs the funky collection of mouthwash and shampoo etc  and the great towels made a very pleasant statement  The staff was incredibly friendly there is free internet access in the basement  and the complimentary breakfast is as good as in a European hotel  In my  years of staying in American hotels I have never seen such a generous buffet all included  even the coffee is great I will definitely try to stay there again even if I have to pay more for it than the great steal we landed through priceline com  A total find 
P => No Complaints Went to NYC for  nights at the end of uary and booked the hotel after reading TRIPADVISOR reviews  Had my own personal critirea and the Holiday Inn Express Chelsea fitted them all On arrival I was expected checked in in seconds was probably in my room less than  minutes after walking through the front door Asked for a quiet Executive Room and was put up on floor   Had the window open all night and the streettraffic noise was not bad at all  Shame about some of my neighbours on the floorThe room was very nice but not over large with big firm bed plenty of lights two phones desk clockradio TV amp the heatingAC unit that was fine and quiet  No safe which was a pain in the rear as I had to keep going down to reception  Its a modern fairly new hotel and should have had a safe in all rooms  If I has any complaints that would be my only one Storage in the room was qute limited but I was on my own so it didnt really matter The bathroom was bright clean and large with plenty of towels flannels comp shampoo etc  Shower was powerful once the receptionist drew me a map on how to get it working and hot and you didnt land up with the usual floods of water on the bathroom floor  Also had a whirlpool bath  Now here is the wierd thing   bathroom and bedroom were erated by a sliding opaque glass wall  You could either slide the wall open and step into the bathshower   or walk in through the door as normal  Really wierdGot the room at a what I considered to be an excellent rate and breakfast was an unexpected extra didnt realise it was included  The other suprise was that it was the breakfast quality was excellent with wide range of cooked items breads cereals pasteries fruits etc  Coffee was on tap  always hot and nice coffee too  That saved me a few bucksIn the basement was a fitness room  Although there were only three machines I never had to wait to use them  Next to the fitness room was a Business Centre with  computers printers and a photocopier   all free of charge  I think the whole hotel was wireless broadband and free Location was fantastic for me being  minute walk to Herald Sq and Madison Square Garden No complaints   would gladly stay there again  Only reservation was if there were two of us and we would be staying more a week or so the room might start to get a little cramped PS come out the hotel and turn left at the lights turn right and go up one block  Cross over the road and you will come a cheesecake shop  Do yourself a favour   GO THERE 
P => Dont tell anyone  Have just returned from  nights at the Holiday Inn Express  Was really impressed with the friendly staff and the room which was fine for the time you spend there  A clean comfy bed with a fantastic shower facility once I too had to ask how it worked so close to the subway is a real treat especially for the price The complimentary breakfast was a real surprise and got me through till mid afternoon without fail  The free internet too is a nice touch  These things cost so little to provide but show a willingness to provide a bit more than many larger and more established hotels  No restaurantbars etc but there are plenty to choose from in the location No complaints at all except that as more people get to hear about this gem of a hotel the price will inevitably go up  Hopefully I will return soon  
P => Snappy answers to stupid questions Like the previous poster I had lots of fun with the thermostat and the shower but after asking two stupid questions that they say have been asked by a lot of people everything was fine  There is still work going on in the basement and unless fully booked I cant understand why theyd put anyone down there The room itself was fairly compact but fine with a hallway leading into the proper room  Storage is at a relative minimum with drawers under the TV cabinet and only a skinny armoire to hang clothes up in  and the armoire was already occupied by an iron ironing board and an extra blanket  That said the bed was very comfortable with four pillows the bathroom was of ent size and once I got the heat and shower working all was right with the world Theres also an extended continental breakfast with both hot and cold food and coffee and juice available all day The location is great with the  subway line a block and half away and Herald Square a five minute walk  Got it for  a night through Priceline and if I could get that kind of deal again Id go back  especially now that I know how to deal with the heat pull down the thermostat cover and adjust it manually and the shower pull down the ring at the end of the faucet  
P => Great bargain in midtown manhattan The holiday Inn Express is a brand new  story hotel just opened in     We stayed during last week of ember and got a great bargain rate of  per night Imagine paying double price for a hotel in midtown manhattan during the xmas season The hotel has free continental breakfast every morning from  to  a m  but get there early before  a m  to avoid the crowds  The lobby area gets very crowded so get your breackfast early and eat it in the comfort of your own room  We got so full every breakfast that we skipped lunch everyday plus saved alot of money on brunch Location is excellent walking distance to many NY landks  Just exit hotel and turn north on th Avenue  You will get to Madison sqaure garden and Penn station in just  block Macys largests dept store is  blocks and Times Square is  blocks away  Manhattan city blocks are like rectangles very short north and south but very wide east and west  Dont drive in NY bc walking is faster since traffic is always congested in Manhattan plus parking is very hard to find  Location is very safe lots of NYPD officers around the area and plenty of people walking at night  However hotel room is very small about  sqft but that is expected bc space is a premium in Manhattan  Plus room walls are somewhat thin especially when other guests close their doors and take showers  You can hear some people talking in the hallways but it is mostly quiet at night  I would definitely stay at this hotel again for the convenient location new rooms free breakfast and great bargain rates  If youre on a budget this is the place to stay 
P => Bare Bones Choice in NYC We regularly visit NYC and have stayed at assorted hotels  This hotel is very basic but was fine  This is truly a Holiday Inn Express and if you would be happy with that in New York you will be okay  The staff was fine and there is a parking lot just next door if you arrive by car  While they call this Chelsea it is not the nice area in the teens which most New Yorkers think of as Chelsea  Rather is it just  blocks from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station which means the immediate neighborhood especially th Avenue toward the Garden is not the greatest  On the plus side you are a very short walk from Macys and the Empire State Building and you can easily walk to Times Square and the Theatre District  
P => great great hotel very great location and convenient  only one block to subway station  easy to get in any atractions in new york city room was clean and comfortable  bathroom was clean and modern  hotel staffs were helpful and compliantry breakfast was so great you can get not only fresh fruit and bread but also many choice of hot food  this hotel was great and rate was cheap and fair especially in new york city  i will stay in this hotel again 
P => Great stay but some noise issues  Everything thats been said about this hotel is true its a great location round the corner of the no  subway which will get you to the most important tourist hotspots  And just a few blocks from pennst street station for all business puposes  Cabs are not hard to find th down and th for uptown travel  Just walk towards any corner  Staff is great efficient and polite  This is not however your New England BampB but it doesnt pretend to be  Breakfast is a zoo when full but is provided with swift service  So you dont have to wait for food very long if they are out  Bathroom is great new and big enough   people in a room would be more than a squeeze though  If you have however stayed at a London or Paris budget hotel this is the RitzOne big issue for me is the lack of soundproofing  Or at least the doors not being soundtight at all  It wouldnt matter if you had the door wide open youd hear the same  Slamming doors the whole night people talking in the hallways etc  If this bothers you you should REALLY consider another hotel  We moved twice and although the staff were very helpfull it did not solve the noise problem  So bought earplugs and turned on the airconditioning to drown out the sound but still no better  Streetnoise is virtually non exitent due to great double glassed windows  Why dont you guys just finish it all off by putting in they right doorsIf they get the sound issues straightend out I would give them a  out of   So all in allIf youre a light sleeper MOVE ONIf you want to sleep cheap in a great bed with good morning food in a good location in a great new room and a smile on the staffs faces STAY HERE 
P => Just wonderful   great hotel in every respect My family and I stayed at this hotel for  nights for an after Christmas getaway   It was excellent in every respect  Things that are greatLocation   Cant get any better   just blocks from MSG Penn Station Macys Herald Square Times Square Price   Half of what you would get at any other Manhattan hotel Service   These are seasoned folks here  They were very accommodating when they could be and very matter of fact but pleasant when they could not  I sat in the lobby for some times and watched as they handled each situation with expertise and professionalism Rooms   Small   This is no shock since its NYC  But even through they are small they are designed very efficiently and everything about them is great  The beds are comfortable TV is good bathrooms are nice granite GREAT shower Luxury thick towels Wi Fi access is great and fast Breakfast   OK just do the math here  On average you have  folks staying in the hotel and they offer a great spread for  or so folks fire code  When its normal I bet its OK but when its sold out its a zoo a free for all   and New YorkersNew York tourists are great at shoving and being rude Elevators   you can wait a while since there are only  and there are no service elevators so the staff uses them  But they are clean and smell nice All in all you cant go wrong here  Its a new property so that helps and it  go downhill in the future but for now its a great choice  
P => Quality Accomadations My family recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Chelsea  We found the accommodations to be clean and of quality  Our room was small but I understand that small rooms are the norm for New York  The staff was friendly and very helpful and accommodating  The hotel is in walking distance of Penn Station  The location was excellent as well  Excellent value  I recommend this establishment 
P => Great Location This was a great hotel for our familys  night stay in NYC  The location is great   easy access to all the attractions  The staff were very friendly and accomodating from the front desk to the concierge desk to the housekeeping folks  The continental breakfast was perfect with a great selection and a welcome break from the expensive dining in and around Manhattan  The rooms are rather small for a family of  but they were just fine and besides we spent very little time there  The doors to the rooms are rather noisy when they close but other than that the rooms are surprisingly quiet  This was our first trip to New York and when we return we will definitely stay here again 
P => Great Just returned from an overnight getaway with my husband and stayed at this hotel  Great experience  The rooms and bathrooms were immaculate and brand new  The location close to Penn Station and all the quotactionquot and price were awesome  The only complaint was that the beds were a little hard and uncomfortable and they did not have a relationship with the local parking garage so you have to pay full price to park  Those were minor problems though  We will stay here every time we come to New York

P => Fantastic highly reccommend I have stayed here twice altogether on two erate trips to New York i would reccommend this hotel to anyone Rooms are clean nice size all staff are fabulous with great manners and cant do enough  If you want ideal location good price clean and not stuffy then this hotel is ideal However if you want the once in a lifetime trip to New York then i doubt this hotel will be for you because your expectations will far out weigh what this hotel actually offers  You cannot expect   plus at this gem but by god its smack dab where i think sums up New York at its best Downtown where everything is not over priced for the tourist unlike Midtown etc  I have NEVER EVER felt afraid in the areas around this hotel and being a hated smoker i even stood outside taking a phone call at am having a smoke and didnt feel at all frightend  I love this area and would and have encouraged friends to come here when they have travelled to New York 
P => Good Place Nice hotel near chinatown plenty of restaurant around and very easy access to the subway  Small room for  people but its new york  Clean room  I will go back to this hotel  parking is expensive look around for cheaper price  
P => The BEST in NYC Cris was the best front desk person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting  Always greeted the guest by name  She knew the answer to ever question I had about the area Premium customer service by the entire staff  
P => A great place This hotel is well located within Manhattan  Within walking distance of Little Italy Chinatown the subway and of course Soho  Service is good and you get excellent value at this Holiday Inn  
P => ent clean rooms good location for shopping This hotel is right up the street from Canal Street and all the great shopping in Chinatown and Little Italy  Its a mid grade hotel nothing really outstanding about it but clean ent  Train station is a few blocks away  The rooms are comfortable actually nice size for the area  I would stay here again if I wanted to be downtown and was looking for a really reasonable rate  Got it for just a bit over  which is never bad for NYC  
P => Clean Spacious Quiet for NYC   a great hotel Was in town for a wedding and got a fantastic rate  Room was spacious free internet nice meeting area on nd floor  In a great location for fun and walking on Canal and Lafayette near chinatown and some tourist shopping  This isnt a fancy area but a fun one for sure  I will definitely try to stay here again next time Im in NYC  
P => Good location near Chinatown My  yr old mother and I stayed here the week of t   It is right across the street from the newly opened Museum of Chinese in America easy walk to the subway Chinatown and Little Italy  I dont really consider this area Soho  Good Chinese bakery for breakfast the next block over  I would stay here again though it is far from where I usually go mid town and made for expensive taxi rides because my mother could not easily use the subway  If you can walk and use public transportation the location is fine  The room was big enough and clean   up to quotnormalquot Holiday Inn standards  
P => Great Location Great Service I stayed at this hotel over the weekend with a few girlfriends and it was definitely a great place to stay  We were in a very convenient location directly in the city   close to plenty of restaurants shopping bars etc  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and tips about the big city  The rooms were comfortable and clean  I look forward to staying here during my next trip to NYC 
P => You get what you pay for This hotel isnt as bad as some people make out  At least not for me The lobby is grubby and gives a traveler a feeling of apprehension for sure but the rooms are cleanwell maintained and all the furnishings are now  Some little extras too like coffee making facilities are nice  Iron and board lots of channels full length mirrors secure doors and generally good value  As far as Manhattan goes for room prices this place is a steal for the price conscious traveler but if you have more money and want something less basic then dont stay here But I dont think people see Holiday Inn as anything more than budget  
P => Fair My first time in NYC and thought Soho was a nice neighborhood  But this hotel is in Soho but I can say it was the beggining of Chinatown  During the night the street is empty until you reach Canal St  and did not look very safe to me  I was given a room facing Lafayette and when the metro passed by the room vibrated and the noise was unpleasent  Fortunately my friends were given a room facing the opposite side and they did not experience this  The room was clean the room had a reasonable size for the price paid but there were things lacking like a modern TV because it seemed very old a better preserved air conditioning old and temperature varied within heat and cold  The bed and bath had a good size  I recommed it just if you cant afford a pricier one  
P => EXCELLENT HOTELROOM   EXCELLENT SERVICE   EXCELLENT STAFF My friends and I were going to NYC to celebrate for a bachelorette party and I was stressing about which hotel to book  When we got there the front desk staff were smiling friendly and most of all helpful during our stay  Our room was exactly what we needed  GREAT location  close to everything   Food Bars Clubs SHOPPING  Amenaties were always plenty  We called for extra towels and they came rather quickly  I could tell the staff was very atttentive  The air conditioners were not noisy or bothersome but comfortable and nice during our stay in the hot y weather  Id definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great location friendly staff and good service 
P => Great Location This hotel is in a great location minutes to China Town Little Italy and seconds to the subway  Had free internet connection but was very slowThe room was a little small but more than OK for NYC the staff was great and very helpful I had a car it costs  to park for  hours and the parking area was  blocks away if you want to stay there I suggest parking your own car for half the price in the parkade around the corner  This is a good value we got it for  per night internet rate thru Holiday Inn website that was one of the best prices we could find in that area for a hotel of this quality  
P => good location   average hotel very average hotel    but if u want to stay downtown for cheap it is an option 
P => Great hotel   great location   awesome staff I stayed at the Holiday Inn while I was on a business trip  The hotel is right between Chinatown Soho and Little Italy  At night there was tons to do all within a few blocks  I had dinner most nights in Littly Italy  YUM Broadway is about a block away from the hotel and theres tons of great shopping there considered Soho be  My room was pretty nice bigger than I expected actually  The bed was really comfortable too My room was on the th floor and I had a great view of the Empire State Building I saw a lot of the same staff members there the whole week   like front desk clerks and bellmen  They were always super nice and helpful  Id read another review about some internet problems so I was a little worried as I do a lot of work in the evenings  My wireless connection worked fine the whole time   speed was good and never got kicked off  One of the girls at the front desk told me theyd recently upgraded their system  Either way it worked fine for me  Definitely a good hotel for business or a vacation in New York  Id love to spend a weekend and wander around the area more There was so much to see and do nearby Oh   and theres a subway stop less than a block away from the hotel  Its really easy and quick to get to Grand Central  
P => Great Staff and Location Just a half block norh of Chinatown is just right for me and my Son   we both love Chinese food  Great property in mist of everything great about Manhattan   Soho Greenwich Village Financial District and of course Chinatown  Rooms were excellent and the staff was first class  
P => For the money     not bad  I was traveling to New York for the first time and was with a friend so we didnt need anything fancy  I just wanted a place that was clean and safe  Ill break this down into different areas because somethings  be of more importance than other things to each traveler  Outside appearance There is nothing fancy about this building  If you feel the need for the big que    look elsewhere Lobby Again     if you like the big grand lobby with all the fancy are and waterfalls    not going to find it here Check In Having never been to New York but read tons about how the staff at hotels were not friendly and often rude   I was ready for that  At the desk was a girl named Chris and a manager named Jason  They both were smiling and welcomed us to New York  Unfortunately our room wasnt ready but it was before  and they offered to keep our bags while we went to lunch  They were always friendly and helpful Room It was small but I think all hotel rooms are small in New York  However   the hallways smelled clean the rooms were clean   the beds were fine  Again   if you plan on spending a lot of time in your room sitting around watching TV    want to go somewhere else but if you just need a place to shower and sleep   this place is fine Location Anywhere you stay is going to be great for some things and a hike for others  China town is just a few blocks away     the BEST food in New York is  blocks away down Mulberry in Little Italy  Theres a subway nearby also  See my New York review for restaurants and subway travel thoughPrice We payed  a night which is pretty cheap for New York I have  issue with the hotel however      not that big of a deal but I must mention it The free WiFi does not work   at all   ever    at least on the th floor it doesnt  They do offer a business center in the lobby for a nominal fee where you can go check your email and surf the net  My feeling is that if the provided free WiFi sucks     they should give you free access to the business center  It wasnt that big of a deal because both of us have iPhones and can get the net anywhere anyways but if you neededwanted to google for some good places to eat   you would have to pay   By the way   I recommend taking your iPhone or a GPS when you take off walking     much easier than a map  
P => Location is Fabulous This is not the Plaza   but the price is right and the location is fabulous It is a very walkable neighborhood with fun shopping in Chinatown and eating in Little Italy  The subway is right down the block for access to the whole of Manhattan  The subway ride to th street Broadway shows is quot away  It is a easy subway ride to Coney Island to check it out  Its close enough to walk to ground zero  The rooms are so so   who cares Have a great breakfast at Baltazar then go for a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge   then explore all the NYC sights  The staff was wonderful and extremely helpful I would definitely stay here again 
P => Excellent for the money  We used this hotel for a short city break this Easter   We found it excellent value in an exciting location  The hotel is clean and the rooms are made spotless each day the staff are friendly and helpful  The location is basically on the edge on Chinatown with Little Italy  minutes walk away  You are  minutes from Canal street subway which links you to the rest of New York subway system excellent and cheap  Dunkin Donuts is just across the road ideal for coffee and muffin for breakfast as hotel breakfast is overpriced but who wants to eat in the hotel  Location is walking distance to Wall Street and financial district ground zero if you dont want to use subway and you have a good selection of shops just up on Broadway again walkable  We are from Gloucestershire in the UK which is very rural and I found the area exciting but in no way intimidating  I think it s a great location to explore the real New York not just the sanitised Time Square and Central Park areas  Although these are only  minutes away on the subway  Check out the Abercrombie and Fitch shop on th Avenue also I ve never been in a shop like it It s just worth going to see the dancing shop assistants 
P => Just what you expect from Holiday Inn This is a good value hotel with clean rooms and helpful staff  There was nothing exceptional but I wouldnt have expected it to be so considering the price and chain  My partner and I were very comfortable and happy with our choice for a long weekend especially good if you want to be downtown try midtown hotels if you really want to be in the thick of it  
P => Good Location Mostly Courteos Staff The front desk staff was courteous  The beds were comfortable and although small the room met my expectations  I appreciated the free access to a nearby NY Sports Club although I didnt have time to take advantage  We heard street noise all night on the th floor which I had expected  I didnt expect to hear and FEEL the subway rumbling beneath the hotel  Nothing a few earplugs couldnt fix  WIFi was technically free for the first  hours but I reentered the free password after the trial period and had free access for two days  I was disappointed with the bellman   after checking out I needed to store my luggage for the day  He placed out items in a room right by the main entrance to the hotel and left the door wide open  When we returned the door was closed but unlocked  I didnt feel like my luggage was safe while I was gone for the day  The location in Chinatown near SoHo is convenient to downtown and multiple subway lines On the weekend the shops and sidewalks are filled with tourists buying cheap knockoff handbags and watches  The sidewalks are incredibly crowded and transporting luggage is a hassle  
P => Great stay location cleanliness and value If you are looking for a place to stay in downtownSoho that is clean quiet convenient basic amenities this is it  I wanted to stay downtown and am very familiar with NY  I did not need any real amenities because this is NY and I can experience them elsewhere  Great location one block to Chinatown Little Italy NOHO Broadway one block west  The room with two doubles was small but updated   two women for a girlie weekend sufficed  We had huge windows and the beds and bathroom were adequate  After having stayed at many larger hotels in the city   Westin St  Regis Millenium Intercontinental what I liked best about the hotel The fact that you can walk in through the front door and be in your hotel room in less than five minutes  The larger hotels can be a maze  The least thing I liked I was on the th floor and when the subway revs up you can hear a slight rumbling  If you are a heavy sleeper do not worry  If you are a light sleeper request a higher level floor   there are  floors  
P => Budget Friendly There isnt that much to see or do immediately outside the door but the hotel is still in a fairly good location   near SoHo Chinatown and Little Italy  Also the quotCanal Streetquot subway stop is only a block or two away  That was very convenient for us  Its less than a  cab ride to the East Village  minute walk where there are TONS of good restaurants to choose from  My friend and I counted  different ethnic cuisines just along a few blocks on st Avenue in the East Village  The room and bathroom were both clean  The beds were really comfortable  The staff probably could have been a little more helpful  I suppose that we were content just scoping out the city on our own though  The doormanbellhop was great with our luggage and getting us a cab  Overall I would say that you will get a little more than your moneys worth here  
P => Comfortable and Nice location The room was clean  The bed was comfortable  It was quite other than the heater that made some noise when it was left on for too long  It is half a block from the subway It is also right between China town Little Italy and Soho  
P => Clean Efficient and Economical I travel on business to New York   times a year  I stay at this hotel most times  For business travellers its very good value and convenient to Downtown  A walk to Wal Street takes about  minutes  The location is actually more Chinatown than Soho and Little Italy is two blocks away Rooms can be small so couples or groups sharing could find this very tight quarters welcome to Manhattan  I am a Priority Club member and find the upgrades to a bigger room when available can be very helpful Ive stayed at this hotel at least  times over thelast  years and the staff are consistently attentive and helpful  The doormenbellhops for instance are terrific  The car service they can arrange is quite good in tems of reliabilty and value  The rooms are always clean and the views from the higher floors are pretty good  The AC Heating are old equipment but have always done the job for me As a location its certainly fine for the business traveller and would be good for shoppers and younger travelers  The dining facilities are basic though the food quality and price is good so room service is fine  The internet acces is wireless and can be very ropey in terms of speed so you wont be streaming video to your laptop but you can get your email and browse the net  
P => neither good nor bad  for  nights days   are neither high nor low  The room is somewhat outdated and small  That  be unavoidable considering manhattans skyrocketing expenditure  The location is rather good  First of all it cost   from La Guardia airport by taxi and   to the airport by taxi  The fare is lower than the limousine bus which charges  per person and takes much longer time Chinatown and Little Italy is just one or two block away and subway stationCanal St is just one block away toward southway  You can go uptown and downtown by bus on Centre and Broadway St respecitively  Those two roads are just one block away right side and left side  You can go to a disco clubSantos Party House by walking southway to the Walker St and just going straight across that street  Dont forget the address of the building  If you dont insist on staying at a luxury hotel nor at a hotel near the Rockefellow Building then stay here with comparatively lower price  But be careful not to be eived by the Chinese bell man who showed aggressive attitude to me when he urged to take the hotels sedan taxi for   To JFK airport it is  by yellow cab but to La Guardia it is just  for driver tip  You can save  by taking yellow cab  
P => th floor good th floor bad Tale of  rooms  I stayed in  and had a great view and by Manhattan standards had a huge room  Great bed   loved it  I also know NY a little and loved the location on the edge of Chinatown  Soho  Also used to staying in places where you get nothing  so free access to NYSports Club a couple of blocks away much appreciated  My Mum smoker in   Terrible room dodgy or much smaller allegedly double bed AC with life of its own etcetc   guess thats what happens if you smoke nowadays   Also her first trip to NY and location a bit edgy for her  So Id go back and would ask for the same room  Taking an elderly  parent  be not here  
P => Perfectly acceptable We stayed here the night before Thanksgiving and I was suprised by how nice the hotel was  The entrance and lobby are more modern than I was anticipating  We stayed on the th floor top floor and the room was a comfortable size for New York  Bed was comfortable the towels were thick and new the room was very clean and nicely appointed  The staff were all friendly and accommodating  We did have breakfast there the next moring strickly out of convenience  The buffet was fine although I cringe at the price  The location in great You are right on the cusp of Canal street which is great if you want a knock off handbag or just want to browse the many trinkety type stores  You are also right in Soho which is a great neighborhood for browsing and walking and talking and not having to deal with the massive crowds of Mid town  We were able to stroll from the hotel to Pastis in the meatpacking district enjoying the walk and the day at our leisure  Theres a subway station a block away on Broadway that has the yellow line takes you right up into the heart of things meaning Times Square  For  and a few minutes you are transported into the masses  I would stay at this hotel again  Sure Id rather stay at the Mandarin but I dont have  to blow in one night on a hotel  Believe me their rooms are not that much bigger than the one I had at the HI  
P => too pricey for what you get Stayed at hotel for  nights  the location is great  right next to Broadway soho and tribeca  Good shopping and a lot of good restaurants the Room is very small  no brekfast included  have to pay  for some fruit and coffee  please They dont have a gym but they have agreement with NY Sports club on Broadway  Remeber to bring your own lock or they charge   Room either has hot or cold settings  so you have to wake up and turn off or on  Room seems kinda old the hotel could stand a bit of reation ent place in great location but its too pricey for what you get  
P => Great stay Stayed for one night at the HI Manhattan SohoDowntown and had a great stay  Was a bit put off by the vendors on Canal Street on the way to the hotel but the hotel turned out to be great and located on a quiet street  The room was small but very comfortable good bed nice bathroom and front desk staff very friendly  Free and fast wifi was great and helped us make the most of a very short stay  Location was so so it does not have a real soho feel to it but walking a few block you find great shopping and caf s  Would definitely stay again  
P => Great location comfortable and clean but pricey and parking was an issue Stayed at the HI SoHo for one night sat  and though we spent little time at the hotel it was a positive albeit pricey experience Living near NYC Ive never had to stay overnight at a NYC hotel so night for a rather small room barely enough room for  beds and the TV stand was only inches from the corner of one of the beds was a bit of a shock then again I paid  for  mixed drinks at the SoHo Grand  However the beds were comfortable and the room clean  Staff was very friendly  We drove in avoid if at all possible and called the hotel to find out the parking situation  I was told to double park in front and a valet would take care of it  After driving around that area on a late Sat  Afternoon the  valet fee was a non issue but leaving the car unattended double parked on Lafayette was an issue  Well one of the staff recommended I simply park it myself in Edison Parking  block east of the hotel and save myself   Guess that paid for the drinks at the Grand    Wish they would have mentioned that on the phone  
P => Had a great stay Stayed again at the Holiday Inn      Room was great comfy and clean small however but friends who were staying at the Solita Clarion down the street had a smaller room for more money and they had really low cielingsThe beds were super comfortable  I did have a problem with my reservation thanks to expedia but the Holiday Inn bent over backwards to help me and finally get me a room  Ron Oz at the front desk was greatCant beat the location right off Canal street everything is within walking distance great shops and restaurants  
P => Very Comfy Bed One night stay after a late night dinner cruise  The room was perfect for our needs  It was clean and quiet and the beds were very comfy with nice pillow topped mattresses The room is small wall to wall beds almost but thats what we expected  Rather expensive for a one night stay but we booked pretty late so we might have found a better deal if wed had more time  
P => This was a great hotel and location My husband and I just spent  week at the Holiday Inn Soho and we were very happy with our stay  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room very comfortable especially the beds  It s a very handy location to see many of the tourist sites and very near to the best deals for souvenirs that you ll find in all of Manhattan and that s Chinatown  Other than walking we used the subway for just about everywhere we wanted to go and this hotel is very handy to the stations  I would recommend this hotel to anyone that asks  We read some comments beforehand about the noise of the subway running under the hotel and my only comment is this   If you re a light sleeper and you like to travel you shouldn t leave without earplugs or you re just asking for trouble no matter where you go   My husband had no trouble sleeping without earplugs  You have to get used to noises you re not used to anywhere you go and after a day or so we didn t really notice the sound of the subway  it wasn t that bad  I on the other hand am a light sleeper so I go prepared anywhere I go and slept like a log Sandy and Denis from Canada 
P => Loved it I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend for four days in y and absolutely loved it  The room was very clean and the beds very comfy the or was outdated but it is costly to keep up with current themes  Staff was very helpful and even had our room ready way before the standard check in time  The one flaw was that we had a handicap washroom and thus the floor were always wet after taking a shower  Not noisey at all despite being abovethe subway  Would recommend anyone to stay here 
P => Loved it   would cojme again We loved this hotel Yes the room is small but its NYC and we were hardly ever in it   the bed was the MOST comfortable hotel bed Ive ever experienced  The hotel is right on Lafeyette near Canal so close to shopping if you so choose and the subway line is right there  That being said it is like a clean quiet oasis in the middle of all the Chinatown chaos  It has a restaurant and workout room and the front desk is quite helpful  The building is within easy walking distance of Tribeca Greenwich Village NYU and Little Italy  Great stay  
P => Average Small Room   Dreadful Internet Connection I stayed at Holiday Inn   DowntownSoho from th  to st    I should mention that I have spent a substantial amount of time staying in hotels with over  hotel nights in some years due to my job  I ve stayed at everything from  star motels to  star hotels and everything in between Check in was good at the hotel and the bellman brought up my luggage very quickly  My room was listed on the Holiday Inn website as an Executive Room which I thought would provide me with a larger size room and that it would be located on the executive floor  Wrong  It was a fairly small room and not located on the Club floor as Holiday Inn calls their Executive floor There is no in room safe no mini bar and  exceptionally small drawers to store anything  The closet space was lhable a  foot area beside one of the double beds that can only be reached by a narrow space beside the bed   I usually do unpack and hang items in hotels and for the first time ever I didnt bother in this hotel due to the lousy access The noise from the street was clearly audible even though I was on the th floor the hotel has  floors and the window was closed it doesn t open  So it seems there isnt any soundproofing  Ive stayed at many hotels in city centres and never had the massive street noise that I had at this Holiday Inn And the constant rumbling from the subway below the building was annoying too   and yes the floor in my th floor room shook each time the subway passed by The blackout blinds were too short to cover the window so the bright sun shone into the room very early each morning The bed was ok though short for a double bed I wouldn t recommend it for anyone over     There is a small coffee machine which I didnt use as in the lobby you can get coffee with unlimited refills which you can bring to your room for US   The wireless internet connection was terrible   I was able to stay connected for about  minutes before it would cut out and the only thing that seemed to work was rebooting my laptop   so not a great solution  One of the main criteria for me in choosing this hotel was that they had internet access so this poor service was unacceptable  I spoke with the front desk and they had one of their engineers restart the router on my floor and that time I was able to connect and stay connected for  minutes  But afterwards the same situation happened with very poor connections  I would not recommend anyone travelling for business to stay at this hotel I had the breakfast buffet one morning and it was ok offering basic items though as with most hotels overpriced for what you get   you re much better off going to a restaurant outside the hotel The location is ok if you want to be in Little Italy or Chinatown  But if you re planning to see a number of Broadway shows then this location isn t great as the theatre district and Times Square are several stops away using the subway and it s definitely not within walking distance as it s over  street blocks away If you are planning to stay for a day or two in New York and if you feel the need to be near Little Italy and Chinatown and don t need internet access this hotel is ok but not great  If you want a good hotel with excellent value or if youre coming to New York for a longer stay I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn   Times Square North instead as it s cheaper better located and much higher quality of room and services All in all I wont be returning to this hotel  
P => Great Location We stayed here over Memorial weekend and have never seen New York so busy The hotel is in a great location easy walking distance to Brooklyn Bridge Canal Street Mulberry Street etc Despite the number of people staying all the staff were attentive to our needs and happy to advise us on places to go On leaving the hotel to return to JFK the hotel organised a cab for us at a reasonable rate  Unfortunately due to last minute shopping and the horrific traffic we were an hour later then planned returning to the hotel but the cab was still waiting and as we had run out of cash the hotel paid the driver and charged it to our room What superb customer service 
P => Great place for the  if you get the right room     Prime location  I asked to see a few rooms before selecting one  Stayed in a HUGE room with tons of windows sunlight a table and chairs and a couch for  per night  This place was bigger than most NYC apartments  Teensy bathroom  Super clean  Ask for room   on any floor and youll see what I mean by BIG  Price of the room fluctuates depending on the day  My  per night room jumped to  for one night then came back down  Go figure 
P => It is in Soho Stayed at the Holiday Inn Downtown   Soho   to    First for everyone that stated otherwise the traditional boundaries of Soho debated by some extend to the corner of Canal and Lafayette so it is just inside the Soho boundaries  Chinatown has just grown outside of its old boundaries and continues to grow  The same distance from the front door to Canal Street has you right on the corner of Howard and Broadway which is so unlike Chinatown youd think you were nowhere near it Having gotten that off my chest the hotel was pretty damn good  Staff were really helpful and friendly the room and bathroom were relatively clean cleaner than my own at home and the beds were just about the most comfortable I have slept in at a hotel  We were on the th floor on the side away from the street and the only time we could hear the subway was when we were in the bathroom and even then it was a minor thing  Never disturbed our sleep at all  If you are from a small town the noise in general might be distracting but then again this is New York  If you are worried about noise in ANY hotel in New York ask for one on a higher floor You cant beat the location  Broadway is a block away  From the corner of Lafayette and Canal you can see City Hall in the Financial District one subway stop away or about a  minute walk which is right at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge   minutes east and you are in the heart of the Lower East Side  minutes west takes you through Soho and into either Greenwich Village or Tribeca  And the subway is right there in just over half an hour we were up in Washington Heights on our way to the Cloisters If you want a real New York experience stay here  Far better than being up at Times Square 
P => Designer Bags I have just returned from my first trip to New York amp cant wait to go back If you like designer bags watches sunglasses ect very good copies then this is the place for youCanal Street is around the corner from this hotel amp is amazing it can be overwhelming at times but pace yourself amp haggle The hotel is lovely great staff comfy beds amp we even had breakfast in the hotel one day which was fine On the downside for a first trip it is a long way out but the subway is just round the corner Make sure you vist Rockefeller Centre amp Grand Central Station they are both amazing Would I go backI would go tomorrowsame hotel be not but dont let that put you off I just dont read maps very well  
P => Ok but some problems that makes me scared JUst recently il    we checked in Holiday Inn right in the heart of the chinatown NYC downtownSoho  Our bedroom was really impressive but unfortunately the rumbles of the subway underneath makes me awake all night long  The subway runs  hours and it really bothers me  Its like theres always an airplane attack on that area and sometimes the building vibrates  Scary and very tiring for the next day  
P => Awesome This hotel is not really in SOHO but in Chinatown  It is in an awesome location  You can walk or take a short subway ride one block away to many area attractions  You are in the heart of Chinatown and two blocks from Little Italy  I am a native New Yorker now living in Wisconsin  I took my dhter and her best friend to New York for spring break  I was EXTREMELY impressed with the hotel the staff the room and especially the comfy bedsOur room was on the thirteenth floor with a view of the Brooklyn Bridge  I would defiantly request a high floor at the time of your booking The staff was always upbeat and accommodating  We stayed at the hotel for five nights  One night I woke up to what sounded like an out of control party  I called security and they were there in less than one minute They took care of the problem and we didnt hear a peep for the rest of the nightThe room was very clean and the beds are so comfy  I had no problem falling asleepPlease let me know if you need any further info on the hotel or NYC  
P => LOCATION and comfort The Holiday Inn quotSohoquot is really in Chinatown to which I say HOORAY for that  My family consists of a  year old a  year old and two aging hipster parents  I was warned that the rooms were small however with four large persons in a two Q room plus rollout we were just fine  We did not eat at the hotel restaurant there was absolutely no need to with the abundant choices directly nearby  The location was superb for hopping on the MTA to everywhere in town shopping of any kind eating great food in Chinatown Soho Little Italy Little India even walking to the Village yeah you can do it all from here  We stayed out late and walked in past midnight with no problems encountered in this area stay alert in NYC no matter where you are going  We found the room quiet and clean high floor helped  Subway rumbles underneath the building be aware of this but it did not disturb us  If you want luxury then dont stay here go uptown and pay twice as much And the Ten Ren tea company is right next door    start the day off with some great chinese tea  Definitely a proper choice for a more interesting experience  
P => Liked it I stayed here for  nights it was free using my Holiday Inn Priority points  The location was great being close to Little Italy and China Town the room was compact but it was clean so it ticked the first two most important boxes for us location and cleaness  The only issue was we stayed on the th floor and there was a lot of noise from the subway  Id stay again but would request a room on a higher floor  
P => Great value and location Ive stayed in NY many times and this place is one of the best when its my money and not my employers  It might not be the nearby Soho Grand but the location is excellent for all the cool spots and Canal Street the nearest Subway connects with almost every line serving Manhattan  If you book far enough ahead room rates are very good value  They are clean reasonably spacious and if you are high I was on th floor as quiet as you can expect in NY  This makes a great alternative to the traditional tourist Midtown  The staff are very polite esp duty manager Ron but be aware it is in Chinatown and not Soho  Also stay away from the vending machines unless you want to throw away your cash  These are small niggles overall a great place to stay  Ignore the comments about breakfast if you come to NY and eat breakfast in a hotel you are kinda missing the point  As ahint if you book join the Priority Club its free you get free bottled water a paper late check out and even an upgrade if possible  
P => Oh Dear      what a letdown I travel all over the world and use hotels in the Holiday inn chain as my mainstay whilst away at least  nights a week  Being a Platinum Points card holder I guess I can say that I know the Chain rather well and that on the whole what you pay for is what you get  However this hotel is without doubt the most disappointing and poor quality I have encountered  The rooms even for NYC were tiny the standard of house keeping was poor with bed linen crumpled making one wonder if the cleaners had in fact changed the sheets from the previous occupants  The price of the room was no way proportional to the size standard or value one would expect from such a well known brand  The staff seemed embarrassed by the state of the room and did offer an alternative which was not that much better but after flying for  hours was suffice for a one night stay but in the cold light of day stained wall paper and threadbare carpet are not acceptable nor is dust on most surfaces We picked this hotel because of the central location to many of the downtown areas of NYC      top tip don t bother stay further uptown and bus to the sites instead We were due to spend  nights there before moving on to Northern MA we checked out the following morning at am and went straight to the Crown Plaza in Times Square   which is from where I pen this despondent note I know the arguments and use them myself that you only use a hotel room as a base whilst in NYC but in all honesty   DSS hostel occupants would have raised their eyebrows at this mediocre offering which has allowed the general run down area of Chinatown and Little Italy to invade the building  
P => Average An average hotel with small rooms and tatty or  Good service but you need to keep on top of the cleaners who fail to fill up the basic hygiene and bottled water supplies Great location close to the subway and good restaurants reasonable value overall  
P => Good location friendly staff Very helpful and friendly staff  Beware though even from a higher floor every time a subway train passed underneath the street it rattled the room and fixtures  Lots of noise heard from the street as well loud trucks even at night  be it depends on what side of the hotel you are on Room was clean and well appointed  Free NY Post and USA Today outside your door in the mornings  
P => Very good value convenient location This hotel is a good little gem tucked away on a pretty quiet area really in Chinatown and not SoHo at all  I think other reviewers who found this to be out of the way of restaurants and travel and had to take taxis essentially walked the wrong way when they exited the hotel The  blocks immediately north of the hotel are a bit grim but otherwiseTravel  major subway lines NR and   are between    blocks away  The NR entrance is about  yards away from the hotel door on the corner of Canal and Lafayette Shopping Literally around the corner from the hotel is Canal Street and Chinatown and Century     the biggest bargain department store    is a  minute walk away downtown  NoLita is a  minute walk away with interesting litle bars and shops Restaurants  block walk to Little Italy Mulberry Street absolutely teaming with fantastic restaurants and pastry shops      blocks south down Broadway are fantastic delis with fresh bagels and great coffee   nice to not be stuck in a Starbucks    blocks directly south of the hotel and you are surrounded by Chinese restaurants The hotel itself was very clean and the staff great  Ive stayed in the Times Square area several times before and will never stay in that antitic touristy area again Downtown is far more interesting and more real  
P => small shabby room noisy Good location for Chinatown Little Italy and SOHO but the rooms are very smalldated and if your facing onto Lafayette very very noisy The staff are OK the bar is OK there is free internet and for  USD not to bad overall but in general it is not up to HInns usual standard full service brand So if you are OK with small and noisy rooms its OK  
P => Perfect for shoppers My first time to stay at the Holiday Inn SoHo my friends second  Perfectly located for shopping on Canal St Broadway SoHo Century  or a stroll to Union square  We ordered in breakfast sandwiches sausage egg amp cheese on a bagel   delish  and coffee every morning from the Jubille deli around the corner on Broadway   less than   The front desk have the number  Abduhl the bell hop couldnt have been more helpful and pleasant to deal with  Will definitely stay again  
P => Good Value Good location Small Room We stayed for a few nights at the Holiday Inn  Nestled between Soho and Chinatown the hotel is a short walk from the Village  The room was very small though it was clean and the staff always helpful  While the hotel is ordinary you are paying for a reliable name and a good location  Well worth it if you can get a good price  
P => good value and location for downtown the quality of the experience is above average given its relatively low price and good location  I call it a quotgood locationquot because I like staying downtown and its a reasonable walk to Soho and Tribeca  This aint the upper east side or central park west  the staff all were authentically polite and the place was great for my wife me and our  month old along with my parents spread across  rooms  
P => I was disappointed ober   My x husband booked our trip and I was so disappointed in the room  The entrance was ok but I look for a great room I had requested a King with a fridge as this was a medical trip with medication needing to stay cold   When we entered the room was a bit musty Between the bed and the fridge it was about  inches of walking space  This was unacceptable spacing for me I always like to say something nice too  So the staff was very nice helpful and very friendly  They were the best part Also   China Town is on the same block  So the location was quite good if you like to bargain  
P => Good for Manhattan but could be better The front desk people blamed Hotwire for the bad room I got when I checked in  But if I didnt use Hotwire I would have paid at least  more than what I already spent  Its just annoying  Aside from the Hotwire messup the hotel was fine  Clean comfortable and quiet  But it was still too expensive for what it was  
P => fab hotel treated like princesses had a wonderful week long stay at the holiday inn there were three of us amp our only reason for being in the city was to shop til we dropped we were treated like royalty amp the staff were so friendly and helpful  great location little italy and chinatown excellent for food and designer knock offs shall definately stay here again 
P => Good location strange hotel I had the pleasure of getting a job assignment working for a lower Manhattan agency this past month  Our rooms were booked at the Holiday Inn on Layfette Street near Canal Street  Upon arriving we were excited as the Hotel is located in the heart of the ChinatownLittle Italy area and near a major subway route  The lobby is on a second floor and the bellboy staff is on the first floor  They have a small unattended bar area with some computer terminals for internet use  When we got to our room on the th floor we noticed immediately the lack of drawer space  The beds were crammed near a closet and the bathroom was very small  Upon talking to some New Yorkers I learned the building was converted into a Hotel and that is why it was so cramped  The bed linens seemed cheap for even a Holiday Inn and constanly slipped off the bed during the night  There was some train noise because the  N R lines run below  The restaurant Pacifica is just as one of the above reviewers described  Fake eggs Lo Mein small Danish type rolls sausage and broccoli     not your average breakfast fare Take note that the management discourages you from ordering off the menu  I was told they quotonly had one cookquot working on the weekend which makes no sense  The weekend would logically be the busiest time you would think and to be constantly short staffed is not a good impression to make  Also the vouchers rewards members get are good for  dollars off a breakfast buffet that costs    The restaurant actually makes money off the Holiday Inn  Take note that if there are  people to a room you get vouchers per couple not per person and this was a surprise to my co workers  Although the management was helpful I could tell there was definitely a division on how each business was run  In fact when we were dining Pacifica sent a company representative to inspect the site and very was disappointed in the way the restaurant was run  We overheard this information and I am sure other customers did as well  On the plus side the neighborhood was nice and Little Italy and Chinatown was nearby  It was nice to have other options for dining in the immediate vicinity  
P => Worst Deal ever for  a night Shopped around for hotels in NY  Not sure what we would get since we had never been to NYC  Figured we would trust the Holiday Inn name  Hotel itself was what you would expect from the Holiday Inn name but the neighborhood was like the ghetto TINY room King size room that barely had quot clearance around  sides of the bed and the roll away for our kid blocked the tiny hallway of the room  Had to climb over the roll away to get into the room or get to the bathroom from the room  Stayed one night and found a King Suite at the WALDORF ASTORIA for THE SAME PRICE Bailed on Holiday Inn Ghetto and stayed in luxury for the following  days  
P => Nice Location Stayed at the Manhattan Downtown SoHo for business woman traveling alone  The room I had was a quotdeluxe queenquot on the th floor  It was small about typical size for NYC but very clean  The batrhroom was also very small but very nice with a ble counter top and what looked like a brand new tub and shower curtain  The room had a good air conditioner needed this trip with temps over  that was quiet and efficient  The room had a nice view of Canal Street  The hotel is on the edge of ChinaTown and Little Italy  Many good restaurants within walking distance in both areas  One night I was tired and ordered in  To my pleasant surprise I did not have to go downstairs and the delivery person was not allowed upstairs  The front desk brought the food to my door  Nice feature for a woman traveling alone The only negative was that the hotel is not easy to get to from Penn Station unless you take a cab    tip one way  There are subway stations on Canal Street     the closest one goes to Grand Central Station Area  and one goes to Herald Square  
P => Nice location  A bit spendy for what you get  Our room was a double queen  Many hotels queens are smaller than what you might be used to at home but I swear these were twins  The room layout made it hard to walk around since the foot of the beds come very close to the furniture  The bathroom on the other hand was quite large  There were water pressure issues at peak times in the morning but nothing horrible I stayed here for  nights and loved the location  Just one block from China town and close to downtown with out offically being in the district Its not fancy its clean and in my opinion a tad bit expensive   per night and this was in   
P => Excellent Stay The Holiday Inn exceeded my expectations   the rooms are immaculate and all staff were friendly  The front desk went out of their way to assist us and I appreciated the parking tips from the valet  The location is ideal being in the heart of SohoChinatown they are right next to each other so Im not sure what other reviewers were complaining about  Several subway lines are close by  I will gladly stay here again 
P => So So in Soho This hotel provides the piece of mind that comes with staying at a well known chain but it has slipped a bit since we stayed here a couple of years ago  The place is clean and the staff professional as can be expected from Holiday Inn  But stay away from the hotel restaurant  We had breakfast there on a Saturday morning and it was terrible  The buffet was a total let down  We were actually served by the busboy who took pity on us as no wait staff appeared until we had finished our meals The meals were very over priced for what we got as well  You can do much better by trying one of the restaurants on Broadway north west of the hotel The hotel owners must have shares in a private car service  We were solicited a total of seven times by hotel staff front desk and concierges to arrange for a private ride to the airport as they told us it is quotalmost impossiblequot to get a taxi out front  I got a cab as soon as I put my hand up and it was about ten dollars cheaper than what the car service price was that we were quoted Room was clean except for what appeared to be two larvae in the water reservoir of the in room coffee maker  There is a Starbucks one block to the east on CanalWill probably try one of the boutique hotels around there next time around  
P => fine for what is it stayed here for business  the hotel is fine  the location is in chinatown so not necessarily a great neighbourhood but alright  its close to the subway which is good  the rooms are a bit small but was clean and has what you need  the subway runs under the building so i would hear and feel it every once and a while but didnt bug me too much  my room was  which was a bit pricey for what i got  room had free wirelesss which was useful  staff were friendly and helped book me a taxi back to the airport  all in all it is an okay hotel but expensive for what it is  
P => Its a fine place to stay I read many of the reviews and even spoke to some friends about the hotel  After visiting I would definitely recommend especially after seeing some of the prices per night that some of the other reviewers received  My night was free due to a frequent stay program  The rooms were defintely small almost humorous but very suitable for a nice stay in NYC  The subway is very close and taxis of course are abundant  Do yourself a favor and walk just a few blocks to eat at the best pizza place in NYC Lombardis at  Spring Street  Overall the hotels staff is friendly the concierge was very helpful and the bellhops were also very helpful  Give this place a chance  
P => No complaints here My friends and I stayed here the weekend of ch st for my Bachelorette Party  One of my friends got the room for free using her credit card points so I wasnt expecting much but was pleasantly surprised  The hotel is new clean quiet and safe and the staff were all very helpful  Yes it is really located in Chinatown but that is part of the fun  As someone else mentioned the shopping is great If you want a knockoff Prada bag fake jewelry or cheap namebrand perfume this is the place to go  There were also always a lot of people outside which made me feel safer  We arrived at  pm and our room was ready  The next day they let us postpone checkout until  pm and held our bags downstairs after that  Our room was nice  A bit small but actually ent size for NY standards  The bed were comfortable especially the  soft pillows  The bathroom was clean and comfortable  We didnt use the tv or eat in the restaurant so I cant review those  All in all a nice hotel especially since we got it for free 
P => Had a Great Stay   Really After reading the many reviews of this hotel on this site   including some from the past few months   I have to admit that we were filled with a bit of trepidation about our stay at the Holiday Inn DowntownSoho            but were now absolutely happy to confirm that we really enjoyed our stay and would not only recommend this hotel to others   but would be most happy to stay there againYes its true   this hotel is not in the very heart of Soho and is a bit more Chinatown   but one Chinatowns a good bit of fun and two the hotels only two blocks from Soho  Little Italy is only two blocks away and the subway N R  etc  is only one block away  Its not scary outside the front door at all by the way The staff at this hotel are WONDERFUL everyone was very friendly we requested an upgraded room as it was my wifes birthday and they gladly accommodated us at no extra cost with a big nicely appointed and immaculately clean room and they also let us check out late without any questionAre there better hotels in NYC Absolutely  But this one is quite nice very clean very comfortable with every amenity that most travelers want e g  small updated fitness center downstairs option to use a nearby full service gym for   cable television etc   And best of all that incredibly friendly and helpful staff 
P => Thought You Should Know  In my search for a hotel this one was listed as a  a night room  The rooms actually cost   There are no  rooms  So they know how to fool a search engine  Use caution  The rooms are literally  feet larger than the king bed inside it  Just enough room to walk around the bad  There are no dressers  There is a writing desk in the room but you cant sit at it  No room for the chair sitting oddly next to it  There is no closet  The bathroom is about  inches larger than the toilet  Luckily I wear only a size ten shoe otherwise    The water pressure is bad   not enough to enjoy a shower forget about filling the tub  The restaurant is embarrisingly bad  Especially for the big city  We waited a half hour for coffee and another  minutes for breakfast only to finally get hard cooked eggs and rare bacon  We were told that the cook didnt show up  While we were comped breakfast the family next to us shared this experience but were not comped and a twelve dollar gratuity was added to their bill  There is no manager on premises on Saturday morning and the assistants in charge of the front desk didnt speak English very well so there is no chance to communicate the subtlety of things  Requests for clean glasses for example could npt be communicated  Now I am a native NYer so when I tell you this you should take it seriously   this is a HORRIBLE location for a family to stay  On Canal Street bordering Chinatown simply disgusting  You should never let your wife or kids out in this neighborhood alone  In fact our first night here three people were murdered within walking distance of this dive and two were auxilliary policeman  So dont select this place because of its supposed convenient walking distance to SOHO and the Village If you like apologies offers of discounts on inedible food and argumentative managers this Holiday Inn  be what you are looking for  
P => Great Stay Stayed at the Holiday Inn Downtown  Soho  ch    ch Have read all of the reviews on here for this hotel and was a bit worried from some of them as what I was going to find at this hotelFristly The hotel as far as im concerned is in a great location Just around the corner from the main Soho shopping street close to th avenue next to China Town and a short walk down to the financial district wtc site and the ferries to the statue of liberty  A subway station is less than a minute away and yes you can here the subway when you are in the hotel its not loud and I got used to it and eventually forgot about it The sound was like someone was just turning up the air conditioning  Dont let that put you off just remember this is New YorkWe had  rooms both were twin rooms one was a small room on the th floor with two double beds which was ok nicely orated and very clean the second room was on the th floor which was much larger again nicely orated and very clean  We were also shown an Executive room on the th floor which had a double bed sofa and was a very large corner room but this was not suitable as we needed two beds per room  One of the rooms was paid for and the other was booked using Priority Club rewards points  An upgrade was given as I am an Executive Priority Club member  Both were ideal as a place to sleep wash and drop the shopping bags who goes to New York to spend loads of time in a hotel room there is too much to see even on a second trip The hotel had a small gym on the ground floor with a couple of running machines bike and cross trainer and some free weights  There was a small bar area next to reception  Breakfasts were available every morning but go and out explore there is a great cafe about  mins up the roadThe pictures that are on the Holiday Inn website do not do the hotel justice they are quite poorly taken  There is clearly a lot of money being spent on the hotel there was re building work going on in the entrance lobby by the escalators up into reception but this should be finished by now and didnt cause any problems when we were there  Every day we were there new beds were being delivered and old ones taken away Staff were very friendly and couldnt do more to help  The girls on reception were very welcoming when we arrived and allowed us to check out a number of rooms before we booked in  Every morning we got a cheery quothelloquot from them and were asked how we were where we were off to etc etc  Having stayed in a lot of hotels in the UK I think little touches like this add to the stay  There is also a lady who will book theatre tickets give out maps etc etc To sum up a great hotel very clean welcoming staff good location dont judge it by some of the reviews on here and give it a go 
P => Great location Stayed for  nights with my partner at the end    The entrance was not the most promising as it is situated on the corner of a very non descript street that is completely lacking in personality  It is not quite in Chinatown nor Soho  However it is only  block m from Broadway and  blocks m from the heart of Soho  Similarly it is  blocks from the heart of Chinatown  So within   mins walk you are right into the heart if these two vibrant areas  The hotel is a typical big city Holiday Inn the rooms are fine not huge but comfortable we opted fro the two doubles to put our bags on and clean  We didnt eat in the hotel   who does when there is so much choice in NYCNearest subway is Canal St and taxis aplenty on Broadway  Overall a great location for Soho and Chinatown and lower Broadway  So great for shopping and eating and a  min walk to ground zero Wall St and the Brooklyn Bridge  Went across to the River Cafe which was absolutely fabulous   picture postcard views of the NYC skyline and high end quality food  
P => Great Location for food and shopping Okay Rooms I am extremely anal about safeness and cleanliness and this hotel met my standards  It was very clean and I felt safeIt is located in the heart of Chinatown and Little Italy  We walked like  block and we were right in the middle of Canal Street and the subway station  We took a taxi from the airport which is the way to go   taking the subway from the airport was too time consuming  The hotel was an excellent location to catch the subway   very easy to use location  If you are in the city for a few days then get a flexible pass   it helped us because we were able to jump from Statue of Liberty to the room back to Battery Park then up to the Guggenheim with a mistake here and there and it was covered in our pass   very freeing to be able to get on and off when needed  The hotel is in a fairly busy area off a side street so we felt safe enough walking from the subway station to the hotel room since there were lots of people out  even at night  There is a Starbucks within walking distance and lots of good little eateries mostly Italian or Chinese  Great shopping on Canal Street especially if you like knockoff stuff  be sure to bargain and dont be too scared to go into the little room in the back of the store   thats where they have the good stuff  The hotel itself had great staff   friendly  professional and accomodating   We came in after a red eye flight expecting to just store our luggage because it was in the middle of summer super busy time  and they actually had our room ready We dont spend much time in our room  so we werent extremely picky with ammenities  It comes with the typical shampoo soap and such and they also had an extra counter for foodcoffee or makeup They have a restaurant but its way ster and cheaper to eat out on the town  you didnt go to New York to eat in your hotel Rooms were quiet  We had a ugly view of the building next to us and the street but hey we werent expecting to spend our time enjoying the view from our room the entire trip  Good television   lots of channels  We had  comfortable full size beds   extra pillows available upon request  Big room and good size bathroom with tub  Hallway areas need an update but overall what a good location I would stay here again just for the location and the total New York experience   hustle and bustle  Oh and did I mention they have a free complimentary use computer in the lobby   perfect for checking emails      granted it is a slow connection and lots of people want to use it but good for a quick  minute check 
P => Chinatown NOT Soho I booked this hotel based on its description as the Holiday InnDowntown ManhattanSoho  Imagine my shock then when the cab stopped in CHINATOWN  If you dont believe me check out the photo   the hotels name is written in English and in Chinese just like everything else in the area  Apparently Soho borders Chinatown and the hotel is on the Chinatown end of the border but technically has a Soho address thus the misleading description  The only time I felt unsafe during my visit to NYC was one night when we climbed out of the subway onto the street a block from the hotel  Every window it seemed was barred and the streets were deserted except for one screaming drunkcrazy person who of course was directly in our path to the hotel  This hotel also looks nothing like the glowing photo featured on the Holiday Inn Web site and on this page  In fact we could barely find it as the only thing king it on the street as the Holiday Inn were a few nondescript tiny flags  On the plus side the hotel was clean and the staff friendly and helpful and it is only a short walk to the subway  I just didnt appreciate being misled by the supposed trendy Soho location  
P => Perfect for a budget holiday If your travelling to New York on a budget this is perfect  Its in a great location the room was spotless and the staff were very friendly  It was great staying here as we were away from all the madness of Time Square   and it was lovely to just wander around the streets of Soho  We were also able to walk to all the sights in Manhattan but if you dont fancy a trek on the streets the subway is just around the corner from the hotel  There are loads of great shops and restaurants close by including the fab Spring Street rest   and its right beside Little Italy and Chinatown  
P => Perfect Hotel Perfect Price Perfect Location I researched for a month and this was the perfect hotel for the price and location  My room was very clean and the service was excellent  The hotel was walking distance from Canal Street  The concierge was soooo helpful and pleasant  Everyone at the front desk was pleasant  My only suggestion for improvement was the dining area We only ate breakfast there once and the tablecloths were dirty and some of the napkins appeared to not have been washed  Other than that EXCELLENT EXCELLENT 
P => good value I spent  nights at this hotel and was stunned about the tiniest room I have ever seen in my life  Anyway the room was clean and with all equipment  The rooms especially the draperies need an update  The staff was mainly rude and not very helpful  I would recommend the hotel to all visitors both tourist and business travellers who look for a good quality hotel for a reasonable price located in downtown Manhattan  
P => Great location and resonably priced The location of this hotel was great good restaurants nearby and easy access to the subway  Rooms were only small but were clean well maintained and airconditioned  We booked direct with the hotel online which gave us a much better price than the brochures  Facilities are modest but when you are out all day it doesnt really matter  This is a well priced hotel in an overpriced city and is all you really need in New York  
P => PERFECT Location We were really happy with the location of this hotel  A block away from Chinatown and also from Little Italy  If you like food and shopping   this is where you want to be The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful   from the bellman to the bar staff and everyone we came in contact with  The concierge was a bit on the snooty side   we only asked her one question and then just ided to figure things out on our own   which was actually quite easy  We were upgraded to a ior suite when we checked in my husband is a member of the Priority Club at Holiday Inn and it was an awesome room  A big corner room with awesome views  The bathroom was a bit small for two people   we couldnt even both fit in there  It was one of the quietest hotels weve ever stayed at  Our room was on the th floor and right by the elevator but we were never awakened by anything  To clear up the subway topic mentioned by earlier posters YES you can hear the subway as it does run underneath the hotel  We could hear it on the th floor but it quickly just became background noise   this might be a problem though on the lower floors If we were to go back I would request a high floor just in case  The room was very clean and no sign at all of bed bugs  A previous poster mentioned the Chinest restaurant just outside the entrance to the right of the hotel  We ate there on her recommendation and we loved it  Also every place we ate in Little Italy was awesome  The subway entrance is just a block away and was an easy way to get around town  Cabs are plentiful and quite cheap but be careful when walking around town  The traffic is horrendous and scary   we saw a teenager get hit and thrown through the air by a car just outside the hotel on Canal  You need to really be aware of whats going on around you at all times  
P => Holiday Inn Soho just great My friend and I went to visit my dhter in NYC for the long Labor Day weekend  While there was some confusion as to my reservation since I did not leave a credit card to guarantee it they did accomodate us and even upgraded the room at no addional cost  The rooms were large and very clean  The front desk staff and concierge were very helpful and chearful which helped in the pouring rain  The property is not imediately next to any restauaraunts or bars or cafes so you do have to walk a bit but the subway is very close  one block and Canal street shopping one block also  I will definetly go back provided I can find another reasonable rate which of course is not always avaiable anywhere in NYC Only suggestion There is no regular doorman so if getting dropped with lots of luggage make sure you have help to inside the door from the cab driver  
P => Adequate hotel   good location Room reasonable size has all required facilities furnishings a little tired but nothing that would put you off  Bathroom clean Staff were fine Breakfast is a dissapointment but with all of NY on your doorstep pop out to Broadway and walk a few yards and choose from all of SoHo Locationwise   it is more Chinatown than SoHo but Mulberry StLittle Italy is only two blocks away in one direction and the trendy SoHo cafesbarsrestaurants a few blocks in the other Recommended restaurant is the French Bistro Les Amis in Spring Street  
P => Great location nice staff okay rooms I stayed at the Soho Holiday Inn on business on ust    The location is great  Even though they say Soho its really Chinatown  I had business at Federal Plaza so its about as convenient as can be for business travel to that area  I was early for check in but they accomodated me and were very friendly  Everyone was uniformly friendly from the the guys at the front door to the front desk staff to the maids to the bartenders  The rooms are small and at   all taxes included not necessarily a great bargain but it could be worse  I dont really know the rates in NYC  I didnt eat at the restaurant why would you when you step out the front door into Chinatown 
P => All systems gp Thinking about a trip and trying to put it into words are apples and oranges  I just got back from Manhattan  I spent   th  th   at the Holiday Inn downtown on Lafayette st   I read so many mixed reviews about this hotel I was a little skeptical  If that were not enough confussion I found two articles that blew me out of the water  One was from a man that said he stayed at the place  days a week for forty two weeks and did not recommend that anyone stay there  The other was from a man that asked if you ever wondered why the subway was so close quotto the hotel His answer was that the subway runs under the hotel  He wrote that he got a free giggle everytime the subway passed  I am a  year old woman who was traveling with my  year old dhter who is a student at UAB in Birmingham Al  It was by then too late to change the reservations  No time to research another hotel property  I drove from Mobile Al  picked my dhter up in Bham then on to New York  Ladies and gentlemen it was the time of my life This Holiday Inn is called the Holiday Inn quotSohoquot the Holiday Inn quotLittle Italyquot It is actually the Holiday Inn CHINATOWNquot  Located one short block from one of the busiest street in NY  Canel Street  It is not far from quotLittle Italyquot and quotSohoquot but it is in Chinatown  If you do not want to go there avoid it all together  That being said It is a very nice hotel  I paid   a day not including taxes or parking  I have a  Toyota Camry and it costed   a day to park  They charge more for bigger cars  No in and out of the parking lot  You get your car again when you leave  I booked this room by calling the number to this hotel directly  My advise is to book your own room  You get a confirmation number and there are no suprises  The staff treated us with care attention and respect  The TV did not work when we first arrived so we called the desk  Five minutes later the maintance person came and plugged it in  He was friendly and we chatted about NY  The conciergse cant spell it suggested we ride the open top tour bus  We gave her ten dollars each and she gave us a slip to get our tickets with instructions on how to do it  We paid another fourty each   total for the up town downtown quothop on hop offquot trips  and night time tours good for  hours  That my friend  was a deal  The restaurant had no red wine and no vodka  We didnt care  There are many bars in NY  The other reviews got one thing right  The rooms are small  We had two double beds and a bathroom  All we used the room for was to shower and sleep  The place was very clean The property is trying to save water so if you want your room made up or fresh towels call the desk  We didnt need anything but more coffee and got it in a flash  If you come out the front door of the hotel and turn right you will find a Chinese restaurant next door  Eat there          Soooo Good The shopping was wonderful   purses and two wallets cost less than    Dont pay over   for ANY purse  Not over   for a wallet  Dont buy from people on the street  Stay with the shops  I wanted to stay in Chinatown  I was not disappointed with a thing  I hope this helps someone out there  Oh I almost forgot  I didn t feel one giggle from the subway  No street noise either  Go figure  
P => It should cost less Holiday Inn on Lafayette needs to be refurbished it is ok but it feels like the rooms are old and kind of dirty The staff is not very dedicated talking to they are doing their job but no more The location is great but it is a hotel for only the sleep nothing else is enjoyable I feel that you pay for more than what you get  If you want a place to sleep at while in NYC it is ok but bear that in mind that it is everything you are about to get Peter G 
P => Expensive and Very Small Room with Mediocre service   Great Location This Holiday Inn is one of the worst I have ever stayed at  The room was very small and cramped for space the view is uninspiring and the or is mediocre  As a priority club member I usually get free breakfast but this location discontinued that feature which results in an expensive breakfast bill and an hour or two of unnecessary arguing  The location was great   one block from a major subway station ChinaTown Little Italy and close to many shops  The bell men were excellent and always helpful   they booked our airport transfers and were always willing to give us directions Overall   I would not recommend this hotel  There are plently of better quality hotels in NYC for the same amount of money about USDnight  
P => Great Location Clean  Great Location  ent price I did not encounter attitude from any of the staff Balthazar around the corner  
P => Staff attitude problem Stayed here last week for  nights and have to say from the beginnning to the end there were numerous problems  As a Priority Club member I deserve better treatment  On checking in I was assigned a really horrible dingy small room  On complaining the guy at the desk admitted the room was not the best and put me on the th floor were the rooms are bigger with much more light The telephone in the room was closed  i couldnt make calls without asking first to the desk the same with the movies on the television  The wireless internet access was free of charge in the rooms but was a joke and didnt work   of the time after complaining to the front desk it worked within a few minutes so I guess it was an effort for the management to save money Breakfast was another nightequotYou cant sit here Sirquot is what I heard in the breakfast room you cant choose your own table the staff ide the place you should sit  Apparantly all the other tables that I had prefered to sit at had been reserved for lunch at am all without RESERVED signs  The image portrayed was that of a lazy slovenly and inmotivated staff  The waitress threw tantrums an d also her napkins on another table when I refused to sit were she pointed We asked to see a manager but the waitress denied causing problems and I am still waiting for a response from the manager on duty that day who didnt have the ency to call my room after the incident even though she requested my room number On checking out more problems they wanted to charge us more than the invoice amount stating that we had gone over out authorised amount whcih was utter nonsense as I had a prepaid reservation This was eventually sorted out on presentation of the invoice that I had printed from the Internet A WORD OF ADVICEIF YOU ARE STAYING AT THIS HOTEL AND HAVE DONE THE RESERVATION ONLINE  Please please make sure that you have a copy of your original booking invoice otherwise you will be overcharged by a bunch of the most ignorant uncustomer friendly desk staff i have ever met 
P => Great location friendly staff We arrived in NYC at  a m  but we were given a room at no extra charge although check in is not till  p m  The room albeit small had  twin beds which was perfect for my family  adults  children ages  amp   The room and bathroom were clean had a TV CD playerradio and internet connection  We called for extra towels and in less than  minutes someone was knocking at our door with extra towels  The room we got was on the rd floor so the view was not exactly the best but this is New York and everything else unless you live at the Trump Plaza Rockefeller Center or the Waldorf is taller than your building The hotel was at the edge of Chinatown and a stones throw from Little Italy and Soho  We walked a block towards Broadway to get on the subway to Times Square  Every day of our  night  day stay we rode the hop onhop off sightseeing buses which had a stop a block away by Broadway and Respinard Sts We went shopping at Chinatown in the evenings and ordered quotto goquot Chinese food so we can enjoy them while watching out favorite TV shows in our room The hotel charges   per luggage for keeping them after you check out but its worth the charge instead of lugging them around while waiting for your flight  Ours did not leave till  pm and with check out at  pm we just left them with the concierge went back shopping ate out then returned to retrieve them We definitely will be back at this hotel next time we visit NYC and we strongly recommend this hotel for families with children  
P => Amazing Location Stayed in this Hotel for a weekend during ch The hotel itself is nice enough with staff being friendly and helpful  The room was clean tidy and a good size although could have done with a refurbishment Breakfast was ok if a little over pricedThe best thing about this hotel is the location  Its away from the really tourist area its just off one of the really busy chinatown streets it seems to be a liveley area from early morning to late night  Seemed to be a really safe area to walk around too  Its also only a few hundred yards away from the beautiful Little Italy For people who want to do touristy things the hotel is near  subway lines that can get you to most parts of the city really quickly   including the airports  
P => Great location My dhter and I stayed at the Holiday Inn   Soho in uary  Great location  Loved Canal Street The staff was very helpful  Subway just down the block Room was clean   nice bathroom   concierge gave us great restaurant suggestions  Will be staying here again 
P => watch out those bed bugs bite Room size was nice room service on time   but what are those itchy welts coming up on my arm neck and legs A trip to the dor next day confirmed that these are bed bug bites Of course the hotel staff totally denied the problem so beware   those critters are still at large and those itchy bites dont go away for days  Try complaining and you might get a room change but be prepared for the entire staff treating you like youre the one to blame A very humiliating experience in all    stay away  
P => Cant complain hotel If you are looking at a ent hotel that is not priced out of the world this is the hotel for you  As someone who is fond of Asian food this hotel is located where you can find some of the best hongkong style food all within walking distance  The hotel is clean and safe  The only problem we had was the size of the room which leaves us no space to open up our luggages  But this is expected of any budget NY Manhattan hotels  All in all it is a very neat and tidy no frills hotel  Afterall that is what a hotel room is for resting at night  And this hotel caters just for that  At that kind of price no one should complain     
P => Very Central to Great Neighbourhoods If you prefer being away from Times Square and want to be in the midst of the great neighbourhoods in Manhattan the Holiday Inn SOHOChinatown would suit you  Its a classic  star hotel  Nothing spectaclar and just what you need while in NY  Rate was reasonable  Rooms were small but sufficient  Front desk person not very knowledgeable  Housekeeping staff very friendly  Get the   flat rate tips and taxes included to La Guardia Airport from the hotel  Watch out for the quototherquot airport rate    We know someone who got burned Great shopping and restaurants all around the hotel  No need to walk more than  minutes  
P => Good value for money My family and myself stayed at this hotel for  nights on a visit to New York just before Christmas   I thought the location was great with good transport links  I am not a fan of Uptown so found the location great for Downtown so I found the location great for Downtown Greenwich Soho etcSpent very little time in the room so I found the facilities adequate  I would definately recommend the hotel to friends visiting New York The staff were very helpful they even let my check in at  am as we had an early morning arrival Look forward to my next visit to New York a will definately rebook This is not directed at this hotel but hotels in the USA in general  It really annoys me all the extra charges that are added to your bill eg tourist tax etc 
P => Enjoyed the stay The room was a lil small for a  double bed room  the bathroom was small but nice especially the shower head  beds were nice and the sheets were always clean  a maid service everyday  oh and the pillows were real comfy  the concierge at the bottom was real nice always helped us out on where to go and how to use the subway  its located right in chinatown and near lil Italy  and the substation is right on the corner  so it was very convenient  overall i enjoyed my stay at the holiday inn at soho  not much complaints at all   and i didnt feel the subway shaking the beds at night i have no clue what that other dude is saying    
P => Awful Hotel Food Staff and Location    Free Vibrating Bed from the Subways bel Stayed here four arate weeks in ember and   We were unable to get a room anywhere else in the City for the Govt Rate of  for the period  I stay  nites a weeks  weeks a year for work and have doen so the last five years  This is by far the worst hotel  As stated in other reviews the restaurantbreakfast is awful the staff nonresponsive to requests and complaints rooms substandard and had various problems  One week a cup of oatmeal and coffee is   the next week it is    Another week they ided to charge   a bag to store luggage for a morning checked us all out of the hotel when we asked for a printout to check the rate check us in at three different rates even though I had made all the reservations at the same time for the same rate and most weeks failed to credit our Priority club accounts for stay credit  The rooms were not clean the last week my carpet was soaked from a leak from the room above and every nite security had to come to room room to let me in as the key card never worked To all of this Management was indifferent  The neighbor is not interesting but filthy with construction going on along Lafayette and the intersection of  or  subways are beneath the hotel  If you enjoy a vibrating bed gratis this is the place for you There is a reason this is the only branded hotel that offers such a low rate in the confines of Manhattan  Stay in New Jersy of you must but dont stay here  
P => Budget Hotel in Great location If your looking for luxury then dont stay here  If however your looking for a good clean place in a fab location then this is the one for you   Walking distance to all the main areas little italy tribeca china town    
P => Well done Holiday Inn Just spent  nights at this Holiday Inn in Manhattan and apart from feeling that I was in Hong Kong rather than NYC it was brilliant  Situated just on the edge of Chinatown it had subway stations really close by  All the staff were pleasant and helpful and the room was warm comfortable and welcoming  What more do you need I was a single woman traveling alone but had no fears in this hotel or the area  
P => All we needed My wife and I stayed for a weekend to browse the Chinatown and Little Italy areas  Location was ideal for our needs  Room was good sized and spotless clean although a little dark as it looked on to a blank wall across a side street  The staff were excellent  Always cheerfull and friendly and ready to help with advice and directions  For what we wanted we could not have done better at the price although I will say we were disappointed in the restaurant menu which was dominated by oriental choices and which turned out to be bland and tasteless  If in the area again would definately return  
P => good cheap place to stay I stayed here t    and like other reviewers said it is definitely in Chinatown  After around  p m  theres no one in the neighborhood no open nearby drugstores or places to eat  But during the day its bustling and the subway is RIGHT THERE  There are safe ATMs all around cheap Chinese buffets and a place on Canal that sells pizza and Jamaican beef patties that were actually pretty good and cheap  The vendors outside the hotel are selling fake designer purses  pashmina scarves yeah right fake designer watches etc  If this is your thing buy during the week  I found that the vendors are much less likely to deal on Saturdays when the neighborhood is flooded with tourists  Dont worry at all about your safety   I am a woman and I never once felt in danger  Of course take the usual precautions but dont be afraid to consult a subway map because most other people around are too The rooms are SMALL be  square feet and our bedspread had some cigarette burns in it  We called and asked for another blanket   and they brought another bedspread  Oh well  The bathroom was clean water pressure fine AC actually got the room too cold and I didnt hear ANY noise from the street the entire time we were there and we were on the th floor  Really for the price it cant be beat  We paid  a night during the U S  Open  Dont pay premium to stay in Times Square the noise and crowds and absolute tourist overload there would get old in about  hours  
P => Great Value for Money Holiday in Soho is nothing fancy but if you want a Soho location technically its in Chinatown but literally  block from Soho and not in the middle of the Chinatown hem but without the late night noise and traffic go for this hotel It took us  minutes to walk to Broadway and  minutes to walk to the heart of Soho  Perfect for both shopping and nights out Service was great   we got automatic late check out as Im a Hilton honours cardholder and they didnt mind when we checked in at midnight after the flight from the UK  They even gave us as requested a quiet room on a high floor or is not exciting but the beds were comfortable enough   and if youre visiting NY on vacation lets face it you wont be in the room muchAm returning to NY in ember and will definitely stay there again and save the rest of my  for shopping 
P => Definitely Disappointed  I based my expectations on past Holiday Inn experiences and other NYC area hotels and was definitely let down  The overall price was probably fair considering the location but the value was definitely far below average  I was not able to get internet in my room with either standard method  There is no wall jack to connect to in the room and the wireless connection was so low I had to work from the lobby  Having a good internet connection is very important during my travels considering the trip was for business and that I work in the software industry  So I asked to change rooms several times finally being able to the last day of my stay  The location is definitely in Chinatown  My AC was average  The breakfast buffett was horrible so I tried ordering something off of the menu the next day to find they were at least consistent  Needless to say I did not eat there again  The one positive thing I could add is the proximity to the subways  If you look it up its on the coner of Lafayette and Howard  J M N Q R W Z   Previously working in the hotel industry for over  years definitely makes me more of a critic when I stay at other hotels  But I always keep a positive attitude and have a high tolerance for the lack of service and facility because I expect there is some reason  In this case I find it important to pass my experience along because I would not recommend that anyone stay here and I will definitely be back  
P => OK if your expectations arent too high This is not a luxury hotel it offers few amenities and the location is not great  But my room was clean the air conditioner worked and I didnt get stuck in the elevator as an earlier reviewer did  I paid  plus another   in taxes which puts this in the lower price range for this kind of hotel  The neighborhood is called many things on maps and in guideboks but it is definitely Chinatown though its close to Little Italy Tribeca and Soho  The front desk staff was capable but I wouldnt call them friendly or helpful  The restaurant Pacifica was not very good  average diner food and poor service  We ate there twice for convenience and only one of the people we encountered appeared to speak English and he was surly  There are  floors so try to get as high as possible  Even so the garbage trucks come by at  am so youre not going to sleep through the night but thats true of most places in Manhattan  On each floor they had near the elevators an electric shoe shiner which makes this place feel like a hotel for salesmen catering to the local stores  it has a Willy Loman feel to it  For under  this is about what you can expect in New York  
P => Excellent hotel The hotel is not located at the most beautiful location but the hotel itself is perfect  Friendly staff breakfast adequate and a big bed  The rooms arent big but convenient and very clean  Television iron ironing board hair dryer stereo cdsampradio all included  And expect a daily newspaper in front of your door during the week in the morning  We had a perfect stay 
P => Loved it I have just returned from one week vacation in New York City The hotel was excellent me and my girlfrined had a great timeI have seen different reviews and was little bit worried but everything was perfect  The hotel is in fact in Chinatown but Soho East village Ground zero are within walking distance I would recomend this hotel to the people who has already been in New York and to those who plan to go out in the evening because all downtown area is so close and you will not loose much time  
P => Perfectly Fine The location walking distance to Soho and Tribeca and immediately adjacent a station served by several subway lines is ideal  I did not eat at the hotel because so many restaurants were so very close  The staff were extemely helpful and courteous  The rooms are plain but the price for New York is an incredible bargain  
P => Perfectly satisfied Stayed here for a long weekend with my grown family  Rooms were clean and well equipped  Also nice to have a bath to soak in after a long days exploring Location is very convenient for walking around the Soho Tribeca and Lower Manhattan areas as well as having excellent subway access to the rest of Manhattan  Staff were helpful and welcoming  This was my second visit to this hotel and I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again  
P => Great deal for the price My husband amp I stayed here for five nights in early il   It was our first trip to NYC and I was very happy with everything including this hotel  We were on the th floor unfortunately with a view of the building across the street Honestly the size of the room was larger than I expected  I don t think we had a chair just a king sized bed two end tables and a television on a stand but we didn t do much lounging around the room anyway  The room was very clean and everything in it seemed relatively new no shabby carpets or worn out comforters  Bathroom was also fair sized and extremely clean  There were a few problems the shower head wouldn t stay upright hair dryer wouldn t always work light bulb out in bedside lamp and the cd player wasn t working but as soon as I got around to mentioning it to the front desk the manager came out and was very apologetic  He made sure everything was fixed that day while we were out and offered us a comped breakfast we d already eaten and it was our last day oh well a nice gesture anyway  The lady at the front desk who checked us in was a little cold but it was late pm and overall the staff was great  We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant once   it was very good one of the best ham amp cheese omelets I ve ever had AND a great price  I think the room service breakfast is the same menu and same prices which is practically unheard of Too bad we didn t have a chance to take advantage of that The neighborhood wasn t the best   I definitely would ve called it Chinatown rather than SoHo but it wasn t far from SoHo and for the price hey you can t beat it  On the plus side it was very quiet and there are a couple of subway stations within a block  It s a little scary at night because the streets are pretty deserted from the subway to the hotel but no one ever bothered us All in all I d highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good room at a good price  
P => Great Choice This must be one of the best value for money hotels in New York  I was part of a group of  from Norway who stayed here for  days in    and we were extremely satisfied with every aspect of the hotel  The rooms are a fair size for New York newly reated the front desk staff were efficient the concierge knowledgeable the area safe and there is a plethora of varied ethnic restaurants within walking distance of the hotel  The nearest subway stop is  metres from the hotel entrance  All in all great value for money  
P => A real gem and it IS in SoHo I have been twice now once for pleasure once for business  The rooms are good sized for NYC the price cannot be beat the staff is charming and I like the room service breakfast cheap too  Its three blocks to the heart of SoHo so get over yourselves whiners  Center Soho hotels cost X to X as much The rooms and public areas were spotless and I had a great view north to the Empire State Building  Being in Chinatown is a real hoot and I found several new places to eat  Subway is just down the block pleanty of cabs to hail and its close to the Holland Tunnel too Its not the St  Regis but the value for the money is superb  
P => Excellent I stayed at the Holiday Inn downtownsoho for several nights in uary Staff were friendly and helpful  Check in is from pm and having a speedy passage through customs etc meant i arrived early at midday but I did not have to wait around for  hours  i was given my room straight away  Very useful after a long haul flight Place is clean and tidy and the conciergesecurity are friendly and helpful if you ever need some local knowledge or assistance be it the nearest bar check out puck fair about  blocks higher up on lafayette or somewhere to eat Room was an adequate size and both the room and bathroom were both cleaned daily and to a high standard  The air con in the room was rather noisy but a quick blast of it for a few minutes kept the room warm for ages It could get a bit cold with the air con off  but with the wind chill outside being   degrees and it snowing that was hardly surprisingThere is so much to do in the city that you will probably not be spending much time in the hotel room anyway  Normal Tv plus pay per view if you feel the need a cd player desk and a hair drier are all in the room too It is right on the edge of chinatown so if you need a shady rolex or a louis vitton handbag or pretty much any replica designer item you care to mention or even just a plain old I love NY t shirt this stuff is just steps away  Walk in the other direction and you end up in soholittle italy  with its abundance of small cafes restaurants bars and designer stores Canal street subway station is about  seconds walk from the hotel entrance as is broadway which you will have no problems hailing a cab on at any time I found it to be an excellent location and i did not feel unsafe at night in the area  certainly refreshing and a total contrast after living in london for some years  Its not far from midtown by either cab or subway and if you go in the other direction the financial district and across the east river to brooklyn are just as easy to get to   is about what a cab will cost to get you up to central park  and that was during the day in traffic the cost was less at night I cannot comment on the restaurant or bar in the hotel  as i didnt make use of them but they looked to be a ent standard Check out is at midday  i had an pm flight and the hotel will gladly look after your luggage for however long you need under lock and key  very useful and this is a free service For getting back to JFKnewarkwhich takes between minshr the hotel provides a ent luxury car service for a flat fee of  the same flat fee it costs from JFK to manhattan  Simply book it a few hours in advance and it will be there waiting for you at your specified time  Saves the hassle of first hailing and then paying the metered fair to the airport which is unpredictableAs a younger person it was ideal  although i cant comment on it from a family or someone travelling with childrens perspective Inexpensive for new york good location and good service   it was a pleasant place to stay  certainly no complaints from meAndy   Uk 
P => Great location friendly staff and exceptional value for money Just spent  nights in the Holiday Inn Downtown and would definitely choose it for a return trip to NY  At Eur  per person per week it was great value the room was a good size comfortable clean and well maintained had a nice view and the staff were very helpful and friendly  Theres a subway station and a bus stop about  seconds walk away and Chinatown and Little Italy are literally on the doorstep with Soho and Tribeca a few minutes away on foot  The Financial District and Ground Zero are also within walking distance    minutes on the subway or a little longer on the bus gets you to Midtown Manhattan  We two women felt completely safe walking around the area both day and night The area has hundreds of restaurants   not just Chinese but Vietnamese Thai and Malaysian and of course Italian   where you can eat very well very cheaply  Most of them dont take credit cards so bring enough cash if you plan to eat in the area every night  Soho and Tribeca have a huge selection of more upscale restaurants and bars as well as great bakeries and coffee places  The shopping along Broadway just a couple of blocks away is excellent with branches of most of the Midtown stores a new Bloomingdales and lots of designer shops Overall couldnt recommend it more highly  
P => Good Base Stayed here on our last trip to NY  Its nothing special but a good base too see the island  Plenty of places to eat in the area as is right between Little Italy and Chinatown  The hotel itself is very clean and the staff are all very helpful  The rooms are a little on the small size but this is the usuall for NY  If you are looking for somwhere to put your head down at night thats clean and safe this is the one  The area the hotel is in seems safe at night as we walked around it a few times and never experienced any problems  
P => ent but the Beekman Tower was better First I dont think this hotel should be listed as DowntownSoho  I think this is rather eptive since it is more in Chinatown than Soho  To get pretty much anywhere walking you definitely have to go through part of Chinatown  The hotel is ent  The staff were extremely hospitable and helpful  The room was small  It was me my sister and mom in a room with  double beds and even that seemed a little cramped  It is convenient to the subway  Actually the subway runs right underneath the hotel so if you are a light sleeper you are sure to hear it my mom did  We visited the weekend of    and think this mustve been the beginning of the peak season because the room was night and definitely not worth that much especially after having stayed at the Beekman Towers for about  less and feeling like we had a lot more room  
P => Loved this hotel and staff Ive been to NYC many times and have stayed in many lower priced hotels and this one was great for the price  The room was spotless  The staff was overly friendly and helpful  When we called for extra pillows and towels they arrived within minutes  We had to check out hours before our flight was leaving and they kept our luggage safe and secure and had a car waiting for us to take us to the airport for a nominal fee  The location is excellent close to shopping Soho Little Italy and Greenwich village  All of these locations were within walking distance  I would definately stay here again We loved it 
P => Great Location The Holiday Inn is right in the heart of Chinatown and within walking distance of great restaurants and shopping  You do not have to travel to China to shop for Chinese souvenirs  The location is also two blocks from Little Italy  We ate at Angelos on Mulberry Street  The food was outstanding although a little pricey  We visited many art galleries in Soho all within  blocks of the hotel The staff at the Holiday Inn were friendly and helpful  The only thing lacking is the size of the bathrooms  miniscule   We had a quotsuitequot which consisted of a large open room with a very comfortable sofa a table and  chairs and extra chairs for entertaining  Room Service was very quick in their delivery  within  minutes  We had trouble getting a cab in front of the hotel  We walked a block to Canal and found cabs easily  The Canal Street station of the subway is on the corner of Canal and Lafayette one block from the hotel If this is the kind of weekend that you enjoy I would recommend the Holiday Inn  
P => Still recommending it to friends For a weekend trip to NYC this turned out to be a great hotel especially for the price  Two friends and I booked a room with  beds for a weekend visit and had a great experience  When we checked in the desk clerk offered to upgrade us to a ior suite for the same price as a normal room with two beds  We ended up with a spacious suite with a king bed and a full size pull out sofa which worked perfectly  The room was very clean and the staff was very helpful and friendly  The hotel is steps from Little Italy Chinatown and Soho so there is plenty to do and we did not feel unsafe at all  We did not eat at the hotel  there are so many restaurants in the area it just didnt seem to make sense  I would not recommend this hotel for anyone who wants opulence and indulgence or who isnt used to urban hustle and bustle  I would recommend it for anyone who wants a standard hotel that happens to be in a great location has friendly employees and clean well appointed rooms  
P => great summer dealgreat downtown locationgreat hotel whoever is complaining about this holiday inn must be on there first visit to new york first of all you cant beat the price to stay in that area of the city the hotel is super clean great staff and the food in their restaurant is very good if you are looking to walk out the front door and be surrounded by trendy boutiques and cafes this place is not for you you are one block from canal st  for fun bargain shoppinga couple blocks from little italy a short walk to the village and only  blocks to ground zero the hotel is really in china towneven though they call it sohobut that was o k  with me  there is a great starbucks about a block away on canal st and the area is very safe at night       
P => Great Location Great Service This place is awesome The staff was very friendly and helpful  Ive stayed in new york four times this year and for the price this has been the best  Ok so its closer to china town but its only a two block walk to soho  Also Its Very close to little Italy  Three very touristy areas within a three minute walk  Cant beat that I am planning another stay at this hotel very soon     
P => ent hotel in ChinatownSoho    no complaints  My husband and I just returned from a business trip in NYC  Stayed at the Holiday Inn DowntownSoho  nights which we found to be quite acceptable for NYC where most hotel rooms regardless of price are small and better than a typical Holiday Inn  No complaints though I would agree with another reviewer that this hotel would more accurately be called the Holiday Inn Chinatown  Its located on the border of Chinatown and Soho so is surrounded by the restaurants and lively street kets of Chinatown while also being just a few blocks from the charming outdoor cafes of Little Italy and eclectic artsdining scene of Soho  The Canal St  subway station is just steps away Travelers who enjoy or at least dont mind Chinatown    or who generally enjoy the artsyethnic neighborhoods of Lower Manhattan which is quotDowntownquot in NYC parlance    this is a ent affordable and interesting lodging option in NYC  We had a king room  Small and a tight fit for  people but this is standard in NYC even at higher end hotels like the Hilton where we have also stayed  The room and bathroom were clean and well kept  The bathroom was nicely reated    good counter space and unusually good plumbing We did not try the hotel restaurant or bar  The hotel is surrounded by an abundance of multi ethnic dining options  Even though we love Chinese food we ended up eating most of our meals in various casual French restaurantsbistros close by  Endless choices for food lovers in this neighborhood  We found the hotel staff to be helpful  They arranged for a town car to take us to LaGuardia Airport for a flat rate of  a great deal for a town car    comparable to a cab fare in good traffic The hotels fitness center is the New York Health Club  blocks away We had no complaints and would stay at this hotel again if were looking for lodging in this part of Manhattan   
P => Dont believe the Description The literature the web site the photographs lead you to believe that this hotel is on the edge of a hip desirable art o area   it is not  Its location is seedy the walk from Canal street subway is past pretty dodgy stores and characters   the internal prices for breakfast and drinks high and not good value for the  deal Counter Staff very helpful  
P => No complaints Just returned from a shopping weekend with friends and we stayed at the Holiday Inn Downtown for  nights  Our rooms were on the th floor and were clean and a good size my only grumble would be the noisy fanheater unit on the window  The hotel is excellently located on the edge of Chinatown with busy Canal Street and the subway around the corner  Soho is also a few blocks away  The hotel itself was clean and the staff were very friendly  We ordered room service breakfast more than once   the eggs were delicious If you want to stay downtown in the heart of things I can recommend this hotel  
P => Very Pleasantly Surprised  
P => Title Eccentric hotel in an eccentric neighborhood  
P => There are better places  
P => ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING  
P => A great New York experience  
P => The Pleasure or lack thereof of a Third World Quality Customer Service in the Heart of New York  
P => Comfortable Accomodations after whirlwhind shopping on Canal Street     
P => Life pur  
P =>   
P => ottimo rapporto qualit  prezzo  
P => Traumlage    Top Hotel  
P => Buon Hotel  
P => Un buon hotel  
P => Tr s bon emplacement  
P => 
P => It was like home I really really liked that hotel it was in a very nice place easy to reach with any means the service was perfect  the price is effordable and worthy and people very gentle  
P => Apparently Many Folks Think Theyre Leona Helmsley I stayed this past  Thanksgiving and have no complaints whatsoever The room king smoking on the th floor was very large and comfortable and clean My best tip  The Roosvelt deli at the west end of the block  Cheap friendly  open  I think its safe to assume the property will be reated as part of Holiday Inns quotmakeover quot When they do so if they ask my two cents worth Id bring up two things Brighter lighting and  Ice machines on every floor    currently theyre staggered Meanwhile I must say I liked it  I travel more than Id prefer but I would definitely stay at this property again  
P => Basic Accomodations    you get what you pay for This is not a bad hotel by any means   it is just very basic and run down  The or is old and drab the location is by no means great  However its not far from Columbus Circle so if Central Park is your choice you are right there  Unfortunately I got stuck with this hotel on Hotwire  Sometimes you get good sometimes you get bad    this time it was drab  
P => Very good hotel close to main locations Very good qualityprice relation  Clean spacious room and very good location 
P => More than we bargained for I had stayed in this hotel previously in  and enjoyed the location and easy access to the areas of the city we were visiting   but what a scruffy run down establishment it has now become  There is a peculair smell in the lobby area and the corridors and rooms are delapidated and showing their age  Chipped paint peeling wall paper and frayed carpets were a feature of our room along with a major infestation of bed bugs which bit me extensively They did agree the room would be fumigated following my complaint but they did not appear surprised to hear about the additional room occupants If you know what is good for you   STAY AWAY 
P => Not as bad as some of the other reviewers found this hotel  Frankly after reading some of the reviews I was very apprehensive about staying there  Arrived as the NY th athon was ending and many of the runners seemed to have chosen this hotel for its proximity to Central Park   a big bonus particularly at this time of year   glorious Fall foliage  If you have a thing about smoking definitely stress non smoking room when booking and Tower A  Internet access is expensive  x  mins and the system cheats when it comes to printing boarding cards  On balance I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends   central to just about anywhere in Manhattan  If you want a really good experience with city tours small groups exceptional guides and drivers go for OnBoard Tours www newyorkpartyshuttle comtours   great  
P => ok price clean rooms location good hotel could need reation Did check in late then our room with twin beds was already taken but the staff where helpful and gave us another room for the first night also got free breakfast because of that   star hotel and ok price compared to others I could find at the specific time  The lobby looks good while rooms and hallway could use some reation perhaps but to me it didnt really matter  The rooms could also perhaps use some sound isolation because we could hear people that where out in the hallway or in room next door  Free wireless internet is included  In overall for price and location this was quite ok  
P => Good Value   Great Location As a first time vistor to NYC I was not sure what to expect after finding this hotel at  per night   which seemed a great deal compared to most other Manhattan hotels I researched  I was there for a  night stay with my wife and  young kids  On arrival staff were friendly and we were pleased with the room which was spacious enough and clean  As other reviews have highlighted the or is faded and a little tired but at this price in Manhattan I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as long as youre not looking for luxury   and if you are then pay the significant extra s so you wont be disappointed  On reading some reviews it seems to me that some are expecting more than what they paid for   its a Holiday Inn at a discount price after all  In our experience even with young kids youll be out exploring NYC most of your time and the hotel is for crashing in at the end of a tiring day We did not use the restaurant at all during our stay so I cannot comment on the service or the food  There are too many options for eating out in this city so staying in a hotel to eat did not appeal to us  The location has to be the best thing about staying in this hotel we loved the fact that we could walk to Columbus Circle subway station in a few minutes and hop on to get anywhere in the city  Central Park is also within a short walking distance and the Times Square and Theatre District is only a   min walk away  There are also restaurants pubs and diners nearby when you want to stay close  The neighbourhood is pleasant and safe and not too noisy  We were out with the kids after dark many times and did not feel at all threatened here To sum things up this is a good value hotel situated in a great location for tourists  If I ever come back to NYC I would definately book this hotel again  Just dont expect luxury for this price in Manhattan  
P => Very impressed The hotel was in a great location  The rooms were clean and spacious  We stayed  nights and our maid brought us fresh towels and tidied the room everyday  We had breakfast coupons so we ate breakfast at the hotel  The breakfast was good no problem w service  The bar was expensive  for a beer and  for a cocktail  Did not hang out at the bar due to this  Found a great bar  block from hotel w better prices  DJ Reynolds Irish pub Lots of great restaurants around the corner  a diner across the street my husband walked into the diner the morning we left and got us a cappuccino very good  some street noise during the day but it seems to quiet down around  pm  Would stay here again  
P => Location Excellent Rooms OK Everything else Poor We stayed here in mid ober for  nights  When I booked the hotel I had requested a high floor non smoking room  We were given a smoking room by mistake which we instantly got changed to a non smoking room fairly easily  The new room which didn t smell was in the main tower on the th floor The  lifts in the main tower were very busy early in the morning when everyone is going out for the day  Waiting several minutes for the lift or trying to cram yourself into a packed one wont be uncommon The room we were given was also right next to the lift shaft so the dull rumble of lifts going up and down could be heard but thankfully stopped during the night which was the only time when it really mattered as we were out sight seeing all day As the other reviews have mentioned this hotel is in desperate need of reation specifically the lobby and the hall ways on all floors  They look tired and depressing The rooms were large clean had a comfortable bed and were of the typical  Holiday Inn  standard which is what I was expecting so no complaints there  They were missing a room safe though which i did find odd The plumbing in the bathroom was a little outdated and I found the shower getting excessively hot whenever I heard a toilet flush in a nearby room This is by no means a  star hotel so don t go there expecting that  The location is excellent and for the money I paid I was fairly happy with the whole experience  I ve also uploaded a video of our room which you can watch When we checked out we left our bags at the hotel as we had a evening flight and wanted to do some more exploring on our last day  The bellman offered to arrange a car back to JFK for  tip included  I ve read on tripadvisor that some people were put off by this but I actually thought it was a good deal and took them up on the offer  The ride back to JFK at pm took about an hour and  minutes and was in a nice SUV I paid  for a cab from JFK to the hotel flat rate  toll  tip and I ve heard that getting a cab back to the airport would be difficult as no one will want to take you anyway so the car make sense to me If I was to return to New York I wouldn t stay here again only because there are better reviewed hotels in more or less the same area for the same price  
P => Faded and tired We travelled across the USA on a tour organised by Great Rail Journeys of York between the th and th ober   We had  nights in New York at the Holiday Inn Midtown We thought this was a hotel in big need of refurbishment   the or was dark greens deep reds and browns and faded and tired looking  While we were there a large number of new mattresses were being delivered Our room was clean and was adequately serviced  The bathroom was  old fashioned  with extensive use of plastics in the bathroom and with an erratic shower but both queen sized beds were comfortable and gave us a good nights sleep  TV reception was poor and we could clearly hear the family next door  There was no in room safe  We didn t eat in the hotel and the Pool was closed for the season  The concierge was helpful but on arrival it took the staff over an hour to deliver our luggage to the room  
P => Good Location But No Smiles  This hotel wins on price and location You cant argue that it represents good value and the roomsbathrooms are more than adequate  However it is greatly let down by the staff who treated us as if everything was too much trouble  We had booked  rooms for a family re union each travelling from opposite ends of the world but in spite of booking some  months ago the hotel could not put us on the same floor  Caution to others As we were travelling on flights from different parts of the world we arrived at significantly different times  As I had made the booking the hotel would not allow our family to check in until I arrived in spite of them having a copy of the booking confirmation and the same surname  They were also charged for leaving their bags in the hotel until we arrived On one occasion our room hadnt been serviced OK we accept anyone can make a mistake so we went down and asked for some shampoo and coffee one complimentary coffee is given each day when this was finally brought to the room the person went off with the huff because we did not give a tip for something that should have been done anyway  Bell staff were also keen to push guests into unofficial overpriced quottaxisquot as opposed to the cheaper yellow cabs  Throughout our stay we never got a hullo or a good morning and we were given to feel that guests far from being paying customers were just a nuisance  We did however like having a coffee machine in our room and an ice machine in the corridor  From here we moved on to Holiday Inn By the Falls in Niagara in Canada where the difference in attitude of the helpful staff was like a breath of fresh air  Visitors tip and New York runs on the other sort of tip so this is the only one you ll get for free If you stay here try the Morning Star Restaurant for breakfast turn right when you come out of the hotel cross the road and its on the corner its good value and the staff are all very helpful with suggestions and ideas on where to visit its a shame they did not work in the hotelI would recommend this hotel on price and location if it was not for the staff  
P => Fine hotel great location incl roof pool This hotel is fine for a holiday  The rooms are small like all Tourist hotels but OK Great is the POOL at the th store with a view over the city  Great after a day shopping in the heatness of e 
P => Tired Part of a longer journey to USA   stayed  nights Extremely poor reception with non American staff  Overall impression of the hotel was that it needed a refit   drab  Very good sized rooms Position good for Opera and Central Park but out of the way for other attractions and not particularly well sited for the subway  Did not eat in the hotel as breakfast options available locally 
P => Convenient but thats about all  My partner and I stayed for a week in tember in a north facing room no direct sun for most of the day Very dark  the room had a distinctive damp smell the entire time even after cleaners had been through  The bathroom was particularly bad  Ended up buying deodoriser from the corner store  The room itself was tired and the hotel needs a reation at some point  No effort was made to present towels etc in an aesthetically pleasing way  When we arrived these things were just strewn over the bath rail as if staff did not care  Other hotels pay attention to these sorts of details and are standard for rooms of a similar price  Perhaps for  a night thats what you get in NYC I will say though the concierge team were helpful and the housekeeping staff were pleasant as well   However the porters did not acknowledge us or offer to help in any way the entire week  In fact they were more interested in leaning on their desk and talking amongst themselves  No attempt was made to help us with our luggage when we arrived  On our second day we ventured up to the pool area and were greeted by what I think were pool hands who looked like they had been dragged off the street   they were not wearing uniforms and could not be identified by name tags which in itself is a worry as they could have been up there to rob or harass guests They made no attempt to acknowledge us our offer us assistance and were clearly hostile young men  We ended up leaving the pool as we felt unsafe and unwelcome   Again in this context one would think front of house staff would at the very least smile rather than grimace at guests Finally while the condition of the hotel is not totally offensive it is rather tired  The porters and pool staff made me feel so uncomfortable I would not stay there again  The reception staff except the woman who checked us in were indifferent and reluctant to offer information on the odd occassion we made a request I have on a previous occasions stayed at the Holiday Inn in Soho and had a far superior experience to the one I had at the mid town location for less than what I paid at Holiday Inn Midtown  In fact had I not have booked a non refundable advance purchase room big mistake I would have left after  night and gone to Soho as their rate through Expedia com was cheaper for the week we stayed  
P => Great Place For Tourists If your visiting New York for a week or less I would recommend this hotel sure its nothing special but its reasonably priced and in a good location  If youre like me then you only want somewhere to put your head down for the night as youll be out sightseeing etc  and this is the place for just that The hotel is about   minute walk from Times Square and there are plenty of places to eat on th amp th Avenue again within walking distance Also I would mention that this hotel seemed to be on one of the more quieter streets in New York which does help as New York is probably the noisiest city Ive ever visited so youll be glad of the reduced noise  
P => perfect location It was a great location near Central Park and a reasonable walk away from Times Square  The rooms were good sized and it was clean amp mod priced 
P => New York city in ust We stayed at the th st Holiday Inn and what a great neighborhood that is in the summer  Just a quick walk away from Central Park and Lincoln Center  A block from the subway  Overall a great trip  That hotel is nasty though and we stayed there based on reviews from Trip Advisor so I dont know whats going on with that  The swimming pool was saving longue chairs for quotmembersquot of the pool  Not hotel guests  We had to sit over on the quotsun kquot but there were no chairs there  The pool was a scam  Just accept that there is nowhere reasonable in Manhattan with an outdoor pool  
P => Spot on Location and Great Value Stayed here in    booked direct on hotel website  Got room on top floor with amazing views of the city  Left curtains open at night just for the viewRoom bigger than I had expected and very clean  Downside   not enough lifts  Very handy for the subway and only  min stroll to Rockerfeller Centre  Would stay there again without a qualm 
P => good value clean facilities  Will stay again NEW MATTRESSES TEMBER  travelled with my wife and two young kids to New York  Booked the holiday Inn becuase it was not ridiculoulsy priced like a lot of New York Hotels  VERY happy with it clean bacthrooms clean rooms nice pool and for everybodies information as we left tember   they were changing EVERY mattress in the entire north tower for a brand new one I seem to find a lot of whingers on this site who want the Waldorf Astoria on a Holiday Inn budget If you want the best then open your wallet  But if you want good clean and honest accomodation that is a walk to central Park th avenue restaurants even Times square then you cant beat the Holiday Inn and the restaurant served a very reasonably priced breakfast 
P => OK   if your only sleeping there This is a very dated hotel in need of a refurb  The rooms were clean enough   but with no air con it was pretty stuffy  We opened the windows at the few inches that they would allow and ended up covered in mosquito bites which was pretty uncomfortable for the rest of the holiday  If you plan to be out of the hotel most of the time and will only use it to get washedshowered etc and sleep there the its ok although it is a bit out of the way but there is a subway a couple of blocks away  The only saving grace really was that we were just around the corner from th avenue which has a lot of really nice restaurants and bars where the I was told the New Yorkers eat and drink   we tried a few and they were extremely nice and prices werent too bad either 
P => location excelent After reading all reviews of holiday inn i was not happy about going What a great surprise i got We booked with american holidays that could have made a difference in the accommodation we got Our room was very spacious clean and excelent view from the th floor overlooking the swimming pool and the bay to the right side and new yorks skyline We never closed our blinds once as we were fascinated with what we could see I was very worried about people saying the smell of tobacco all over the loppy and on the corridors i dont know what part of the building they were in The building is old but is well kept clean fresh towels every day sheets changed when we wanted Bathroom is small but you can live with that as we did for five days i found every one to be very helpful I will definitely stay there again  
P => I couldnt wait to check out I had arrived in New York at about pm and was just staying for the one night at this particular property I must have received the last available room in the hotel as it was on the floor above street level and SO loud    The bathroom was was tiny and the bathroom sink was located OUT of the bathroom next to the room door just by itself    very strange  Not very private if you are going to share a room  The next morning I woke to scratching noises     and yes as I rubbed my sleepy eyes I peered down to see a rat run across the floor  I ended up building a pathway of furniture around the room so I didnt touch the floor Needless to say I packed my things in record time and checked out  When I checked out I informed the staff of what had happened and I kid you not they looked at me then continued to type away on the computer   NOTHING WAS SAID  I am a frequent traveller and have stayed in numerous properties around the world this is certainly one that I would not recommend  An absolute rip off for what you get in return  
P => Good value I give this hotel  stars mainly for its value  I prepaid and got  nights for  per night which is an absolute bargain  Hotel is in an excellent area rooms whilst old are clean and large  Had quite a few dealings with different staff and found them all very courteos and helpfull  Pool area was clean and relaxing and was one of the reasons I booked the hotel  Would stay here again if I got a good deal again 
P => A good deal and love the location When I booked this hotel I was very skeptical after reading other reviews  I am a Priority member and I stayed in the Tower A twice  One time at the lower level and one time at the higher level  Yes you can hear the slam of the door and people talking outside the hallway  The elevator was ok for us  Only one time around am when a lot of people checking out the elevator was slow  Other times were fine  There a little places like lamp or remote control not working or mold on shower curtain but that did not really bother me  I guess I am not a fussy person  The service is not friendly but I expect that from New York City  All I care is the location and the big clean room  One time the doorman asked us if we want taxi and he got hotel limo for us to go to La Guardia and charged us  which I felt I got ripped off  when we come back to the city and took taxi by meters it was only   So next time we went to JFK we got cab ourselve  Because the location it is very easy to get a cab on your own  You save the tip for the doorman  I would stay at this hotel again because the price is good and love the location and dont need to be crowded with other tourists in places like the hotels in Time Square  
P => Good value for money We have never been to New York and went for our th wedding aniversary  After reading reviews on small rooms ided to go for a well known chain the fact it had a pool on the roof helped not that we had time to use it much but an added bonus  Very helpful staff clean rooms and good location Deboragh and Stuart North East of England 
P => You are in New York its a place to crash after a busy day We arrived after midnight and were very tired the night receptionist was lovely very helpful he checked us in quickly and efficiently  They had double booked so put us for the first night into a top floor suite i was quietly disapointed on seeing this as it had two rooms but only one bed and a pull out sofa bed  We looked for extra bedding and there was none apart from a sheet and a pillow already on the pull out bed  Who cares we were so tired it didnt matter the next day we were moved to a th floor room and that was fine The rooms seemed clean they provided an ironing board hairdrier etc normal things There is an ice machine on the th floor  There is no mini bar I am used to having a safety deposit box in the room and was disappointed to have one in the reception area so didnt bother and kept my stuff with me It would have been nice to have a kettle in the room perhaps thats just a British thing its quite sad but we bought tea bags and boiled water through the coffee makeryou have to be quite resourceful Breakfasts were ok you are seated on arrival in the dining room and offered orange juice and tea coffee or chocolate Most of the menu involved an egg in some form or another the pancakes were nice and the french toast was lovely They always offered just Corn flakes but there were quite a few others so just ask Every thing was charged arately and we had a priority club card which had points accumulated on it and this provided a discount of  off the bill it normally cost around   for  of us each morning The location was really good its near most of the attractions we only had one taxi and walked back every night from the Time Square area We regretted only turning right out of the hotel every day when on the last day we discovered the amazing cafes and resturants when you turn LEFT This hotel was practical its all you need if your priority is sightseeing and sleepingrecovering from blistered feet  Sign up to the Priority Club card through this chain of hotels as we had accumulated enough points to benefit from  free nights and a discounted breakfast  It all helps as you can spend the extra on a good show or some Comedy Club tickets  
P => Very happy with my stay Stayed here for five nights on my own during a trip to New York on holiday  Check in was quick friendly and efficient  Room was clean and had quite a cosy feel to it for a place of this kind  All the cable channels were on the TV  Housekeeping was faultless  I didnt try the breakfast  Rooftop pool was a reasonable size and had a lot of sun loungers available for use NB   pool is only available during summer months  Overall the place felt welcoming and at about   per night represented ent value for NYC  I would definitely consider staying again  
P => Wonderful stay What a lovely place to stay in New York The location is the best staff friendly and helpful room was clean and spacious   The hotel is located only a couple of bloks away from Central Park and metro station is close too  You could easily walk or take a train to see spots further away  There are nice places to eat breakfast lunch etc  close to the hotel  We didnt eat in the hotel but would have tried that too if we had had more time  The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful  Especially the concierge who helped us with musical tickects and many other things  Our room had enough room to fit three friends in the same room easily and it was clean  The bathroom could use a little reating but it didnt bother us  We saw the pool on top of the hotel and it looked nice and clean but we didnt have time to use it  If I ever go to New York again Ill definately stay at this same hotel  
P => What a lovely surprise As the title says it was a lovely surprise after reading some of the reviews on here I was quite anxious about our trip after some peoples opinions but i neednt have worried  The hotel was clean the rooms were large with very comfortable bedspillows  Ideally situated in quiet streets away from the hustle and bustle but also within a short walk too The concierge was extremely helpful in checking our flight times and confirming with the airline that we would be travelling he organised the transport to the airport limo at not much more than  taxis would have been for  of us Food Europan turn left on th Avegreat for snacks if you have just arrived and in need of something quick try Brooklyn Diner they do the most amazing scrambled egg and polenta  The sight seeing tour bus circle line was the best money we spent  day hop on hop off with tour guide   brilliant I wouldnt hesitate to recommend or go back to the Holiday Inn   free safety deposit boxes too And the pool what a bonus just what you need after a long day on your feet shame it doesnt open a bit later though  
P => Great Value   recommeded This hotel is a little gem in very expensive Manhattan very close to EVERYTHING We just walked and took metro  I also love that this hotel is participating in a Linen Reuse program which saves water and energy to our planet as well as reduce waste water an chemicals   well since I travel with my little children one of them had anquotaccidentquot at our second night so I just placed the sign quotPlease change linens todayquot in my door and voila The staff was also very helpful the room was spacious and very clean well be they could use new carpet   The restaurant was good  We bought breakfast coupons it was very useful for us  Im very pleased and happy with my stay at that hotel  Just note that they dont have refrigerator or microwave in the roomIve stayed in other HI across the country and they do so we ended up renting one  dollar per night because we needed milk and juice for the children it was cheaper keeping it in the room than buying at the restaurant   I mean it is not  stars   but it is extremely good for what you pay 
P => A Pleasant Midtown Surprise I took my kids to Manhatten for a few days of sightseeing and wanted to be central with short cab or subway stops to most attractions  This hotel is very close to Columbus Circle and Central Park and not too far from most midtown attractions like the Museum of Natural History St  Patricks Cathedral Empire State Building FAO Schwartz and Times Square with Toys R Us  The neighborhood is mostly residential so the streets were relatively quiet  The front of the hotel is on th St  between th and th Avenues and the back is on th St  With two blocks of rooms all rooms are either on those two relatively quiet streets or facing the other tower so street noise is minimized There are some small shops and eateries around the hotel and of course it being a Holiday Inn they have a restaurant on site but we didnt use it at all  The brand pretty much determines it will not be a luxury facility and as is typical of the brand it is a popular destination for foreign tourists so if that bothers you I wouldnt stay here  Overall though I was expecting much worse for the price  We stayed a Sunday and Monday night and paid about night plus tax which seemed pretty reasonable for the location and time of year  
P => Great hotel We stayed here for  nights  Everything was great   especially the price I got the room for  On the internet with AAA discount This was a great rate for NYC It is very convienent to anyplace you want to see It was clean  Check in and check out was very quick We got to the hotel around noon and immediately was given our room  Had a few drinks in the lounge it was nice   only thing missing would be a free breakfast And the rooftop pool closed at pm  Would be nice to stay open at least till  especially for kids  
P => Great value with a pool We traveled with our  year old dhter and one her best friend  years old friend  We needed a hotel with a pool even in New York not easy to find at a reasonable price with  double beds I usually prefer a   hotel than a   but this one is a great value especially in Midtown close to everything  Good size room and a outdoor pool on the th floor The girls thought it was great and so did my husband and I  The whole personnel was great same for the front desk personnel and the concierge  Great family value  
P => Every service has its own price at this hotel We booked our room through hotels com and requuested for  double beds when we arrived they said they dont have any and request is not guaranteed thank God they still have non smoking   the front desk lady was not very nice either  We asked for rollaway bedand waited for almost an hour for housekeeping  Apparently the request has to go through front desk because they charged night we stayed at the Hilton two nights before at different city and the rollaway was free  On the last day we wanted to go sightseeing the city and asked for the bell service to store our lugagge and again they charged bag more if its oversized bag  As already mentioned by everyone else here the parking is night funny thing is we left our camera in the car and wanted to get it from the car ourselves but the rule of the valet is we werent allowed to go to the car ourselves until we leave the parking garage  To top it off when we were already checked out and wanted to fill out the gas we found a scratch ding on the right mirror of the rental car We know it wasnt there before because when we rented it we did an inspection with the rental car salesperson and you can tell somebody was trying to cover it up with somekind of paint  DO NOT PARK YOUR CAR IN THE VALET GARAGE IF YOU WANT IT SCRATCHLESS 
P => Excellent low budget hotel with pool My wife and I stayed in the three days in the Holiday Inn and were happily supiorsed by the friendly and helpful staff  The room that we had was clean and for New York standards very large  The location of the hotel is ideal  You are in walking distance of the theatre district Times Square and the Moma  The subway is just a few blocks away  We loved the pool but were a little disappointed that it wasnquott open longer  
P => Safe area for a good price in expensive NY but nothing great about the hotel  When we arrived from CA we had been traveling all day and didnt get to the hotel until AM  We had reserved a NON SMOKING room w double beds and had confirmation of that  However we were put into a NASTY smoking room where when you got off the elevator you almost got sick off the smell  Our youngest son cried for about an hour because of the smell   not a great start  I ended up sleeping  hours and went to the lobby to try to rest  In the morning I went to see about getting moved to a NON SMOKING room and I was told there werent any available even though the night clerks had told us we could move in the morning  After I was forceful and told them that they needed to find us a non smoking room OR find us another hotel at the same rate we were paying they magically found us a room  Once the manager arrived I spoke with her about my conversation at check in and that I wanted the room fee waived for that night  She had the audacity to say quotYou were happy with a   discount last night  when you checked in quot I told her that we didnt really have much of a choice since there was no manager on staff when we arrived and with it being  oclock in the morning and because we were traveling with children we just needed shelter  She ended up giving us   off for that one night and free breakfast in the hotel restaurant nothing special  The rest of the stay was pretty much what other people have posted  Not an exceptionally friendly staff  Nothing special about the hotel  But a very good price for where you are staying in a chain where you know what the hotels are like  With our AAA card we got a rate under night    thats pretty unheard of for the area for a family of   I would only recommend the hotel if you get a rate you cant beat in a hotel where you feel like youll be safe and its relatively clean  If the chance of being put in a smoking room is an issue for you like it was for us beware that it might happen and it might not be worth it  
P => Great central location The hotel was very nice and clean  Its location was walking distance to Times Square and Central Park  i dont think that a hotel should charge you to park if your staying at the hotel and the breakfast was expensive for what you ordered but otherwise a nice place to stay  
P => FANTASTIC   PERFECT LOCATION Stayed here for ten days at the end of e   We were in the smoking bit so naturally there was the lingering smell of smoke in our room but a couple of cheapo air fresheners solved that wee problem  We were  floors up so had a fabby view of part of the skyline all lit up at night not forgetting the perfect view of the independence day fireworks which others paid   dollars to see ahem  The room was cleaned daily  Only downside was sometimes there was a wee bit of a wait for the elevator but hey ho being  floors up and only  elevators to serve them what does one expectCouldnt fault the location about   minutes walk to Times Square how fab is that Had our breakfast at a wee restaurantdiner on the corner of th Street and th Avenue called the Morning Star  A quaint wee eatery run by mainly family members   ace food with fast friendly and efficient service just perfect to set myself and my family up for a day sightseeing in this fab city  Other fancy restaurants served the same food minus the ambience and quotcrackquot for three times the price we ended up having our dinner there every night  Big hello to George and Harry and Ron  Miss them all already I luv New York it was my third visit  If I was to go back wouldnt hesitate to book a room in the Holiday Inn 
P => Good value good location  I stayed at this hotel for three nights with my Mother and two dhters four girls in the room with two double beds  We ended up on the th floor which had a nice city view  I had booked another hotel and switched at the last minute because the price difference was   I am glad we switched because it was a huge savings and paid for all of our meals for three days  If you are sightseeing in NY most likely you will not be spending any time in your room at all  We have two young children and were never back at the hotel before  pm then went straight to bed  The room is good sized bigger than most I would say fit all four of us nicely  It was not state of the art or plush  It was average but substantial clean and served its purpose  The bathroom vanity area was small my biggest complaint  The carpets could use some updating  I usually like a fairly nice hotel at least   stars but went with this one based on price  If you want a good deal good location and dont mind if its not a plushy or trendy hotel then this is a good place to stay  Also we did the CitySightsNY Double ker bus tour and loved it  It is a hop on hop off bus tour and you have two days to use the bus  We saw almost all of the major sites in the city atop the bus stopped at the places we wanted to see and then hopped on the next bus  I would highly recommend that tour  Great way to see the city in a short amount of time We loved NY cant wait to go back 
P => Absolutely Horrible My husband and I chose this hotel for our first trip to New York  All I can say is   DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL  Customer service is HORRIBLE  The hotel itself is disgusting  As we were walking down our corridor the smell of dust and smoke REEKED Our room was so disappointing  Everything piece of furniture was dirty grimy and disgusting  In short the pictures on the website are eiving   DO NOT STAY HERE 
P => A nice stay in a great city We stayed here for  nights and we were give this hotel by Virgin Holidays  The hotel lobby and main area is very clean and spacious but once you go into the lifts and to your floor the hotel seems a bit old in places the corridors did smell of a wierd odour  The rooms were fine and comfortable and the daily maids were very good  The bathroom was very small and the door did not close  Had no trouble with road noise and slept fine  The beds were comfortable  We had breakfast in the Gotham Cafe and it was very tasty and very resonable  Walking to the heart of NY   Timesn Square took about  minutes  but it was a very nice area and walk  Would use the hotel again but would look somewhere else first if could get a better price  New York is a wonderful city and everyone who visit will have a great time cant wait to go back  
P => Excellent value and location  I would recommend this hotel  We stayed here for  days in e   The hotel is good value and in a great location close to Central Park     min walk and Times Square     min walk there is also a subway station very nearby  The room was a good size and very clean  cleaned daily   The hotel staff were always helpful I would recommend this hotel you would struggle to get better value for money in Mnahattan I would definitely stay here again  
P => Please dont go there Do stay here if for no other reason than the service is terrible  We booked the room weeks in advance and when we arrived they had the check out date wrong a day longer than we were staying then stated they couldnt and wouldnt alter it  We were informed that by booking the room we had to still pay for the day even if we were not there  Then we asked what if we cancel our reservation now and just get a room they advised that they would still bill us for the  nights  As of yet we have not resolved the issue with the management  The room was fine for what it is but I cant see us staying there again  
P => Well position hotel for tourist visit Visited this hotel for a couple of nights as part of a UK tourist group  All the room facilities cleanliness were good  The main lobby always seemed crowded with guests coming and going  Used the restuarant for breakfast which was adequate although some members of our group found the service very slow  found the bar prices extortionateHowever the hotel was well positioned for access to all the tourist parts of New York and was in a safe enough area  There were a range of small shopscafes nearbye  If you are looking for a really good meal and drink without breaking the bank try Kennedys Irish pub  YDS along th St  As good a meal as I have had even in much classier places 
P => Terrible Service No Water for a Day Slamming Doors But a Great Location The negatives of this hotel overshadow the positives so I will start off with the negatives The bad First off floors   had no water for about  hours  This meant that if you went to the restroom before you realized there was no water that there was no way to flush the human waste down the toilet without water pressure Second issue guests would discard food trays outside of their rooms in the hallways  These trays would have discarded food on them  The trays would be in the hallways for days at a time  There were two on our floor alone and one of them we had to walk by every time Third issue after walking by the same discarded tray of rotting food for over  hours the smell started getting to my pregnant wife  So I picked up the tray and took it to the front desk so they could do something with it  I explained to the lady that the tray wasnt mine and had been sitting in the hall by the elevator for over two days and that the food was starting to rot  Instead of apologizing the woman at the front desk where people check in said quotWhy would you bring this to the front desk What do you want me to do with this censored inflammatory religious reference What nervequotAlso when the hotel floors   lost water AC and the ability to evacuate human waste from guest room toilets for about  hours most of the staff was rude and eptive about the reason why and the amount of time to restoration  The staff refused to relocate me and my pregnant wife from the th floor to another hotel and said that I was free to do so at my own expense  However at the end of the trip they did refund me   of one day for the  hours we were without water which is a satisfactory solution to me The hotel also has a noise issue with doors  All of the doors slam so hard that they woke me and my wife up each time someone on our half of the floor entered or exited their room and allowed the door to naturally shut Pool hours for the hotel were am to pm  Youd think they would be from be noon to midnight  My wife and I werent able to make use of the pool because of the pm closing time The elevators are slow and crowded as well and sometimes dont always function right The goodIf it wasnt for the horrible handling of the food tray situation and lack of water issue I would have had a very enjoyable stayThe best part of this hotel is the location  There are a LARGE amount of subway lines at the quotColumbus Circlequot station and you can actually access them from an underground tunnel thats at th Street and th Avenue great if its raining  You can quickly and easily use the subways to go anywhere including Citi Field The Brox Zoo New Yankee Stadium Anywhere in Manhattan  Also youre within short walking distance of Times Square the Broadway theatres Restaurant Row and beautiful Central Park Although we received generally bad service there was one very nice young gentleman that manned the front desk at night he was a gem The rooms arent huge but they arent small either  The bathrooms are a little small and ours was showing ware but nothing that was too bad  After all its a Holiday Inn youre not there for a swanky bathroom The TVs are alright and have lots of local and national channels to keep you entertained While I had a few negatives listed about the pool above it actually is a nice facility just with bad hours  The rooftop pool located on top the of south tower perhaps above the th or th floor has a great view of Manhattan and New Jersey  The pool facility is well maintained The room cleaning staff while they didnt fluently speak English were very polite and did a great job of cleaning and replenishing the rooms with towels  The lady that took care of the th floor noticed we had the quotDo Not Disturbquot sign because we didnt want room service each day and offered us towels when we came back to our room which was very courteous and high level of her Also the wireless Internet while not blazing fast was more than sufficient and much better than other hotels out there  It was easy to setup and use and I was able to use it from my th floor north tower room  
P => Great Value Great Location We recently spent four nights at the Holiday Inn on th Street  We were pleasantly surprised at the location and cleanliness of the hotel  As we were arriving late I emailed and requested a nice room with a view for our first visit to NYC and the staff was very accommodating  We had a lovely king room on the th floor overlooking th Street  We couldnt have been more pleased  The hotel is well within walking distance of many attractions and we felt very safe walking even after midnight  We ate breakfast in the hotel dining room and it was priced reasonably  The only inconvenience was the elevators which were small and slow  Other than that we could find no fault with the hotel or the area  One thing that is a big plus for me is having windows that will open  We would definitely stay at this hotel another time  
P => Great Location at a Great Price We recently spent  nights at this hotel  The location was top notch  We could walk to the theater Central Park Times Square the Lincoln Center and th Avenue comfortably  There are several good places to eat nearby  The hotel itself is a bit dated but the room was good size by normal standards and huge by NYC standards  The layout of the bathroom and dressing area was a bit cramped and could have been laid out better  The only real negative were the elevators  They are extremely small and if you over fill them they will get stuck between floors  We found ourselves stuck on more than one occassion when despite our warning people crammed into the elevator  The value was tremendous  most of our nights were in the   range  I have already recommended this hotel to several friends  
P => I HAD A GREAT STAY HERE The Holiday Inn on W  th Street definitely exceeded my expectations  My room was small but clean and well appointed with great bedding  The staff was helpful  The gym is actually a serious no frills local gym located in the basement very much like the one I go to in Los Angeles Body Builders in Silver Lake  The shop in the lobby offers plenty of snacks and the prices are not exorbitant  I took advantage of the reasonably priced shuttle to JFK but be advised that you should book your shuttle seat  hours in advance  The west side location is very convenient a short walk to Columbus Circle and Central Park  Overall I give the Holiday Inn th Street high ks  They are definitely making an effort in all areas including pricing  This is a particularly good place to stay if you are a former New Yorker or know your way around the city and dont need to be babied  
P => Great Location at a better than average price Stayed here for  nights with my family  The rooms were larger than the average NYC hotel room Ive experienced  Check in was easy as was check out  I rated this at  because the price location and room size couldnt be beat  Keep in mind that this is not a fancy hotel  It is a bit worn around the edges but it is clean and comfortable  I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised when I saw the property and room  The place was quiet  One negative was The AC didnt work that well  Luckily it was cool the days we were in town  Our room was on floor  and faced the parking lot  I did not hear any street noise  Big plus is central location  I have an  year old and  year old and we walked a lot  The hotel is within easy walking distance of the park and Times Square  We walked from the Natural History Museum to FAO Schwartz to Times Square  For longer treks we used the subway  I gave my  year old a subway map and he guided us through  Subway is easy enough for an  year old to navigate  There is a subway station a couple blocks up at th and th ave  We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant  I was not impressed with the restaurant at all  Food was average and service spotty  Im still rating the hotel a  because I know better not to eat in hotel restaurants especially in NYC where food is on every corner  I would stay here again based on location and price paid  
P => Great place to stay Ive stayed here several times and continue to be impressed with the pre trip help and the service when I arrived  For the price and what you get I believe its the best deal in mid town  You can get nicer but you also will pay   more  Its in a quiet part of town and five minutes from subways  A great deli is a two minute walk down the street with great food  Plus youre a ten minute walk from Central Park  I cant recommend it enough  
P => Would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone    The hotel is old and smelly and dirty I originally asked for a nonsmoking room and they gave us a stinky dirty old room  I requested the front desk for antoher room and was told that they normally wouldnt change the room but eventually they gave me another room  The new room still smelled bad with the wall papers peeling and the popcorn ceiling falling all over the coffee pot  It was disgusting but since the hotel had no other rooms available I couldnt request to be moved again  The air conditioning got my teenage son sick   The bathroom is small with molds on the ceiling and the beds are old and lumpy  I could go on and on and on  The only good thing was the location   it was walking distance to th avenue  
P => Nice place for the price We stayed here over the weekend and found it to be very nice and not too far from the main attractions  wee walked everywhere and only took a taxi at the end of the night to get back because by the time we did head back it was late and we were exhausted  Overall nice place if you are just looking for a place to sleep which is what we were looking for  
P => Great hotel   no complaints Myself and two other female friends stayed at this hotel and we were very pleased  The room was great and very clean  The bathroom couldnt be better  We paid  including taxes  Ive stayed in other hotels for the same price which never even came close to meeting the standards of this hotel  I think this hotel is a real find for the money  The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful  They held our baggage after checkout while we explored Manhattan all day  I highly recommend this hotel  It is in a safe area there is a nice restaurant for breakfast that is not too far on th Ave near th street called the Applewood  There is also a very nice Italian restaurant on th Street near the hotel Ralphs Italian Restaurant  The food was great and inexpensive  I think you would be happy with this hotel and its location  
P => Great Value Good sized rooms didnt feel cramped  Only the bathroom was small  Walls were a tad thin as you could hear other folks slamming doors and such but quiet at night  Free WiFi  Good water pressure good AC clean rooms  Another guest said the pool is really nice  Great diners within walking distance  Very centrally located 
P => tired and dated hotel i stayed in the south tower which is tired and dated the bathroom leaves a lot to be desired the standing room in the bathroom was about  square feet the bath is very small with mould on the tiles and paper peeling off under the sink however the room is large and the hotel is in a great location  minute walk to central park and   mins to times square 
P => According the expectations Hotel is well located close to Broadway especially if you like visit shows in Broadway theatres  th avenues cafes and restaurants and Central Park are just in walking distance  Hotel itself doesnt offer any big suprises  Service is OK and rooms clean but if youre looking five stars luxury this is not a right place to choose  
P => A great hotel by US standards Generally Ive found that US hotels arent quite up to the standards that us Europeans are used to  This was a good hotel with friendly staff  Carpets needed renewing and bathrooms are small but the hotel is generally good  Ideal location for exploring Midtown  
P => If you are just interested in location you cant beat the price  The location is hard to beat  Its a few blocks from Central Park in downtown Manhattan  If youre just looking for a safe place to lay your head youll have a difficult time beating the price The rooms are older but extremely clean and well kept  Theyre spacious by NY standards  Our ac was old and had a difficult time keeping up with the heat might be a bigger issue in yust  Other than that it was comfortable  Bed was a little lumpy but passable Business Center is  per  minutes but in room Internet is free with your own laptop  The meeting areas are nice and appear to be newly reated Service is hit and miss    of the people we saw employed inside the hotel were Russian and most everyone outside was not  Some were polite others were cold and impassive  One at the front desk was noticeably rude to the Japanese party ahead of me  No smiles or warmth just efficiency  Perhaps the business clientele appreciate this as tourists we did not Parking is expensive about night its about the same as anywhere else in the area and at least its covered and well protected The pool yes a pool in Manhattan is open during the summer only Doormen were great and a great source of information If we had it to do again we would stay farther out and take the train  However you wont be able to beat their price for a safe and clean place to stay in Manhattan  They are almost half as expensive as everywhere else in the area  Recommended for budget travelers or those only needing a safe clean place to stay  
P => Excellent location large room for the price This hotel isnt super modern or fancy  but what it lacks in style it makes up for in service and location All the staff was helpful and the rooms were very clean  We stayed in a room with  double beds which was huge especially by NYC standards  Located just a few blocks from Columbus Circle and Central Park close to Metro in a safe neighborhood  We ate most meals at the Whole Foods in Columbus Circle My only complaints are really minor  slow elevators and expensive on site restaurant  Skip the hotel food and venture out into the neighborhood  there are lots of diners as well and a McDonalds and Wendys down the street  Also if you dont have a laptop you have to pay per minute to use the business center computers I plan to stay here on my next visit  
P => Not fancy but convenient comfortable clean with pleasant staff My dhter and I went to New York to celebrate her graduation from University and we were pleased to find the hotel a good value for the price convenient to Time SquareBroadway and Central Park  We found the lobby of hotel to be attractive and the rooms quite well kept for an older hotel   and the only negatives were the hallways were kind of drab the elevators were slow and the bar was expensive even for New York   We were on the th floor and considering that we were in a busy area the hotel was rekably quiet  The staff were helpful and overall we were very happy with our four night stay  
P => Great NYC Bargain This hotel was a great find  It is only a few blocks from Central Park  On the positive the location was good it was safe the service was good and the price was excellent especially for two full beds in one room in NYC  It was not perfect  The rooms were dated which made them seem a little dingy  But the bedding towels and linens were all clean  The first room we were in had a ceiling leak in the bathroom exposed pipes and hole in ceiling  We asked to be moved and were moved promptly and given a free breakfast coupon  The second room had a strange layout but it was fine for our needs  It was a great bargain especially if you want a lot of space in NYC   the rooms were very large for NYC hotel standards  
P => GREAT VALUE  Just returned from  nights  This hotel is great value  Found all staff to be very friendly and helpful  Had room on th floor which was large in size and very quiet and had all necessary amenities except a fridge  Room was very clean and more than adequate for our stay Concierge arranged a limo back to JFK which we shared with another couple for   For breakfat try the Moonrock Diner on next block left out of hotel or Brooklyn Diner  blocks away Saw Jersey Boys on Broadway  BrilliantGo up to Top of the Rock for great city views 
P => Better than just OK  This is not a bad hotel  In fact it is better than OK  But it is a bit dated with dingy colors and wallpaper  The staff was very pleasant  We had a couple of issues  The pillows were that foamy stuff we dont like  I called and they were replaced with new feather ones  The hall smoke alarm kept beeping with a low battery  We told the housekeeper and it was replaced quickly  We noticed room service trays left in the hallways for very long periods of time  Not only is that unsightl and smelly it is an invitation for bugs  We mentioned it downstairs and they were quickily removed  Our only real issue was the air conditioning  Not unpleasant just never as cool as we like a sleeping temperature  It is close to the Metro so that was great  
P => New York at its best the Holiday Inn was ok   This was not my usual stay in a hotel it was me the father and my  year old dhter so when I walked into the room and seen just how large it was I was so happy the last thing you need is to be squishing around each other in a room as I said she is  so spent most of her time in the bathroom and was not happy as that was very small not what she is used to at all at all lol We did not have breakfast there but if anyone would like a good place to go there is the Moonrock Diner Caf  when you come out the door of the hotel turn right and one block up on the left the staff and food are great Back to the hotel we booked this hotel because of the price I got a great price on line paid up front and was very happy with our large room Carl the Concierge was a great help even for the stupid questions lol The hotel and rooms do need a make over its old old old but I found it to be very clean You cant beat this hotel with a stick as for its location one block over and  up and your in central park and even by taxi its at max  bucks to times square we used a bus and Subway and a little tip if you have a subway ticket you can use it on the bus also Look its New York and we had room  it over looked the road and no matter what your going to hear noise if you did not hear it your in the wrong city lol saying that it was not that bad Over all I would stay here again for the price and location alone if I had been looking for some thing fancy   forget about it    
P => Pleasantly surprised and pleased Interesting location to the west of Midtown with a hint of realism about the people away from the bright lights but not too far  Easy walking distance to the likes of Central Park and Times Square  Subway stations also  or  minutes walk away and great fun to use   suggest buy the   Metro Card for unlimited use for day  The sightseeing buses also good value and can often get a deal if talk to the uniformed salesmen on the street cornors yellow and red outfits  The commentators all have an interesting slant on life in NY  Deals can also include Empire State and Boat trip around Manhattan  Warning if going up the Empire State get there by  am or leave until  pm due to long queues   mainly due to security Hotel was friendly and what we expected  Breakfast was ample and reasonably priced  Felt very safe on the streets and would use again   
P => in two minds This is an outdated place  Old rooms that need refurbishing not really very clean and staff is helpfull but not friendly except Carl at bookings musicalstheatrerestaurantsclubs    whos a gem Location is good and price reasonable for NY  
P => Wasnt bad but check your bill at the end Stayed at this Holiday Inn as it was slightly cheaper than the rest of the hotels in the IC chain Its about min walk from the PATH station that goes to and from Newark Intl  Checking in was good and quite quick  As a Platinum member of the Priory membership club was given vouchers for continental breakfast each morning which was unexpected  Got to the room which was on the th floor  Room was a twin bed room and was quite spacious for New York  The room itself looked a bit tired but was clean  The bathroom set up was a bit weird for me with the sink outside The bathroom itself wasnt that nice and smelt of damp with some quotfriendlyquot mold growing in the corner  The room was equiped with a large TV and coffee machine but no tea for us Brits   I would have liked a safe in the room but after looking everywhere for mins couldnt find one The rooms were cleaned everyday to a good standard but no one seemed to notice the mold in the bathroomWe used our vouchers for breakfast and had some extras sometimes from the menu  Prices for breakfast did seem reasonable and were quick The best thing about this hotel is its location You could be in times square in about mins by walking  Did this most days   day and night   and felt quite safe On the last day we were advised that we could actually use the breakfast vouchers we were given against the menu and minus  off the bill which the reception conviently forgot to tell us  However this caused more problems than not as when it came to the bill on check out we were still charged the full amount  The reception seemed to not care and couldnt be bothered to help and resolve the problem  So after realising it was like talking to a brick wall we paid and left in a huff Overall because it was only slightly cheaper than the rest of the hotels in the IC chain I would probably go with them next time But was pleased with its location  
P => Perfect Location My Mom Grandmother and I stayed at the Midtown Holiday Inn on a Friday   Sunday in il  While the hotel room itself was adequate the location could not be beat A     minute walk will take you to Central Park in one direction and Times Square in the other direction  The three of us fit comfortably in a room with  double beds  I would stay there again For breakfast be sure to try the Morning Star Cafe for breakfast   right on the corner at th and th  We also ate breakfast one morning at the Brooklyn Diner which was a little pricey but very good  Dinner options  Ate at ONeals  W th Street before the theater one night   very good upscale American food moderately expensive  Also tried Patsys  W th Street   great Italian food so so service and high prices 
P => Not a bad hotel in an ex location and at a good price This hotel is what you expect from a holiday inn ex location good price fairly sterile atmosphere but it was clean  Our rooms were fairly large everything we needed was provided in the rooms hairdryer plenty clean towels crisp clean sheets plenty of hot water and an iron and ironing board  Rooms properly serviced everyday  Staff were polite and accommodating  Apart from the hotel needing to complete or overhaul the food was not great  None of our group were impressed but we did find several ex places to eat very near the hotel  Moonrock diner is where we ate a lot of our meals  They do ex pancakes for breakfast with huge portions and interesting specials for dinner and at a super price  We met Rachel Allen there one morning They are about half a block on right when you go out the front door of the hotel very near Kennedys pub on the opposite side of the road to the hotel  Super deli on the left of the hotel at the end of the block for take away   huge sandwiches really tasty and open  hrs  The location of this hotel is ex   we walked to th ave on the first day but got taxis to most of where we needed to go  No problem getting any outside the hotel  We would return to this hotel mainly for the location and price  
P => Nice staffbut dirty and old The location is ent but the hotel needs some MAJOR remodelling  Rooms are old smokey and dirty  Bedspreads look dated  Bathrooms tiny  During my last stay a bunch of kids were living next door with their mother and you could hear every word until  PM when they went to sleep finally  I was in a room with an adjoining door that was paper thin  Old dinner plates with caked and dried out food from room service stayed in the halls outside rooms for nearly all day  Very unsanitary  TONS of tour buses and tour groups use this hotel  Think   kids on field trips going to see Mama Mia  The people who work here are great and friendly  You get the impression that they know the place is a dump but its cheap and its in Midtown so why bother fixing it up  Also the elevators are extremely SLOW  cramped and stop on nearly every floor  They do have a very good fitness center  The restaurant is so so  Toast was dry  day old bread  Coffee was ent  The gift shop was a joke  The cash register wasnt working so they had to call in maintenance to fix it  
P => a good value for the money i actually expected less from this hotel for the price in midtown manhattan  we stayed  to   the concierge on duty friday and saturday evelyn was SO helpful  very honest and happy to help  i was impressed by her  the entire staff is wonderful the waiters in the restaurant the friendly people in the gift shop and the doormen  the hotel itself is old and the rooms are not very big but its clean and it felt very safe  i would definitely stay there again  
P => Excellent Location   Great value At least in LOW season We spent only one night from ch th to ch st but it was great  Central Park is at  blocks from this Hotel  Times Square is a  minute walk tops West St has nice restaurants and there are all sorts of ammenities close by The Hotel has two towers A and B the B looked in better shape than the A but we stayed in a room in the A and it was great  Comfortable beds nice and clean good bathroom etc I dont know if its a low season thing but we only paid   for the night before taxes AAA rate I thought that was a great deal for a Manhattan Hotel Room  
P => Good location terrible staff Good location good rooms  One night there was hot water and nobody told us  We got back from a shopping day at Woodbury and there was hot water and a fwe coming down on shower  Any apologyse for that and there was no advice and no one told us what had happened and when the water would be abble for the guests  So that night we had to stay at the hotel good room service  Whole hotel was being repaired so it was dirty  But the price was okay and great location  
P => Excelent for the Price If you want to go to Ny and intend to walk all day to the best atractions in the city and at night arrive in a absolutely clean and comfortably room NY in a excelent location too near from train station Central Park columbus circle Broadway Times Square   for a very good price this is a real good choice  Do no wait for luxury modern oration and a gorgeus swiming pool view this is not a new resort resort  I would came back for sure  
P => Good Value    Fine Location Its a Holiday Inn    so sterile atmosphere and lack of character and warmth are par for the course  The room itself was clean overall but there were some small but noticeable old stains on the furniture carpet and bed spread  The bed linen was clean and nicely prepped  The room and hallways look slightly dated and are starting to show some wear and tear often coated over with paint  The room itself was on the small side but served our needs  Unfortunately sleeping was hampered by the lack of dark curtains around the windows only sheer curtains are provided  Cleaning staff were very friendly and helpful  The front desk were indifferent and sometimes unhelpful but not rude  One bothersome note was that bellhops insisted on taking our bags to our room annoying in itself    but they did not accompany us  This meant we had to sit in our room for  minutes waiting for our bags to arrive and wondering if our passports were safe and then tipping for the privilege  Whats the point of this I carried my bags into the hotel surely I can take them up an elevatorThe location is very central  We got a good deal on the room and for that reason I would return here again assuming I could get a similar deal  
P => Clean clean clean Easy walk to Lincoln Center Carnegie Hall Columbus Circle and Central Park close to bus and subway you cant beat the location  Our quiet room was good size and comfortable with a good bed piles of soft pillows sheets under AND over the blanket which I always appreciate  Large squeaky clean bath with plenty of towels  The people couldnt have been friendlier or more helpful  We got a great rate and thought this hotel was a gem  Would go back in a heartbeat  
P => Hope to stay again    often Very Impressed We were very pleased with the service we received as a family with three young teens    everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful    from front desk housekeeping and bellhop services    morning paper coffee extra towels and amenities     storing our luggage on our day of departure  We couldnt be more impressed with the service at a fantastic location and a reasonable price Close to many tours museums restaurants and attractions     walking distance to Times Square Broadway District Late Nite with David Letterman    Central Park Park Plaza Hotel th Avenue Trump Tower etc    great restaurants and shopping      we are already planning another trip 
P => Cheap  After trailing the net for a ent  star hotel in Manhattan I soon realised it was quite a task to find one without bed bugs or other vermin infesting the hotel  The only review I read of a   hotel within this area was the Holiday Inn and my stay there was as many reviews highlighted was a very pleasent experienceUpon arrival we were greeted by the bell staff and checking in was not a problem  I do not smoke but we had unfortunately booked a smoking double room  The floor and room did not smell of smoke though so this was a good thingThe or of the hotel rooms is dated as is the furniture  The room itself was big more than enough space for  of us to lounge in the room could have easily held another person  We booked  double beds but found these to be rather small in comparison to that in this country so ideal for   be pushing it on the bed frontAmenties of the room were  HairdryerComplimentary lotion shower gel and shower capCoffee Machine topped up with the extras everyday at no chargeTVInternet Access via the TV at a costIroning board and IronRadio alarm clock  ours was a bit dodgty and kept going off at all hoursHeatingThe bathroom was tiny   but from reading other reviews to have a big bathroom is a luxury in New York as space   money and what you pay at a Holiday Inn hotel is value at its finest Therefore it wasnt really an issue Although what I did find odd was the basin sink was outside the bathroom Not sure if it was just the room we stayed in but heyThere was a school opposite the room we stayed in   we went during spring break so there was no traffic  noise in the morning  The windows are single glazed so Im guessing youd hear a lot during term time   Also the walls are thin and you can hear the water pipes from other walls  Note for the light sleepers   take ear plugsThere is parking at the hotel but its charged at something like  a day  Best to check if you are planning on hiring a car whilst out there  The transport links are pretty good   theres a subway a few blocks away at the time warner building oh yeah Ricky tin lives around the corner from the hotel and there are always cabs passing the hotel There were a few drawers to neatly store clothes in  Again reading other reviews there seems to be a major theft problem in other hotels but I cant say I had noticed anything missing now or there and at times I left my phone and camera in the room and it was exactly where I lft them when I came back  If you go in the summer months there is a rooftop pool which is open within certain hours of the day  Obviously being ruary and freezing this was locked off so I cant really say how big it wasLocation wise the hotel is situated around a  min taxi ride from the airport  NOTE Cabs are a flat rate of  tip from the airport to any Manhattan destination  Do not be fooled by the cowboy cabbies that hover and approach you in the airport asking for  and discouraging you from lining up Same applies on your return  There is something called an airtrain but if you are travelling with a few people works out to be cheaper getting a cab  If there is a long queue just be patient as the cab wait line goes very quickThe hotel is a few around  blocks from Time Square   not far to walk be  mins at the most   and Im not the quickest of walkers either The tour bus stop is a few blocks from the hotel as well so if you do ide to take the red blue city tour guide best to familarise yourself with the surrounding streets Up the road is a starbucks I can see why they say theres a starbucks on every corner there literally is   cheap compared to England so nice to have breakfast in as the hotel is very pricy with its menu  Hotel internet access was something like  per minute which is a rip off   starbucks have free wireless access for anyone taking a laptop with them There is also a nice little Turkish restaurant halal across the road from the starbucks near the hotel which is priced well   full meal costs under  and is beautifully cooked We ate there every night with no problems the staff are really nice and friendly Theres also a McDs by the cosmopoitan building youll know it when you see it   its a weird shaped building made from mirrors where they make all the top magazines   located about  minutes up the road from the hotel  McDs stop serving breakfast at am   and its really cheapJust a note in general   New York is very different to London  You can haggle in stores  obviously not places like Macys and Bloomingdales but independant stores  I did not know this but being a non US citizen you can claim back   on purchases with tax  From what I can remember clothing is the only thing not taxed in New York   and broadway  sporting tickets The hotel have an entertainment booking desk   again this is pricey best to go out to the broadway theatres and buy best available seats on the day  I also found i e  I went to see y Poppins we were charged at the theatre box office   for our tickets  When asking at the hotel they said the cheapest seats available were   for the same show in the same seats Same applies to the knicks game Madison Sq  Garden box office     hotel      Best to save the pennies and book direct when out and about One bad thing out of the control of the hotel of course was the water was really harsh in New York that it made my skin have rashes Take some cream  lotion just in case if your skin is sensitive All in all the Holiday Inn is what it is here  Had no problems getting towels and bed linen changed everyday and the maid service was pretty good as we were an untidy bunch at the best of times  Only bad thing was the the TV choices or be its the broadcasting networks with shabby choices and prices for food and entertainment at the hotel I didnt like New York   the people are so rude and London is so much better but if I had to go again I probably would stay at the Holiday Inn again  
P => above and beyond our expectation My friends and I stayed in this hotel for about  days  It was extremely amazing and meet our expectations  Location couldn t have been better anything you need is either up the street or around the corner  This inn is not your typical holiday INN  Rooms where immaculately clean and spacious   well ours was  Furthermore house keeping did there job well  Everything was organized and updated  Overall I would give this specific hotel   
P => shopping trip and friends birthday what a place the staff where very friendly allways willing to help got us booked up to do the sex and the city tour also mama mia and reserved us a table in tonys italian restraunt just off times square so if any is going check it out beautiful food but the drink can be expensive so go for a jug of there sangria mmm lovely 
P => Great location and great price If youre looking for an inexpensive hotel in midtown Manhattan the Holiday Inn is a great choice While in toen on business for  days I got a room with a queen sized bed for less than  a night which is unheard of in midtown Manhattan  My expectations were not very high    this is a Holiday Inn after all not the Waldorf Astoria    but I was very pleasantly surprised First of all the location is unbeatable  The hotel is on th Street    a major thoroughfare    is less than  blocks from the subway and is close to Columbus Circle Central Park and the Theatre District  There many good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel as well as a drug store that is open  various bodegasdelis manicure places and anything else you  need  It is also extremely easy to get a cab either at or near the hotel The hotel staff was very pleasant and accommodating  When I booked my reservations online the only room available at the price I wanted was a smoking room but upon check in I asked if they had any non smoking rooms available for the same price  They did and switched my reservation with no problem  The doormen also hailed cabs for me and helped me with my luggage upon my arrival and departure Room service was extremely fast and the food was good  I called room service around am all  mornings and received my order in less than  minutes each time  The food was good reasonably priced and the portions were very generous My room was very quiet and extremely clean  The bed was very comfortable and the heat was easy to adjust  The maids were very thorough  Oh and each room comes with free high speed wireless internet access which is so convenient You can connect to the internet in literally seconds and the connection is extremely fast  There are no catches at all it really is free I didnt check out any of the other amenities but I know there is a barlounge restaurant pool and fitness center  Again this isnt a luxury hotel but I was pleasantly suprised by the efficient service  I would absolutely stay at this hotel again its a great deal in an ideal location  
P => Not bad for its price and location I stayed at this hotel the first week of ruary   I booked a standard room with a Queen size bed through the Holiday Inn website and got a rate for  USD per night  With tax and other fees the total came out to about  USD The hotel is a little old and the rooms are a little outdated but for the price and location cant really get a better deal in Manhattan  The hotel is located only a few blocks away from Central Park  Its about a  minute walk  Subway access is only a few blocks away too  The bed was comfortable and the floors were clean  However there was some dust here and there  I really didnt mind the dust  Everything was fine with this hotel except for one thing  be this is not a big thing for some people but for me it was a bit of a nuisance  I guess its due to the old pipes or something but the water coming out of the bathroom sink and bathtub was a bit white kind of looked like salt water  It wasnt crystal clear like you would get in your home  That was my only complaint about my stay at this hotel Staff were friendly and polite  If youre looking for a cheap yet acceptable hotel in Manhattan this hotel is probably your best bet  For under  USD you get an acceptable room and great location  
P => Comfortable clean well run and reasonable hotel Great location near Columbus Circle and Central Park south  Easy walk to the subway My wife and I have stayed here three times and have always been pleased  Rooms are clean and well maintained  Staff of the hotel has been courteous and helpful  Certainly not a luxury hotel but for the price an excellent value  
P => Very nice We stayed at this hotel one week before Xmas and we couldnt believe that it could be so nice being so cheap for NYC The room was clean and nice room service every day there are lots of delis nearby so dont order breakfast in the hotel If youre going to NYC to do sightseeing and youre not afraid of walking all day you wont need any transportation its really close to times square and th avenue I would definetly stay there again 
P => Excellent location   couldnt be better I stayed in this hotel recently with a friend of mine  After reading some of the terrible reviews of other hotels I was afraid that it would be a dive  The or is a bit shabby and dated BUT we needed two doubles as my friend is a light sleeper and snores a lot  The room was surprisingly big for NYC where space is at a premium  I have to say the room was spotless so I couldnt fault it  I did get roomservice one nite but it wasnt great  so I would give that a miss if I were you  The best thing about this hotel was the location  If you stayed any closer to Times Square you wouldnt get a wink of sleep  This was only about  min walk to everything  We found a really classy upket diner five mins away called The Brooklyn Diner  Wth Street  It was full of locals and little bit pricey but lots of people watching to do and the staff were really chatty and nice here  The day we left the hotel our flight wasnt til that evening unfortunately but the concierge arranged for our bags to be checked and then they organised a towncar to the airport which was no dearer than a cab and it was MUCH more comfortable  The only bad thing about the hotel was the bathroom was a bit on the small side but I have stayed in more expensive hotels like the Sheraton Manhattan and the bathroom there wasnt much bigger so like I said space is at a premium in NYC I suppose  
P => A budget stay in Manhattan  Good location too We spent the last day of our NYC trip in the Holiday Inn on th St  It was a uary deal at  per night book through the hotel website it was the cheapest and the most convenient hotel we can find on the net Staff services were standard as expected in any budget hotel chain  The rooms were situated on two different wings   one has all the odd number rooms and the other has the even numbers  We were not told which wing our room was on so we got to find that out ourselves We stayed in the standard suite in the  even numbered  wing and were amazed at the spaciousness of the room given how small rooms can be in Manhattan  The room was very clean and odour free with king size bed TV fridge coffee making facilities and a standard bathroom include all the basics  It was a little strange having the wash basin and mirror outside the bathroom and the ironing board in the bathroom where the toilet and the bath tub are  Location is between th and th Avenue and if you are willing to do a little walking then the shopping world at th Avenue is no more than  minutes away  There is not much of a nightlife in the surrounds but Time Square is not too far away   about  or so blocks away each block is not very big so don t be afraid  There are some eateries if you keep walking towards the th th avenues but there is a Starbuck nearby if you need a quick feed  Duane Reade a  hour convenience store is also nearby if you need any essentials Breakfast is available on the ground floor  The food was reasonably priced from  to about  Food was fine with standard offerings  The food tasted a bit bland but the fresh orange juice was very niceOverall our stay in the Holiday Inn at th St was fairly standard   pleasant and expected  This hotel is more suited for travellers toward the end of their New York trip where they want a clean cheap and quiet place to stay for a night or two before heading back home  
P => Good location Very well located a very short walk to Central Park th avenue with lots of great restaurants and Time Square  Room was a good size dont be put off by the slight shabbiness of the corridors though the rooms are better than this  Other than that main complaint was the slight smell of smoke that seemed to hang around the corridors and the bathroom  
P => excellent hotel Stayed at this hotel for  nights with  friends we had  rooms  doubles and a twin  the rooms were very spacious with tv and great veiw of new york city  we had clean towels and flannels every day and nothing was to much for the reception staff very clean tidy and friendly hotel Exellent location most things with in walking distance such as central park and times square would definatley stay here again  
P => The only hotel in NYC for around  per night that was available Stayed for  nights at this hotel  It was clean   a room with  beds was large enough to accomodate  people comfortably  It also has a rooftop pool and a gym Its a few blocks south of Central Park  I couldnt say there was much of a quotvibequot to this neighbourhood   just some office buildings and a construction site were on the block but cafes and restaurants on th Ave were just a couple of blocks away  We felt safe at night   th St is quiet and adequately lit  The subway isnt too far away     minute walk This is a large hotel and I rang many hotels all over the city months ahead to try to get a room and this was the only hotel for around  a night that I could get in  Save yourself the trouble of calling smaller hotels and try this one first  
P =>  Good choice and excellent value  We stayed at this Hotel  nd   th  and were more than happy with our choice  The rooms are large clean and very comfortable we also had the benefit of an excellent view of the skyline at night  The location is very good most places withing walking distance although very cold in ember  The amenities excellent amp everything on hand the staff on the information desk were particularly helpful and even arranged a SUV to JFK at short notice  We were a little apprehensive after reading the odd negative review but very pleased with our experience  This Hotel is very good value for the price  Will definately stay here again in future  A TripAdvisor Member London 
P => loved it   stayed at the hoilday inn from the st until the th and had a fantastic time the hotel was perfect for location very cleantowels changed daily fresh coffee every day  very friendly staff and helpfull would definatly stay again and recommend itfor eating try kennedys across the road it is absolutely gorgeous food the chicken in basket was huge and well worth it 
P => Great Stay at the Holiday Inn Stayed at this hotel for  nights in ember and it was a great stay have stayed in New york several times but this hotel is hard to beat for price and room size Got a great deal booking through Hotwire Room was spacious and clean bathroom was on the small side but clean  Staff were friendly and the location was abit further out than I would normally stay but for the price its a bargain   nearest subway was columbus circle two blocks upWould stay at the Holiday inn again 
P => Great value at the Holiday Inn My two friends and I stayed for three nights in a triple room at this hotel  I have been to NY many times and usually stay at more upket hotels but on this occasion price was more important than design  On this level the hotel did not let us down we paid   per night for a triple room far less than similar hotels in this neighbourhood  The hotel is basic a little dated think floral bedspreads and dark wood furniture but more importantly is clean and well located  For a cheap option in NY I cant recommend this place highly enough  A  min walk to th Ave friendly staff and a large refurbed bathroom added to the experience  
P => Practical and comfortable this hotel is very sufficient for a short stay though its not glamourous and doesnt make you feel like a prince or princess on madison avenue it does provide clean comfortable rooms Being an older hotel it does have a darkish feel to it in the entryway and hallways and the carpets are a little stinky very minimal  I have chemical sensitivities and was not bothered by this  If you like fresh new york city airha ha you can open the windows in rooms partially personally I found this very comforting  The dining room was bustling in the morning and feels like a place you wouldnt mind hanging in for awhile I didnt have anything besides tea and muffin so I cant rate the food The convenience of the location and safety is a nice plus I would recommend it if your not looking for fancy welcoming lobby try times square for that and you just want a good place to rest  
P => Great Budget Hotel This hotel is great if youre on a budget when visiting NYC  The check in was fast the staff were courteous the room was clean and spacious  Didnt try the hotels restaurant though  We were quite pleased and would stay here again  Would be nice to visit here in the summer and try the rooftop pool  
P => Good location large room This midtown hotel is a bit further west than I prefer but the entire city was nearly sold out and this was a good option  Large room promt and inexpensive room service food was ok clean and pleasant overall Rooftop pool which is nice can be difficult to get a cab because of the locationstreet directiontraffic flow  I found myself crossing busy th many times to get a cab because the large tour busses were occupying the bellmans attention Rooms were a bit tired and well used especially for  a night but New York prices are what they are and with the UN Conference I was lucky to get a room  
P => Great Location Hotel what we paid for Me and my partner have just returned from a four night stay in NY and had an excellent time Check In was fine no problems no queue  We were given a room on the th floor had a view looking over th Street  Room was quite large we had  double beds  Bathroom was clean and had what we needed  The room was a standard  Star and the hotel isnt pretending to be anymore than this  I was a bit weary before i went with reading some of the reviews but i know i paid for a star and that is what i got  The rooms were spacious and clean and really that is all we needed  Only complaint was some noisy guests coming in at all hours but that was no fault of the hotels  Didnt sample any of the food in the hotel so cant comment on that but the room service prices are expensive  Location was fab walking distance of central park and times square  We got a taxi to battery park to get the ferry for statue of liberty and this only cost  which we thought was ok for the other side of manhattan  We landed into Newark airport and the taxi fare was  plus  toll fare plus tip so it worked out about  but returning the hotel arranged a shuttle transfer for us and this cost  per person cheaper to JFK so this was quite good Overall for the price and location this is perfect for anyone just wanting a bed for the night and wanting a base to explore new york 
P => Good hotel and location After reading some of the reviews posted we were a little concerned but need not have worried  No problems booking in the staff were polite and helpful the room was large and the bedding clean the bathroom was on the small size and in need of refurbishment but the water was always hot  We asked for assistance with the safe and someone arrived at the door within minutes  Ideally placed for sightseeing we took our  year old son and walked for most of the time he got as far as Times Square without moaning  We used a small restaurant just around the corner on th Ave called Route  for breakfast would recommend it  Be prepared for all types of weather in ober quite warm one minute absolutely freezing the next  Used a limo service to and from Newark Airport cheaper than getting a taxi  We enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn on th Street and would stay there again  
P => ent location but needs a makeover Stayed for  nights towards the end of ober and was glad to leave to be honest Let me start by saying that I am no expert on New York Hotels this being my first visit  But I expected much more from a Holiday Inn the previous week I had stayed in a Holiday Inn in San Francisco and the difference was chalk amp cheese  However my sister was staying at the otel on nd and said the rooms there were also below average so be its a NY thing The room th floor was very dated and smelled damp each time we entered  Also that awful Artex ceiling which had damp patches  As a Platinum Priority Club member I was given vouchers for a complimentary continental breakfast which mentioned Muffins Bagels Croissants etc  On the morning I tried it I was told by a waiter that I could have coffee orange juice and toast since they had nothing left  I never went back Also tried the restaurant one night which miraculously transforms from the breakfast room to an Italian Trattoria  The only difference is the menu  It was a joke  The waiter clearly forgot to process our order and mins later presented us with toast quotto keep us goingquot  ToastMy starter then arrived then  secs later another waiter came out of the kitchen with our mains spotted that I had just started my starter and did a U turn back into the kitchen  No doubt our meals were kept under a hot lamp for the next mins I had no problem with the staff other than the waiters  The bar and reception areas are fine  Was given a late pm check out which was helpful and the bell boy arranged a car to JFK   Safety deposit boxes are available at reception no safe in room these are free but you pay  if you lose the key As mentioned already its located well for Central Park and Times Square is a min walk Overall we enjoyed NY but next time I will look elsewhere for a hotel unless it gets renated  I noticed there were  blocks be I was in the old block My room faced th St  
P => Not special Pratic Good Location The hotel was has a good location near Central Park perfect if you would like to have running there and not so far from the Fifth Avenue  or  bus stops  Brodway and the most important museums are not so far the hotel is not special and new Rooms are very old    also the bathroom  New York City is very expensive for an accomodation  I know    but USD  for a double room  night is too much  
P => Holiday Inn th Street is perfect to expore NYC Styed here for  night from th tember and i have to say the hotel was brilliantI was really scared before i went as i had read some negative reviews however they were all thrown out the window when we arrived there  We has a room on the th floor facing the street which was amazing as we had a brilliant view and could soak up the NY atmosphereThere was  of us in the room with  suitcases but it was still hugeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee We had no problems with the bathroom and were right by the lifts however this caused us no problem  Check in and out was quick and the staff were all really friendly  The hotel is in the perfect position  Its only  min walk to Colmbus Subway station which was brilliant and only a  taxi ride to times square  th Avenue is around the corner and just behind the corner are loads of resturants  Definatly go to the morning star resturant  The food is brilliant and the staff are the best They were so nice and gave us loads of help  Also the moonrock diner just up the road is really good  There are loads of shops   mins walk away so it easy if you need anything Honestly this hotel is great in terms of its location rooms and service If your looking for a clean and comftable hotel then this one is great  Dont expect   quality but this hotel is still briliant  I am already planning my nest stay there next year 
P => Well positioned hotel for sightseeing  We stayed here for a couple of nights  The room was ok and there was a coffeemaker  However the bathroom was a bit small  There was a powerful shower over the bath The aircon unit in the room was pretty poor and didnt seem to cool the air   it just moved it around  This factor plus the heavy bedding made sleeping uncomfortably hot The subway station at Columbus circle is not far away which made getting to see the sights very easy  Also Times Square and Central Park are within walking distance  
P => Not bad at all The Midtown has a lot of positives and only a few negatives  The positives are that you can walk to Times Square its a about  blocks or so not much by NYC standards  A cab ride to Times Square cost us about  one way  It is located near a lot of stuff  Another positive is that the room is larger than a lot of rooms we were considering  We were able to have  girls stay comfortably in one room enough room for a rollaway bed which is rare in NYC  Bathrooms are very small but eh who cares there was enough room for us to sleep and get ready which is all we needed  The free continental breakfast is good as well  You have to ask for the coupons or they wont give it to you The negatives were housekeeping staff that did a less than stellar job  My dad spilled water on his bed at around pm and called to ask for a bed change and a new blanket  We left and arrived back at pm and nothing had been done  He called again and asked someone to come up and do it  Someone arrived  minutes later with some towels  Random So he called AGAIN and asked for sheets and blankets and someone brought them up and didnt even put them on the bed  Our room didnt get made up one day at all BUT at these prices and for a pretty good quality room with a good location you cant be too picky  I would recommend the hotel 
P => Its like they didnt try I live in New York but had to move to a hotel while my apartment was having some treatment  I am on a very limited budget so I settled on the best quality for the best money  The room is ok as long as you dont need much and there is wireless internet in the hotel  Those parts are nice  But the front desk was very RUDE every time we met  They spoke down to you and were confrentational  When checking in my girlfriend needed a copy of my credit card and ID when I had spoken with someone earlier in the day and they said everything was good to go  She called me to ask and I asked to speak with the desk  That request was denied and the conversation between the desk and my girlfriend went like thisWhat question does he haveCant he just ask you itI need to know what hes going to askWhat to me Shes not beig helpfulI AM being helpful Miss he can just call me at the hotelWell Im on the phone with him now right in front of youHave him call   Then i called and she denied any of the conversation had happened  She said I was right here and thats not what she said  Turns out SHE WAS THE ONE WHO SAID IT Bottom line the staff is rude and i will never stay here again  Plus the rooms have a lot of things missing that make it a pain in the butt  
P => Okay convenient Good location is its major plus friendly staff and charming and helpful conceige  The place was clean and neat  The room was average but the bathroom was tiny  no closet in the roomBar and restraunt were good 
P => Surprised After reading reviews about this hotel I didnt expect much to be honest  This was our first time in New York  Hotel is really nice from the outside and when you enter the buidling the lobby and reception are surprisingly better than photos posted on the website  Staff were friendly  Rooms were big clean and nice  Was overall really pleased and happy with the room  However the air con unit had a plastic bug strips under it so asked to change rooms to a higher floor just incase  Staff were great and said this was no problem  They even gave use free vouchers to use for breakfast and water  This room was perfect and really enjoyed our stay there  Breakfast was great especially since it was free and staff were really friendly and nice  Never went to the bar or restuarant but this also looked very appealing Stored all of our luggage for the day and also booked our taxi with doormen   all very friendly and helpful  We also used the safe facilities in the hotel found this also satisfactory  Would stay here again   great for shopping  
P => Really Pleased I thought this hotel was great  As a first timer to NYC its in a great location and handy to everything  The rooms were nice and big with comfy beds and quick wireless internet connection  Front desk were sometimes a little grumpy yet still helpful and the rest of the service was excellent would definately stay here again Would highly recommend it   I went with another friend and we both were very impressed with the size and cleaniness of the rooms and the location  
P => Feel good about this choice This is not an all star hotel but so what If you are like we were not knowing anything about New York we had real concerns about where to stay  We took at shot at this hotel and were very happy  It is reasonably priced  This isn t the place for you if you are looking for luxury but the staff was helpful and the location was perfect  It is a very easy in an easy out of New York by car  The location is very close to the subway  Further we felt very safe walking the neighborhood at night  Walking to Times Square was no big deal at all after dark  I was very very happy with the location which meant everything to me  The room was nice enough  We had no problems with the hotel at all  We will stay there again without question  I ve read some poor reviews but I didn t have any of the negative experiences that some have noted  I read reviews before I left and I felt the hotel was really underrated by reviewers overall  We were in New York to see the city and have a ent safe place to stay  This clearly met our needs on every level and more  Oh  easy parking too  You can just park the car and leave it for the extent of your stay  You are so close to Columbus Circle that you don t need your car at all  For Yankee fans  very easy to get to the stadium  Just take the D or the F make sure you know when you need to take the local F train  D does not always stop at the stadium  
P => Good Location We stayed at the Holiday Inn to explore the city quotNYquot this hotel is located  blocks of the subway entrance and Central park  There are some nice restaurants just one block away  The hotel has large rooms for a city hotel beds are good and the shower works and gives plenty of hot water  Instead of other visitors on thsi forum we found the hotel breakfast area just fine youll get a ent meal for a fair price and doesnt have to leave the building The pool was very nice too a little swim after a hot day and much walking is sure welcome  There arent much more hotels which have this service  So overall a good place to stay  
P => Great Location  stayed at the hotel with wife and  teenage dhters for  nights Had one room and was big enough for us all but bathroom was slightly small  room was clean and airconditioning worked adequately  requested high floor not facing the road and got this and found it to be very quiet at night  easy walking distance to times square and central park but not in the hustle and bustle of downtown  breakfast was ok but did not eat at the hotel as there are hundreds of eating places around  ideal for all the shows  walking distance and the hop on hop off tours would stay here again and would recommend this hotel for good value accomodation in New York  
P => holiday inn midowtn th manhatten Hi My dhter and I spent  nights at hol Inn th on th  we couldnt fault the hotel  Comfy beds pleasant staff great showers   minute walk from central park  minute walk to nd st subway  minutes  Good location and quiet too  Hop on and off bus good although it finishes at   so then you have to use local buses trains etc  Taxis seemed cheap enough drivers not very pleasant Recommend transfer buses from hotels well organised and on time  We booked all our tickets for top of rock tour buses and cruises and transfers this end saved a lot of time and hassle and good prices too  We used attraction tickets direct and booked on line  All in all a great find in a quiet location  Roof toop pool a bonus in ust as weather really hot  pool closes from st t and opens sundays only  Good luck and have a great time   we did comfy shoes a MUST 
P => Expected More When we arrived at this hotel the lobby and bar area etc were very inviting and we expected the same of the rooms     with it being a Holiday Inn and big brand name we expected it to be the same standard as a holiday Inn in the UK  however i would say that the UK standard is a lot higher The rooms themselves were okay  the or was be a bit old fashioned and there was a line of mildewmould on the net panel on the window  The room also never had curtains which closed which made good viewing for the rooms opposite in the building across the car park The bathroom was very small and again there were spots of mould round some tiles and overall we just felt as if it wasnt as clean fresh as it could have been The location was ok   we used the subway usually which was handy but was a good few blocks walk to get there    we would probably stay nearer the center next time and closer for walking distance to places   although there a few nice eateries round about Also the hotel reception staff could be quite bluntunhelpful but the bar staff and bellboys were very pleasant Overall the hotel wasnt bad  but if i was to return to New York i think i would stay somewhere different 
P => Dirty  I picked this hotel only because my brother had just started school nearby and we wanted to be in the same vicinity as him during our stay  I knew it would be a gamble because many holiday inns are disgusting but I figured wed take a chance We checked in and out easily and quickly though none of the staff was particularly friendly  They did have our room ready on time so that was a plus  Its a huge holiday inn with tons of people going in and out and a very crowded lobby  If you needed personal attention that would probably be a problem but since we are familiar with NY it was ok for us  The main problem was the room  We stayed in Tower B on the th floor  The room was OLD  Stained carpets faded bed spreads cracks in the bathroom very old furniture etc  The window in our room had fingerprints all over it in other words hadnt been cleaned in a long time  The beds were very worn with a big divet in the center from so many people having slept on them  The sheets were worn some discolorationstains on them as well  The bed was bouncy and uncomfortable and the pillows very lumpy  Air conditioner is  years old very noisy and not very cool  The bathroom was ok except for a very old shower curtain and MOLD on the ceiling  Black mold all over the ceiling  GrossThe bottom line is its hard to stay in a room like that and feel comfortable  You feel grossed out because everything is dirty and worn and you feel unclean even after you bathe and you cant sleep comfortably  In addition there were several trays of half eaten food in front of one of the doors in our hallway on Saturday when we checked in  On Monday when we checked out THEY WERE STILL THERE  Over  hours had passed and half eaten food was all over the hallway  The elevators are also old and gross and smell  Some people are not picky at all and I realize that and they probably wouldnt be bothered by any of that stuff but for me its a huge turn off I would not stay here again and dont recommend it to anyone who is even slightly picky about where they bathe and sleep  
P => Comfortable rooms good location I stayed in this hotel twice in ust   Once on the th floor of the A tower second time on rd floor  Hotel is centrally located close to Central Park and subway  Rooms were spacious ok equiped and beds comfortable  Bathrooms somewhat small and without good lighting but also ok  Both times my rooms were facing the street and it was pretty loud diring the night  Earplugs solved that problem  During my second stay I discovered that my bathroom was not cleaned dont ask me what I found there    They appologized and quickly gave me other room and breakfast voucher  They said there is nice swimming pool on the roof of the hotel  However opened only between a m and p m  so I didnt have chance to see it  Overall this hotel represents good quality for the money I paid  
P => Great Hotel Excellent location  Great base to get to all the amazing attractions that NYC has to offer  Hotel rooms very confortable with a great selection of amenities for a  star hotel  Massive beds that are very welcomed after a long days sightseeing in the city Plenty of places for breakfast nearby namely Moonrock diner on th  Great service and very good food No hesitation whatsoever in recommending this hotel 
P => Its aall about the location I stayed here for  days in e for some pre tour sightseeing MY freinds had a arrived a day before and got a smoking room which is odd as they are non smokers and their room stank of cigerette smoke Thankfully I had a non smoking room The room was extremely large and more than enough room for luggage etc The bathroom was very very small but the showerhead was amazingWe chose this hotel due to its location Midtown is the perfect place to stay for NY sightseeing The subway is close by and it is an easy walk to times square Overall this is not a posh hotel by any stretch but it is clean and close to everything  
P => Been there before will come back again This is one of very few reasonably priced but still nice hotels in Manhattan  It is not right in the heart of the action but is near it in a nice residential neighborhood  For me this provides some reprieve from the craziness of Midtown and a little feeling of living like a local Definitely a tourist hotel with lots of bus tour groups Brits and other Euros This is also a great value for regional travellers as valet parking is  only   per night a bargain for Manhattan The rooms are standard size for an American hotel which is to say quite large for Manhattan  Furnishings are contemporary though institutional My only serious complaint is the use of double beds instead of queens in the quottwo doublequot rooms and uncomfortable institutional mattresses In room fridge would have been nice though drinks did stay cold on the AC vent  
P => No surprises   a pleasant surprise for a family vacation Travelling with kids a hotel with a pool was the key consideration in our ision to pick this Holiday Inn Midtown  It was the only only hotel in our price range with a ent sized pool in the area we wanted to stay  That the pool shut down at  PM was a bit disappointing but not the end of the world   there is more than enough to do in Manhattan  For those looking for a Manhattan hotel with a pool it is important to note that the outdoor pool is seasonal   it is only open in the summer Needing a hotel room for a week long vacation in New York we chose this hotel  We were not disappointed  It was well located and despite being tired as some of the other reviews note well kept up and clean And the rooms are big for New York   at least at this price  We had a room with two double beds two adults two kids two days of shopping and all of the stuff that that entails  It was the size of a standard hotel room in places where space is not at a price premium or even a bit bigger  The staff was tremendously helpful   a plumbing issue in the bathroom was fixed promptly  The concierge provided good recommendations for meals and advice on airport transfers that would be cheaper and more convenient than a yellow taxi The only disappointment was the restaurant breakfast  We did not have other meals in the hotel  But it was still adequate   although three of four dirty juice glasses on the table left an impression that the restaurant s management was not really focussed on details  But that should not really be a concern   there are so many delis and restaurants around the hotel that ent meals can be had quickly at a good price within a very few blocks of the hotel  
P => Its pretty good  I was pleased You know     when you are in NYC you dont plan on staying in your room very much  When you are there you want to be relaxed get a good nice sleep and have a warm shower  This place will give you that  It is close to but out of the crazyness of the whole down area  I was there for  days with family and friends  I had a room that overlooked downtown and the pool  I did not take in the pool but there were always a bunch of people there  The consiearge service people were great  I didnt eat at the resturant there and overpaid for a Coke and water at the bar   This place is not going to pamper you and you wont be in the lap of luxary by any means  The rooms are a great size and were clean  Beds were comfortable and the room was quiet  the would be great for budget families and people who are going to spend most of thier time out and about in the city  We were a few blocks away from the subway which could take you up or down the island very quickly and easily  Taxis were always around  Overall it was a solid place to stay  
P => Loved the pool Holiday Inn Midtown NYC   Loved the poolOur family of four my husband and I and our two teenage dhters just spent eight nights at this hotel and we would stay here again in a heartbeat Service was great the room was large air conditioning worked well and we were also able to open the windows  The bathroom was a bit tight but thats life with two teenagers The sink area was arate from the bath and toilet which was a help  But the best thing about this hotel was the pool We arrived in the middle of a heat wave and the th floor outdoor pool saved us Hot and tired from sight seeing we arrived each day at the pool at about  pm and spent a few hours cooling off and lounging about on the plentiful lounge chairs  By  pm when the pool closes we were ready to head out for dinner and more NYC excitement   bring along one of those little travel clothes lines with the suction cups so you can hang your bathing suits over the tub  All in all this hotel was a fabulous choice for our family  
P => Great Location This hotel is in a great location but the property is old and the rooms look old as well but they were clean  I was a little concerned with noise at night but found this to be a quiet section of NY and we were never awakened during the night  I will certainly stay at this hotel on my next visit to NYC  I found the front desk staff to be less than attentive but this is NYC and you dont visit here for the outstanding customer service  The bellmen were really good but they are working for tips  I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on a quotfamilyquot type budget  There are plenty of great delis and restaurants within walking distance and a subway entrance is just two blocks away  Overall I think the hotel did a good job  
P => Nice Surprise When booking this hotel we didnt expect much  Its been years since weve stayed at a Holiday Inn  We were pleasantly surprised Our room was huge The most spacious room weve had in any of our stays in NYC  We were in the North Tower on the th floor  We had a king bed with a large desk and chair along with another lounge chair and ottoman  Of course the night stands and the TV armoir  The bathroom was small consisting of the toilet and shower only  Excellent shower pressure and HOT water  The vanity was erate off the main room which I love  I was thrilled with the space The only other amenitiy we used was the rooftop pool for a couple hours  It too was surprisingly great  Very clean They have one side of the roof for the pool and lounge chairs only  The other side has tables for eating and more lounge chairs  Very nice Our only complaint was the noise we heard from the other rooms  The rooms dont seem sound proof at all  Every time a toilet flushed or a shower ran from the room next door or across the hall it woke us up  It was quite loud  For the location the value and the room we would stay again  
P => A bit tired Stayed at this hotel for three nights at the start of East West tour of USA  It is in a good location and comfortable enough Some parts of the hotel are a bit tatty and a little tired would be the best description  
P => Average I stayed for one night as part of a business trip and felt that it was adequate for such a short stay  The shortcomings might have been more irritating on a longer stay The hotel is quite dated like most Holiday Inns these days but functional  It does seem very heavily used by tour groups and its probably better suited for this purpose than business because the internet is glacial and taxis hard to come by Its a bit out of the way for a Midtown hotel   not a long walk to the sites really but not in the thick of the action either  It gives the place a fairly underwhelming atmosphere   My only advice is to ask for a room on the lowest possible or highest possible floor  The lifts are tiny very slow and dont have programmed quotintelligencequot  I saw many people from floors   stranded because the lifts were full of people from higher floors Overall the hotel was reasonable value for money though more by comparison to the high prices charged by similar chains than for anything particularly uplifting  Solidly three star but it seems the hotel management is trying hard  
P => Perfect Budget Hotel I stayed here with a group of Girlfriends in ch  It was the perfect hotel to explore the city  The rooms were huge Lots of room to store the shopping and extra bags The rooms were spotless and cleaned daily  The ice machines in the halls were very handy  I will be fefinately staying here when I go back to New York  If you are looking for a budget hotel to stay for a few days of shopping this is it  Its not luxury but your not paying for luxury It is the perfect place to discover New York 
P => Softest towels ever We stayed at Holiday Inn Midtown on the recommendation of a friend  He stayed there for business a few years ago  We had a room on the th floor so we had a long ride whenever we went somewhere  The rooms were clean but the tub stopped draining one day and we complained about it  They sent up maintenance while we were out but the next time it was still somewhat clogged  The next day it worked fine  As for restocking the room the housekeepers gave us new soap everyday but I had to get my own shampoo from their closet  The best thing about the place was that THEY HAVE THE SOFTEST TOWELS I HAVE EVER HAD IN A HOTEL  I have stayed at some  star places that could get some lessons from this place  The AC worked fine since it was during heat wave in NYC  We didnt eat at the hotel and didnt use the pool  The desk staff was nice enough  The concierge doesnt work for the hotel and didnt really do much when we asked for help getting tickets to a show  I would stay there again if I had to but would look for someplace closer to Times Square or further downtown when we go again  
P => ent Hotel I stayed here for one night after my flight out of NYC was cancelled  The lobby and room were both average nothing to write home about but both were tastefully orated and clean  The bed was comfortable  The bathroom showed its age a bit but the fixtures worked well  The room and bathroom were both above average in terms of size  The hotel is in a nice location for many attractions  The price was also very reasonable for Manhattan  This is a good choice for those looking for a ent hotel at a reasonable price  
P => OK For One Night We arrived with our car and the attendants took care of it immediately  We were checked in early without any problems  The room was clean and everyone was helpful  The only problem was the air conditioning  It was set at the lowest temperature but the room was hot and stuffy  The location is great You can walk to everything  
P => Better than I thought I needed to be in NYC for one night with my fiance for an event on the upper east side on     All the hotels in that area were running  and I didnt want to spend that much money  I wasnt willing to try the quothostelquot experience   Im just not one for sharing bedrooms and bathrooms  So after searching for over two weeks for a hotel on all the sites orbitz kayak expedia etc  I finally found the Holiday Inn with an availability for under   I called the hotel directly and they offered me  for the night I reserved the room and read all the reviews on TripAdvisor  It looked a little run down but safe and clean and a convenient   minute walk to our event on E  st Street Our check in went fast and our hotel room was ready as soon as we arrived  Service was very friendly and helpful  We valeted my car in their underground garage for  overnight half of what the garage across the street was charging  We had a standard  double bed room the beds were confortable and clean  The bathroom was clean as well  Very small but typical of many New York hotels  Because I was only in town for one evening we never had a chance to check out the hotel restaurant or room service so I can only review the actual room that I stayed in Room    Overall it was a surprisingly a nicer hotel than the pictures online portray  If youre traveling to New Yotk City and need a reasonable hotel to stay that is right next to Central PArk and a  minute walk to th Avenue I recommend this Holiday Inn  
P => By New York standards perfectly ent As seasoned travellers to New York we know not to expect too much from affordable hotel accommodation in a good Manhattan location  The Holiday Inn Midtown was fine   clean and comfortable with helpful staff  It was the only place weve stayed that let us check in early and out late at no extra cost  When we had a problem printing our boarding passes at their business centre they refunded our money and allowed us into their backoffice to use their PCs  Service was excellent  Liked the free daily newspapers and pillow menu  The few problems we had were fixed within  mins of calling housekeeping   TV reception bulb blew in bedside lamp blocked toilet  We had a room at the back overlooking the rooftop pool so we didnt have problems with traffic noise Location was excellent  th Ave between about th and th is full of good restaurants  Our favourites were Eatery but it gets v busy so best to book ahead Wondee Siam II Q Thai Mangia i Bevi  Theres also a kind of hole in the wall of a shop that sells great pizza by the enormous slice for    We enjoyed being a bit away from the hem that is th nd streets  Weve stayed in those parts before and found it too busy and noisy There are a few subway stations nearby and Central Park is a short walk away  We were sligthly anxious that the hotel was a bit of a walk from anywhere but we neednt have worried  Im  months pregnant and managed no problem to walk everywhere Only gripes about the hotel wereThe plumbing although the shower was very powerful it tended to cut out and vary in temperature from time to time  The bath towels these were the size of a postage stamp and would barely go round me without a big pregnant bump in the wayThe lifts these were fine until a large group of tourists were all checking out at the same time and it took   no exaggeration    minutes to get from the lobby to our room on th floor and back The or we always lh at how backwards US or is in comparison to the standards comparable European hotels  Holiday Inn was fine just a little dated All in all a good hotel and wed definitely go back if we got a good deal again  
P => Just ok  Stayed at this hotel for  nights on our first trip to NYC  Location is great    you can walk to loads of places very easily  Theres a subway nearby  Cant fault the rooms for size but the standard of cleanliness was just ok  The whole place is desperately in need of a revamp  The bathroom was the most basic Ive ever experienced in a North American hotel The quotbell boysquot were a bit strange All very big men in sharp suits   At no time did anyone offer help with luggage  No one was rude exactly but they were very offhand amp just a wee bit intimidating Go across the street to the Morning Star diner for breakfast  Great food amp extremely friendly staff who are more than happy to give you directions amp advice on the best way to get around  Definitely do the movie location walking tour of Central Park    great fun As I said the hotel has an excellent location and the room was big but if we visit NYC again  and wed love to     its a fabulous city I wouldnt choose to stay here  
P => Great location but not good value Great location for touring but so many other things were dysfunctional I wouldnt recommend to anyone  AC is only functional by the hotel no individual control  The room was more than  after the hot afternoons  I felt like we were in the hot south with no ac  Hotel gave us a very small fan  No exhaust fan in the bathroom  The closet area was dark and stinky  No one told us how the windows opened even after complaining to the front desk of a hot room  Mattresses were old and soft  
P => Great Value for Money We booked this hotel after much research a little wary of some of the reviews but the price for the position was the best by far that we could get  Myself partner and  teenage boys shared a room and it was fine  As described clean functional but in need of an update  The staff were great   helpful friendly and efficient  The position is excellent not too noisy we walked everywhere except the most Downtown locations  
P => my home in NYC Have stayed here a few times and would have no reason to go anywhere else  A group of us stayed there during the NY athon  Staff were nice  My priority card meant something and I liked that  Could skip Q and could extend check out to afternoon at no cost  This is by far the best hotel I have stayed in in NYC at the price  Rooms are up to the higher Holiday Inn standard and are perfectly clean  Lifts are a problem OK there is not enough of them  Bar is fine and breakfast typical USA  Food is not an issue with so many diners and restaurants nearby  You can order in for a late snack if you want  Location is fine being about  minutes walk to st Subway and about  minutes walk to Times Sq  Its in what looks like a good neigbourhood nicely near but nicely away from the hussle bussle I will be back  
P => Big rooms good location Just returned from  days staying at the Holiday Inn with my teenage dhter and it was aboslutely fine for our requirements  The rooms were big  Much bigger than other hotels Ive stayed at in the city which is great when coming back with loads of shopping and for spreading out  The bathroom had a arate toilet which is a bonus and while not huge it was perfectly adequate and the whole place was very clean  OK it isnt spanking new and the lobby lifts and restaurant all feel very functional rather than stylish  But its a Holiday Inn so you should know what to expect  We had breakfast on the first day only and that was typical hotel fare and the cost of drinks in the bar were high  But to be honest unless youre staying in one of the top places who goes to a big city like New York and eats or drinks in the hotelStaff were friendly and helpful and concierge didnt try and rip me off when asking about tickets suggesting I book direct rather than through her which is a good sign The real bonus was the location I was a bit worried when I booked as on a map it looks a little bit out of the way  But it was perfect for what we wanted  Its a  min walk to the subway the edge of Central Park and Columbus Circlethe  mins to the City Line ferry terminal  mins to Times Square and  mins to Park Avenue etc  Id considered staying near Times Square but the real benefit with this hotel is that it is in a residential neighbourhood so its pretty quiet and there are a few local shops and delis within m It is right on the edge of the Hells Kitchen area and the walk down th Avenue towards Times Square passes loads of bars restaurants and cafes that have a good local vibe and feel to them  Its certainly not Soho or Greenwich Village as it still has the big wide roads but it felt far more real and les touristy than some other areas be not ideal if you are planning to be back and forth to the hotel all day but that will depend on where you want to be in the City and the closeness of the subway means that pretty much everywhere is easily accessible  
P => Exactly what we expected For  per night   between  of us we think we got a bargain for the  nights we stayed The room was basic but large and clean Staff courteous and maid service every day  We have used Holiday Inn all over the world and this compares favourably  After all its only somewhere to sleep and that was no problem   we were on the th floor at the back no external noise at all After reading other reviews we tried Route  Diner on th Ave for breakfast   just the once very disappointed with the service so we then tried Moonrock Diner on W th between th amp th what a difference great service excellent food and much more comfortable Be warned when eatingdrinking in New York before leaving a tip check your bill as   service charge seems to be the norm now some charge   for parties of  or more In addition some waiting staff still expect a gratuity on topOverall New York was a pleasant experience suitably enhanced by the    exchange rate  We went with suitcases half empty and filled them with bargains particularly from World of Golf Wth opposit Macys and GolfsmithEth between rd amp Lexington 
P => Needs a serious update Stayed for  nights at the Holiday Inn th Street   this is now the second visit  I remember it was fairly average first time round but certainly nothing has changed  The rooms are a ent size for New York and location isnt too bad for Central Park and walking to Times Square Unfortunately the whole hotel is now in serious need of updating   the lobby restaurant lifts and rooms probably havent been changed in  years and even then they were probably still another  years behing the times  The bathroom is so basic and awful that you could cry when you first see it  Queues for the lift every day are a nighte   you could walk down the stairs instead but bizarrely in quotAquot Tower you end up walking out into the street rather than going into the lobby  The staff are pretty much OK but dont really go that little extra distance for you  The hotel is always so full or as the check in staff admitted always overbooked that there is little chance of changing rooms Only recommended if you get a good deal   dont pay over the odds for this as it really isnt worth it 
P => Terrible customer service Stayed at this hotel for  nights over the St  Patricks Day weekend  The hotel clearly does not train their employees on the value of good customer service  When we checked in the front desk clerk looked up our reservation and said we had booked a smoking room with two double beds  My friend that booked the room who is clearly pregnant said no I booked a NON smoking room with two double beds  The clerk proceeded to be argumentative and said that they were completely booked and had only a non smoking room with one king bed or a smoking room with two double beds  We ided to try the quotsmokingquot room with the two double beds and got our keys  Upon entering the room it became apparent that the clerk gave us the wrong room   she gave us the non smoking with the one bed  Hmmm  Went back downstairs and another person perhaps an assistant manager helped us  Told her we were given the wrong room  She checked the computer and low and behold she was able to find us a non smoking room with two double beds which is what we had reserved in the first place  Interesting  On our last day we were sitting in the lobby waiting for our shuttle sat in worn out chairs with a little round table between the chairs that had a sign that said something to the effect of no eating and no drinking  Really Cant eat or drink anything in the lobby It wasnt as if the lobby was at all pristine its in desperate need of a serious make over  Whatever  So after sitting down in the chair with one leg tucked under me Im on the short side and my legs didnt reach the ground in that chair a guy that was working the bell desk approached us and told me that I needed to put my leg the one tucked under me on the floor  REALLY Was he being SERIOUS The bottom of my shoe was not touching any part of the worn out chair and the sole of the shoe was rubber so there was no risk of damaging any part of the chair  My friend and I were completely speechless  Absolutely unbelievably ridiculous  The hotel staff definitely does NOT make their guests feel welcome at all nor do they make their guests want to come back Wanting to complain about this experience I approached the front desk to get a comment card in order to give them well my comments  The clerk said they dont have comment cards but that I could write my comments on a blank piece of paper and give it to her  Wow    it just kept getting better and better By this time I was so completely appalled at the lack of customer service and the lack of motivation on the part of the staff to establish any customer loyalty  With so much competition out there the company should re think their policy on customer service  Its the little things that make a trip memorable and keep people coming back  I will never return to this Holiday Inn  No one ever greeted us the entire weekend whether we were coming or going or walking through the lobby  I prefer to stay in hotels that treat me like a guest  They dont have to go out of their way to make me feel comfortable but I do prefer to be treated with respect  
P => ch  I wouldnt use this hotel againI am a Platinum member of the Prioirtyclub  this is the first Intercontinental group of hotels that gave no respect to that status  Usually you get considered for an upgrade or you get a bottle of water as a minimum  nothing offered or received  Other members beware The check in staff were edging to wards being rude  The Female check in person was unfriendly unwelcoming and abrupt The main gripes were The lifts  too few and extremely busy with long waits walking down isnt an option from the th or higher floorsThe Rooms  noisy especially at night   I got very little sleep over the  nights we stayed  There were quite a lot of events   parties in the hotel   one particular event was a teenagers party with quite a lot of unaccompanied youths misbehaving and making quite a lot of noise past midnight  The location is quite good a few hundred metres from Columbus Circle amp Central Park but it is a long way north of Time Square though the Subway can ease the pain with a station about  metres away  However breakfast was excellent value with extremely helpful staff  Something like bacon eggs toast and drinks was around     The front of house team could do with being trained by the breakfast crew  excellent service  
P => Great Location Visiting New York for the first time and as we were only there for  nights and wanted to see all the main tourist sights we did not see the point in paying over the odds for accomodation  We chose this Holiday Inn based on previous reviews and were not disappointed  Previous descriptions are accurate in that the rooms are clean if in need of some basic orating  The staff were helpful without being over friendly and in fairness sorted out a mix up over the rooms very quickly and with the minimum of fuss  Previous comments referred to long waits for the lifts but we did not find this a problem Where this hotel really wins is its location  We found we could walk to Times Square in   mins and most of the other central attractions were also within walking distance for a relatively fit adult  In sumy we would definitely recommend this hotel as a base for seeing the sights of New York but dont expect  star luxury Finally I cannot comment on the food as we did not eat their but can highly recommend the Route  Diner which is just around the corner  Try the Lumberjack breakfast you will not be hungry until night time 
P => This could probably be any other hotel in NY I am a member of the hotel group and booked The Holiday Inn requesting the usual a quiet room not near liftsyoungsters on a high floor with good views  I had the misfortune to meet as I checked in a very unprofessional and aggressive young manageress who actually said that we do not care if you are a member or not and we treat all our clients alike  She further gave me a room on the th floor Tower B where everyone could look in my room no views at all between a guy that snored most of the night and a guy that coughed all the night and when not was busy smoking  All the doors could close only with a bang and across the hallway were  young girls that came from clubbing talking loudly at  am  You could hear the elevators this contributed to a bad very first impression on NY and the hotel  The next day however was a very kind older manageress that said that members should be treated differently and moved me to the th floor Tower A with excellent southern views no noisy neighbours apart from the one above me that played his ball in his room and huge bangs from closing the doors Conclusions   the hotel desperately needs a reation hallways look old door are terrible  some hotel staffmanagers are very professional some not  probably weekends are busier and you might have my experience  rooms are large but basic with a coffee machine and child size baths  the hotel is some min walk from the downtowns attractions  there are lots of superketscheap restaurants nearbyTips on NY  get a NY pass with access to lots of attractions front of the queue pass in some cases and access to UN where you can send your postal cards with your pic on the stamps  probably some   of the taxi drivers are very rude and they expect a tip or they just take it themselves  for original shoe shops and clothes and not the Designer stuff go to Broadway in Soho or  fake designer sun glasses that come even with security bar code in Canal St  underground staff is also very rude but New Yorkers are very kind and will go to extreme length to help youIf you go to sleep and wake up with an excellent view and then experience only good things trust me is very easy to fall in love with New York  
P => dont expect much from the staff my boyfriend and i stayed here for  nights on a romantic getaway to nyc  while good enough value for money the staff have to be the nastiest and least helpful and friendly ive ever met specifically those at the concierge desk  they kept trying to rip us off about taxis to the airport etc ive been to nyc plenty of times before so knew what i was doing but i dont know how many times the staff tried to tell us the meter would be run in a taxi and wed be better off paying for a private car that cost much more   its clearly stated in every yellow cab that the flat fare to jfk is  plus tip which is what we paid in the end when we finally got away from them  these guys were trying to get us to book a private car for  plus tip and wouldnt let it goobviously theyve their own scam going onthe rooms were fine and quite large by new york standards and cleaned daily  breakfast wasnt cheap so handy if youre stuck i wont be going back there again simply beacuse of the staff 
P => Better I stayed here again recently because they finally found some sanity in pricing and things were a little better The cafe downstairs still adds gratuity to the tab but the service has improved  I found if I request a room on the back side away from the street of tower A Im not wakened by horns and semi trucks at am now  Its still a small room with no microrefer but at least its reasonably priced at lt a night now You cant beat the location  Its a safe area stores everywhere and subway and taxis are near as well  Its back on my list for the price  
P => Great half term We stayed at the holiday Inn Midtown  th  for  days  Myself amp  teenage dhters We had a a large room on the th floor overlooking the Hudson river and a great view of the skyscrapers when it snowed The rooms were clean and we had maid service everyday  The heater was great and the beds the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel  Extra blankets provided minutes after the request  No problems at all Cannot comment on the restaurant as we preferred to eat out  if you like eggs for breakfast try Route  on th avenue around the corner and one evening we ate at a Thai restaurant on the same road  it was fabulousWe had the perfect trip  
P => Large rooms Average hotel what you would expect for a Holiday Inn   except in the context of NYC it is above average  Clean and orderly staff are a bit impersonal but they were helpful  Best feature is its room size   extraordinary compared to other places we stayed at during our trip  A normal sized hotel room by any other standards with the exception of London  Location is a little out of the way although it is still in Midtown  Its a few blocks away from the subway which in NYC is about as far as one can get  Good value for money though  
P => Its what youd expect from a Holiday Inn Myself and my partner stayed at the Holiday Inn on th Street in   for  days over the weekend On arrival the frontage is very pleasant bright and clean  The bell boys were very helpful and right there on leaving the taxi  Carried the bags in on the gold trolley tipped as is expected The lobby was large and open with a fully fitted bar situated to the right and down a few steps  The staff at the desk were friendly and pleasant to speak to no complaints Our room was on the th floor overlooking th street  The view was ok over the highrise buildings towards Central Park but no landks in sight  Windows could have done with a clean The room was well sized two double beds only needed one but the other took the cases with a clean although somewhat dowdy and low lit bathroom  The bedding was clean and everything worked as expected The bar area in the lobby was well equipped however expensive a vodkacoke and a bottle of lager came to    The American locals conversation about NASCAR however was worth a few bucks We cant comment on the food as prefered to eat out The location of the hotel was pretty good  blocks south of Central Park and only a  minute walk from Times Square All in all its a Holiday Inn no frills but what youd expect  Would stay there again although for the financial district and south Manhattan it is a subway ride or taxi away  
P => A pleasant surprise A very reasonably priced hotel in an excellent location  Staff friendly and helpful  Rooms spacious and beds comfortable  We would reccomend this hotel to anybody on a tourist visit to New York 
P => Lovely Stay   from Ireland Both myself and my Wife visited the states for the first time and booked in to the hotel on Sunday the rd of   The lobby was spotless which is always a good thing   First impressions were very favourable   The Gentleman on the front desk was polite and helpful   We went to our room on the second floor of the north tower and although the carpet and wallpaper was aged the room and the two doublebeds were again spotless  The rooms all have a coffee maker  iron and an iron boardT V and hair dryer   Our room was to the front of the building and it was very very noisy due to street traffic   I went to the front desk and asked a lady on the desk if i could have a room to the back of the building due to the noise   She was a little blunt with me and said in a boss like voice quot But there is nothing wrong with the roomquot  This is when i turned sour with her as only a tired Irish man can and asked her if she had been listening to me   the room was fine the noise was not    quotDo you need a hearing aidquot  She quickly gave me a room in the south tower and literally threw the key cards at me    I left them on the desk untill she handed them to me  Every other member of staff that we met were very nice during our stay  there is always one  The gymnasium staff were really nice people and had time to have a little word with everyone  Breakfast was good and the waiters were all very genuine and hard working people  The beds in the rooms were very comfortable the best hotel beds that i have ever slept in  Air conditioning in the room was good and multiple settings for the perfect room temp  In a nut shell the hotel is very well located the Staff except one were very professional and helpfullThe rooms were exceptionally clean and with daily maid service they were kept that way Allways fresh towells every day I would like to stay here again on my next trip to this wonderful city  
P => really good central location We stayed here for  nights in ober during a whirlwind tour of NYC  We loved it so much were going back in   The hotel is as you would expect from a corporate chain theres a bar a restaurant which isnt overly imaginative but the food is good and edible  The room was clean the shower worked and the bed was comfortable  The parking was handy and not expensive compared with London  Hey youre in a city  Dont expect miracles  Overall the staff were friendly the concierge service was good but dont bother asking for restaurant recommendations  Youre only a  minute walk from Lincoln Center which has a fabulous steak restaurant Porterhouse  Not overly expensive and well worth it  Youre also only a  minute walk from Times Square and the bus tours of NYC which are worth every single penny and some  We booked with Grayline tours did the uptown downtown and night time tours and had a great time  The night time journey over the th Street Bridge is a bit scary if you dont like heights but the views are superb  These bus tours are a fantastic way to see the city if youve only got a short time  We LOVED Ellis Island and would certainly go back again  
P => Good Hotel This Hotel is fine if you are just going to New York for a shopping trip as we were  The shopping isnt great close to the hotel but a couple of blocks gets you to time square and travelling over a few avenues gets you to th so everything is close enough  It is very close to the subways the rooms are really big and spacious  They are a little old fashioned but are spotless and good value for money  
P => Large comfortable room The Holiday Inn at th Street amp th Ave  is a very good location for seeing the sights of New York City  Right down the block is a subway station where you can get the th Ave  express to Greenwich Village   only  stops  Try the Route  Grill just around the corner for breakfast   very nice wait staff and good food  The hotel room was clean and large   we had two double beds and a rollaway double and could still move around  Bathroom was tiny but it did have a sink area outside the toiletshower  We werent there long but the service we had including parking was efficient and polite  They stroed our bags until the evening after we checked out  Did not eat at the restaurant but did go down for takeout coffee which was ok  I would stay there again  Good value for the size of the room   we paid  for four people  
P => Good value for NYC Have stayed here a number of times and it remains a good value for NYC  Most recent stay of earlier this week found the rooms to be very clean  Front desk service was fine  This is nothing fancy but the rooms are quite spacious for NYC and the prices are very reasonable  Close to Columbus Circle Central Park and good delis down the street where you can get a reasonably priced snack  
P => Gret Hotel and Great Location Just back from a girls weekend to New York and we stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown we do not have one complaint about this hotel  The front dest staff were very polite and helpful and the rooms are a good size  of us in one room and they are very clean considering all the shopping that we done our room was a mess with all the bags but when we came back that evening to our room it was perfect and all our bags neatly piled up by the wall  The location is great if you dont mind a little walking just minutes from central park and a lovely stroll to th Street even though the subways are just there we walked everywhere it was great and we found a great little diner on the corner of th ave morning star the breakfast is hudge and then up the street are  great bars   Thumbs up for this hotel from all of us we would stay there again great job to all working there    
P => Not bad at all I was somewhat concerned about this hotel because I did not find any recommendations and I really just booked it because it was the cheapest hotel I could find in Manhattan at Christmastime I stayed here  straight days including having my family with me for  of the days I know New York and I love it however West th is VERY noisy all night long  Perhaps its the easy access to the Westside Highway but emergency vehicles are almost constantly coming down th  It is also the preferred route for UPS tractor trailers for some reason  I had a third floor room so I heard everything  For those who might have trouble sleeping in those conditions   be warned I had a room with double beds and it is a very spacious room for NYC at the rate I paid  The bathroom is ok clean everything works  Housekeeping was excellent and when my kids were there and made a mess the room was spotless when we returned  The bedspreads are disgusting and you just want to tear them off immediately  Chintzy old flimsy bedspreads straight from the s They need to upgrade  Otherwise bedding was ent and clean  Double beds were very small and some adults might find them too small to sleep two people Restaurant has excellent breakfast but a little pricey  Wait staff was all very nice  General hotel Staff for the most part was very pleasant  Concierge is a very nice lady Several ent places to eat along th I liked the Morningstar on th and th and went there once for breakfast twice for dinner On one of my last nights there I had to perform an emergency computer repair and was in need of a phillips head screwdriver  I dont normally carry those kind of tools so I called front desk and asked if I could borrow one from engineering  They said they would call and send someone up  I had my doubts about whether it would really happen but  minutes later a maintenance guy was at my door and allowed me to use his screwdriver  He stopped by about  hr later to retrieve it  I just thought that was unusually good service for such an odd request  It was a pleasant surprise I did not drive into the city but if you were driving in this is a great hotel as you can get right off the Westside Highway and park in their garage for a very reasonable price 
P => Ideal for the tourist Just came back from a  night stay at the Holiday Inn  I had read some of the reviews before I went and did wonder what this hotel would be like but on the whole it was an ideal place to stay  The rooms were clean and cosy and although we only had one bed between  of us we mentioned it to the hotel staff and by the time we came back at the end of the night there was an additional bed added to the room  The bed itself was huge and very comfy In some reviews some people have mentioned about the sink being outside the bathroom this is not in all rooms but for ours it was beneficial especially when you have  people trying to get ready The staff were excellent especially the lady on the conciergeinformation desk who was always helpful and interested in how you had got on that day when you arrived back to the hotel  The bell boys as well were excellent if it hadnt been for them we  have missed our flight as I had booked the limo for the wrong day so watch the time differenceThis hotel is also excellently situated on th street between th and th avenue  The sub is just up the street and that takes you to anywhere you want to go and Times Square is in easy walking distance as you pass all the shops and eateries on your way there The breakfasts in the restaurant was good to we ate there most days as that way that was you set up for the day shoppingsight seeing I would definately recommend this hotel as it is location is ideal and you do not go to New York to sit in your hotel room  
P => Its not terrible Not a bad location  th and th Avenues are a looong blocks so its a walk to get to the better part of the area  But the walk is nice if the weather holds The rooms are OK  Typical of a Holiday Inn  Tiny bathrooms  OK amenities  I stayed here on a business trip based on price  I would do so again  
P => Great Value  The room was huge   we had a king size room  Cleaned very well daily The staff are friendly and helpful  The hotel is in a great location A couple of sub way stops from all the main attractions  The hotel is a  minute walk to the subway station  Just far enough out of the hem to be more relaxing but close enough to make getting about easy  Central Park is about a  minute walk away  We paid less than   for a  night stay which was cheaper than most of the others We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant which worked out about   each for a main dish and coffee or juice  Kennedys Pub and Jakes Saloon were both close by   good beer and food reasonably priced To top it all it was   to   
P => Fab hotel and staff Stayed in the hotel from the th ember till the th  We were a bit worried about the hotel after reading some of the reviews but it was lovely and the staff were so nice especially the bell boys who with out them we would of missed our flights the rooms were clean and you can ring for extra pillows  Time square is about min away  We didnt even get directions and found th ave and time square by ourselves its so easy to get round just turn right out the hotel door and head straight for th ave and for time square head straight and about four blocks up make and right and straight into time square My advice for an enjoyable trip when going to Woodberry Common outlets bring a suitcase or trolley to carry the stuff round and even in the city because walking all day with bags is hard  And finally NEVER get a cab unless its yellow we found out the hard way by being in a car crash outside Macys we didnt no it was an illegal cab and were nearly killed we were terrified to get the cab even to the airport but apart from that i would go back to this hotel and check out kennedys bar up the road feels really like home  
P => its ok stayed here late oberall the staff were greatthe hotel does need some refurbbut the rooms were clean with comfy beds  our room on the rd floor was quietand the area very safe anytime day or nightdidnt see any down and outs as someone said great locationgood for breakfast  my advice is look at the pics because what you see is what you geti wouldnt have a problem staying there againjust dont expect the best holiday innalthough i think this hotel is a franchise of the holiday inn name and run using the name and logo 
P => Loud Dumpy Ive stayed lots of places in NYC and this is probably one of the worst  Its not dangerous dirty or trashed but its also not nice The main complaint is noise   it doesnt have double paned windows and the street noise is out of control even in my th floor room  A smaller complain is the suuuuper sloooow lifts Amenities wise theres a lobby barrestaurant  Didnt try them   this is NYC  Theres also a pool but I was there in ober The location is OK   its a long but manageable walk to times square and not too far to a metro stop I would look for a deal at the hilton times square or stay at the Sheraton NY Hotel and Towers which is a bit rough also but has a much better location and isnt much more expensive  
P => not for the faint hearted stayed here with my  children on the return leg of a Hawaii trip  Been around the world  times visited   countries and countless large cities and never been quite as disappointed in a hotel as I was with this one although the sheraton in tahiti came close  I chose this as a quotsafequot option as it is a chain we know and love  but its like stepping back in time  years   dark dingy smelly in desperate need of refurbishment service dubious at best  restaurant awful rooms smelly damp dirty with the tiniest bathroom     you cant shut the door if you go to the loo    it is close to th avenue but the walkway is littered with down and outs if I hadnt of paid in advance for the room I would have checked out on day   for the money you can find better   dont stay here 
P => Disappointment in Midtown Just back from a five night stay at the Holiday Inn Midtown Very much disappointed with the amenities and level of service at a chain hotel in the heart of one of the great cities of the world No corkscrew or wine glasses for the room    and no one interested in addressing it either  Room was unattractive anddue for some upkeep  The location was good and rates were apparently reasonable for NYC hotels The hotel experience took away from what was otherwise a great trip to a great destination I would not stay at this hotel again As is often said    it is the little things that count    and this hotel failed miserably in this area    
P => Pleasantly Surprised I was worried from the various reviews that this place would be a dump but can say I was pleasantly surprised  Yes this place is a bit dated and yes there were some ac problems but for the location it cant be beat  This hotel is in a very good location  blocks to Columbus Circle Central Park and the subway  And anything and everything you  need is within walking distance The room was average but not tiny or small like I had heard about NY  This hotel has a roof top pool too  I think its a pretty good value and I was charmed by the neighborhood  I did not eat in their restaurant so I cant comment  Drinks at the bar are pretty steep  for two  There are so many recommendations in that area dont even know where to begin  We had a great dinner one night at the Rennaisance Diner on th about  blocks down  I also enjoyed a bagel and coffee every morning at the Lunch Box across the street on th I think this is a good place to stay it is conveniently located near the theater disctrict and never felt unsafe  This was my first time to NY and definately not my last  I would stay again at the Holiday Inn with a good rate  
P => Smelly tired and generally disappointing Several of us stayed from the UK for a customer event thinking of saving budget whilst our clients stayed in the Hudson a block and a half away  Big mistake No sign of my reservation   staff were charming and ever  minutes sorted out room   frankly it would have been better if theyd been unable to find one Threadbear furniture grubby bed cover noisy but asthmatic and generally useless ac and carpet that seemed vaguely sticky  Whilst the bathroom was generally clean closer inspection showed some very old showerhead deposits  Overall the room remained horribly stuffy for  nights despite ac being on full blast and retained a vague smell of something aying  Hotel shop doesnt sell water My colleagues all reported similar experiences  be Im spoilt at Westins and Sheratons but this hotel was genuinly poor and  years  overdue for refurb  The first poor review Ive EVER entered  A bargain at  plus tax I think not     
P => Great Place to Stop Found it a great place to stop clean rooms meals OK the staff were friendly and helpful  The location is also very good  I would have no hesitation in stopping there again if visiting NY in the future  
P => Great location Well well well new york city was a blast and me my husband and son we absolutely loved it there from times square to the statue of liberty every bit of new york is beautiful  The holiday Inn is in a great location huge rooms with  double beds very polite staff the rooms were very clean and the roof top pool was a nice touch ideal location for many attractions cant recomend this hotelhighly enough  We came from england for  nights and would definatleystay here again  raycra 
P => Average but a good tourist choice This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel  The first time was  years ago and I was happy with my stay  Reading some of the reviews here made me a bit reluctant to book again which I eventually did In my opinion this is a totally standard Holiday Inn which is definately not suitable for business travellers but is a good tourists choice  As for the problems some of which were written about in reviews hereThe airconditioning is definately inadequate I removed the filter from the airconditioner which improved its performance greatly Bathrooms are very small and the sink is outside of them this  be an advantage for some The overall appearance of some of the rooms is quotshabbyquot The rooms facing th street are extremely noisy   ask for one facing the inner court Lifts are slow and full especially in the morning Vending  ice machines in the corridors make terrible noise   be sure that ask for a room far away from them Doors slam shut by themselves and most guests dont seem to care about letting this happen causing noise for their neighbours The lobby is too noisy to hold a conversation in Internet for those who dont have a laptop is ridiculously expensive    for  minutes On the other handRooms are quite large for NYC and are clean There is a rooftop pool and sunk Breakfasts were good The location is great in my opinion much better than the Times Square area Subway is  minutes away Bus is  minute away Lots of diners  restaurants in the nearby Hotel has a good tourist info desk  concierge On the whole I would recommend this hotel for families on holiday in New York for a few days  It is good value for money even though it is only an average hotel  
P => LocationPrice New York is very expensive Hotel wiseperson and for your vehicle  We picked the Holiday Inn Midtown because of the price versus the location  The rooms were cleannot exceptionally the rooms were small very small  but hey you are just sleeping there and the bed was adequate  The hotel is also in a safe area  If you are pricelocation motivated this is a great hotel  If not look elsewhere  There are lots of dinning and shopping venues close by and the hotel is extremely easy to get to off of the west side highway  
P => Pleasantly surprised and happy with our stay Stayed at this hotel for  days with my husband and  teenage dhters  I was a little concerned having read some of the reviews beforehand but was pleasantly surprised  We had a warm welcome which was effecient and quick and then found our rooms to be very clean and I am really fussy and comfortable  The beds were great and all the linen and towels were fresh  Yes some of the furniture was basic and the carpets were a bit dated but we werent expecting an elaborate hotel for what we paid  The air conditioning was fine and the temperatures were  outside Yes the lifts were a little slow but we werent in a rush  The concierge and reception desk staff were all really helpful with all our requests  It wasnt in a noisy location at all and perfectly postioned to take in all the tourist bits especially Central Park  Easy to get cabs near a subway station and the  bus stops nearby  Overall a great location and a very comfortable hotel  
P => Fantastic great location  Clean  Stayed here for the second time in uary  Arrived just after pm and was checked in straight away even though checkin wasnt till pm  The hotel is in a great location quiet partly residential area Huge rooms with  double beds very polite staff  Cant recomend this hotel highly enough Will stay here again  Check out the fantastic little Deli just outside the hotel on the left  best cheesecake ever rachael keogh yahoo com 
P => Good for the price We stayed at the holiday Inn Midtown in for  nights last week  The negatives were that we were told that the parking would be night  They didnt tell us that to park an SUV the fee would be night so we were a little annoyed with that  We told the manager but she didnt care  Another negative was that the toilet in the hotel room made an exremely loud flushing noise It would definitely wake you up from your sleep Also the shower head in the shower wasnt placed up high  It was in the middle of the wall which was weird  You had to hold the shower head cord the whole time  The staff at the hotel were all pretty apathetic except the people that work at the conciergeinfo  desk were very friendly amp helpful The lifeguards at the pool were pretty nice except they were spraying people in the pool with a big hose quite frequently  They found it very funny but not all the guests were as amused  We didnt eat at the restaurant cause some people told us that the food wasnt very good  Th positives were that we liked the location of this hotel and the room was cleanbut nothing fancy The price was night so that was a good price for a room in NYC  
P => Great Location good service My wife and I stayed here for  nights over the weekend  The location was ideal for using the public transit system bus lines outside the door and the subway two blocks away  Our room was big for NYC and had a huge closet  We had a small problem with the toilet but we called housekeeping and it was fixed in  minutes  The hotel had lots of tour guests from many different countries  The complimentary continental breakfast was a welcome surprise  Not a great view from the rooms but overall money well spent  
P => Hotel is in a great location My sisters and I stay at the Holiday Inn Midtown in e   The location of this hotel was great it is within walking distance to major attractions and very close to the subway  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful  The owner of this hotel actually came up to us in the hotel restaurant and introduced himself  A few days later the owner of the hotel passed us walking down the busy streets of NYC and asked if we were enjoying our stay  Things like this do not happen very often especially in NYC The hotel is definately much smaller than a lot of others in the area but it was very affordable and comfortable  The rooms were good size and easily accomodated our needs  Some of the downfalls there was no refridgerator in our room the bathroom was pretty small and the sink was outside of the bathroom  The elevators were very slow and only one of them worked while we were there  We took the stairs most of the time I would stay at this hotel again due to the location and the price  
P => Good value for Manhattan My husband  teenage dhters and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown il  it was very cold and it snowed We were quoted a cheaper rate through the travel agent of   per room per night  Reading some of the reviews we were a little concerned what the hotel would be like however we did not need to worry  We had two rooms both rooms were of a good size  queen sized beds in each and quite a large bathroom and nice and clean with all facilities  The pool was closed during our stay in early il too cold to swim outdoors anyway and never had time The hotel is a short walk to the subway and about a  minute walk to Broadway  Recommend Route  diner for breakfast a short walk away the friendly hotel staff will direct you  If you can afford the helicopter trip would highly recommnd it have brilliant photos Take the free Statten island ferry and get a great view of the Statue of Liberty and chat with the locals  Thoroughly enjoyed our  hours at the NY York Yankees game too  Visit Woodbury Common a  hour bus ride away for shopping bargains and ask for your coupon booklet on arrival for more savings  Have a good trip  
P => Great location Nice hotel with excellent location  The subway is only a few blocks away and it is close to lots of good dining  Plus theres a Daffys a few blocks down The staff was very friendly and helpful  the pool offers a great view but is only open from  to  so after a full day of sightseeing we were disappointed that we couldnt relax in the pool  The bathrooms did not have vents in them so after a couple showers the room got pretty steamy  We had a small problem with our reservations but the staff handled it well  Overall a nice hotel in a GREAT location with friendly and helpful staff  
P => Good stay   no problems This is a nice hotel currently being refaced at the entrance   and it looks like it will be prettier when finished  Big rooms for NYC  Roof pool is a nice touch  Clean hotel well managed  Nice enough area and very walkable to Columbus Circle shopping amp Metro Central Park Times Square etc  Book with confidence  Staff were pleasant and helpful  Elevators can be a bit slow   one of the three seemed to be out of order  No complaints  Carmines restaraunt was good quality Italian restaraunt with huge portions  Tavern on the Green was a good restraunt also Central Park  Both are only a short taxi ride away  
P => Good location hotel needs a refurb We visited this hotel  months ago and came back to it in e  because of its location  The hotel itself is in need of a makeover its looking a little tatty around the edges  The rooms are clean but definited in need of refurbishment  The layout of the room is a bit strange the sink being in the bedroom itself in a little corridor outside of the bathroom  Fine if youre with your partner but perhaps not private enough if youre sharing a room with a friend  The dinning room is busy at breakfast time but the service is very quick and efficient and the hot food is freshly cooked and very good we didnt eat dinner there  The room rate is reasonable for New York if the hotel were refurbished  The best thing about it is its location  Its two blocks from Central Park and the subway giving good access to Manhatten  There are a couple of good Irish bars along the street and also a couple of really good restaurants  
P => It has a pool This is the least expensive place to stay in Manhattan with an outdoor pool  The rooms were a good size and it is fine value for the money  You get what you expect from a Holiday Inn  There are freelocal papers at the front desk  It is on a main street and so the rooms are pretty noisy  The lobby is often busy  It is convenient to several subway lines and the Park  
P => would definately go back there  Just returned from a  night stay at this hotel and before I went was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews  I must say that any I have no complaints and would recommend it to anyone Its location is handy for th Street subway Columbus circle  The reception was a bit too dimly lit for me but clean enough The hotel consists of two towers  One  floors overlooking th St and the other  story overlooking th Street with a pool on top My room was on the th floor of the  storey  Its true that there is some traffic noise but this is NYC  I would think that the bottom floors on this block  be kept awake at times  There was some noise from within the hotel doors banging etc but no more than any other hotel I have sayed in  There was more noise from the water system  I think it was rooms above flushing their toilet the pipes must run behind the walls but it didnt really bother me  The AC worked fine although the fan was quite noisy  There is also some scaffolding covering the th Street frontage as there is buliding work going on during the day My room was large enough for the three adults in our group  The bathroom wasnt massive but adequate  The important thing for me was that the room was clean  The room paintwork was a little chipped and had a few coats of paint but that is to be expected The area around is typical NYC its a working city and full of character  Some run down buildings and some ultra modern  There are always people around and I felt perfectly safe walking back after pm Didnt eat in the hotel but went down th Street to th Ave turned right a couple of hundred yards and ate breakfast in a deli called the Bread Factory  Allsorts to choose from and reasonably priced  Friendly too  There are loads more around  There are about  Starbucks too for a late night coffee  Plenty of superkets too It would be interesting to know if the negative reports were in the other tower  As I said we were on the th floor of the tower overlooking th  
P => Noisy noisy noisy This is the second time weve stayed at this hotel  It is the quotlibrariansquot hotel for Book Expo  Last time our room was in the back tower facing onto th St  This time it was in the front of the building looking out on th St  th St is a busy two way street and gets lots of truck traffic even late at night  We were on the th floor and it was still very loud  Plus the hotel room doors like all too many slam really loudly  It seems easing the doors closed is just too much to ask of    of all hotel guests so you get the constant slamming of doors at all hours  Even worse our room was directly across the hall from an ice machine that inexplicably was sitting right out in the hallway instead of in its own little alcove or room  Even when most folks were asleep the machine kept making more ice and then noisily dumped it into the hopper We had lunch in the lounge here the first day  The food was ok and somewhat fairly priced but the beverages were outrageous  A flat Diet Coke be  oz worth was   Same with a small bottled water  Then they add   gratuity  I can understand adding gratuity to the bill for a large group but adding it at a bar for a small group denies the patron the opportunity to express his or her level of satisfaction with the service and therefore guarantees poor service We tried to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning but after waiting  minutes for a waiter despite asking for one after  and seeing no fewer than  bored waiters wandering around with pitchers of coffee and juice we got up and left  Pitiful service no doubt because they know they have a guaranteed   coming to them no matter how bad the service The hotel was in the process of reation so I wont comment on the cleanliness although it wasnt too bad  Our room was a ent size but the bathroom sink was arate from the showertoilet room  Take note anyone thinking of sharing a room there is little privacy while you shavebrush teeth etc  The counter around the sink was so small that we had to keep our toiletries on the floor under the sink  I would rather have had a slightly smaller room with a full bathroom  
P => Excellent location only problem is the air conditioning We stayed there in early  and found the location to be very convenient to restaurants the subway at Columbus Circle Central Park and theaters  There were many restaurants on th Avenue and a couple of good reasonably priced local diners  Being my first time to New York in years my first picks were like the Doubletree or Hilton but rooms were very expensive for our dates  So I booked the HI based on price and location  I didnt expect much but I thought that the rooms were just fine just like your standard Hampton Inn type of rooms  Ours did not seem way out of date but I think I heard someone talk about  towers be one is reated and the other is notThe only negative was the air conditioning or lack thereof during our stay  The front desk said it was off in the whole building due to fluctuating outside temperatures  We slept with the window open two inches all that it would open If this is an ongoing problem I would not recommended staying there in the summer  
P => Great Location  But Very Lame Accommodations Best part of the Holiday Inn on West th Truly a fantastic location Close to shopping theatres Central Park great restaurantsHotel also has a great concierge Friendly amp extremely knowledgeable concierge staffFree wireless was another treat The not so good Please note If you book this hotel online which I did please read the fine print  Turns out if you get this great cheap  a night deal which is really not that cheap online deal its completely nonrefundable The whole hotel stunk literally stunk There was a quottingequot throughout the hotel amp in my room  Air conditioner was broken    Hey it was nearly  degrees for  days with no air conditioning That truly suckedWill I stay there again be if this place were a hundred bucks a night I might consider it    just cause of the great location  But for  per night  I expected a more pleasant smelling hotel and a few more amenities    Ta Ta to the Holiday Inn for me 
P => Location Location needs REATION I have stayed at this hotel on at least  previous occasions  THIS WAS THE LAST Although the locations is ideal the physical plant guestrooms common areas and restaurants are in DESPERATE need of reation  The building has not had a makeover since the late s  We suffered for three days without air conditioning  apparently this is a frequent problem at this hotel  This hotel is a blemish upon the Holiday Inn name  The company should give this this franchisee HI LLC the boot 
P => More than good for the money    It took hours on Trip Advisor to find a hotel in Manhattan that was under  per night and yet had a ent review  This hotel met those requirements  night  The hotel was clean well orated rooms big rooms friendly and helpful staff  The location was great too  We walked everywhere or hopped on the subway just a block or two away  Great little restaurants around the corner  One previous writer mentioned it being dark and deserted  The side walks were never empty even when we walked home after plays  
P => No thanks I had a group stay here in il  The rooms were small and dirty  I have booked some doubles and mostly singles  When the group arrived they didnt have the doubles available so the put a rollaway in the room At almost   per night I expected better  The front desk was rude and really didnt seem to care if we were there or not  I contacted management and got about the same response  The employee in charge of groups never even returned my call  Very poor hotel very poor customer service  
P => A good place for a base Couldnt fault the place for its location for all the attractions in NYC  The staff were friendly especialy the porters but at times the reception in my view was undermanned and they struggled with our group    men on a th stag  The Bar service was good although a little pricey and it offered no drht beers  Though the food on offer from there was adequate for something quick and simple   As for our hotel room functional and had all the facilities youd expect to find   but the rooms are about ready for a re furb  The bathroom is very basic with the wash basin on the outside in the main room for some odd reason   handy though if youre sharing the room  Our room was had the option of a connecting door for the next room but the sound did travel quite alot  So hope and pray you dont get noisy people next door  The only real gripe was the fact that we did book a bed and breakfast deal wich a voucher is offered for   off the breakfast  But and a big BUT comes into this   its only offered to the lead person in the room   in our case there was  so hence we thought we were short changed  after complaining and moaning that we felt that we had a rough deal the girl behind the counter did issue us with vouchers apiece   I can recommend the Detroit omelette by the way All in all we enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would most likely use it again  
P => Just average hotel I returned from a stay at this hotel with my  teenage dhters for an Easter Spring Break trip  Its just far enough off the beaten path to be relatively quiet especially if your rooms are on the back side of the hotel  We never heard the horns and sirens from the streets  There were however a fair number of rowdy teens in the hall yelling and slamming doors at all hours  I never saw security  The acoustics were lacking in that respect as I was also awakened early in the morning by slamming doors  The room was clean but the hotel is rather dreary with beige and green walls old stained carpet and dark drapes and bedspreads  It is definitely in need of reation  The  computers are in the lobby and charge for services  I had a house drink in the bar and it was    Ouch Plus they tack on a  fee for accessing movies in the room which are steep to begin with  There is a small TV unit with  small drawers thats it  No drawer in the desk  There is a tiny closet with one shelf no storage in the bathroom except on the sink No room safe or frig  There was an ironboard and a small hairdryer as well as a  cup coffee pot  All cups were plastic  one chair in room  We had  rather hard double beds with stiff linens  The shower head in the bathroom was fixed in one position  They provided a shower cap and a tiny bottle of cheap combination shampoo and conditioner   We stored our luggage on the last day for  a bag and they had a cab for us  That was the extent of service we used but they were very polite  We had an average breakfast in the dining room  not bad but there are so many better options near the hotel   They have  elevators but they are very tiny and we had trouble at times catching one  The stairs lead to the back outside of the hotel and arent well ked but thats an option  Overall this is a pretty good option for a reasonably priced hotel  I wouldnt choose it for a romantic or special trip but for a clean and safe place its fine  I rated it  stars but in reality its about a    
P => A great place to stay in NYC This is a nice hotel we had a large room with a great kingsize bed  Nice and clean too  The location is smashing  Not far at all from Times Square a  min walk to th Avenue Tiffanys Burberry etc and its also on the doorstep of Hells Kitchen which has loads of trendy bars and restaurants to try  
P => Great Location Family of  stayed around St Patricks Day week  Location was ideal just   minutes to Times Square area  The room was larger than I had expected  Clean and very good for the price  Staff very helpful  Typical NY delis around the corner on th  Terrific bagel place on th  Great if youre looking for a place to sleep  
P => Just OK after switching rooms  My husband and   year old dhter stayed at this Holiday Inn over Christmas for one week  The initial room we were shown was really terrible  No cover for the toilet old dirty carpet chairs and bedspread  We requested another room from the front desk and then they gave us a room right next to the vending machines extremely noisy  Thankfully we did not spend much time in the hotel because we were visiting relatives and only needed a place to sleep  The location was great for us  Walks in Central Park were near by as were grocery stores restaurants and lots of shopping The bus stops right in front of the hotel too So overall Id recommend this hotel ONLY if you dont plan on spending a lot of time in your room  
P => Neighborhood folks give this hotel high ks  I had stayed at this hotel some years ago while attending a professional conference so I knew of its reputation  Nevertheless I imagine the best review a hotel can get is that the people who live locally like the place so much that they have their out of town family and guests stay there  This is what my airport shuttle companions told me while driving from La Guardia to Columbus Circle  When I commented on the amount of construction taking place on th Street and its environs the desk clerk suggested a room in their quotBquot wing which faced an interior courtyard rather than the street adding quotBesides there are two conventions in town and the house is full quot Because I agreed to accept a smoking room rather than the non smoking room I reserved I was given a certificate good for a free drink at the bar and another certificate good for a free continental breakfast  So far so good The room turned out to be in an older wing of the building and the smell of smoke permeating the corrider carpeting led me believe that the room itself would probably have cigarette burns on the furniture and carpeting  Nothing could have been further from the truth  The room itself was smell free and had recently been scrubbed and vacuumed within in inch of its life  I can see why the locals like this place for their guests  the rooms are squeaky clean Room service was good too  I ordered a salad plate and a bowl of minestrone at pm after I had finished unpacking  It arrived in  minutes brought by one of the most cheerful servers Ive ever met  Have hearty simple food well prepared and you cant go wrong  
P => Nice Hotel but I am iffy on the location I liked the hotel  It was clean and the staff were all friendly knowledgeable and accommodating  The gentleman Carl at the concierge desk was great  I would recommend this hotel for any budget traveler and specifically for people who have small groups who want to spend their money on shows and food Location and hotel would be the downsides for me  I agree with others that the hotel is centrally located  Most things are in walking distance  It was about  minutes to walk to the Met Museum of Art Times Square and Broadway shows  However the subway system is not convenient if you want to cut down on the time  And the location was very dark not well lit on the surrounding streets  As a single female I did not want to venture out after pm and when my mother came in the next night she didnt want to walk around together after dark  Neither of us have problems after dark in the Time Square area or in most cities we visit   it was just a feeling around this hotel  We have both visited NYC before and arent timid Because of the location making me uneasy I ate at the hotel  The food was subpar for the price  I recommend venturing out to Kennedys about   blocks away  The food was a little more than the hotel but completely worth it  The Thai restaurant in the hotel directory Thai Basil and the Boston ket on th were also very good  The little grocery shop on the corner th and th had very fresh produce for the morning beat paying   for half a grapefruit at the hotel Good hotel  I think I would stay there again  Just not alone  I would also go to Kennedys for late evening snacks even after pm because it was that good  
P => Not luxurious but adequate for a base to tour NYC We stayed here for  nights recently and found that the location of the hotel was quite good for touring New York City  However the rooms were very dated and looked frankly a bit worn out  The ensuite bathroom in particular looked in need of attention  The shower curtain smelled a bit the bath was very shallow and in general it looked like it lacked care and attention  I was surprised that free shower gel wasnt provided as this seems to be a fairly standard offering nowadays The food in the hotel was ok  I was surprised to find that breakfast wasnt the usual Holiday Inn buffet but just a menu based affair   actually this worked out better for us because they offered nice big bowls of fresh fruit and you just paid for what you ate   so if you dont feel like very much you dont have to pay for the whole buffet  We went for dinner there one evening and it was nice  The menu isnt bad  The bar is small but pleasant and they serve a range of bar snacks like chicken wings sandwiches etc and this can be handy if you happen to be around the hotel at lunchtime TIP Dont miss Kennedys Irish bar just across the road and down a block  They have a lovely restaurant great food huge portions and theres a very nice ambience Staff in the Holiday Inn were friendly on the whole but some were quite cold  The concierge was very helpful with tour bookings and booking us a stretch limo back to the airport   it was a nice touch     he asked if we had children and when I said yes he said hed make sure we got a stretch limo  We were very excitedI found that there was little or no sound proofing between rooms and the noise of tvs blaring could be heard through the night   this would normally drive me mad but NYC wore me out so generally I was able to sleep through it  When we were there there seemed to be quite a few school groups staying in the hotel and that might have been the cause of the excess volume of the TVsAll in all Id recommend the hotel for its location and price but would call it relatively cheap and cheerful rather than luxurious and pleasant 
P => great location  I stayed there for  days with my brother and we definitely got what we expected   great location nice neighbourhood local feeling friendly staff and clean roomWe would definitely go back Great value for our money 
P => Good Value  My wife teenage dhter and I stayed at this Holiday Inn over Presidents Day weekend and were quite pleased with the value for the money  We paid   per night including all taxes and have often paid much more in NYC and gotten much less While not a luxury hotel the room was clean and large  I stay in NY several times a year and I have to say it was probably the largest room Ive had The location was much quieter than other hotels weve stayed at  It seems like its in a quiet zone as we heard very few cab horns at night  The rooms appointments werent brand new but were fine  Unlike another family who stayed there the same weekend our HVAC was working fine and the protective construction scaffolding over the sidewalk was not an issue didnt spend too much time looking at the outside of the hotel The hotel provides free access to the basement level health club which had a good selection of equipment and the usual towels TVs water etc  It is however a windowless basement frequented by people and their trainers who are there to work out not see and be seen If youre a runner the location is just a couple of blocks from Central Park one of the greatest places for city running in the world We didnt eat at the hotel who eats hotel food in NYC but instead had great vegatarian ethopian and indian dinners all within a  walk from the hotel  The concierge was very helpful in providing recommendations  Or just walk south on th th or th avenues and find something that suits you Skip the hotel breakfast and walk over to th avenue head south a few blocks to the Bread Factory for a great breakfast There is a major subway hub  blocks away at Columbus Circle at the Time Warner building where for  bucks you can take a train to Greenwich Village th street shopping The Natural History Museum etc  While the hotel is not in the theater district we opted for an easy walk back to the room after seeing a show rather than take a cab Parking for  days was   Not a bad price at all for NYC We checked out before noon on our last day and threw our bags in hotel storage for the day  While there was a nominal charge posted for bag storage the bellman didnt charge us  All the hotel employees we encountered were very pleasant While I do have to stress that this is not the Waldorf Astoria or Palace it is a very good choice for families or others who want a clean comfortable roomy moderately priced midtown location  
P => You get what you pay for    Stayed there Pres Day weekend with my wife and con  After checking out MANY hotels online I booked based solely on price th trip to Manhattan in the past  years and first stay at this hotel Positives  nice people larger than average room for NYC ent location for midtown and Central Park Negatives  front of building surrounded by scaffolding dont recall being informed of that beforehand room that never got warm even with heater running continously overall worn appearance  Also would have been nice if gift shop sold some bottled drinks andor water since vending machine was not working and how about a complimentary cup of coffee in the lobby in the morning    Overall not a bad experience but just reinforces that you do get what you pay for  If all youre looking for is an okay place to sleep and budget is the priy concern this would fit the bill  
P => Great rooms good location great prices The hotel exceeded our expectations based on what previous reviewers wrote  Our room was fabulous very much up to date clean and comfortable  The bathroom was a bit out of date  The lobby was very nice and it looked as if the conceirge desk was very helpful  They had signs at the desk that said they would help book and suggest attractions  The one time we wanted to talk with them there was a long line this is the only time I think there was a line  The on site restaurant was fabulous for breakfast  The dinner was a bit drab didnt offer many options and had horrible cheesecake The restaurant was always a bit chilly so wear a sweater  Overall the stay was excellent  
P => Nice Hotel Location ok I stayed here with my boyfriend in ober for  nights  The hotel is lovely amp clean  The staff were very nice and helpful at the reception  the concierge amp the room porters  On every second floor there are vending machines for cans of minerals make sure you have one dollors handy as they cost   but r the nicest in the world if u wake up in the middle of the night gasping They also offer pay  per  view movies which is really good esp if uv been out all day amp ur in bed early with ur feet up  The room service is also really good but avoid the steak very fatty  The hotel isnt in a bad location  it is about  blocks from broadway amp times square  But If I was going back I think I would stay closer to the main area  I couldnt honestly fault the hotel as it is really nice and really holds its head high to be rated as a  star  The reason I think I was a bit disappointed in the location is because we walked the length amp breath of NYC so by the time I got to Broadway I was saying oh nooo not another  blocks To stay somewhere closer good spots are the wellington or the edison  also the Pennsylvania Hotel which is a good location but to be honest as a travel Agent I have heard some nasty stories about it  I would highly reccommend the Holiday Inn but I wouldnt oversell it for its location However there is a subway stop on th street that will bring you downtown soho etc for pp one way Shopping Tips for NYC go to Pearl River in Soho go to Cliquers on th Street across the road from Macys and down a bit towards the empire state building  And also watch out for a chain shop called Rainbow there is one on th St amp th St  next to the Holiday Inn  ALso if you are going in ober try to stay for the night of the st and go see the Halloween Parade the New Yorkers take it to the next level  I was so disappointed that we were coming home on the st and missed it  One more tip for NYC   if you want nice accommodation amp not too expensive book the radio city apartments excellent location really clean and handy You can book these through     or through your travel agent as sometimes the radio city give out their allocation to agents so their website  not have availability but you will get it from another agentbut book early as they are really popular  Also one more tip when coming from the airport instead of getting a taxi which will probably rip you off book a shuttle on     it is so convienent amp inexpensive  When you arrive in JFK go to the Ground Transportation desk and hand them your confirmation the mini bus takes about  ppl and in turn drops you off at each hotel on the return you ring super shuttle  hours before you travel home to reconfirm your booking and flight number they will give you a new reservation number and a pick up time to be outside your hotel  The best thing about this is that when you pay for it at time of booking you know how much you will be charged etc as taxis in nyc charge while they stand in traffic  If you want to tip the driver then that is up to yourself  And finally I just have to say that the  shopping trips one to Jersey Gardens amp one to Woodbury Common are great  If you are stuck for time and money then go to Jersey Gardens mins of a journey amp it has a Nike Factory shop Tommy Hilfiger Ralph Lauren etc it is indoors and compact  Also it is a lot cheaper and shorter journey to get to than Woodbury Common You go to the  nd Building on the left  when you are standing in front of it looking at it at the Bus Port Authority  go to the desk ask for your return ticket to Jersey Gardens  go to exit  and look for bus NJ Transit  this  change from time to time  Woodbury Common is also great but it takes an hour to get here and costs about pp for the bus alone as you are buying this from a new york sights seeing company  Woodbury Common is outdoors and has loadsa shops george Beene Donna Karen Armani  Gucci Adidas Factory Nike Factory  But to be honest if you are not into Gucci etc Jersey Gardens is def the place to go  It has everything woodbury Common has but less expensive to get thereHappy Shopping 
P => Excellent location We stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown for two nights in uary rooms were very spacious and clean as was the hotel  The staff were excellent especially the concierge desk  We enquired at the desk as soon as we arrived regarding best places to eat shopping tours and shows and the advice we were given was spot on  We did a lot of walking whilst we were there as the hotel was in such a convenient location  Would certainly stay at this hotel again and would have no hesitation in recommending it to friends  
P => Top Value Hotel in a Great Location Stayed  nights at the Holiday Inn Midtown th St just before Christmas  After searching the net for good deals I finally chose this hotel priily based on the nightly rate but also for its location  This hotel is great value compared to many similar hotel brands in New York  On arriving at pm check in was fast amp efficient  Front desk staff amp concierge were all polite amp helpful  Rooms are extremely spacious by NY standards with plenty of space for suitcases etc  The bed was very comfortable amp never had any problems sleeping at night  The or is ok amp room amenities just fine  Housekeeping was efficient  The hotel is well located amp within walking distance to the main tourist spots  Central Park is just a couple of blocks away amp Times Square a leisurely   minute stroll  We walked everywhere apart from to the financial district when we used the subway  Always felt safe when walking around even at night  There are loads of great traditional Diners near to this hotel amp most are open hrs  This means you can always get something good to eat amp you dont need to rely on the hotel where the restaurants are on the pricier side I would definitely choose this hotel again as it really was a good value for money base to explore NYC  This is not a luxury hotel but then it doesnt pretend to be  Its a clean amp affordable option with spacious rooms amp friendly staff  If youre going to New York to shop amp do the tourist thing then the Holiday Inn Midtown is a good choice  Why spend loads on many of the other big chains Hilton  Renaissance  Westin etc when you can get the same amenities for much less  Since youll hardly ever be in the room save your money   stay at this hotel amp shop til you drop    
P => Hard to Beat  Location and comfort I have read some negative reviews on the Holiday Inn Midtown  Well I suppose it is impossible to please some people This is a very ent place if one is not seeking total luxury on a budget  The bathroom are great the room meet international standard and I travel a whole lot Trying to do better than this in Manhattan Good luck then  
P => Good location   ent for NYC We stayed at the Holiday Inn midtown on th on     The location was great we were able to walk to Radio City and Rockefeller Center easily  The hotel staff were friendly  The staff at the front desk recommended the restaurant Puttanesca located at  th Ave at th for dinner  It was delicous and a short walk from the hotel  On Wed  morning we grabbed a bite at Pick a Bagel on th as we walked to Radio City  Pick a Bagel was quick cheap and good  We were able to park our car at the hotel for   for  hours  We arrived around pm on   and on the th we saw a show and did a few tours and then walked back up to the hotel to get the car at the end of the day  Perfect location  The price was  for one night    good price for NYC during the holidays  Dont expect luxury    the hotel was a cheap clean place to stay  Needs a bit of reburishing however I would stay there again  
P => Unbelievable value and location After painfully searching for a good location and value in midtown Manhattan I stumbled upon the Holiday Inn on th street this place is awesome  For a run of the mill Holiday Inn its location is prime close to everything and in walking distance to all the touristy spots Plus the price couldnt have been better I went through the Holiday Inn website directly rather than through Expedia and Travelocity because frankly you can get a better deal going directly through the hotels and you dont have to pay up front The rooms were huge for NYC standards and clean and the staff was helpfull and friendly I can honestly say I never expected this from a chain hotel Do yourself a favor   STAY HERE 
P => Holiday Inn Mid Town   What a gem in the big apple We stayed in the holiday inn on Wth from    to th   and found it to be excellent  We stayed in the Sheraton Manhattan Last Year and the Holiday Inn was way better and cheaper  The staff were both friendly and helpful the room was huge by Manhattan standards and it was spotless  We were a little apprehensive as some of the reviews werent great  There are a couple of diners nearby which were good the morning star across the road is alright a bit cramped and expensive for what you get  The moonrock diner between th and th on th is excellent   more reasonably priced and the food and service are way better  The Flame on th avenue is also v good sandwiches are excellent  If you like greek food try Nicks on th Avenue about  blocks down from the corner of th and th heading downtown  When we were leaving the porter organised a hotel car to bring us to the airport at very short notice  flat including toll and tip  We are making an annual trip to new york for christmas shopping and will definitely be returning to the Holiday Inn    Clare Dublin Ireland 
P => Good Place to stay Myself and My Husband stayed here the end of    Hotel is very nice in a quiet area very safe to walk at night  Room was very big and clean  Bed was hugh and very comfortableHotel Staff were very helpful esp the guy over the showstransport  Would stay again when i go back    
P => Tired hotel in need of updating We spent Saturday night there  It is a good location about a mile walking distance from Time Square Central Park and Rockefeller Center  The room was very tired  It was an unusually warm day for    and the air conditioner did not work  The room was very stuffy and warm even with the windows open  The bathroom was in dire need of an update  Hotel personnel were nice and the lounge was good too  Breakfast dining room was also fine  
P => OK but wildly overpriced I paid an average of   per night for a six night stay in tember   Manhattan hotel prices are notoriously absurd but I thought this was a lot for the accommodation  There was nothing spectacularly wrong with the room or the hotel but the room was old and worn  I imagine it must have been nice in  but it didnt look like it had been reated since then  Like a lot of budget hotels in New York the water temperature moved rapidly from lukewarm to scalding I just thought that   qualified me for something other than a budget hotel and I definitely expected more from a Holiday Inn On the upside the room was large by Manhattan standards and clean  The bed was good and the linen of more recent origin than  However Im sure one can do better for the money and I am unlikely to repeat my stay  
P => Overpriced dump I was truly disappointed with this hotel  The website photos are   least to say   a glorified impression of this motel wanna be hotel  I paid  a night in ober and for this rate it is totally NOT worth it and a total dump  OK if you get a killer rate and want basics this is it When I entered the lobby it stank mildew  The bellboys were just standing chatting and had no interest in helping with the luggage neither when I arrived or left  The day I left they tried to force me to book a limo taxi for the airport and got aggressive when I lined they earn commission on these bookings  Instead I got a taxi for  less than their quote even if they swore I would never find anything cheaper than quottheirquot rate I dont need extreme luxury if I travel for short trips and look for budget accommodation but for this rate I would expect something much better  The location is not good either and there are far greater hotels in NYC for better rates on better locations  The location a bit off beat really kills that awesome NYC feeling you get when you visit the Big Apple and you somehow feel a bit cut off from the real center Room services was normal and my room was clean the food quite allright but not a single glass for water  They actually refused to bring me a pitcher of water with my  dinner order and demanded me to order bottles     I refused to pay for water at  a night and  for an ordinary meal My cleaning staff were about as sweet as they come  It seems to be a popular hotel with old people and tourists who clearly are on budget  I felt I was living at Motel    not the Holiday Inn I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone who has to pay anywhere over  for the rooms even if its New York and hotels can be costly even for rubbish  
P => The Girls Hit New York City I stayed here in y with my two dhters  and  and we had great service  Our room was not facing the street and it was very quiet  My girlfriends room was facing the street and was very noisy  After the first night she asked to get a different room and was given one right away with no problems  The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful  The hotel is about a  minute walk to Times Square but it is a nice walk  Central Park is right around the corner  We even rode the subway the last two days with no problems  Tiffanys is right down the street at Fifth Ave  Walking with my two dhters at  at night was never a problem and we always felt safe on our way back to the hotel  This was the summer though and the streets were alive with people all the time  We never used the pool as we were out of the hotel by  in the morning and back at midnight  I would not hesitate to stay at the Holiday Inn again  
P => Enjoyable  nights Stayed at this hotel from th to th tember   A great start to our holiday  New York is amazing and this hotel is absolutely fine  We had read some bad reviews and did not know what to expect  We had a king size bed that was just huge and had lovely clean linens  Cleaniness of the room and hotel was good  All staff we spoke to were polite and friendly  The concierges were very helpful and knowledgable  The area round the hotel feels safe and there are some great places to eat  The Morning Star cafe is the place to go for breakfast lovely atmosphere and good food  Would recommend this hotel and would have no worries about going back there to stay  
P => Great price quality and location Myself my husband and best friend stayed here for  nights in ust  I did heaps of research on this site so was hoping I made the right choice I got a great price for booking directly on the Holiday Inn website USD  Keep in mind that a year ago I stayed at the Sheraton Towers for triple the price so was comparing to that Anyway we found it to be excellent value for the money  It was in a great location th and th   a little bit of extra walking but we needed it with all the food we ate the room was big actually larger than the Sheraton  It was older and a bit worn but again no worse than the Sheraton  The bathroom was a good size The hotel services were good   the Concierge gave us his direct line to the car hire place and told us to ask for the hotel rate which saved us some money It had all the benefits of a big hotel bar room service etc OverallI would highly recommend as a cost effective hotel in Manhattan  Will defintley be staying there again  
P => great Went with  girlfriends who are all picky and we were happy with this hotel  The rooms were a good size more towels provided when asked water presure good room service good and friendly staff  I like staying on the east side but the prices were too high and I got a great deal at the holiday inn  I am planning another trip and looks like im staying here again  I would upgrade if I could but prices are again too high and I had no problems with this hotel except the bar closed at midnight so we had to continue our evening with a bottle to go up to the room  If you cant afford rockstar prices this is the best place for you  
P => Not so bad really I have read the other reports and must admit that we did not find this Holiday Inn that bad  For a big city hotel it does its best nand the staff are very friendly and helpful  It is well located for most attractions especially Central Park  
P => Would not recommend to anyone My husband and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown for  nights in ust   We had never been to NYC before and thought it would be ideal for a short holiday  The city and attractions were fantastic however our experience with this hotel was extremely disappointing  We are well travelled and have stayed in hotels all over the world  Never have we had such sub standard accommodation  We do know what to expect from a  star property having stayed in many without incident  Our room was on a non smoking floor which we had requested   however the smoke from the room below came through the vents continuously and consequently not only did the room have the foul odour which pervaded the entire hotel we were subjected every day to strong cigarette odour  I have quite severe allergies and could barely manage to complete our stay here  There were food service trays in the hallways every day   the same ones that were there when we arrived  During the entire  days these were never removed and the odour of rotting food grew in intensity very quickly  Our room was not serviced each day  On our way out one morning we encountered a member of the housekeeping staff who threw a number of disheveled towels in our direction and were told that was it for the day We had to return to our room to leave the towels  The shower handle fell off at least twice during every shower and the shower itself was anything but powerful   a mere trickle would be an exaggeration  I could never get all the shampoo rinsed from my hair before the water turned ice cold  Unfortunately the only positive thing I can say about this hotel is that all the concierge staff we dealt with were pleasant knowledgable friendly and would obtain tickets quickly for any attraction you might want  Overall this was one of the worst hotels we have stayed at throughout our many years of travelling  We did not eat at the hotel but did find adequate restaurants although expensive   I guess that is what you should expect in New York in the area  We did feel safe walking at night as there were so many people about  Overall even though this is an inexpensive hotel by New York standards we have stayed in many finer Holiday Inns and I cannot honestly recommend this location   just too many negatives 
P => Bypass this hotel Pass this hotel   do not use precious reward points go directly to the Doubletree Guest Suites on Times Square   This is not worthy of the Holiday Inn chain and we have been at a few not so clean Holiday Inns but this was bad  We have also been at the best of the Holiday Inns  We were at Midtown y   my first inkling that we had picked the bottom of the litter was when my  y o  dhter and I got out of the cab with our luggageand there were  bellman around and noone acknowledged us for  minutes no kidding I spoke up twice before we got some help then the rude desk clerk demanded a charge card and I refused since the  nites were on Rewards Nites they didnt need a charge card  We were assigned the first room on the th floor in the towerthe hall stunk like garbagethe AC didnt workit was a heat wave their were dirty dry cloths in the bathroom on the tub the room was filthy and there was not clean linens on the one bed  There was an inch of dust on the wall floor and between the wall and bedside tableI take an air purifier so I need to look for plug ins The room stunk like mold and mildew and the shower wall had visible mold on it in many places  I called the manager and said it was unacceptable he moved us to the th floor in the tower the hall smelled better and the room was better but still needed some cleaning Sheets didnt fit either  I requested the room to be really cleaned the next morning this shower wall had a few spots of mold on it not as bad as the prior room but there was still alot of visible dust in between the wall and bedside table  My dhter and I retd from breakfast  while housekpg was in the room and she had really been working on the shower wall and cleaned the visible dust  She did tell me that every employeebusboys clerketc  was to take turns doing heavy cleaning on each floor every  days and it was obvious that wasnt being done  The housekeeper got us new bed linens that fit and I will say the room was tolerable the rest of the stay but not to the point that I would recommend this hotel  The AC still didnt work the best and there was always an odor in every hallway we were on  The rooftop pool was very clean and nicely kept and was refreshing for my dhter and I to go to after long days of touring the city  The lifeguards were also nice enough to allow it to stay open past the pm closing time on a couple hot days  The outside Holiday Inn street sign is very nice but very misleading to what is inside  I cant help but think we were given the bottom of the barrell because of using reward nites and it was my dhter and I staying  I am writing Holiday Inn corporate office as this hotel is no short of being awful  To top matters off my husband received a   charge from the hotel for one nite on the th that wasnt even in the reservations The accountant had no problem removing the charge but is the principal be leary Our bill was   when we left  We were at the Doubletree Guest Suites on Times Square which is where we will stay from now on  My dhter really wanted a pool and that was hard to find when preparing for this trip so that is how we ended up at the Holiday Inn Midtown  I am sure there probably are some nice rooms in this hotel but only kept up to snuff for certain visitorsI regret spending our points for this place  
P => ick ick ick I stayed here last weekend with my two children  We were given a room on the nd floor and as soon as we got off the elvator there was a disgusting rotting smell  Turned out it was someones room service food in the hallway meat with a sauce coffee with milk super ripe with a film on top  Called front desk assured they would remove  The bathroom was disgusting dirty one towel water on the floor strange sewage ks etc  We came back from dinner that night the food was till there called again The next morning food was still there and the smell had pervaded the room itself  I have travelled a lot and generally budget and hostel level and this was grosser than anything I have seen since the hostel in New Orleans during a heat wave when I was a teenager  In other words my standards are not super picky  So I called again was offered free breakfast  kids eat free anyway so whatever  Went out for the day came back and the food was still there now with flies and strange colorings  The room was stinky as hell and the air conditioning was not great this was during a  plus days even into  degree btw So I went to the front desk and had some sharp words which I have never done before  I offered to clear the food myself and the front desk person yelled at me   Talked to the manager very calmly and she was wonderful  She swapped my room for a lux th floor corner room tra la  That was greatHowever when we left the next evening I stopped in on the nd floor this is perhaps a  minute walk from the front desk just to see   it was still there So theres some pretty serious internal and sanitation issues there I go to NY at least once a year   lemme tell ya my friends sofa beds will be fine from now on  Gross 
P => Great Location and Nice Price I have no idea what the last posters were talking about in terms of the room being so small and pricey I booked our room on y  and  for night and it had two double beds  At first I thought the beds would be small but they were more like queen sized beds  The room was bigger than any hotel room Ive ever stayed at  You could have fit one more of the beds in there at least For the price this room was absolutely fantastic  Cant beat the location walkable to Times Square Rockafeller Plaza Central Park etc  Like a previous poster said we walked many places that we should have probably taken a cab to but because it was so convenient we just walked instead The restaurant was perfect for breakfast It was myself and my two dhters and because kids eat free breakfast was only  each day including a full breakfast for me coffee juice hot cocoa for the kids and their choice of pancakes waffles french toast eggs etc  The first morning the water Alvaraz even begged me to only order  of the adult portion for the kids when they didnt want to order off the kids menu so that they wouldnt be charged for it  I highly recommend the cinnamon french toast yummmmieeeeeI go to NYC once a year with my girlfriends and will absolutely make this our new hotel to stay at from now on 
P => Great locaton but Recently stayed at the Holiday Inn on th  Great location for all the major tourist traps  Rooms were a bit small the a family with two kids but bearable  Toilet small and noisy but the wash basin was erate which was good except for the leaking taps and slow clearing drain  The AC was a godsend  Housekeeping were very efficient with the cleaning and towel changes so efficient that they actually appeared to have gone through our shopping bags and tried to tidy them up sadly they missed the photos that we had in the bags and they threw them in the thrash  Management did not seem to care about this and I got no apology for this at all  The breakfasts were a bit pricy but were tasty  The saving grace for the hotel to me was the great guys they have as concierges Carl and Kelly were absolutly brilliant  The Morning Star hr diner accross the street ins quite good but if you bring someone special on a trip there bring them to the resteraunt La Biarritz a small french place one block over to the right fabulous food  Overall I would stay here again only if I could not get another hotel at the time of my stay in the city  
P => Good Choice After  hours in aeroplanes and airports it was great to finally put our heads on a pillow  The Holiday Inn chain provides a more than adequate accomodation option  Check in was smooth and our room was adequate  As far as value for money goes the Holiday Inn New York is well worth it  Clean rooms friendly staff and close to everything  While we didnt eat in the hotel there were plenty of choices in the immediate area  We travelled with two kids and the area appeared very safe  Often we were still out late at night For location and value for money I would have no hesitation about staying here again  
P => Good for New York even if not a Good Hotel As many regular travellers with a quotnormalquot nightly budget will know New York  be one of the Worlds Great Cities but its greatness is in no way based on the quality of its middle of the road hotels these tend to have small rooms aging or and poor customer service So although in any other city this Holiday Inn would be quotjust another cookie cutter Holiday Innquot these attributes in New York in particular the room sizes elevate it above much of the competition And the location not far from Columbus Circle is very convenient Would I go back Yes I have been doing so for years  
P => Nice hotel I stayed here with my Father from e th till thThe room was huge the beds also And you get every morning USA today for freeHotel staff was also niceAnd you can walk to central park in  minutes Subway is also  minutes block from the hotel you have a nice little restaurant dont know the name anymore but the food was good and cheap 
P => Holiday Inn    great with caveats Holiday Inn at th was a great base for a week in the Big Apple   Fine room  we even looked out on the roof pool    it was ace  Didnt try the food  th Ave Diner was fab for breakfast  and the Brooklyn Diner a bit farther away was great but a bit more pricey Some draft beer in the Hotel bar  and a bit of personality might have enticd more than one drink per night there   Overall wed stay there again at the rate we got   also desk staff and concierge s were very helpful Other stuff  the town is everything we expected   River Cafe FAB FAB FAB      the view is to die for  TKTS is terriffic and the lines really moveSwing  is rubbbish    they tried to charge  dollare for  minutes of music  and we were the only people in the band area     come on     Shop till ya drop  though Century  is a bit mixed up  Macys rocks  and for the guys Macys have a bar AND a Barneys Lookin forward to the next trip  
P => Loved the Hotel After reading some of the reviews for this hotel we were a bit hesitent about what to expect my husband and two friends stayed for  nightsfrom th e  and found it to be a lovely clean and very central hotel to stay in in new york the rooms were nice and big and the staff were very accomodating  The location was fab easy walking distance to most of the attractions and very safe would RECOMMEND anyone to stay there dont believe all the negative reks would definately stay there again  
P => Great location Myself and my friends stayed here for a weekend in NY from      the location was briliant the hotel in is a nice area with a great little Irish bar across the street  It is also within walking distance of Central Park th Ave Times Sq etc etc so is perfect for tourists  The subway is only down the street too if you dont want to walk The room was clean and spacious enough for the  of us  The only downside was that there are no curtains that you can draw at night time so the sun beams in the window from sunrise though this isnt much of a hassle if like us you are up early to see the city Overall a good hotel and I would stay there again for sure  
P => Great time in the Big Apple My husband and myself went to New York e th to the th and we had the best time  New York is truly the city that doesnt sleep  The Hotel is in a great location as you can walk everywhere  min the Empire State bldg   to time square  to the theatre area min to central park  The shopping is great and the food is excellent  Nice Italian restaurant on th and th  After walking around New York for a few days We were very pleased with the location as well as the hotel itself  The hotel rooms are standard size so that was great  The swimming pool was great place to relax after walking around all day  The staff were extremely helpful  We will be going back again  
P => Great spot but dont have the breakfast Great spot  Very central to everything but use the subway  After the first day on foot as we were unsure about subway your feet give up Central park just around the corner  Huge rooms great facilities There is a gym on the ground floor which was good  Staff would be a bit iffy particularly on the night we arrived they basically told us they had no room becuase we were a day and half late due to cancelled fligh although I had rang to inform them I fought my case very easily i must add and sge sorted us out  Very busy spot too and if your in tower A looking onto th on nd floor as we were the street can be a bit noisy at night  But DO NOT have breakfast there  We had one omlette  cereal  teas and toast and a glass of o juice each    dollars crazy  try out the brooklyn diner eastwards on th   lovely spot or just past morning star dont eat there there is a brilliant eaterie but the name escapes me Just cross the street at morning star go past it on left with small chinese run grocers on right and its up on your left I would recommend the holiday inn midtown   only avoid the costly breakfast 
P => Pleasant Stay at the Holiday Inn on th Street My recent stay at the Holiday Inn on th Street was quite good  I stayedin a room in Tower B that was quite large by NYC standards  Everything throughout the hotel was clean and well maintained  The room itself wasvery typical of that you would expect at a Holiday Inn  The only reason I didam not rating this hotel quotExcellentquot rather than quotAbove averagequot is that themattressbox spring in my room was uncomfortable and creaked wheneverI moved  larger more absorbant towels would also have been welcomed The location of this hotel is good for exploring the city  A majorsubway hub is only   blocks away at Columbus Circle  Lincoln CenterCentral Park and the theater district are an easy walk from this hotel While the immediate area surrounding the hotel is residentual thereare numerous restaurants nearby especially along th Avenue goingsouth toward the theater district  The only meal I ate in the hotels restaurantwas breakfast which was good but not outstanding  The service in thehotels restaurant was good in spite of the fact that the gratuity was automaticallyadded  The hotels parking garage provided a good value for NYC parkingat only day for hotel guests  There are no inout priviliges but you reallydont want to drive around NYC anywayOverall this hotel is a good choice for someone who wants a clean pleasantplace to stay that is moderately priced  or less by NYC standards  Thishotel is certainly not appropriate for someone looking for a luxurious experience I certainly would stay at the Holiday Inn on th Street again  
P => Great central hotel Myself amp a friend stayed at the Holiday on West th in    The hotel is centrally located  blocks from central park  min walk to Times Square  The rooms were clean amp spacious with all you would expect from a holiday inn including TV Phones hairdryer Iron amp ironing board amp our room had  double beds  Within a minute walk you have a choice of many restaurants including chinese indian italian mexican sushi pubs  There are also a couple of starbucks close by which make breakfast a lot cheaper than eating in the hotel The staff were all very efficient amp professional amp the concierge service is good My only word of warning in this hotel is BEWARE of the international telephone charges as they are extremely expensiveOther than that I wouldnt hesitate in recommending this hotel amp I would stay there again  
P => a great option   air con is installed   staff a bit iffy  What a good hotel    I was in  of Tower A  Especially if youre a tourist planning on seeing more than just the inside of a hotel room  Location was fine     to Times Sq  taxi ride  Subway near by goes to a multitude of good locations  Rooms were roomy  We had four people in ours one night and that was fine  For the price I got  including tax I was happy here for the  nights  In New York you get what you pay for  Id rather spend my money elsewhere Airconditioning was installed contrary to previous review Beware room service is VERY expensive  Best to go to the Morning Star Diner across the street on corner of th and th  Cheap and cheerful  Theres also a fantastic by the slice pizza shop on around th and th that does fantastic pizza One thing the staff here do have a MASSIVE attitude problem but I wouldnt let that affect my stay at all  One thing that irritated me was that I received a phone call from the front desk to say that my sunglasses had been handed in had my name in the case went down to reception two hours later and noone knew where they were  They were eventually recovered but they all seemed to have a chip on their shoulder   aside I might add of the night concierge and valet staff  They were super friendly and helpful In closing a good find if youre in NY want somewhere comfortable and not too expensive  Wouldnt pay more than  per night here though including taxes Friends of ours stayed at the Doubletree on st and Lexington good hotel but in a business area  Same price range though  
P => The best hotel I have ever stayed in After struggling to find a hotel to stay in for my birthday holiday in New York I ided on the Holiday Inn  I was a little bit nervous about the size of the room after looking at reviews for various hotel   they all complained that the rooms were tiny  Imagine my surprise when I walked through the door at the room was massve  Our bed was big enouigh for  people and swing a cat I could have swung a horse without it touching the side  Here is a list of the points Huge room if you hadnt already gathered Room Service and restruant food was excellent a little pricey but never mind Rooms cleaned and towels changed every day Staff extremely polite Concierge very helpful the more tip you give the nicer they are Good quiet air con Excellent location  mins walk from Times SqWhat more could a person ask for 
P => Great Location This hotel was a real find  Had stayed in New York once before much closer to Times sq in a hotel with the smallest rooms ever  The Holiday Inn however was much better great room sizes and friendly staff  The conceirge was very helpful to us and made everything easy Its very close to Central Park and about a min walk to Times square  In the other direction Tiffanys is about a minute walk  The pool on the roof was great for a relaxing few hours Breakfast was good we went out for all the other meals there is a great Irish bar along the road called Reynolds with good food and Stella on drht 
P => Great locale nice cleam rooms but no AC This was a great hotel great location great service   but the one thing that stunned me is there is no AIR CONDITIONING How can people even survive there in the summer As it was we luckily only had one hot day when we were there and almost roasted alive    even on the days when it started to get cold outside the inside was still hot and we had to keep the windows open  If its wintertime though this shouldnt be a problem  There is just no way anyone could be comfortable there in the summer though which is a shame because the rest of the hotel was great Other than that the rooms were very clean service and the hotel staff were great and friendly  The location is in a nice residential area but close to Central Park  blocks Lincoln Center  blocks and Carnegie Hall  blocks  Its a nice but not too long walk to Times Square  Price was very reasonable I thought for the location Great breakfast place on th and th   the Flame Diner  
P => Great location and reasonable price We stay in NYC frequently and chose this hotel due to its proximity to Carnegie Hall and the price  Location was great  Room was attractive and clean  Staff was friendly  We paid  with all taxes for a double room  Free internet in the room  Bar area very nice and staff knowledgable  Parking was  for  hours  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Great location This hotel is around  miles from JFK and was around  in a taxi ALWAYS use the yellow taxis as they are cheaper than the private ones there is a   gratuity on EVERYTHINGHotel is spacious the rooms are basic but very clean and tidy there is an enormous bed which I loved Lifts are very small though and at peak times there can be a wait The bar was very expensive but had the atraction of a very attractive barmaid Toilet had a powerful flush which was noisy but you hardly heard anyone elses All in all a comfy and clean hotel which was very close to the centre central park and broadway were minutes away on foot  Ask at reception for directions to the cut price booth for theatre tickets up to   off  I saw the producers with a half price ticket   right up front I would happily go again     
P => Nice Room Good Location Mafia Staff The hotel was in a good location close to the theaters and to central park  I liked the room it was spacious and had everything we needed  A view would have been nice but it was acceptable for being in nyc  The hallways were a bit s and reminded me of a cheesy motel  The reception hall was ok but the staff seemed to bring it down  The receptionists were very attentive but the supervisorsmanagers always seemed like they quothad a late nightquot and the bell hop boys were disturbing  They hung around their stand like a bunch of baltic mafiosos usually talking about guns  They made you feel creepy  They were not pleasant    which was strange for a city with a high proportion of friendly nice people  The concierge a blonde guy was super helpful and friendly and I wish I had the money to leave him a big tip  He is the type of person who lights up your day  
P => Fantastic hotel This hotel was an amazing value for the price  The room was large by any standard especially for NYC  And it had just been remodeled so everything was clean and new Having access to the real gym downstairs was a big perk for me  Didnt try the restaurant but the lobby and bar area were spacious and nice  Location was great too    close to shopping the park and the subway  
P => clean  this is not a  star hotel but probably one of the few ny  star hotels that actually deserves  stars  first i am writing the review from the hotel with its courtesy wireless internet which is nice  second i arrived at am and they checked me in with no problem whatsover  third the rooms are very big in ny standards which means average size anywhere else  And finally the room felt very clean which again is not something that should be taken for granted in ny  yes the room was a little noisy my room was facing th street which is a pretty busy street but since i used to live in ny it doesnt bother me that much  
P => Great hotel for the price compared to other NY hotels My partner and I have just returned from a wonderful trip to NYC and this hotel was a great base  The rooms were much larger than expected with a large comfy bed and big TV  The bathroom was a reasonable size with a arate sink area which was great for doing my makeup  The room service and breakfast were good and all the staff were friendly bar one man  If you dont want to spend a fortune on accomodation and would rather spend it exploring NYC then pick this hotel  we enjoyed the walk to Times Sq it was quite near th ave tooand the subway is   blocks  
P => Better Than Expected I have nothing to complain about  The accomodations and the staff were wonderful  We ate breakfast at the Hotels restaurant and it was great  No complaints  
P => Great hotel We stayed here late  early ch and we found it to be good  The location was great near Lincoln Centre and Central Park and within walking distance of Times Square  There were lots of shops and restaurants near us  The room was a good size bathrooom was clean  We didnt hear any of the noice complained of by the other reviewer  All staff were extremely friendly from reception and concierage to cleaning they were all very friendly and helpful  Also useful is the vacation desk where any questions regarding activities in NY  Theyll book for you there too While its not five star it is good value  Id definitely recommend this hotel 
P => Great hotel This hotel was great wonderful location clean bathrooms and nice staff  We arrived at am after being on a red eye all night long when we made reservations they said our room wouldnt be available until pm  When arrived at am all groggy and tired from the plane ride the checked us in right away and we were able to take a quick nap and go enjoy New York all day  it was great I had to leave a day early because my flights got canceled for the next day due to the snow storm  I told the front desk of my situation and they didnt charge me for the extra night I would have stayed even though I had booked it That was nice of them Plus when I was running out of there in a rush to make my flight the front desk man ran outside and got a taxi for me to save me timeand from standing in the cold If you want a clean hotel in a good location with a friendly staff this is your hotel  
P => Spend a little more and go elsewhere My husband and I stayed here in ruary for two nights but moved the third to the Casablanca down on rd St  The Holiday Inn was tacky tired overly worn with a lumpy mattress tiny bathroom tiny room in general  The door bolt didnt work and the noise from the hall was deafening  Save up and spend the extra money on the Casablanca  Well worth it  I would have written a glowing review of that hotel but all the reviews already on there were exactly right  That place is wonderful  
P => At this price    or higher   you couldnt ask for more We didnt expect a lot    but hoped for a small room clean and safe  Were we surprised Good sized room  Clean and comfortable  Friendly staff and good neighborhood  Highly recommend this hotel 
P => a good option This hotel is a good option if you can get it at a fair price as it is clean and comfortable and in a good location for time square and easy to get to all the sights in new york  It is nothing fancy though and is showing its age but it more than makes up for it location wise  It is also quieter than midtown locations  We had a high floor and werent bothered by noise in the night  Lovely large room too  The staff on the reception desk went out of their way to be nice too  Especially Yoldanda a very helpful lady This hoitel is well worth considering  
P => Great Safe Location My husband and me stayed at the this hotel for  nights  It was our first time in New York having just arrived from Europe we were plensently surprised at how big the rooms were  It isnt a really new hotel but the rooms are large comfortable and clean  The bathrooms were fine amp they have tea amp coffee facilities in the room  We walked back to the hotel numerous times very early hours of the morning and felt safe at all times  I would definately recommend this hotel and stay there again The location is great within walking distance to many New York attractions Yes the lifts were slow once or twice but if we got sick of waiting just took the stairs  
P => Good location Forget the other reviews of this hotel unless you care if you drink from a polystyrene cup or the room wasnt orated to your taste Good safe location  Within walking distance of Times Square Central Park Fifth Avenue amp Rockeffeler Centre  Less than  minute walk to subway and two stops from th Street Didnt eat in the hotel but plenty of good places around especially the Flame diner on th Ave for breakfast Hotel staff were polite and no problems with the lifts being slow Only bad points are the plumbing on the th floor of tower A was a bit noisy and the room could do with being updated to make it more welcoming  However it was very clean and safe Would definitely stay here again  
P => No Complaints Have just returned after a weekend break with my family  Ive stayed in hotels all over the world and many of them much worse than this  Staff polite and helpful room clean but in need of a fesh lick of paint  Have read reviews of others who make many complaints but have they thought it might be they who are at fault  Would recommend the hotel and stay there again  
P => Thnaksgiving Stay Stayed here during Thanksgiving week as I was in Ny for the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade This is your standard Holiday Inn that you finn all around the country so dontt expect luxury  The room is large by NY standards  The stff was helpful even given the huge number of toursits in town for the parade  West th Street is a busy street  Good as it is very safe for walking around at night  Not so good if you are a light sleeper or are use to sleeping in the country  Being on the th floor I copuld hear some of the traffic noise as my room was on the front of the building  Try to get a room on a higher floor if possible  Very little interior noise from people next door or in the hallway  The check in was quick and efficient even though there were lots of people checking in for the holiday  We did get up to the room to find that it was still occupied  The desk clerk was very apologetic and the situation was quickly remedied with a room upgrade I never waited long for an elevator which is amazing as many people were all leaving the hotel at the same time to get to their prime spot on the parade route  But be prepared the elevevators are samll The location is great near Central Park and Carnegie Hall and the Crosstown Bus stop is very close I would not hesitate to stay here again  
P => You dont get what you pay for at  a night Staff and management attitude here is very bad overall  Leadership is abysmal and is reflected in the outrageous treatment given to the guests by the employees  First let me say this is a beautiful hotel and there are a few very good employees especially the people who clean the rooms  However for the most part the employees reflect the worst attitudes possible in the service industry    ATTITUDE  NO ONE SMILES  In fact there appears to be a significant effort on the part of employees behind the reception counter and in the restaurant to avoid smiling even when charming customers from various countries are smiling at them    ATTITUDE  EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT ARE RUDE  Employees behind the reception counter act as if it is a great inconvenience to them to have to listen to a customer  They interrupt before they know what the issue is and they treat customers rudely  Again not all employees but most   ATTITUDE  CUSTOMERS ARE THE PROBLEM  There is no effort to fix problems but rather to make excuses for why they cant be fixed especially at the management level  The bell hop dropped my computer monitor  I reported it to security and they took a report  I heard nothing more about the incident  The next morning I walked by a bell hop I believed to be the one who mishandled my monitor  He said something like quottwo two two quot I didn t know if that was a curse or if he was saying something to the man next to him who was on the phone  It sounded more like a spit than words   VALUE  YOU GET HALF OF WHAT YOU PAY FOR  There are two kinds of hotels  One provides a bed the other provides a wonderful experience that makes guests want to come back and to tell their friends  This hotel provides a bed plus a bad experience  I cant recommend it to anyone   GRATUITIES TIPS  GRATUITIES ARE MANDATORY NO EXCEPTION  Gratuities are automatically added to every check at the bar and in the restaurant even for one person  There was no clear answer about the percentage rate of the tip only that it was  minimal  whatever that means  This allowed the employees to take a quotcould care lessquot attitude and most did  The occasional employee with excellent social skills gets screwed out of a good tip    RESTAURANT  RESTAURANT SERVICE IS RUDE  Waiters walk away while the customer is ordering the music playing is most inappropriate and is set to produce the familiar echo of over amplified third world radio stations  When I asked one waiter if the tip was included he quickly said it was included grabbed the bill and my credit card and disappeared  The two numbers at the bottom of the check that looked like they could have been tax and tip werent labeled and seemed way out of proportion  He didnt bother to show me the tip or tell me how it was calculated  The only thing that came back with my credit card was the receipt for my signature  I was in a hurry so I didnt question him on it  It made me feel like he stole from me even if he didnt   BAR  THE BAR IS BORING AND FRUSTRATING BECAUSE OF THE STAFF NOT THE GUESTS  I was at the bar for about an hour one night  There appeared to be two bartenders  One was constantly away getting food for the bar while the other sat in a chair at the bar doing paperwork  The two employees appeared to be at each other throats  The bar was full and people were upset that they couldn t get service  But why should the bartenders provide service when their tips are automatically included in the bill The bar environment would drive any employee crazy and the customers hated it too  There was disco music playing from the PA system and a loud TV playing in the lounge area of the bar  It was the most pathetic bar experience I have ever had    COMPUTER ACCESS  SOMETIMES THE WIRELESS NETWORK PROVIDES PLUG AND PLAY ACCESS  I was given a wireless network bridge to attach to my computer so I could use the wireless network in the hotel  This is a free service to customers with computers  For  hours I worked with the people providing bridge service via a   number  Most of the time was spent waiting on them to get back to me  Finally they had me change out the equipment at the desk and that solved the problem  They guy behind the desk said quotyou should have just brought it back right away quot That wasnt helpful or fair since one of the people at the desk told me to make the calls to the support company    VENDING  THERE ISN T ANY VENDING  I went to floors       and   Those are the floors with soft drink machines  Not one of the machines worked see pics  This was reported to management on the first day I was there and it was that way when I left  On the last day I bumped into one of the bell hops in the elevator and even he knew there were no soft drinks to be had from the vending machines  The hotel manager whined that he could only advise the restaurant that the machines needed to be filled  But why should the restaurant fill the machines that charge   for a soft drink when they sell the same soft drink from a refrigerator in the restaurant for   plus never having to work to keep the machines filled The boutiquestore in the hotel is forbidden to sell soft drinks   HOUSEKEEPING  HOUSEKEEPING IS GREAT  The housekeeping staff did a velous job  They were very friendly and courteous and the room always looked great Out of  stars  being the highest this one gets a   The housekeeping staff kept it from getting a zero  It could have been amazing but it wasn t even mediocre  
P => Great location  Very nice Hotel After reading some review about this hotel  I was can of weary of staying there  But this was the best location to be for a stay in NY city  You could basically walk to everything or you were within two blk of the subway which could taking you anyware you wanted  The Hotel was great   Nice lobby great bar and the people were very nice from the desk to the cleaning ladies  The rooms were average  Nothing too fancy  Bathroom was kinda small  But that was okay If you have a family with you this place rocks because its the only Hotel that has a swimming on the roof for the guest   I would definitly recommend this hotel to anybody  And I would go back  
P => Better than expected A friend and I spent the night of ember th and we were pleasantly surprised  The  double bedded room was enormous by New York standards  We had a room on the th floor with an ok view of other buildings and roof tops  Shower had great pressure and plenty of towels  No special amenities so bring all your own toiletries  As a female I always comment on the bath lighting for makeup application  Forget it here  However our room  had so much light from the windows and there was a large desk that I used and it was fine  The location is good for all attractions  Felt very safe as well  Anthony at the front desk said all the rooms in Tower B were reated and from  and up in Tower A  We paid about   including taxes and got that rate by calling the  number  It was less than on their website  Enjoy New York 
P => Average  No Problems Im a little late with this review  My husband sister and myself stayed for one night in y  It was a last minute trip  We usually stay in Time Square however this was the only hotel we could find for a reasonable price  Friday night double bed was around  tax included  The room was average size and clean  Staff was polite  We had a few questions about sightseeing and the lady at the front desk was very helpful  Im not sure if I would stay here again but only because I like being in the heart of Time Square  If I were on a budget and couldnt find anything else  Id stay here  
P => Perfect Location My now fiancee and I stayed there at the end of ust  and we really enjoyed it  Its in a great location where we could walk to Times Square and even to the bus terminal  When we told my fiancees family who live in Brooklyn where we were staying they were very impressed that its in a nice area of Manhattan  Everything is within walking distance and our first day there we walked around Central Park which is only  blocks away  Its like an oasis in the city  The rooms were very clean and tidy and the housekeeping did a great job  We stayed for  nights and have no complaints  The only thing I would prefer is more lighting in the shower area but thats just a personal preference  The water pressure was great  I recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable place to stay in a great location and I will definitely stay there again next time were in NYC  
P => average Holiday Inn Stayed at the Holiday Inn on th for  nights  We liked the location as it was close to central park and places to eat  We did not experience difficulties checking in  The room was large for New York and clean  The coffee provided was not to our taste  The nearest subway is at Columbus circle only a few minutes walk  The information desk is useful and staff were helpful  In general a good budget hotel in an ok area  Do not expect luxury remember this is in New York  We have stayed else where in New York and so far this hotel is the best for the price  A good base to explore from  
P => Quiet amd convenient Good quiet location and very convenient  Its a bit removed from the hustle and bustle of the Times Sqaure area but we enjoyed that Great restaurants win walking distance The room was spacious   there were  of us and needed a rollaway bed and we didnt feel at all crowded  It was also very clean Concierge was friendly and articulate and we looked forward to chatting with him during our  day stay Id definitely stay there again  Next time well follow a recommendation to take the carriage ride through Central Park  We ran out of time and dry weather 
P => good base SOME nice staff Great hotel Stayed back in ch  HAd a great time here and found the hotel was a good base within easy reach of everything  Some staff were great and very helpful especially the slovenian barmaid she was lovely and the lady behind the trips and excursions desk  the rest of the staff made you feel a little like you were putting them out especially the portersbellboy  and the restaurant staff were damn right rude on the only occaision we ate there  the rooms were standard for a holiday inn anywhere in the world down sides were the coffee tasted like petrol and although this is good for future travellers the hotel was being spruced up but unfortunately they were doing this as we were leaving and couldnt get our cases down the hallMy main tip is to go across the street to the restuarant on the corner opposite the staff are friendly helpful attentive and the food is amazing    but why potatoes for breakfast    must be an american thingwould recommend as a good base for the budget traveller  
P => Cant beat the location room was good service OK Nothing fancy this is your average Holiday Inn  The location is fantastic plenty of dining options nearby food stores drug stores cleaners everything you would need while staying in NYC  blocks from major subway station Columbus Circle Time Warner center and the great Whole foods ket which was also a great and cheap way to eat  Walking distance to th Ave shopping  blocks from Central Park South West and safe area to walk during late night out When we arrived service was prompt and courteous there was an issue with the rate I got from Holiday inn but it was corrected immediately we even checked inn earlier than supposed to and the room was ready Room was nice and clean bathroom had been renewed I would say around  months ago  It was very spacious we got a double room and it is by far bigger than the NYC standard size room  We got a great rate for the dates and it was the  Best Breaks  promotion from holiday inn basically you would get  off per person on your breakfast  if  people  We used it every day of our  day stay the food was great and plenty of it we paid in average  per day tip included ordering omelets and coffee OJ some days I would bet anyone that this is the cheapest in Manhattan and let me reiterate it was GREATLoved the city and would definitely stay here again totally recommended  Don t believe everything you read about this hotel try it for yourself  
P => real nice hotel  great location really nice hotelon a great locationroof top swimming pool was greatwe had lunch in the bar that was really nicea big room bigscreen with tv and a nice view on the streetnear the Park and also Times Square 
P => Good hotel in New York Just returned after  nights on business staying in Holiday Inn west th St The hotel is pretty handy for the west side of town only  minute walk to Times Square and handy if you are on business and are heading for the Javits centre The rooms were huge my room was  it was well maintained although a little tired great air conditioning and plenty of work space The only bad point is the lifts they cannot keep up with demand and I queued for over  minutes to get a lift to the lobby Bar is small but adequate there is VERY little seating in the front lobby Good price and location in an expensive city would use it again  
P => Good value Good pool Rooms ok Good location We stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown for three nights in tember     adults and  children aged  and   Plenty of space in the rooms which were clean and standard Holiday Inn style  Wall paper came away a bit in the bathroom but apart from that   good all round  We were in the South Tower which was excellent for access to the pool  In the middle of summer its worth staying here to get the pool which has great views of nearby skyscrapers  Very few NYC hotels have pools  Pool was clean and warm and nice sun terrace  Only criticism was that it was only open from   and could have been open much longer We paid around  dollars a night on an internet advance purchase which was excellent value for the location facilities and in comparison to other hotels that could have accomodated four of us in a room  Staff were helpful and we were able to check out at pm rather than the am usual  Location is good   couple of blocks to the metro and to central park  Lots of restaurants nearby and good access for the excellent CNN tour at Time Warner building We would return  
P => An Excellent Room and Value We spent two nights at the Holiday Inn at the end of ust   Our room was large spotless and a great value at  a night AAA rate Monday and Tuesday nights  True it is a Holiday Inn thin towels and plastic glasses but Ive stayed in worse places for more money in New York Some guesses as to why our room was so good I registered through the Holiday Inn website not a travel site  Same price but you can cancel and I bet you get a better room  I used my Priority Club number  Before choosing it I read the other reviews which made me nervous and I was going to ask for a particular tower but forgot which one  We wound up in Tower A which I guess was the right choice  A friend of ours who lives in Queens visited and said her friend stays at this hotel all the time  Well return assuming the price stays good Other plusses   just a block and a half to the A train some good restaurants nearby including a cheap place for breakfast  The prices on the room service menu seemed very reasonable but we didnt try it  I recommend this hotel highly  
P => great deal Ny husband and I along with our sixteen yer old dhter just returned from a two night stay at the Holiday Inn Midtown  We travel to New York frequently but this was our first stay at a Holiday Inn  The hotel is very reasonably priced with no frills  Our room was clean with maid service daily  The staff was polite and helpful and the parking was cheap for NYC   a day  The rooms are big with two comfortable double beds a desk and a chair  Its not romanticbut its everything you need if you are out all day sightseeing and viewing shows at night  We will book there again  Its all you really need  
P => fantastic I was visiting new York for the first time and i ided to go for the holiday inn because it was the cheaper option  I went to this hotel exspecting not much just an average hotel although i was wrong to think this because when i got into the hotel it was terrific  The lobby was very cleen the staff were helpfull and polite there was an information site at the hotel desk were you can find information were to go in New york  e best thing about this hotel were the views from the hotel window in my room it was a great view of mid town manhaten  The room were excellent very clean  The location is in mid town manhatten a couple of blocks away from central park  min wark away from times square  Theirs a bus stop right out side the hotel and a undergroung station ablock away  I would say this hotel was excellent cheap and quality  
P => Great Value We definitely plan on staying here again soon  The hotel is newly reated clean and within walking distance to Central Park Lincoln Center and Roosevelt Hospital which is why we are here  It also features a pool on the roof top restaurant all in all a much better than average Holiday Inn  New York City hotels are so expensive but you will not be disappointed in this one  
P => Location and Value The Hotel was the standard Holiday Inn  clean good size room andstandard features for a comfortable stay  There was enough room for a family of five in a room with two double beds and a roll away  Wearrived early  am expecting to check our bags and return laterto get our room  We were surprised when the clerk verified our reservation and put us in a room right away even though check in wasnt until late afternoon  There is a pool a bar a summer cafe near the pool a gift shop room service restuarant valet parking bagbell service and tourist info all for under  a night which is a bargin in NYC The location is away from times square but only about  minutes toBroadway and another  minutes or so to get down to the square  Itis not a plush Hotel but it is perfect for a family looking for a comfortablestay at a reasonable price  
P => Manhattans Best Kept Secret I used to live in NYC and got asked all the time quotWheres a nice place to stay but cheapquot  I didnt have an answer for them until now  Id recommend the Holiday Inn to anyone  Sure its basic but its clean and the roof top pool is a fantastic bonus Great location too  
P => Good location Great location  A few blocks from the subway station and  blocks from Times Square  Clean and good size room  
P => Rude Staff not kid friendly We took a group of  to NY and stayed here for  nights  The carpet and walls were dirty and the hotel was generally run down  Good location but rude staff  Cannot eat or drink in the lobby chairs  Rooms were a nice size and price was reasonable  We booked in ember and they had us on  different floors scattered throughout for our trip at the end of e  I wouldnt book here again unless it was quite a bit cheaper than everywhere else  
P => Solid value with good location The Holiday Inn on West th was a pleasant surprise  I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews  Our room was quiet clean and large with two double beds and plenty of room for a rollaway bed  Even though the hotel was sold out we never saw anyone else on our floor or heard them  The rooftop pool was nice but the hours are limited to between   but our kids got to enjoy it three times  The location is good in a fairly quiet neighborhood one block from the CBS Broadcast Center  While walking down the street one morning we were invited in to see Ringo Starr perform Lots of good neighborhood restaurants nearby  Try Cafe  the Moonrock Cafe and Broadway Diner  About a  minute walk to Times Square  minutes to Macys Empire State Building  Three blocks from beautiful Central Park and the new Time Warner Center  All in all a solid deal for approximately  a night a bargain in NYC  
P => Convention location is good Stayed here cause the conference I attended put me here  Nice quiet street but the hotel is undergoing a badly needed reation  No automatic doors for handicapped and the doormen were not helpful  Room was standard clean and fairly quiet  Wouldnt be my first choice when I return to NYC but the group rate was ok  
P => A good hotel near Central Park We had no complaints about the room which was clean and tidy but the restaurant was a disappointment  We like to use the hotels buffet for breakfast rather than waste time looking for somewhere outside  This is the only hotel we have come across in the USA which has no breakfast buffet  It is waiter service only and very expensive  But the service is no great shakes an order for cereal produced a tiny Kellogs box and a bowl for instance no more service than youd get with any buffet breakfast  For fast food at any time of the day we thoroughly recommend the huge selection at the food court in the Time Warner Building on Columbus Circle a few minutes walk away from the Holiday Inn  
P => Great for the price  Excellent staff We stayed here from  th th  The city was virtually sold out and we got our room for  a night for  nights and  for the last night  We had requested a king nonsmoking room in the reated tower with a rollaway for  of the nights  Tall request and they accomodated us with no problems whatsoever  The elevators were small but that was no big deal  The room was very large by NYC standards and very clean  The lobby is huge with a ent bar that also serves some food and two computers with pay internet useage which I found helpful bc I needed to check my email Every request we made of the front desk staff cleaning staff and valets was accomodated with a smile  They had several tour groups in the hotel and the hotel worked with them as well  Our room was pretty close to the elevator and we still werent bothered by them The hotel is in a great location  several subway stops within a few blocks  We ate breakfast at Morning Star  times and it was great food and service at a good price  th street closeby short walking distance had a ton of really restaurants and Kennedys pub on th was a great Irish pubrestaurant as well All in all this hotel was a great value for NYC  It is a typical chain hotel oration was average but that didnt bother me  My reqirements for a hotel on this trip were ent price good location safe and clean  The Holiday Inn Midtown met all my requirements  
P => Loved it The pool was definitley a plus  It isnt luxury but its ent if youre only going for the actual city  One of the major perks of this place is that we were less than a block away from Morning Star restaurant  Weve visited NYC before and made a note to eat there again  Their food is awesome the service is quick amp efficient and the staff is great helpful too ask for directions Youre not too far from the subway either and buses run by often  
P => Clean Room Great Location but problems     Just spent seven nights at the Midtown Holiday Inn on th Street  Gave  points per night of Priority Club points to stay there  That was a lot of points as you can get Crown Plaza rooms for the same amount so I was expecting a lot  The rooms were big and the housekeeping staff were great and did a nice job cleaning the rooms  The location of the hotel is great in terms of midtown activities  Those are the positives The week before we stayed there the temp was  degrees one day to the hotel ided to turn off the room heating system  The night we got there the temp out was  degrees and the room was cold  We tried to use the room heater and it didnt work  The next morning I complained to the manager and he informed me that once they turn off the heating system and turn on the air conditioning system the dont reverse it due to the efforts it takes to make the change  They offered us extra blankets and we were cold most nights  One night we ran two hair dryers the iron and the shower as hot as it would go to warm up the room but it blew out a breaker switch and our floor lost power for about a half hour  The elevators are really slow and small so make sure you are not on floors   because when they are coming down from the upper floors they are usually full and you have to wait to finally squeeze onto one Places to eat and drink  Do quotRalphsquot over on the southwest corner of th and th avenue  A great italian resturant  Great house wines and great food  Also there is quotJakesquot bar and grill on the northwest corner of th and th avenue just down the street  A great place to go for a late night drink  CBS folks hang out there from across the street  Met some interesting folks from  Minutes in there one night  Also the MorningStar Cafe on the northwest corner of th and th avenue is a really cheap place to eat breakfast or get a burger late at night  Pretty good food for quick and cheap in NYC  
P => Great Location    The location was great staff not that friendly     the hallways stunk of stale cigarettes   not sure why as there was meant to be non smoking   but if you are just looking for somewhere to stay that is a central location then I would recommend this place   be it is a bit old and needs a bit of an update   the airconditioners are constantly going in the rooms   probably so you dont notice the smell    
P => OK but customer service is nonexistent For the budget traveler this hotel is great  I did get upset at one point when the cleaning staff didnt even bother to clean the room  They actually had the nerve to take off the quotplease clean roomquot sign and throw it in the room and put up the quotdo not disturbquot sign We had left late that day and obviously a lazy person didnt want to clean the room  The staff is not friendly and act like they are doing you a favor  And this is not just the new york attitude coming through they just dont have any customer service whatsoever  The positive were however are that the room service is quick priced right and ent  The rooms are clean and very large by ny standards ours overlooked the street and building nice  And you cant beat the price for NY  We dont spend much time in the hotels normally so at  night for ny it was a steal  Next time I go I would probably stay elsewhere if I could find something for  night  Overall I would reccomend it for someone who doesnt care much about where they are staying and just want a clean place to sleep and shower  
P => Holiday Midtown Great Place to Stay Our group  Boy Scouts and leaders stayed at the Midtown for  days  What a great experience  The staff was friendly and courteous and went out of their way to assist us when needed  The lobby is very spacious and made a great out of the way place for us to gather before we took off touring the city  The rooms are also spacious and nicely maintained  One morning my wife and I forgot to bring in the Do Not Disturb hanger  When we returned at pm for a short time we brought the hanger in  It was not with the intention of housekeeping taking care of the room  When we returned later that night the room had been cleaned with new towels etc  How many hotelsmotels have done this for youWe had two buffet breakfasts at the Midtown also  Well doneThe only possible downside is the number of rooms on  floors vs  the  elevators small cars  Pre planning to leave the hotel works best in the morning or use the stairs unfortunately the stairs cannot be used to go up   odd huh We recommend it  
P => clean and nice experience after reading all the critics for ny hotels we were in a messWe went for it and it was all that we were expectingA clean bed and a nice bedroomno noises and good showerwhat else can you ask if it is well located and good priceHighly recomended  
P => Variable hotel good value for NY If you like a gamble stay here  Sometimes youll get a room which is pretty worn and tired other times youll get a nice big refurbished room on an upper floor with a king bed and a view  It might be coincidence but since I finally gave in and signed up for their Priority Club they wont give you miles on your airline card I see more of the latter  What this place has going for it is the right balance between value and location  On West th St its close to Broadway from where you can stroll down to Times Square in about   minutes  Go the other way and youll be at Central Park in about  minutes  To get that for internet prices of around  for a room in NY is pretty good  You also get access to an impressive basement gym at no extra charge though its probably best to eat and drink out no shortage of choice to avoid hotel prices  Only three stars because its not outstanding in any way its just a good base at a reasonable price  
P => For  midweek a great deal  Of course nothing fancy For the price above average  We had some very specific needs  high speed internet access we dont have a dialup account anymore  clean  centrally located with a short walk to a safe subway station  Under  a nightHoliday Inn fufilled all of these critieria  With Hilton riot Renaisance and Hyatt all coming in at  for a mid week rate the  rate was exactly what we were looking for ProsLARGE rooms  Clean  Convenient  Bathroom was very recently completely reated  Some of these new quotboutiquequot hotels in New York which have opened recently have tiny tiny rooms  Several small grocery stores and a breakfast place one block away which is very convenient ConsI had to ask for a room change which they did with no hassle because even though non smoking room some previous person had clearly smoked  Wall paper in room peeling a bit  Rug and upholstered chair very tired  Staff has a bit of a New York attitude but I grew up in San Francisco so am used to big city perfunctory service  As long as they are efficient and have a reasonable attitude thats enough Good value for money in sumy  
P => Great place to stay My dhter and I were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room on the th floor in A block  Lots of space and very clean  Staff were great   allowed us to check in early and check out late  Tourist info was very helpful  The Morning Star Restaurant across the road great for breakfast  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => OK stay at Holiday Inn New York City West th St  Stayed over Christmas  in Tower B  Had allegedly recently been refurbished but wallpaper was already peeling next to heater by the window Room was nice and large and plenty of hot water and powerful shower  However there were no glasses provided for the washbasin to clean teeth and we had to make do with plasticpolystyrene cup taken from the bedroom table provided for the coffeeice bucket  At  or so a night what would it have cost them to provide a glass for rinsing out the mouth and cups and saucers for the coffee machine for which incidentally only one coffee sachet was providedAlthough we had a non smoking room the cleaner cleaned the room whilst smoking so the smell was there The staff are friendly and helpful other than when we asked them for a local New York phone number and they told us we had to dial Directory Enquiries from a local payphone at our own expense  However when we asked for extra pillows they arrived within minutes Unlike other reviews we never had any problems or delays with the lifts  If you are going back to JFK from the hotel ask the bell boy or concierge to arrange a limo taxi for  not much more than a yellow cab but a lot more comfortable and safer We would stay there again  
P => New Years in Manhattan Me and three friends stayed at the Holiday Inn th for New years   The rooms were Holiday Inn rooms nothing special diffently not for the   a night we paid But the staff was very nice and extremly helpful when tipped right although the concierge was not very informative the bell and door men were  Would we stay there again probally so but not for the price we paid  
P => ent Holiday Inn Fair Rate Stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown West th Street    first  nights   rate and last night     rooms on th floor and th floor        night   th floor Big rooms That is the most important point to remember for this hotel Bathrooms   nice strong HOT water  Restaurant   okay   nothing special   only ate one meal at the hotel restaurant Other folks have mentioned staff at the door   I thought the same   that they were going to open the door   but never did 
P => Great value I really cant believe some of the reviews on this hotel I have just got back from NY after a five night stay at this fab hotel  We arrived late in the day the receptionist was quick and nothing was too much trouble  I had emailed the hotel about  weeks before our stay and asked for a newly reated room in A block which we got  The staff were friendly especially Carl the consierge he is a real credit to the hotel  We had breakfast in the hotel on our last morning and wished we had gone before the waiters were quick polite and again nothing was too much trouble  I have stayed in New York before at the Grand Hyatt on nd street the hotel was grand indeed but as far as comparing the rooms go for the holiday inn they are much larger cleaner and cheaper On the whole if you are looking for a good quailty hotel without paying th earth then the Holiday Inn is for you  
P => Just Okay We stayed here the week before Thanksgiving  I agree with some of the more recent reviews  The downside The front desk staff was not nice   they seemed rushed and impersonal  THe exterior of the hotel was really shabby   it looks like something right out of the s  I didnt even know they had a doorman There always seemed to be employees standing around the lobby but no one ever bothered to help open doors or assist with luggage  We stayed on the th floor in tower A  The interior of the hotel is shabby  The carpets were old and the doors to the actual rooms were horrible  They stopped about   inches above the carpet so the light from the hallway comes into the room at night and you can hear people in the hallway like they are in the room  The also were steelaluminum doors that look like the door to an elementary school   they were all dinged up and the bottom of all the doors on our floor looked like they had been kicked open by every vistor who ever stayed there  When we got to our room the door looked so dirty and dingy that we were afraid to look in the room  The sink faucet never stayed on so when you turned on the water it slowly got slower and slower until it stopped  Our room was very hot   we kept the windows open the whole time We just couldnt seem to get the room cool enough The upside The room was alright   it was very large we had a King size bed  It was clean and the cleaning staff was really great  They were pleasant and nice always said hello and left more than enough towels  We had no problem with the shower at all  The shower and toilet are arated from the sink so it was nice  Overall there was nothing wrong with the room   it was just the impression we got from the appearance of the hallways elevator and outside of the building that made it somehow seem dirty when it really wasnt  The location is great   close to subway  blocks Central Park th Avenue shopping  I recommend th avenue for eatting though  There are so many places to eat and great bars for watching sports I would stay here again now that I know what to expect  
P => Nice hotel We came to New York for four nights during the athon weekend and got a room on the  floor in the A tower  I read a lot of negative reviews about hotels in New York and also about the Holiday Inn Midtown  But I was surprised the room was spacious and very clean  We hadn t much contact to the staff but if then they were very friendly  As another traveler wrote sometimes the elevater is very slow  But this is not a big problem on the   floor  The location is great and close to the Central Park  As a traveler you get there all you need and I would return into this hotel  
P => Dowdy and Shabby Really disappointed with this hotel  Whilst our room was generally clean and spacious the whole place including corridors and public rooms were shabby and badly in need of refurbishment  Our shower nearly always seemed to run out of hot water in the evening and the hand basin never held water  A bit difficult when trying to shave  The curtains had come away from the curtain tracks  On the first night the whole room smelt strongly of disinfectant The reception staff were just not interested The bar staff appeared to take no pride in their work  The glass topped tables were nearly always sticky and dirty you certainly could not put anything down on them  
P => ent hotel for the money no problems We stayed at the Holiday Inn with a group tour in ober  The rooms were fine nothing fancy and clean  The hotel is probably a little older but we had no problems at all  We asked for extra towels and we were told that they could not hand them to us at the desk that they would send them up  Someone was at our door in less than  minutes  I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I was looking for a ent nights stay that is fairly close to the action without breaking my budget  
P => Relieved traveller I must admit that after reading mixed reviews before our arrival I was a bit hesitant  I took note that the hotel was being refurbised and emailed the hotel ahead and asked for a newly refurbished room which I got  The rooms are spacious and because of the location of the hotel you are able to sleep of a night  It is just a shame that they forgot to give the bathroom ceiling a coat of paint  Take note that they have only refurbished part of tower A and this has now stopped for the time being due to them being busyinfo from one of the managers A couple of the reception staff did have an off day but so does everyone but on the whole they were very pleasant  I can confirm what has been said about the customer advisor he was very pleasant and helpful and would give Liz Taylor a run for her money with that ring on his finger  Try Applejacks on Broadway for breakfast and the ket on th Avenue on Saturday for craft shopping  If you want to pay your respects to some of the people who died at  go to the New York City Fire Museum in Tribeca thus avoiding people selling Disaster magazines at Ground Zero  My husband and I went for our tenth wedding anniversary and after seeing where some of the other hotels that we had considered were situated I was glad we chose the Holiday Inn 
P => Room was infested with BED BUGS Our room was infested with beds bugs and my fiance and I received over  bites after just being in the bed for  hours  This hotel has no pest control measures in place and I caution anyone that plans to stay at this hotel  
P => Great Room Nice Design Interesting Staff This is a great bargain  Ive stayed at the Pierre and the Waldorf for work and seriously the room in the Holiday Inn was larger and more pleasant  The lobby has been redone lately and is very chic  If you can make a summer month theres a nice roof top pool where Manhattanites can quothangquot for a fee  One of the managers is a very dapper fellow with double breasted suit two tone shoes and curly white moustache  He clearly revels in the role of Manhattan hotelier  Look him up and listen to a most pleasing NYC accent  Times Square the Park Columbus Circle tons of stuff is a quick walk away  We were there with  kids and were all pleased  This place deserves your business  
P => Nice clean room in Tower A With help of this site we ided to stay at the Holiday Inn Midtown on y    Excellent Value for  USD The rooms in Tower A have just been reated nice furniture bedding  Only the bathroom missed the reation  But was OK Our family of  felt very safe walking as late as  pm at night in this area Yes Morning Star Restaurant is good but nothing to really rave about Try Pizza Villagio on  street for dinner awesome value and great foodPool was clean and lifeguarded  Closed at  pm  Lobby has brand new laid carpet they worked during the night Free safety deposit box at front desk for your valuables We had good service by the front desk staff and chambermaids Would highly recommend staying at the Holiday Midtown NYC  
P => Very Good Hotel and Value We wife sister in law two children and myself stayed four nights in early y  Our rooms were clean and quiet  Rooms are unusally large by Manhatten standards     plenty of space even with two double beds a desk and a chair  Front desk personnel were efficient and the maids were very nice  The hotel is about  blocks from the subway  While only   blocks west of the BroadwayCarnegie Hall tourist area the area around the hotel has a more residential feel which we enjoyed  This Holiday Inn is strongly recommended for anyone     particularily good for travelers with kids who want a larger room and a pool not easy to find in NYC  We ate breakfast the first morning at the Morning Star restaurant corner of th and th Avenue due to positive reviews on this site and returned every morning     good food excellent value and good service  
P => Was satisfactory Our room was large but the knob kept falling off the bathtub and the door to the bathroom stuck badly so badly our two  year olds had a hard time getting out  When we extended our stay the front desk forgot to update our hotel card keys and we were locked out  But basically our stay was enjoyable and the hotel maids were great  If you asked them for towels or coffee even if it wasnt their room to service they would oblige immediately  Dont give your postcards to the front desk to mail  We gave our mail to the front desk on Monday and the next Monday only one person had received theirs  We mailed  cards  Be sure and eat at the Morning Star across the street it is the best place in town  The gym downstairs is really nice  The pool is nice too but it closes at  pm  The gift shop is very reasonable  We would stay there again  
P => Great Value We stayed at the Holiday Inn Midtown again this past weekend and were again very happy We stayed there when my then girlfriend and now wife got engaged and found that for the price it was way above average for New York City  We like to stay there if we can find a great rate and for  this was a great bargain Were beginning to find in our many travels to the city that a lot of hotels below that rate are either shared bathroom or have a rat problem or are simply run down or all of the above This hotel has a spacious lobby is clean has a good restaurant the parking is reasonable they have a roof top pool and the rooms are bigger than most middle class hotels in the city Highly recommend the Holiday Inn Midtown 
P => What a treat We were very impressed with the Midtown Holiday Inn  We checked in late and the clerk apologized that the only room available was on the second floor street side  She said it would be noisy which it was  However she also told us to call at  the next morning and we could move to another room  This time we got one on the seventh floor facing the other tower of the hotel  This was much quieter  There was also room for a rollaway bed so our son could have his own bed  We paid  a night plus  for the rollaway which seemed reasonable for the location  The room has a coffee maker and theres a DAgostinos ket across the street so after the first couple of mornings of going to the Morning Star cafe which had tasty and inexpensive breakfasts we bought breakfast food at the ket and ate in the room which helped us save time in getting out to see the sights  The Columbus Circle subway station was in easy walking distance  We bought a one week pass for  each and used the subway to get everywhere  We had no trouble using the subway and many people were very helpful  Watch the cab ride on the way back to the airport  The city mandates a cost of  on the way FROM the airport to Manhattan but its metered on the way back  Our cabbie drove us through Times Square the most congested area day or nightat  in the afternoon and told us it was rush hour yeah right and that  for  he would take us on a shortcut  We agreed to it but then didnt tip him so the cost came out the same as the trip in the other direction with a tip  
P => The Holiday Inn Midtown was fabulous For the price the Holiday Inn Midtown had large clean rooms and a great location I heard lots of horror stories about NYC motels especially size and cleanliness  It was a pleasant surprise 
P => Clean Convinient and Roomy  I couldnt believe the reviews of the other hotels in New York  It seemed as though you had to have top dollar to be able to stay in a clean hotel  Ive searched and searched  My sis didnt recomend staying at some other hotels she claims pictures are ieving  I would definitely recomend this hotel to anyone interested in staying in New York  The carpet is clean vacumed everyday large rooms nothing old about this room and the bathrooms are all newly tiled  Hotels have to keep up with the standards of holiday inn which is more than i can say for many privately owned hotels in New York  It is conviniently located in the middle of everything you want to see  Only streets away from Central Park The goodclean side  Two blocks away you find stores like Hugo Boss Diesel Channel and many others that wouldnt risk putting their business in an unreputable part of town  Grocery store pharmacy subway and eateries are all within a block radius  The hotel has a fairly large loby for an inn with a fully equiped bar and banquet halls  that goes to show its size  I would definitely stay here again 
P => Great hotel stay   Cant wait to go back My friend and I stayed here last tember and this was a nice and convenient place to stay We only paid night for a room which included  double beds  Thats a great price considering the location and midtown is great place to stay in  The rooms are huge and you can easily fit  people in the room  Nice location within walking distance to everything in Midtown Just a comparison  Weve stayed in  various cities in Europe for vacation the past  years and the hotels there cant compare to the size and comfortability of this hoteland weve stayed in supposedly  stars hotels there and they were more expensive Staff at this hotel are friendly people in NY are friendly also Thouroughly enjoyed our stay in NY and will be back there again next year 
P => Worth it I had a really good stay at the Holiday Inn  Receptionist and Concierge were friendly and efficient  The room we had was big and spacious lots of room to store shopping  Location was good got taxis to most places the fares were so reasonable Dont miss the Morning Star across the road for breakfast sooooo nice Overall Holiday Inn was a nice stay and worth the money 
P => For NYC This room was big Ive stayed at one other hotel in NYC  The other hotel was much more expensive than this Holiday Inn  It had more moder fixtures but was no where near the size of this Holiday Inn  The Holiday in is located on a nice residential street and is within walking distance of restaurants and shopping  This is not a fancy hotel but it is roomy and comfortable  
P => Great Value for Your Dollar My husband and I stayed at this hotel in ober   He had to attend a function at another hotel which was booked  So we chose this hotel This is good location and a grat buy The room are large and clean  If you can stay in the new part of the hotel I would stay there again 
P => Good Value for the Dollar Good choice if youre trying to keep room rate under  per night  I was in Tower B for  nights in early uary for about   er night  As mentioned by everyone rooms are large and comfortable  Furnishings were nice and clean  Bathrooms are nothing special but not dirty either  Maid service was dependable and friendly  Nearest subway stop is  blocks away  Walking to Times Square takes anywhere from  to  minutes  Central Park is nearby  Many sites within walking distance if walking is your thing  Otherwise buses and subway are close by  Good choice for the cost conscience such as myself  
P => Big Rooms I stayed for  nights here on a special deal on my nd trip to Manhattan  The rooms are big bigger than an average Manhattan hotel  Service is fine though Room Service have trouble with Australian accents My room was not serviced for the first  days but once I called to complain it was taken care of straight away  At the time I stayed the hotel was used by Aer Lingus cabin crew as they seemed to book in each night  It is a busy hotel with European travellers  Not overly friendly just standard and few complaints  Didnt have CNN when I stayed there so I wont go again only for that reason  
P => Large Rooms Great Price and Clean Ive stayed at this hotel a number of times and never had a bad experience  The rooms are very large especially by NYC standards and the price is a bargain  On my last visit the staff went out of their way to find an even larger room for me I was hosting a party  There are two towers to this property   Tower A and Tower B  Request a room in Tower A as the furniture is newer  I have two minor complaints  First although street sounds are minimal and soundproofing between rooms is good the same cannot be said of sound between the room and the halls  Secondly the wait for an elevator especially during checkout time can seem like an eternity  If you have no luggage its much better to take the stairs  I would suggest eating at any of the reasonably priced restaurants on th Ave  south of West th Street  Ninth Ave  is just around the corner  
P => clean comfortable good location  
P => Nice reasonably priced hotel in good location  
P => Good location  
P => Fab
