N => Not as bad as I expected If you compare this hotel to American standards then yes I guess I would say this isnt the best place to stay for the money  But in comparison to India standards it wasnt all that bad  be I just lucked out  The location was perfect in relation to the airport domestic and international terminals  My bathroom was clean so was my bedding the staff was responsive  I did order room service which wasnt to good the menu was strictly vegetarian and over priced  I got much better quality and tasting food from the Shangra Lai hotel in Delhi for a little bit more money  Would I stay here again for a night   yes  I probably wouldnt for more than one night though  
N => Dont stay  Wrote a mail and got reservation which included airport pick up  No car waited  Took pre paid taxi to the hotel At the reception no reservation   people took care of us no one said something about the mail although I got answers from them  Gave us rooms at higher price than reserved Later at home saw another mail form this hotel promising a discount on their rates which they didnt give when we checked in The hotel was under reation losts of dust noisy working until late  Rooms dirty sheets filthy obvious not changed since the last guests  But at my request new sheets were brought  Got taxi back to the airport and they even gave us a wake up call All in all not worth the money   
N => Better stay at Airport Due to unavailability in star hotels was compelled to stay in this hotel for my transit flight Pros Staff was good Airport pickup and dropCons Dirty Rooms  Mosquitoes all varieties of insects  Even after  hrs of flight journey chose to stay awake was not feeling secure It would have been better if I would have stayed in the transit lounge at the ariport  
N => very poor do not stay here we ided to stay here for one night during a layover at the airport on our way back from nepal  On our outwards journey we stayed at the hotel clarke international which was amazing includidng an awesome meal too we booked The airport hotel because we had an early morning flight and wanted to be near the hotel  After a breif web serch we ided to book airport hotel the website gave the impression or a professionally run establishment On arrival we found the reception staff to be rude and very unhelpful  We had a late flight so we had no indian rupees to pay the bill with  They would not except us dollars or any foreign currency weird for an airport hotel instead I was told I would be taken to the airport to change money  in the end I was given directions on how to walk to the airport for currency exchange  Once in our room we found it disgusting I wanted to leave but we had no other options and we were on an early morning flight the next day so we ided to grin and bear it The sight of the room still makes me want to be sick  dirty peeled wall papper  A smelly dirty bathroom  with no hot water dirty carpet and a dirty bed  with the location of the airport there were not restaurants nearby so we had to eat in the hotel restaurant  The hotel webstie proudly boasts cuisine from around the world  what the website didnot say was expensive poor vegitairian indian food  by now I just wanted to get drunk and fall asleep to end the misery  I was told by the reception I would hve to walk to the shop to buy beer the hotel did not sell beer We were then told breakfast was part of our room package  when we went for breakfast in the morining we told we would have to pay  I dedcide to check out and that I would rather sit in delhi airportwhen leaving the room we were harassed by  differnt members of staff for our room key so they could check our mini bar I would not wish this place on my worst enermy please please please do not give these people your hard earned money 
N => Not Recommended Because of a unexpected layover at the Delhi Airport it was necessay to get a quick room which ended up being spur of the moment at the Airport Hotel Delhi  It is very close to the Delhi Airport but the room was very basic the shower didnt work and it was noisy The service was actually the best part of the overnight stay  I managed to order some coffee and toast in a pinch very early in the morning before flying out This hotel should be used a emergency stays only but not recommended Watch out for very overpriced cabs that are stationed outside at the Delhi Airport  Use the pre paid cab service from inside the terminal  
N => Stay Away Had to transit via Delhi on my way to Surat Gujarat and ided to spend the night close to the hotel  Worst ision of my life as the hotel was quite possibly the worst hotel that Ive ever stayed in India  The bed was awefull the room dirty and the shower full of mould  There was no proper hot water and the front door wouldnt lock properly  Would highly suggest that you look elsewhere 
N => Worst hotel ever been High rates bad rooms complicated check in 
N => Overpriced  What a Rip Off I stayed at Ata with my spouse and another relative earlier this month  The hotel is  mins by rickshaw to Connht Place and is on a very busy and interesting street  We booked the family room and were quite astonished that the actual room was nothing like the pics on the hotel website Those pictures are misleading  We were put in a ugly windowless room which is not up to international standards at all  The bathroom was not impressive also  The night when our relative arrived to join us we were taken by the Ata staff to a hotel at the back of Ata and told that we needed to check in again  This was quite confusing and uncalled for  We had to be rude and grab our bags back and walk back to Atas front building Like previous travellers who commented on this hotel we were also offered tour packages  We were told that the price for just a driver from Delhi to Agra and Jaipur and back to Delhi would be   for  persons  Luckily we ided to visit the Incredible Travel Centre Office in Connht Place before making any isions and were shocked to be offered a package of   per person for a week trip to DelhiAgra Jaipur and Pushkar  This price included all hotels taxesdriver breakfast etc  We immediately accepted and checked out of Ata the next day never to return for the duration of our trip and I dont think ever to return again  Probably the best thing about this hotel is the restaurant which serves good foodyet it was very pricy compared to other hotel restaurants which had higher standards with cheaper but good food I would not recommend this hotel to anyone   The staff whould also try to make the atmosphere at the hotel relaxed  We felt uncomfortable every time we came to he reception area because staff seemed so distant and unfriendly  
N => value for money good  user friendly clean hotel  rooms need to be more airy  
N => Dont stay here Dont stay here  They constantly wanted to sell us tours etc even when we had said that we preferred to make our own plans  My husband was using the internet and was looking at a hotel in another city when one of the staff came up behind him said quotthat place has no running waterquot which was completely untrue we stayed there and it was beautiful plenty of running water clearly the hotel gets a commission from sending people to other hotels which did not include this one and they are prepared to lie to you   I also had the misfortune to leave my mobile phone in the room when we went away for a day  Luckily I got it back but a call had been made to a number I did not recognise  One day one of the staff knocked on our door saying that we should have checked out by now when we had already pre paid for that night and the following night so they were very disorganised as well  I have never posted a negative review before but I think people need to know what they are getting in for when they stay here  I could go on and on with bad points about this place    
N => Require improvement Positives  Close to New Delhi railway station  Above average restaurant  Good value prices  For dinner only  Air conditioning works  Service OK  Didnt have much trouble with the tour manager Negatives  Website photos are misleading  There were no proper windows in my deluxe room   Sheets provided not particularly clean  Bathroom not clean see photos attached cracks on the bathroom wall  Lift wasnt working on day   No hot waterConclusion I paid around INR  per night for a deluxe room it just didnt feel right  Should have paid less for a budget hotel or pay more at a quality hotel  
N => Get a Rough Guide to India or Read the Trip Advisor We started our journey at  am on friday morning   at arrival to New Dehli plane was delayed an hour    driver was waiting   no problems    reached the hotel at approximately  am   we all were shipped into a small room to check in and also payments for our stay was requested immediately   after sending a number of e mails for explainations on the rates a price was agreed however we were overcharged   okay payments were made without arguments   we finally went to sleep at  am    my year old son was exhausted   next morning at  am   phone rang   office manager wanted to know how we were     at this point we felt we had to get up and go down     am we went downstairs   we hadnt even reached the final step when the office manager greeted us and took us straight into her office to discuss our interniary and what our plans were   at this point we were still jet lagged my son wasnt feeling very well   he also was hungry as well   none of this was taken into consideration   we were bombarded with questions   we had to tell her we need to think about what we want to do   if we asked any questions she would reply and then say I told you so or I have already told you   which confused us more   the service in the breakfast area was very poor   no one explained what breakfast was available    we didnt like Ata at all and wouldnt recommend it to anyone   we stayed at a reputable Hotel in Mumbai and the same brand hotel was only x doors way if I had know I would have rather spent my hard earned money there than Ata   we went to Ata because of the Lonely Planet reviews however we felt because perhaps we were Indians we were been exploited in the hotel as well as out   the manager told us not to trust anyone outside yet we felt we couldnt trust anyone in or out   rather take out chances out then in the hotel  we stayed at a number of other different hotels in India and Ata was the worst    it was all money money money I am in the process of writing a complaint letter to Ata Hotel   I am not expecting a reply   they have our money    they dont need to reply     
N => This hotel is NOT safe for single females At the beginning of ober my sister a single female traveller about to arrive in India called this hotel on two occasions from the UK and requested a room booking for the night of her arrival in Delhi  She spoke to two arate members of staff both of whom assured her that a room had been reserved for her  She then followed this up with an email to the hotel  She requested an airport pick up gave her flight details and was assured also that this had been arranged On arrival at the airport in the early hours of the morning she found no one from the hotel waiting to pick her up  On telephoning your hotel to ask about the transfer she was told that her room had been given away to a party of guests who had arrived and requested a five day stay  The person she spoke to seemed to think it was perfectly reasonable not to honour her reservation merely because a more lucrative booking had presented itself My sister was thus stranded alone in Delhi in the middle of the night  She was taken to an office of touts by a taxi driver who forced her to pay a very high price for a five hour taxi transfer to Rishikesh I wrote to the hotel and asked for an explanation but no reply has been received  I therefore do not suggest that you stay at this hotel as it doesnt seem to value customer service or reliability at all  
N => the hotel does not honour its commitment We reserved luxory rooms  weeks before arrival but they didnt have such rooms for us  Other hotels nearby give same kind of rooms and service for half of the price  
N => terrible hotel high price room dirty and old water stops very high price not recommand 
N => Not worth the room rates charged Stayed here for  nights  It was not a very comfortable stay in comparison to the room rates we paid  Found the room a bit small    the double bed occupied the entire space  The water pipes were leaking in the bathroom The room key did not work one afternoon  So we were stuck outside our room for almost an hour while the carpenter tried to get the door open  While checking out the credit card machine was not working  My husband ran around for  minutes in search of an ATM and we paid by cash  So I would suggest others to have enough cash handy during checkout Good points The drivers associated with the hotel are polite and friendly  Near the New Delhi railway station 
N => Not welcoming and first impressions last       We booked at Hotel Ata prior to arrival in India it had mixed reviews but so did most of the Hotels in Delhi  A plus point for us was the free airport pick up which was fine  We got to the Hotel at about am after many hours travelling  The staff were unfriendly and after filling out the forms which we felt they could have done later they wanted payment up front  When we produced Rupees they wanted to know where we got them from how much was the rate and if we had the receipt  We pretended we couldnt find the receipt and were a bit shocked at how in our face they had been about it  The room was semi clean and it had toilet paper etc but no hot water  We also had no window in the room except into the corridor The worst part of the Hotel was the tour manager at the office downstairs very pushy and in your face every time we walked in and out of the Hotel  We nearly took one of their tours naivety showing through until we met up with a friend of a friend in Delhi who told us that the Hotel had been in the papers recently for scamming tourists with the tours We checked out of the Hotel early in the end and would not recommend it to anyone  There are much better places to stay where you dont feel like your are being questioned and under surveillance  
N => Try another one   Ok the price and pick up service attracts you at first but     The room was too noisy I thought I was sleeping on the street and you will not find the rooms like the photos on website  Restaurant was terrible  They say not available for everything in the menu except rice and some Indian stuff  Breakfast is so called open buffet but there was nothing at all and you can not order anything else if you need  And do not ever think about arranging a trip with them they literally conned me  When I understood it was too late and they did not even reply my emails I paid  rupees for a trip which costs maximum  rupees And they demand for cash  The cashier guy told me that quotthis is too small money give it in cashquot I think India became rich  So I would not recommend to anyone   
N => ent Hotel I was a little bit suspicious of Hotel Ata based on some of the reviews on here  However the hotel was perfectly fine to use as a base to explore Delhi  It was generally clean the rooms were a ent size and the shower was warm albeit a little temperamental  The complimentary hotel pickup was very good  The first room we were given was a bit cell like as it was small had no window and the bathroom looked a bit grubby but after asking the staff were happy to move us to the slightly bigger room next door where there was a window and a better bathroom   The hotel was a bit noisy but what can you expect from the location Staff were freindly to us and the lobby etc    was clean  The restaurant was fine too  Some people on this have complained about a quotpushyquot travel agent at the hotel trying to force you into overpriced tours  When we checked into the hotel we were spoken to by a friendly man in the office about our travel plans but because we knew what we were doing he didnt try and sell us anything though the hotel might want to note that some people on this website have found this approach a bit pushy and unwelcoming  Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Ata and would recommend it as a budget place to stay in Delhi  
N => Not a guest friendly hotel Please carry cash at the time of check out credit card is not accepted in this hotel else you will have to walk for five minutes to take cash from ATM and pay your bill  
N => Ata Hotel was clean and hospitable in an impeccable location  We appreciated our clean cool room in the hot season and the friendly helpful staff  This hotel has a lovely view of the Taj Mahal from the rooftop eating area and the car and driver we hired to drive to Jaipur and back to Delhi were comfortable and clean  This was an excellent value and we would not hesitate to stay there again  We were a party of three adults traveling together my husband and me and my sister in law  
N => Much improved from the first time I stayed I have stayed at the Hotel Ata on  occasions The first was not a good experience however this was be because I had not prepared for the differences in lifestyle and other things  I felt pressured to take taxis everywhere and lost money doing so but I ided to give it another go and returned This time I found it much easier the food was very good the service was excellent and yes the rooms were a bit noisy but its New DelhiI would recommend this hotel as its a really good place to chill out whilst aclimatising to this beautiful country  
N => Dont let the photos fool you  Its a budget hotel and thats exactly what it is  Its a good budget hotel but their webiste seems to fluff things a little too much  So LOWER your expectations as in way way low if you want to stay there  When I was checking in there was a big group of rather unfriendly guys it felt like some local government office rather than a guesthouse  And then another Indian guy kept asking me to follow him out of the hotel I didnt know whats going on some other guy has my passport     it was a mess  They didnt scam me or anything but having just just arrived to Delhi this sort of disorientation at the place you are staying isnt ideal  I made two reservations one for when I arrive and another at the end of the trip  I cancelled the second reservation That was my experience and I stand by my word  
N => Good Location Rooms  we Went with my own tour group had  of us occupying  rooms the staff knew what everybody wanted and we all had a great  nights here at ata this is right next to everything and a great location we booked this through sanfred travels and was a good ision They serve food  hours a day which was great but yes we overate they have awesome balcony rooms overlooking the city and easily the best looking hotel in the area They gave us an upgrade on our return from udaipur which was a welcome surprise Kudos to ata hotels 
N => warm drinks we stayed in y  in this hotel  We occupied two rooms one single and one double The single had no window  Room price   The double had a fridge which did not work  After complaints some housekeeping boyscoming three times to look after but without success So we ordered cola which came warm same with mineral water  Not to forget the beerThey told us to go outside for a cold beer but this also never came A special service was a small bucket with ice cubes for  Rs The hotel has a nice roof top restaurant but what a sense without cold drinks After one night we checked out and went to the neighbouring Grand hotel which wasreally great  
N => budget hotel I stayed at this hotel a couple of times with my husband as we had to transit in Delhi  The first time we saw the hotel I was really worried  I have never back packed before and the hotel was in a very crowded area and I really did not like it at all  However as I was with my husband I did not mind it too much  But do not believe the photos you see on their home page The rooms were not too bad  They were quite spacious  When our flight was postponed we stayed an additional night and they upgraded us  However I thought that the semi deleuxe room was better than the upgraded room Also I am not so sure about the staff at the front desk  Some of them are nice but the others    I am not so sure On my last stay I met a lady at the front desk and she seemed quite nice  The rooms could be a bit more clean  We ided not to stay here again when it took us nearly  hours to go to the hotel from the airport and at the end of a long travel we were not too keen to go to some crowded place But I think it is ok value for money given that most hotels in Delhi are quite expensive  
N => Tickets travel and holliday thanks to hotel ata in new delhi Myself and nelson and kelly from stellar trip management in the usa planned our journey to india and nepal with tickets to india plus our stay all with hotel ata being travel professionals we know we can be a pain when were travelling but we as a  team would encourage via this review whoever is behind the ata operations and say You guys delivered fantastically if thats a word we are your clients for Life Very professional extremely hard working Team     They did however take their sweet time to check us in but we reckoned security protocols are better adhered to than not    Will be sending you a written recomendation soon 
N => sophisticated and affordable Ata hotel is one of the best places to stay in Delhi  Not only is it cost effective but the ambience food and the service is superb Definitely recommend it to everyone to choose this as their first preference to stay in Delhi  
N => As a single woman I needed a safe and relatively cheap place for a few hrs in the middle of the night I got into Delhi at AM and Delhi as a city has a horrible reputation for the safety of single women  I was greatly relieved to see the hotel arranged driver was waiting patiently as my flight in was delayed for over an hour  The only glitch was even though I had paid via cleartrip com the hotel guys said I had not made payment  However I was able to connect to my bank and the call centre people spoke to the hotel receptionist and convinced him that my card had been charged  I was leaving at  the next day so spent only about  hrs in my room but it seemed a perfect fit for my specific need  The staff was very curteous and the room and bathroom was clean  
N => Terrible experience I booked a twin room in this hotel for  days via telephone thats one way of booking this hotel  But when I finally reached there with my foreign friend they said they cannot let us stay in one room if there is no relation  I tried to argue but there was no use  They shifted us to another hotel instead  The location of the hotel Paharganj is terrible too no ent restaurants or cafes there  The food in hotels restaurant is also very average  Overall an experience woth forgetting  
N => Never Ever Coming Back first impression was worst I made a resrevation on Phone and I was told they will provide me Pick up and drop pff at teh airport so I cancelled another reservation which was near the airport  Pick up was horrible took time to get to Hotel then I was told at teh check in they provide one way only as either pick up or Drop off have I been told on the phone when I made reservation I could have used Drop off as I had my car for the that time  They forced me to pay for the Airport drop off its not matter of   its matter of giving fasle informationSo I will suggest dont rely on what you are told on phone get a written confirmation for everything and More over Dont even stay here  Airport hotels are much better safer and more customer oriented  If it was any other hotle they could have accpeted thier mistake and provided the tranport as it was their fault of giving wrong information Their Resturant is said to be AC but not worth sitting there its always hot some how 
N => clean safe place to stay good value for money I was travelling to India with a girlfriend and was warned by several friends about the safety factor in delhi for girls  We were greeted by a friendly driver at the airport and taken to the hotel  The room service was good and the fact that there was an in house restaraunt helped on days that we wanted to spend time relaxing  All together the stay was safe and comfortable and good value for money  I would suggest offering non smoking rooms  The staff was very warm and friendly  
N => NO VALUE for MONEY The room was neat and clean  But the TV provided by them and NO wi fi connection makes u feel that u entered into some low budget hotel  No doubt a bath tub will be provided but i dont know wat they xpect us to do without proper water storage in dat tub  there was prob wid d valve n culdnt stop draining of waterEven the water bottles chips amp cold drinks provided in the room are charged nothing is complimentary  And more over the food in the restaurant is NOT at all worth that price bad taste and bad quantity  
N => I would not recommend this hotel to anyone Recently I stayed at Ata only to be ambushed on arrival by Mrs Kher   the inhouse travel agent   who arranged for travel for the remaining time that I spent in India   on the following day I requested that all travel plans be cancelled   which I was told was not possible   but was given a reduuction of INR  of total of travel costs   After leaving New Delhi I again requested that all plans made by Capitol City Travel be cancelled   and was ignored for a few days   then to be told that yes it can be cancelled quotbut you will loose some moneyquot   I have been back from india for over a month and still have not recieved any refund from these people   BUYER BEWARE   I thought that i was just checking into a hotel initially   not booking a holiday   I would not recommend this Hotel or Capitol City Travel to anyone   check more reviews for confirmation of this at TripAdvisor com 
N => Not as cheap as you would expect altogether bad value for money The main problem with the Ata is that it is run by a management team that has no centralised system of communications so that you have to record yourself anything you pay for in order to make sure that you can defend your case when they do not find a trace of your advance payment But what I found the most suspicious about them is the way that they charge you a   service fee on top of the usual    luxury tax tourists normally pay  This dramatically increased the cost of accomodation making the Ata almost as expensive as some  star hotels in much nicer areas of Delhi Funny enough one of the manager proposed to reduce that service charge to   if I chose to pay in cash which I refused  Do I smell tax evasion Anyhow I have never seen anywhere charge   service on top of your room fee especially since porters and others employees still expect to be tipped  It is all very dodgey and I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone unless you enjoy being ripped off  
N => Bad start to India trip Having read a number of reviews I feel relieved that many experiences mirror mine  Pick up from the airport was good but we paid for that by having a small dingy room on the first night for which we paid appx AUS  Taken into a room and interrogated about our travel plans  We were backpacking and didnt want a tour but they were like a dog with a bone and wouldnt leave us be  By the time we left wed gotten used to ducking for cover each time we saw the travel agent lady Extremely pushy  Extremely nosy  Extremely bad manners We couldnt leave the hotel without someone asking where we were going and who we were meeting and where we were going next and where we were planning to stay  It was a terrible start to our holiday and unfortunately put us off staying in any hotel which ran a travel service as we assumed they would all be the same  Thankfully we found out later they werent  I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone and I would never stay there again  
N => Great Holiday Experience at an Affordable Price  we went to delhi in ember to attend my cousins wedding amp stayed at the Ata Hotel  the service provided was excellent very conveniently located near my cousins place  We were picked up from the airport by the hotel staff for free  on the drive from the airport the driver updated us on all the new places that had opened up such as restaurants malls etc  very friendly amp nice fellow  At the hotel we were greeted by the manager of the hotel who was really helpful in helping us plan our travel itinery  we told him that we wanted to see the Taj Mahal in Agra amp the Fatehpur Sikri Fort after my cousins wedding was over  Our room was really nicely done and was very clean Im very fussy about hygiene amp cleanliness  didnt expect it to be so nice considering the deal we got  the restaurant was nice too but breakfast was a bit expensive  The location too was really cool  just  mins drive to connht place which is the centre point of delhi amp has amazing shops amp restaurants  path was my favorite shopping haunt for handicrafts amp k jewelry amp colorful embroidered bags  very bohemian stuff at prices that are exorbitant but you can manage to fit it in your budget by hardcore bargaining  I loved haggling with the vendors never get to do that here in Vancouver  The highlight of our visit to India was our Agra trip  We rode to the Taj on a camel cart  Darn exciting experience  it was our First camel cart ride  The Taj is the most beautiful monument weve ever seen  the hotel arranged for a guide for us to explain the history of this gorgeous monument  Excellent guide he was very informative and witty  the hotel guy arranged for a professional photographer who clicked our pictures very artfully  After the taj we went to Fatehpur Sikri Fort which is a very intriguing monument  its sitiuated on top of a hill and has this massive gate that made us feel so tiny  the fort has a white ble mosque where it is believed that whatever you wish for will come true and has had visits from top celebrities and bollywood stars  huge compound but very crowded  children selling stuff really pestered us  but on the whole a great fun place to visit  the ata staff really made our stay worthwhile  we will definitely stay with them again whenever we visit India again and recommend this hotel to everyone Cheers guys Thanks a ton for making our stay MemorableBest RegardsRachita amp Gang 
N => good value Booking was easy got a great price for the central location in Delhi  Near the railway station super easy to travel outside delhi  Hotel arranged pick up from airport got me tickets for the train to Agra set up sight seeing around Delhi reccomended authentic place to see  They even have their own restaurant and travel agency which was very convinient for me  Room was nice and clean  All in all exceptional service 
N => Not bad    remember to haggle with Mrs Kehr My girlfriend and I arrived in Dehli and grabbed a taxi straight to the Hotel Ata We were both exhausted from our flight and also a bit nervous about the start of our planned  months of backpacking before arriving in New Zealand As soon as we arrived we were ushered into a little room where we met Mrs Kehr a representative of Capital Tours She asked us what we had planned for our  months in India and we replied that we were just going to wing it She planned everything for us A driver called Dinesh who was a really fantastic guy    very knowledgable with really good English He took us around Rajasthan to Agra then another driver who was rubbish took us to Khajuraho Bandhavgar Tiger Reserve and Varanasi We haggled with prices a LOT    so felt that we got an average deal I must say though her first price which we halved would have been a HUGE rip off The hotel Ata itself was well located in Delhi  The room average sized could have done with a paint job and not that clean    but you do get what you pay for Overall I would say that it was a really good place to start our experience in India 
N => Great service We were in New Delhi last month for my cousins wedding  We stayed at the Ata hotel for about a week and a half and it was a great experience overall  The staff was very polite and friendly  The lobby staff went out of their way to help us find the things that we needed around town like finding shops etc  I would definitely recomment all my friends to go stay there if they go to India  Thanks Guys   Sunny Par amp Family  
N => awesome time very good hotel to stay in if ur goin to delhi u have a good time goin place up north ask amp it will be delivered at room thats how good the service was          you would not have lift a pen regards nakul 
N => Constantly mislead I arrived in  in Delhi with my mom  We booked Ata online because it was easy  As expected we were picked up at the airport  The rooms were not as nice as the photos online at all  We arrived late so had little choice  The next morning a woman introduced herself we later found out she ran Capital City Tours Mrs  Kher  She asked us our plans  She made us believe she was booking trains for us and mid range hotels  The price for  was  for  days we thought it was a lot but it was  am and we were in a foreign place  Next she said it was complimentary to be toured around Delhi so we went  That was when we discovered we hired a personal driver for  days  He was nothing but annoying He would only take us to places where he got commission fed our mind with crazy stories about being poisoned and raped and complained about his job the entire time  He also was falling asleep while driving and refused to pull over to nap  Most of the hotels were really nice one was disgusting  He was supposed to stay with us for  days   but we let him go a day early because he was so obnoxious  Then we were on our own for the next  days  nothing included in the original   The last day of our trip we had prepaid for an overnight train ride and a hotel in Mumbai through Mrs  Kher  Unfortunately we were in a bus accident side note dont take busses most of the drivers are drunk  My mother couldnt continue to travel so we began booking flights home early  We called Mrs  Kher she was super nice saying she would help us with what ever needed and she would refund us our  for the last portion of the trip  It is  months  phone calls and many emails later and we still havent been refunded  On the phone she would say check in  days it just went through Ill send you confirmation  NOTHING  She fed us with lies to shut us up so now I am writing this so people know it is a bad business and if something unfortunate should happen they will only lie to make you happy but not follow through  
N => What a Gem Traveled to Delhi in ember  from San Francisco last minute with a few buddies and booked the Hotel on a friends recommendation who had stayed there before I was glad to find the hotel better than expected and great value for money compared to other hotels in the busy touristy neighborhood The rooms were clean and spacious Internet connectivity was great  The hotel staff was courteous with good service and helped plan our trip in Delhi  We were also able to book tours to Agra amp Jaipur through the Hotel in a private taxi last minute at very reasonable rates  On the way out our flight was delayed due to fog in Delhi and missed our connection back to the states  The Hotel accommodated us last minute for  days and provided to and from transportation from the airport promptly in the middle of the night Highly recommended place to stay for travelers  Thanks Ata  
N => ent hotel convenient to train station We had a really hard time finding a hotel in Delhi but chose Hotel Ata for its proximity to the New Delhi train station as we had a early morning train to catch to Agra  The hotel is not in the best neighborhood but I think you could say that about most of the hotels in India  It was only a short walk to the station and was quite comfortable save for the extremely noisy neighborhood  The best part though is probably the attached restaurant  Breakfast wasnt anything special but after a long day of sightseeing dinner at the restaurant was superb  
N => Overpriced but adequate hotel We booked a deluxe room with airport pickup before we left for India  The airport pickup went well and was appreciated since we arrived about  am  The deluxe room had no window and the toilet leaked  They showed us two other deluxe rooms but one had no window and the other had a tiny window however the toilet didnt leak in this room  The TV worked in both rooms  The rooms were clean enough  The restaurant was adequate but nothing special  We used their travel service to book a tour and that went well  I would recommend Capital City Travel  
N => More than adequate Hotel Ata was ok with us  After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor my wife and I were apprehensive about staying here  Well the airport pickup went without a hitch  They claim to be close to the airport but are more like central Delhi about  minutes from the airport  The neighborhood is the real Delhi lots of interesting stuff going on in the street  We even got to watch a performance of the Raana in a small park adjacent to the hotel  Staff was friendly but we didnt book anything through the hotel  You can avoid that kind of pressure by staying on a night to night basis  Our Superior room was a little small but quite clean by Indian hotel standards  In retrospect the bad reviews on this site reflect more about Indian hotels in general than Ata specifically  We only stayed one night as a layover and this was fine we got a little taste of Delhi with no problems  If you re staying for a week a more in Delhi it might be fun to treat yourself to a fancier place for a couple nights  But considering some of the other possibilites for Delhi hotels Ata is more than adequate  
N => Stay Away My email correspondence with this hotel should have been enough warning to stay away however I persisted and put it down to lack of English communication  Upon check in we were requested to go into a room which can only be described as a customs integration office  After this lengthy process we were advised that our room was available numerous times I asked if the room type was the presidential suite that I had paid for before arriving and the check in lady advise yes this room type is the one you have booked  Upon arriving in the room and further questioning of the front office staff it was apparent that we were not given the room type requested however given one that was three or four times a lower standard  It was also very apparent that if we did not question the matter that the hotel staff was happy for us to stay in the lower room type without refunding us the difference  After a lengthy discussion at the front desk the following day the check out person reluctantly refunded us what was rightfully ours During our stay we found the hotel staff to all be very unhelpful and rude  The lack of communication within the front desk was very annoyning having to report the same thing to three different people  The only thing going for this hotel was the friendly driver that greeted us at the airport  If staying in Delhi I would not recommend to stay at this hotel  There are numerous other hotels along the same road that be suitable  The rooms do not look at all like the ones displayed on the internet  
N => Booked Stayed Regretted Ok so this is a few years ago but still    I booked the Hotel Ata for my first trip to India  I figured out myself how to get there having read up on the various taxi scams going on at Delhi AirportThe hotel itself isnt bad  The rooms are not as clean as they can be but whatever  My problems began when I told the inhouse travel agent that I wanted to see Rajastan  They sold me a  day trip with driver etc  etc  etc  Needless to say it was a complete disaster and after the first day I demanded to be returned to Delhi and I got back to the hotel I demanded my money back  After some serious arguing they caved and refunded me  So that was good  After a second terrible experience with an organised tour with another agency I steered clear of tour agencies for the rest of my trip All in all its an ok place to stay theyre fairly honest fairly clean but quite expensive rp a night  For the rest of my time in India I never spent more than rp a night for a room  
N => The worst hotel in the world I have ever stayed in We were constantly arguing with this cheating hotel  It ruined our holiday and cheated us out of money  DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL  On the first day it took  hours to check in on a pre booked room  The room had cockroaches and they changed our room but it was missing a bed  It then took  hours to get the bed  They also accused us of not paying despite having a receipt and they tried to make us pay twice As soon as you arrive they make you see the tourist lady a lying cheat  DO NOT buy trips from her  She sold us trips which were not possible and a car we couldn t use due to Independance Day  She tried to sell us trips totalling   rupees    Thank god we took the cheaper option  She knew the trips and the use of the car were not possible but she sold us the trips with no conscience to make money  She then wouldn t give us our money back  She also constantly lied when we were trying to sort things out and constantly changed her story  She was not sorry at all for her actions  I have never met a lady as bad as this lady in my life There are a lot of hotels in Delhi to stay in and this is not one I would recommend to my worst enemy  
N => Tried to make us pay twice for the rooms We booked two rooms to stay one night at Ata hotel on y    We gave our credit card number before our arrival for payment  After staying one night and checking out the man at the front desk asked for payment again  When we told him we had already made the payment via credit card he said that payment hadnt gone through yet so he needed cash  When we asked what if later after paying cash the credit payment came through  The man said that he would refund the money back As though we are fools  We told him we it was his look out to check about payment and that we are not fools to pay him double He also was going to charge us for food we never ordered the night before  We only asked for mineral water  But also tried to add in some bill for food items The front area has been reated and so were some of the rooms  But the pictures on the website was nothing like the rooms we stayed in  It was in much more dull The door locks with an olden style key which kept jamming My room was very basic with small bed and a small tv  The other room with a double bed had no tv and a mini fridge that didnt work Please be wary when you stay here  
N => Most horrible place Ive ever stayed This hotel is a joke  Dont stay here  I know there isnt much choice in Delhi of clean ent value places but there has to be better than this dump  Our sheets were filthy the staff were HORRIBLE and very shifty waiting outside our room until we left the next morning and the bathroom was dirty too  Avoid at all costs  Such a rip off  
N => Bad Experience I have to say that staying in this stupid hotel was the most horrible experience in my life i stayed there in st week of   i was picked up by the hotel chauffer from my midnight flight only nice thing during my stay as it was complimentary as promised   was escorted into a smelly indica car with no ac  i was promised over phone that ac car will be there for pickup and drop by a lady who talked to me the drive was smooth  i was expecting a big hotel as for appearence from what i saw from website picture  i was driven to a road which was congested  unclean bustling with activity even in the midnight  i was ushered to the reception  i was supposed to be given a welcome drink as the website promised   but i was not even welcomed inside  after asking for a room the manager told me to give my icard i have heared about iphone but icard seems to be something that i cannot discover atlast it came to my mind that it was i d card and so gave it to him  i was alloted a standard ac room  the hotel ppl navigated me into a labyrinth of maze and i was given room no  in one corner  it was a very small room with a tv and a fridge that did not work and was meant to hold a couple of fanta bottles  the door did not have a proper secure lock so i had to use my room key to lock each time  the bed was tooooosmall to hold two ppl  and the bedsheet which was given was meant for one and to be shared by  people  whole night there was light from outside glowing and we heared sounds of autorickshaw pying  so didnt get proper sleep at all the bathroom was ordinary  next morning after bath luckily luke warm water was available and we went into the hotel restaurant which had no south indian food items   i was forced to eat badly burnt bread and omlette with tuttifruities in it  we had planned to go out so we gave the keys to reception and asked them to clean the room  we came back in evening and asked for keys  the reception manager was fumbling coz the keys were not returned to reception after cleaning  we had to wait for  hour to get the duplicate keys  finally we had to suffer the same insomnia next night too  and the worst of all when we asked for the car to drop us in the airport we were told that only pickup was complimentary and drop was chargable at a nominal price of rs    so i hade to once again fish out money to get a car since i had to board the flight urgently  overall it was a very bad experience staying in atha 
N => ent tourist class hotel Checking in was an experience  We were taken to see so many people when all we wanted to do was get to our room Trying to sell toursexcursionsflights     do not do it    sort it all out yourself as its much cheaperWhen we eventually got to the room it turned out to be simple basic but clean enough  Consierge tried to sell us an upgrade when we arrived in the room but we refused  Dont think those rooms were much different to the one we had Air conditioning and ceiling fan a must India in il and we had themRestaurant was good for breakfast and dinner  Buffet breakfast only available when you arrive in the morning  If you pretend to leave a full al la carte becomes available hahaha   Try it yourselfGave us a a lovely cake for one of our birthdays when we were staying there  Would have enjoyed it more only for the dreaded Delhi Belly but that was not their faultInternet is available at a small cost 
N => Ripped off i and a female friend booked into the Hotel Ata before we left England  neither of us had been to India before so i checked the internet and booked our holiday on there on our arrival in Delhi Airport we were met by a driver who took us to the hotel  thats when we faced our first obstacle  we were given a poky windowless room  after much arguing with the staff we were allocated a room at the front of the building this was also poky but did have a balcony overlooking the street  we stayed the nights of th th th and th ruary  leaving at midday on the th  in all that time our room was not cleaned nor the towels changed  the roof top restaurant was a building site with no service at all  luckily we only used the hotel as a base  on the th ruary we asked about a trip to Agra taking a car for the day  we were quoted Rs which we lined  we found a more reasonable rate across the road we had also booked two nights th and th ch  so that we had someplace to go at the end of our visit to India  on arrival on th ch we were told they didnt have a room for us  after much arguing we were given a room windowless but larger than the original one  as it was for only one night we booked for the night of th ch but was leaving at pm for the airport we ided to make do all was well until we went to settle the bill  we had previously heard others arguing about their bills but thought nothing of it we ended up paying more for the two nights than we had for our original stay of four nights  as time was pressing to get to the airport we had no choice but to pay up  included in the bill was charges for cleaning the room twice   it had not been cleaned whilst we were there  When we arrived at the hotel on th ch we had already paid Rs  on enquiring what our balance was i was told Rs  on checking out we had to pay Rs  i will be returning to India late  but will not be staying at the Hotel Ata again am i satisfied with the hotel would i recommend it definitely not 
N => scams   watch your back here when we arrived we were told we had to check in through the travel agent he faffed around with our voucher in reception for a while and after a night on the train then the delhi tuk tuk drivers I insisted i would check in at reception not the travel agent  The receptionist told me they were check out not check in even though the Indian woman in front of me was checking in  Grrrr had to go back to travel agents Fortunately he could not do a hard sell as we were not even staying all night Room clean windowless  All we needed  Breakfast most excellent Travel agent came in to breakfast and was trying to accost breakfasters for a tour Lots of people loitering around on each floor  Some sort of bangingbuilding going on in a room on our floorRooftop restaurant a building site did get a tea and sat on dusty chair View goodBIG DOWN SIDE   when we came to check out they tried to charge us again they claimed we were checking out after    no we said were not due to leave till tomorrow we are checking out early  Then it was where is your voucher we gave it you this am we said  They said they couldnt find it although didnt really look for it and wanted to charge us again  Fortunately we had a second invoice though not strictly the voucher and they copied this and let us go  Surely they must have a system ie they dont let you in your room without the voucher It is my personal opinion that this is a deliberate scam  
N => Average We stayed in a presidential suite for  nights  The rooms are a good size the bed is comfy and the shower is fab  You have to accept that Delhi is noisy and the rooms are not soundproofed  We only used the hotel as a base and it is central  The room was never cleaned over  days but this is India We chose not to use the hotels travel agency finding much cheaper deals elsewhere  They didnt appreciate this and tried to cancel our room but we had the confirmation and they let us stay  Because of that we chose to stay in a different hotel on our return  I would stay there again and it is a fair price  The hotel pickup was fine but they quote  for return to airport  Taxis charge  rupees for the journey   or   We chose a taxi 
N => Terrible Hotel Please note This hotel is advertised as New Delhi but is actually in Old Delhi We stayed at the Ata Hotel for a total of five nights in early ruary   It was our first stop on our round the world trip  We were picked up ok at the airport and immediately shepherded into the travel agency by Mrs  Shah who dove straight into her hard sell  Before we knew it she had charged our credit card with  INR for a trip to Jaipur amp Agra that should have cost about  INR  We argued that shed ripped us off and she gave us  INR cash back and a further  INR when we argued more with her  Despite the rocky start we were determined to enjoy our time in this beautiful country and had two really nice days in and around Delhi with our friendly honest driver  He tried to take us to some emporiums but we stood firm and told him that we werent interested  He was totally ok with it and we gave him a  INR tip and he seemed much happier with that Our trip to Jaipur and Agra was great and both hotels especially Jaipur were nice with clean rooms and good food  Of course we came into contact with scammers but the best way to deal with them when they ask you if its your first time in India is to say No  They usually back off if you are firm with them When we returned to Delhi we had the same rubbish from the staff of the Ata but just ignored it and ate in other places and hailed our own rickshaws really easy just raise your hand at the roadside and about fifty of them race towards you All in all India is an amazing place but if youre in Delhi be consider staying somewhere else  
N => trap trap trap When we arrived at the airport there was no pick up service we had to call the hotel to send a driver who was supposed to be there in  minutes which ended up being hrs  The hotel is situated in a very busy and unpleasant part of town  Although the hotel itself does not reflect the outside there were plenty of blemishes we had to pay for the supposed complimentary driver plus the expected tip  we were then escorted directly into a travel agent room instead of check in where he proceeded to rip us off by offering outlandish prices for tours and cars  The staff expected a tip for everything Including pointing to your room even though you already know where it is  The advertised Wi fi did not work and i heard it still wasnt working after a week  The internet was slow and did not work most of the time which frustrated the tourists there that and the fact that they still expected you to pay for the internet that didnt work  The exchange did not have enough INR for   If you are hiring a driver be aware that they will take you to emporium after emporium and if you have any specialised shopping in our case it was a camera they will not take you to the cheaper government stores but to the more expensive stores where thay have commision  You will save a lot of money by catching auto rickshaws and getting around on your own  Although the rickshaw drivers do exactly the same thing if you are firm they will know not to muck you around  We made friends with our driver and established a quick understanding which saved us a lot of money and time  This hotel like others i suppose will at any cost milk tourists for their money  Although it is nice be warned be aware and remember that doing all your travelling arrangements is possible even though the travel agent will say that it is not the food is good and the superior and supposed presidential suites are good dont expect a great view like the net shows but anything under these are very basic  Hope this helps especially the first timers to india    
N => Avoid This Place    A lot of rooms have no window  Room rates are far too high for he rooms and service provided  We paid rooms in advance but when we arrived one room had been given to someone else so that one person in our group of  had to stay in another hotel which was even worse   They tried to cheat us with the tax by trying to charge a tax on the rooms which is only applicable on food and beverages  Bed sheets were dirty and seemed not to be changed after each guest   Roof top terrace is a place where they dump rubbish and old furniture can t be used to sit  We saw many other people complaining about the rooms cleanliness and prices during our stay   The attached travel agency is very aggressive and trying to sell their tours which are heavily overpriced  Usually people arriving in the hotel will be asked to come to the travel office straight away  We asked them to quote for a  days tour and got it for one third of the price somewhere else later  DO NOT BUY TOURS AT THIS PLACE  I can clearly say that I am not going to put a foot again into this hotel and can only recommend avoiding staying there  
N => Tower of Terror We stayed here for  nights th amp th ember was meant to stay another night but didnt read on and you will understand whyPositive Location is only a min walk to New Delhi Train Station perfect for the early morning train to Agra Cantt station to see the Taj Mahal if you want any hints or tips on how to do it yourself dont hesitate to contact me excellent free transfer from airport to hotel took about  mins but this was in rush hour  Room    massive bathroom and clean  TV air con not needed in ember cheap mini bar hard bed our preference  Restaurant served nice amp reasonable food however if you dont like your meat on the bone then go vegetarian No beer served in the restaurant but you can go up to the roof terrace and get a Kingfisher beer NegativesNot enough toilet paper I know it seem petty but why should you have to tip someone just to get the basics The same went for towels  Why clean the bathroom and take away your dirty towels but not replace them unless you give them moneyAs I said earlier the food was nice in the restaurant however the constant harressment from the waiters and manager meant that you could not enjoy your food Also be aware of your meat on the bone they use every partNo hot water at all on our last morning and when I went to speak to the manager he just ignored me and shrugged his shoulders when I asked if the water would come back on  This was the worst constant building work on the nd floor   I mean all through the night  I think it actually started about am you could actually taste the dust It felt like they were building next door When I went to reception and asked to be moved the manager again just ignored me  I had enough at this point and left when we checked out my partner went over to speak to the manager who just stared at us and didnt say anythingI know that its all down to personal choice but please do not stay in this hotel but if you do good luckFor our last night we stayed at the Hotel Palace Heights in Connht Place  Please see review  
N => Do not trust the travel agency We booked a hotel in Goa with the travel agency in the hotel  When we arrived in Goa the hotel was disgusting linen stained and unclean swimming pool so unclean couldnt see the steps let alone the bottom So we called Ata to ask if we could get a refund he said yes over the phone     a month later we are still trying to get a refund  We have emailed and called countless times and still no refund  We also found out since he was making   commission PER NIGHT on our booking The hotel was not great either poor location and our room had no windows 
N => It was an experience that I will always remeber fondly Frome the very first moment we walked into the Hotel we knew that we were going to come back again and again  We have never felt so at home and comfortable at any other establishment  From the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff everyone was very pleasent helpful and warm  I would surely recomend this hotel to any of my freinds and family  
N => Fawlty Towers of India I rate this as quotterriblequot because it was   er   terrible Actually Ithink the hotel is perfectly comfortable in a seedy old colonial yetbohemian sort of way  It has one lift which I wouldnt trust to be infor more than  minutes a concierge on every level who likes to knowexactly what you are doing and how many tips he can make from you in any one conversation and wholl report you falsely to the boss for trying to give you own clothes to local builders  Hot water was intermittent  Creepy managers near reception loiter to ask how you are doing only as a foil to get you to use their restaurant their taxi services their facilities  However once you tell them you are leaving or are not pleased with certain aspects they drop you like a dead donkey to fend for yourself  That said their restaurant is pretty good and certainly convenient and their rooms fairly clean although we slept in our own bed covers as the dirty ks on the sheets looked suspect  The most disturbing creepiness of all though was when a manager came to us on our first night as we were about to sample the delights of the street informed us that at night the road was not safe from muggers and thieves  I felt this was a strange overkill way of getting us to use their restaurant  When we booked a second night for convenience they had hiked the Expedia price by more than double  If you like quirky creepy soiled and disingenuous this is the place for you  What Expedia are doing to team up with these people is beyond me 
N => ent Hotel The hotel was nicer than expected  The rooms were basic but fine for the price  Our room had a balcony which was great to see the hustle and bustle down below us  Was a little noisy at times but thats expected in the city o The restaurant food was delicious and all staff very helpful  It was also convenient having internet access onsite  Overall I would stay there again as the location is great not too far from Connht street in Tuk Tuk  
N => Horrible experience The rooms are not very clean and our air condition was so noisy it was difficult to go to sleep  I would never stay here again and would recommend everybody else to stay away  There are so many better places on the same road This is not a hotel but a travel agent We arrived with a late flight from London and all the hotel was interested in when we arrived was to sell us one of their trips  Since it was our first night we thought we should be polite and listen even though we had made our own arrangements before leaving home  We were told that the route we had planning was stupid and that a stretch we wanted to take the train was impossible   although we actually had a ticket for it and the train was definitely running  We had booked a car to pick us up the next morning to go to Agra  We were again told in a rather aggressive way that it was ridicolous for a car to come from agra to pick us up to then drive back to agra the only way sesnible to do this was to drive from delhi to agra and back to delhi    Further the hotel made every effort for our driver not to find us and when he asked fo us they even said there were nobody with that name staying at this hotel  There are so many other places to stay in Delhi pick any of them just not this one 
N => Tour operator After to have read positive comments on this website we ided to book for  nights in this hotel According to the quality of the facilities offered by the hotel the price for a room is expensive  Moreover on the spot we booked a  days trip with the tour operator of the hotel Ata  We were very disappointed by the gap between the initial prestations presented to sell the trip and the real quality of the activities and the hotels  We paid indeed an expensive price to get air cond and hot water in each hotel and it was not the case for many nights  In addition we booked for a camel ride in a desert with a quotwonderfulquot night under a big tent in the desert with local dances and a huge diner     but once in the desert the guy in charge of this activity explained us that it is not possible to sleep under a tent and he never heard about these local dances     We ided to cancel the remaining days of our trip to go back in Delhi in to discuss quothardlyquot with the hotel Ata to refund money back  We are very angry to have paid an expensive price for bad prestation and finally to get bad holidays  
N => Terrible place   bad experience Our stay at Hotel Ata just went from good to bad to worse in the three days we stayed there  Here is an account of what happened  We had a reconfirmation not just confirmation from their reservation agent before  st regarding our booking  But when we arrived on   at  pm at Hotel Ata they had no idea about our booking  Our name did not show up in their list or anywhere else  So they took us in as a walk in customer  They promptly went into their keting gimmick of showing us a really small room first and then a larger family room Room  which was available on discount that day  The rate was Rs   in place of their regular Rs    We accepted it and took the room  The room was nice and I have no complaints about this room for the price we were offered  However later on they must have checked with their agent and found out that the accepted rate between us was Rs    So they charged Rs   to us the next day which was fine for me as that was the contracted rate  Their rate fluctuates depending on circumstance and the person in front of them   that is dynamic pricing for you We then left for Agra the next day   with our baggage left at the hotel saying that we were coming back in a day to stay at the hotel again as per my reservation with the agent  The manager at the reception Mr  Kaushal gave me his contact numbers and said I should confirm with them before I leave Agra so that they can keep a room for us  I did so at  noon on   by making a call from Agra and letting them know that we were arriving at  pm  Obviously their processes are not in tune with the needs of the travellers of today  So when we arrived at  pm there were no rooms for us and most were already booked  So they sent us to a room Room  which was a suite with inadequate bedding for the four of us but large open spaces  Seeing the room I knew that the room would cost a lot more than Rs   They did not mention the rate to us while sending us there anyways  When I called them up to enquire about the rate for the room they said it will cost me Rs   for one night again at a discount of course as it is usually priced at Rs    This was not acceptable to me and they reduced it to Rs    Finally after some haggling and fighting in the middle of the night they agreed to let us stay in the room for Rs   for one night  The next morning we had to pack our bags and keep it ready so they could move us to another appropriate room since this suite was at our disposal only for one night  We packed our bags and left them there and went for the sight seeing tour which we had booked through the travel agent who sits at the counter at the same hotel the sight seeing trip was another disappointment which I do not intend to describe  When we came back tired at about  pm that night we had no room again and our bags were still sitting in the same place where we left them in the morning  I argued with the guy at the counter about the reservation and our experience of the previous day etc    Finally he gave me a family room for that night Room  which I thought would be similar to the first room we got and liked but it was not so  It had fewer beds and less moving space  They said they would charge us extra if we wanted extra beds and so we ided to adjust with what we had  And then to our horror we found that the cold water taps in the bathroom were dry  All we had was hot water from the taps  We were too tired to argue or get anything done as it was already late so we just grinned and bore it  We resolved not to return to this hotel ever again in our lives   Moral of the story Hotels like these are not tuned to taking care of modern day travellers  Indian budget hotels have not grown up with the times where reservations are honoured  They do not take advance payments I asked the agent about making payments in advance and she said I need not worry only that I should just show up  They are only tailored to take in walk in customers  So you better show up between  noon and  pm and you might have options to get a good room  After that they will just chuck you into any room and charge you whatever they want reservations be damned  I do not know how they got listed on Lonely Planet and otehr publications     I did see a number of non Indians who had checked in thinking this is a great place  I am not sure if they are treated any better reverse discrimination      Regards Jay 
N => Good for the Price This place was a pleasant suprise I have to say  Everyone says Delhi is a nighte with hotels and to be honest this was good at a good price Room was nice  View was not so good but I wasnt for sitting in my room gazing at any view so that was fine  The bed was comfortable  There was a mini bar which I think the prices were fine  It had chocolate too  Television was fine  medium sized Location is good   minute autorickshaw from Connht Place  I liked the area  Its a bit dingy but the energy was good  Such a stretch of hotels on the street a row of neon  Found it nice to breeze through  A lot of people complained that it was dirty  It was a bit but the energy was generally good  Some stores nearby were grand too  There was a ket nearby where there was a random security entrance unplugged and planked in the middle of the road  Strange looking thing Restaurant on the ground floor was another surprise  They had a nice buffet and I liked the way they kind of replaced rice with porridge flakes in a curried pea dish  Very subtle and tasty  The evening meal was also nice  Actually had a pizza here that was a delight  Chai was lovely  It appeared to do a good trade too which was encouraging Each floor had a hall monitor type guy who ran to you when you moved  This was helpful but a bit crowding  The staff were fine but there was a lot of drama and theater with receipts and everything really  You stood there as they started to lose their heads over a simple request you made  Sometimes they just chased you shouting questions  They were good natured for the most part though I can see why some people were a bit wary of the travel agency  We got the pitch there well actually we didnt  They bring you in and make a fuss of you and then get mad as hell when you dont want their services even though youre upfront from the start  This is a bit of a turn off  Some prices quoted to us seemed to be really excessive based on us looking them up afterwards  But we didnt book anything so we have no need to complain about being burned  Be a bit careful with this one though Also when you get there shop around the rooms because the condition varies wildly  We visited a person we had met in Jaipur in their back room and it was something else  There was a full scale construction thing going on outside and Im not talking that the noise was near  The construction was right there  If you put your hand out the window you could have gotten your hand crushed by some kinda hydrolic shaft thing  There was a backdoor to the room that was not the most secure thing  Therefore be very careful in choosing wisely  The computer room was great and fast  The taxi service as good  We got a good price to the airport compared to the fleecing we had gotten from someone else in another direction Thanks to Lonely Planet washing their hands of the hotels and inns in Delhi in general our expecations were low and we found that this place was fine really  The staff were a bit hyperactive but if you insist on picking a good room its a good choice really  
N => Over priced We stayed here for  nights in ember  We arrived late and had arranged an airport pick up but once we arrived at the hotel desperate for some sleep we were left in one of the side rooms while the check in staff stood around and talked we were then given a talk about the services offered by the hotel when we lined we were finally shown to our rooms The room was clean and functionaly though there was erratic hot water in the bathroom The staff were of limited help and seemed more interested in offering paid services rather than giving helpful advice They also have a member of staff on each floor who each time you go back tries to escort you to your room and expects a tip   we ended up trying to tip toe back to our room to avoid thisDont use the pre paid taxi booth in the reception   this is vastly over pricved go outside and get an autrickshaw the pre pay booth charged us  ruppees to the train station the autorickshaw was  and its only a  min walk awayOne very positive point is the roof top restaurant  The food was fantastic the staff friendly and very helpful and the value was tremendous Overall there are many better and substantially cheaper places in Delhi 
N => Not a good choice We stayed in Ata with my s o  in the beginning of ember    We definetly are not picky but this time the hotel really managed to disapoint us We arrived late at night and were given a small room with no windows and two beds instead of double bed   not what we had ordered and paid beforehand and definetly not what we had seen in the pictures on hotels website  After a moan we were given a new room which did have a double bed but where there was only boiling hot water in the shower and where the toilet didnt flush  We complained again and were given the first small and dirty room again for there were no other rooms available  Next day we moved again this time to another room with a double bed  There were windows   which gave to the hallway The personell started to work there every morning at   and as they were very loud and the walls did not stop the sound at all we simply could not sleep  The bathroom was uncomfortable and infested by insects Our room was cleaned only after I asked for it for the second time  Not one of the rooms had sheets until we asked the personell to bring them  This repeated every day  All the towels were dirty   really all of them also after we had asked for new ones The personell didnt seem to care about us   they didnt for excample apologise once during the late night when we moved from one room to another and back again  It seems they simply dont have to do that   they had the hotel booked full anyway  Something positive My mother who stayed in Ata couple of days before us was treated ently and transferred to an ok room but only after two days of hardcore tipping The location was ok Sumy unclean noisy hotel where we felt ourselves not wanted  Could serve as a one star  hostel but definetly not worth the price  
N => Vey disappointing My partner and I stayed here for  and  nights in t  at the start and end of our holiday having booked via Hotel Club in e Although we had paid for a superior twin initially we were assigned a tiny room with no windows  After a moan we were given a better room with a shared balcony The lavatory would not flush and despite many requests to get it fixed nothing happened and for two days we were obliged to flush it using buckets filled in the bath  The bathroom had a wooden louvered window which could not be closed  Overnight the bathroom was infested by insects which totally covered every horizontal surface The air conditioner tripped about every couple of hours and each time we had to seek out someone to reset the trip  This was a common problem with all three of the rooms we had After a further round of complaints we were moved to another room where at least the lavatory worked We did not receive the  hard sell  from the Travel Office and in general the staff were friendly but just hopeless  We witnessed several disputes at Reception one so severe that we were moved to an office to complete our check in  The Buffet breakfast in the dinning room was stone cold even at   Ignore the lovely pics of the roof top restaurant it is a tip and apparently used for storing k  There is however a sign stating that you can have a coke and a pizza for about a quid On the whole very disappointing and by far the worst hotel we stayed at during out two week visit and by no means the least expensive I believe that  The Rough Guide  should review their recommendation which is prominently displayed all over the Hotel  
N => Skip the in house travel agent Good room but wasnt fully clean when we arrived  Short walk to New Dehli railway station  minutes but a fair step to Connht Place  minutes  Reasonably priced restaurant with good food  Reliable internet and phone service  Only real downside was the pushy guy in the travel agent who offered us a vastly overpriced trip and then became unhelpful once we said no  
N => Avoid in Summer On arrival everything seemed ok but on entry to the rooms they seemed to be falling apart  We stayed for  nights not all consecutively and eventually hadto change because of the poor quality  If you pay budget you get budget  Our stay was in e when the weather is hot  The ac cuts out everyday between pm and pm  The rooms have fridges which seem to be ornamental they didnt fucntion The lift did not work alot of the time  Location is right in the centre with all the hustle and bustle so do not expect peace  Restaurant Service extremely slow  It took the waiters around  minutes just to give us the bill Each floor has a itor they were the only pleasant things about our stay at the hotel  Very hard working and will attend to all your requests apart from gettin the ac working  When we made our complaints no discounts were given instead a deluxe room was offered at the same price which had exactly the same facilites as the standard rooms including a non functioning fridge and non functioning air con  
N => Noisy Poor Service Avoid it very noisy could not sleep at all ordered eggs came with shells just avoid this hotel and as always look at the room before you buy  
N => Stay clear of these con artists Stay clear of these con artistsDo not make the mistake I did and stay in this hotel only because it has a website  Theres far better options out there  This is how they operate  You book online thinking that this will be a great place to stay after seeing the pictures on their website  When you get there youre not allowed to have a look at the room before but you have to sit down and talk to the incredibly pushy sales woman whos trying to sell you one of their tours  You have to be really firm here as she will not give up very easily  We were not interested at all in any of there tours as wed come to India for a friends wedding and to see India on our own in our own time  She stopped smiling when she found out that we werent interested  She took us out to the reception and said something in hindi to the receptionist sounding very annoyed  Probably because she didnt get us into booking a tour  Before leaving UK we had booked the second most expensive room at hotel Ata thinking this would be one of the nicer room among their pictures on their website  However as we didnt buy a tour they weret interested in giving us a nice room or providing us with good customer service  They claimed that the dirty room we were given was the room we had paid for  So if you intend to buy a tour with these guys then you might find this hotel ok but still overpriced as they will give you the better room and suck up to you  But if youre no interested in tours   STAY CLEAR OF THIS DUMP  I discovered a great place on my second trip to Delhi  It came recomended from other travelers I met  Its called quotCottage Yes Pleasequot and is located in the same area as Hotel Aata  Its very close to the cinema  We got a spotless room for  R  
N => Nothing special but not expensive First I really appreciated the free airport pickup Second the neighborhood leaves much to be desired  Granted we were leaving from the nearby New Delhi train station the next day so it was all we needed  Still not a place Id love to spend time in The rooms were OK especially given the price  I too was put off by the touting of tours    especially during my phone call from the U S  to book the room 
N => Rude Management I had booked six rooms for myself amp my colleages  On arrival at the hotel they didnt have the right rooms as we booked for and one of the room was not available for my friend  We had asked to see the ownermanager Mr Arya  When we confronted Mr Arya he just ignored us amp didnt even bother to solve the problem of accomodating us  I think in view of attracting foreign customers through their joint travel agency service the whole management of this hotel is terrible  The hotel is overpriced for the service it gives  Better off getting hotels GodwinCrystalYuvraj etcnearby with better service amp cheaper  
N => Can Not Trust The hotel staff taking my reservation on the phone was rude and sounding as if doing me a favour ok I can understand that a low grade hotel cannot afford to hire polite staff  So far so good  Then he wanted to charge to me for my airport pickup request their website says its free so I lined the pickup  Inspite of offering my credit card details to confirm the reservation he said will hold my reservation without the card details  I informed that I will check in after midnite Upon reaching the hotel I found the same staff who took my reservation on phone  First he lined he had any reservation in my name  When I insisted on seeing the reservation register and found my name in it he gave the following assorted reasons for not having a room for me  You arrived late   Your reservation is for the following day not today   You didnt use our airport pickup  You didnt provide us with your card details   You didnt email to confirm the reservation He offered to put me up in his friends hotel next door a shabby room at exorbitant price for the night and move me into his property the following morning  As it was midnite I reluctantly agreed  The next day he flatly refused to check me in at his property  I noticed that other guests at the hotel reception area were being treated extremely well and offered rooms  I was not because  I am not white skin  I dont hold an American or European passport  I was not going pay in dollars but in Indian rupees Reserve your stay here at your own risk Ku  
N => ottimo il prezzo    ma non del tutto confortevole  
N => Horrible ni se os ocurra  
N => Dont bother We paid for the best room    The electricity was constantly going off for long periods  OK this  be part of the Indian way but why advertise it as  electricity  Even when the electricity was on the shower NEVER worked   not good for the price of the roomit was dirty and grubbyThe staff were unfriendly and rude The only ent person there was in the roof top restaurant   he was a really nice chapDont go there   spend your money elsewhere 
N => Terrible Terrible Terrible We had made a reservation via e mail based on recommendations in a guide book  Our reservation and price were confirmed as were our travel arrangements  However when we arrived after an overnight train we were told the only room available was double the price we agreed  The staff were rude aggressive totally unwilling to explain to us why the reservation had not been held  They accused us of not having made a reservation and then when we could prove we had they then told us we were too late arriving  mins after our train was due to arrive at a station  mins away even though they had our train details  The room we were offered did appear clean however it was the appalling manner in which we were treated which left a lasting impression  If you are staying here confirm re confirm print your e mails from them and have a back up plan  
N => Horrible place to stay This was my first visit to Delhi and I have to say i was really horrified by this guesthouse  Id already been travelling for  months and i dont think my standards are particularly high  It put the grubbiest of my student flats to shame I arrived at about am so was tired after a long flight and was picked uparrnaged through guesthouse in a small van which didnt start we had to get pushed several times by strangers in the street The room i got was tiny like a prison cell  The white walls were covered in dirty grimy ks and dead insect stains The bed was old and though i think the sheets were relatively clean the place had a grimy dirty feel to it  The bathroom was disgusting old falling apart and felt dirty  I also had the nasty experience of someone waking me up at about am the next night knocking on my door  I said hello a few times but no one answered me and i could hear feet shuffling outside I didnt open the door as im a lone female traveller but it made me very scarred  Thankfully i had bolted the door  Needless to say i left after one night  
N => Who likes sticky beds It  be recommended by many guide books but frankly speeking I found the Ajay Guest House in Pahar Ganj the Main Bazaar really horrible  Our room was dirty the bed was sticky   I dont know whether the bedlinnen was cleaned at all but they should definitely changer their washing powder if yes  Staff wasnt helpful either and they overcharged on the airport pick up  Rs instead of  Rs at the prepaid booth  It might be cheap for Delhi ca  Rs for a double room but in my opinion its not worth even that  There are better places at the same rate around Ajay Guest House Delhi India Paharganj  Main Bazaar T l      Email      
N => A real treasure   what a wonderful introduction to Delhi While my partner had travelled to India many time on business it was my first time  The Aya Gardens was such a wonderful way to ease myself into India   spacious room beautifully orated very clean with incredible service  Staff very friendly and owner gave us great advice on how to approach Delhi and our days there Go to Karims restaurant   I still dream of the food there  Breakfast was fabulous very fresh and delicious  The building itself was unique and the garden a welcome respite from our sightseeing  We loved it   would definitely go back  
N => The worst ever Poor hotel which needs an urgent reation  Baware that quotbalconyquot does not mean quotnice viewquot  My room was in front of the Air Con system of the hotel ugly view but also extremly noisy nights and days But the WORST     If you like to be bothered during your night by MOUSES running into the air conditionning system of your room then youll be delighted I mention MOUSES because Ive SEEN them into the grill of my Air Con in my room      Insane 
N => Good spacious rooms Huge rooms and bathrooms  Taj service as usual impeccable  Dont expect great views from your balcony  Nearby metro construction can be noisy sometimes  Has a great Non Veg Thali in room service menu 
N => Great Place Excellent place to stay  i would defintely like to be there again 
N => Ambassador was pretty good The Ambassador hotel is a clean western style hotel that made a good base for us for our first few days in India  The rest of the trip we stayed in much less posh hotels but this was a comforting place to first land  It looks like your average American  star hotel  What made it great for us was that the staff was extremely helpful the driver they provided was really great and they went out of our way to help us navigate Delhi and arrange the rest of our trip  Id recommend this to people looking to ease into India  
N => Very conveniently located I spent a most enjoyable   days at the Ambassador just before Christmas  The location was perfect for the places I wanted to visit and when the metro subway station that is being constructed next door is completed in a couple of years this will become one of the most conveniently located hotels in the city As at other hotels in the city in response to the recent terrorist attack in Mumbai security measures were taken quite seriously  All vehicles were searched before being allowed to enter the grounds and visitors and guests were required to pass through metal detectors in addition to being physically searched and having any packages scanned for suspicious contents  In fact there was a veritable army of security personnel on hand at the gates and the entrance I saw more staff there than anywhere else in the entire hotel As noted in other reviews this is not one of the premier Taj properties  If you are looking for glitz and glitter or are booking a room for your honeymoon youll do far better to look at the sister Taj down the road  But if you are just looking for a safe clean and comfortable place to lie down at night you should consider the Ambassador if you can get it at a reasonable price I had searched for a room on kayak com which led me to a discount hotel room broker where I was able to book a room for Rs   per night before taxes about US   Note that as at other hotels the taxes substantially increase the total cost  Right before booking through the internet I had called the hotel to inquire as to the lowest rate available and was quoted approximately Rs      so check for internet discounts before you bookWireless internet access cost an additional fee    about Rs   per  hours  I had no problems at all getting a strong signal from my room  But internet access in a business hotel in this day and age really should be included in the price of the room At check in I requested a quiet room to avoid any noise from the metro station construction and I was given a room in one of the triangular hotels wings that faces away from the construction site  The room had a balcony that let in a lot of light but overlooked a rather unattractive inner court  I wasnt disturbed by any noise from the metro construction site during my stay but then I really didnt hear much noise coming from the site as I walked right by it several times over the course of my stay  On the other hand I could clearly hear the voices of people in the hallway from my room  And there were occasional tolerable noises from reations that were apparently underwear elsewhere in the hotel The room was immaculate and very comfortable although the mattress was quite firm  There were faint traces of unpleasant odors in the hall outside my room I think from painting or other reation work and from the airconditioner in the room mouldy smell but the temperature was such that it wasnt really necessary to turn on the aircon since there was also a fan in the room All of the staff with whom I interacted from check in to housekeeping to laundry staff were gracious and friendly  And I might add astonishingly attractive The fitness center was pretty rudimentary    a couple of treadmills a couple of other cardio machines and some free weights  The pool is under reation but a car was offered to transport guests to the sister property down the road if a dip in the pool was desired I very much appreciated that when I asked the staff the typical cost for a taxi to the airport I was told that a hotel car was available I think the fee was Rs   plus tax but that an alternative was a black and yellow taxi for Rs   which is what I took after having to wait only a couple of minutes for the taxi to drive over  Certain other hotels would not have mentioned that the lower cost option was available My only complaint apparently arose from a misunderstanding at checkout  I had planned to pay for a  night stay intending to check out on the third evening to catch an pm flight  As I was checking out the clerk noted that the terms for the discounted rate of my room prohibited any modifications to the scheduled stay  He said that since I was checking out quotearlyquot  pm on the third night rather than before noon the following morning I would be charged a full night as a cancellation penalty  We got into an argument over whether or not this was a cancellation  In retrospect I think he must have mistakenly thought I was trying to get the hotel to allow me to just pay for  nights and be allowed to check out very late on the third day either that or he was just clueless Overall I would recommend a stay here if you can get a room under US  per night be even  if its high season and the supply of rooms in hotels of this caliber around the city are tight  I cant see paying anything like  such as mentioned in other reviews  
N => Beware Construction Site night time work We arrived at The Ambassador on ober th and checked in at around pm from the airport and were quotupgradedquot to a room which overlooked the construction site working thru the entire night Even with earplugs I could hear it Trying not to be rude or impolite I tried to deal with it but at am I had to go downstairs to complain    the front desk person said that the hotel was completely booked    they had a sign up apologizing for the noise     if I had come down sooner she would have switched the room it was fully booked she just said offered to let me sleep for a few hours in a room that someone just checked out of I had to wait until Mr Vishal Sekhri arrived to resolve it  We were checking out at  am he offered me   rate reduction and a snack for the road trip to Agra  Total charge for the room   USD after the discount  He also said that had I notified them earlier that he could possibly have worked something out with the other Taj Hotel in Delhi and moved us to the other hotel  We paid for our own breakfasts  He promised that he would contact the Taj View Agra to make sure that we had a nice stay    We arrived in Agra and the hotel is no longer the Taj View     its called The Gateway and is no longer part of the chain  Im warning people not to stay there if they are offered a room on the construction side of the hotel    It was TOTALLY NOT FAIR     not give us an option or tell us personally when we checked in  WHY would anyone quotUPGRADEquot a guest to a room which is affected by the construction noise that goes on all night they should have told us personally when we checked in and NOT assumed that we read the sign about the construction noise    we didnt   It is so disrespectful and unfair to try to make people pay for that kind of room with out giving them an option  My niece stayed in an interior room and didnt hear the heavy machinery  her stay was fine  aesthetically nice hotel    Im sure it would have been great if we werent affected by the construction noise    please ask not to be placed in a room on that side or beware    for now  
N => Pretty bulk standard hotel Not a bad hotel   we had just finished a  hour train trip and were pretty exhausted so the comfy bed was much appreciated   but its quite old looking and very expensive for what it is  The Sheraton was full which was how we ended here but that is a much nicer and cheaper place  Its comfy but at   a night you dont really get your monies worth  We were only there for a few hours though so did not get to sample anything much except the bed Also beware the front desk will try to charge you in sterling thereby giving you their exchange rate which like all hotels rates is lower than you will get from you credit card company  
N => A First Rate Hotel We stayed at the Ambassador Hotel New Delhi from the rd   th y   Our party consisted of two adults and two young children  We were en route from Calcutta to Trivandrum using Rajdhani Express rail services Our suite at the Ambassador was absolutely huge clean and well maintained  We found staff at this property to be efficient and eager to please  Once settled in we went to their small swimming pool accessed by walking through the  Yellow Brick Road  coffee shop on the ground floor  We were there for around a couple of hours and the kids had a bite to eat whilst the adults read the newspapers and magazines poolside I was feeling a bit under the weather which had nothing whatsoever to do with the hotel  I ended up going to bed for the rest of the day  Staff offered to get a Dor which I lined  They came round with a number of bottles of mineral water at no extra cost which I thought was a nice gesture  I had no dinner however the other family members did eat downstairs  They thought the food was fine  In their absence I was able to connect to the hotel s Wi Fi network Breakfast at the Yellow Brick Road caf  was actually very good  Chicken sausages beans hash browns cold meat fruit cereals local food croissants eggs fried scrambled boiled or omelettes etc  Even though it was a buffet staff were very helpful and brought tea coffee and hot chocolate for the children  They also organised the omelettes and fried eggs  No matter was too much for them  The Taj Group clearly train their staff well  
N => Good choice next to Khan ket Stayed  nights in e and enjoyed the stay very much  The room  was huge with slightly old interior but very clean and the bathroom was excellent with quality toiletries loved the lemon soap  Not necessarily a  star establishment but the price was right and the proximity to Khan ket was a great bonus in the summer heat  
N => Comfortable but problems at the front desk The facilities and rooms at the Ambassador are good  Nothing over the top luxurious but definitely comfortable  My room was a suite  It was usually well cleaned except for one day in my week long stay they did not replace the flower in the bud vase or the towels  I of course didnt care about the flower but had to call for towels to take a shower  Overall though the room was clean quiet and spacious  The hotel felt safe The room had a lot of extra amenities minibar bandaids robe slippers shoe wax toothbrush toothpaste etc   Room service was excellent as was the breakfast provided with the room price Wireless was available but for a considerable cost  I think that a hotel that kets itself as a quotbusiness hotelquot should have free wireless  I had a snafu with booking that took several trips to the front desk to be fixed  The people at the front desk were friendly but quite unhelpful with trying to resolve this issue  
N => Way overpriced money games at check out  Towels from old Motel   
N => Shabby but Comfortable  
N => ThisHotelCannotBeTrusted We reserved two rooms at Hotel Ananda a month in advance We exchanged some emails including their confirmation email our flight information email and a reconfirmation email that we sent two days prior to our arrival date Things went smoothly UNTIL the night we arrived at Delhi airport We finally got to Delhi filled with excitement and anxiety from our long flight    only to find out that we no longer had our reservation for the night Needless to say there was nobody from the hotel at the airport although the hotel had guaranteed that they would send somebody for us The hotels excuse was that all their rooms were sold out the night  and that we were going to be taken to another quotupgradedquot hotel We had no choice but to wait for another driver to come pick us up at the airport for a long while just to go with a random driver who claimed to be sent by Hotel Ananda and let him drive us to a hotel somewhere in New Delhi that we had no idea about We do not know whether our alternative hotel was actually an quotupgradequot since we had no chance to go see Hotel Ananda to compare them during our stay in Delhi  
N => ONE TO AVOID What a terrible hotel There is nothing I can say good about this hotel  My family and myself reached at this hotel at  am  Having travelled for a long time we just wanted to sleep  At the reception they were fine  They told us the basic information we needed to know and led us to the room  When we opened the room door we were in a great shock  The room stunk of damp and the walls and ceiling was covered with moulds  My husband went down and told the reception if we could change the room because it really stunk  But they told him to adjust the night and that they will sort another room the next day  We was so tired to argue so we thought ok it is another couple of hours so we can adjust by leaving the windows open and go to sleep  My dhter wanted to sleep  So I opened the blanket and was horrified to see bed bugs crawling everywhere  I had goose bumps as soon as I saw them  That was the last thing we wanted to see  We packed everything and went downstairs and told them we were going to leave because there were bed bugs  They apologised immediately and didn t want to leave us instead they gave another room  why did they not do that in the first place  We had no choice but to change the room because the place was new don t know anybody and don t no where to get help and it seemed a risk travelling at night with a young child so we agreed to change to a better room  The second room was fine we asked them to change the bed sheets in front of us and so they did  The  roof top restaurant  is a dump  I really don t know why they call it a roof top restaurant  It wasn t clean the table and chairs were filthy and they really really need to do something about it  We just stayed there for  nights and couldn t wait to leave only if we knew the place well we would have moved immediately we was like a person blindfolded in the middle of nowhere  Although the staffs understood the mistakes apologised and tried to help we felt unhappy of the whole experience  
N => Bad Experience with seepage rooms I must admit that I had a bad bad experience during my leisure time here  The hotel was undergoing some reation and I really had to spends my nights in the seepage rooms I would not recommend this hotel to any traveler   
N => Basic hotel unhealthy kitchen  Having read positive reviews on tripadvisor we ided to stay here before traveling around north India  I really can understand why this hotel has been rated so highly on this site  It was one of the worst hotels we stayed at over three weeks  The staff were grumpy slow and not very helpful  The room was a reasonable size but basic and not particularly clean  The bathroom was grim and the shower cold  The roof top restaurant was a converted flat roof with a staff member p ssing in the corner  
N => a nice retreat from chaotic delhi I was picked up as promised and the driver waited even tho I forgot to give my flight number ooops  The hotel location was very good and the hotel itself was a break from the chaotic streets  The hotel was very clean and the service was excellent with a good rooftop resteraunt to relax in  
N => Friendly and simple Was greeted by their friendly driver as promised at the International airport free Not long after I had arrived I was asked by the helpful staff namely Shabir if I wanted to go sight seeing    this didnt take much convincing  I was whisked away not long after by their driver singing and dancing my way around New Delhi    it was a lot of fun and he was great companyThe room was spacious with two singles  Funky or and a flat screen plasma  The air conditioner was noisy however it worked a treated at helping me escape the heat of Delhi Unfortunately there was NO hot water    this was disappointing I was told later that the boiler was broken and has since been repaired The roof top restaurant is a great place to see a completely different aspect of New Delhi  The beers were cold not something you can often rely upon and the food was delicious Sharbir front of house was great company very professional and assisted me with organising my onward adventures  
N => excellent value hotel  safe comfortable friendly  would stay there again This was my first trip to India and I went with my sister  Were both young finished university but still on a budget  We stayed at  different hotels throughout India during our two weeks there and we both felt this was by far the best  Of course its not a  star hotel but it was clean and comfortable and we felt that we were well taken care of  I found my bed there to be the most comfortable of any hotel bed I slept in in India  The manager Somu was genuinely friendly and gave us little quotfreebiesquot here and there internet access some complimentary pineapple juice extra toilet paper helped me to not get ripped off by the international phone quotservicequot around the corner which they didnt have to do  The first night I didnt realize how to turn on the hot water but I called the front desk and they immediately sent someone up to show me how  I dont remember the towels as others have commented but I usually bring my own towel when I travel anyway  Our experience at other hotels even more expensive ones was that every little thing cost extra  At Hotel Ananda we were never asked for so much as a single rupee extra At the end of our trip we ided to stay there again because we had enjoyed such a pleasant stay the first time  Im so glad we did  Apparently we stayed when it was quotwedding seasonquot and there was a noisy wedding parade outside the hotel  Later I went back inside and reked how interesting it was and the hotel manager said he was off to a friends wedding and invited me to come along  At first I was a little hesitant being a young woman headed off at  pm to who knows where but Im so glad I went  It was really the highlight of my trip  I was the only foreigner there at the wedding and it was truly incredible  Even though no one knew me I was treated like a welcomed guest invited to join in the festivities and to eat and drink with everyone else there Obviously not everyone will have the same experience but I found that for a traveller on a budget its just as good as many other hotels that cost more  I was quite satisfied with the comfort and cleanliness of the accomodations and I could not have asked for friendlier more helpful staff  
N => Good service clean rooms excellent food  We stayed here for four pleasant nights  They picked us up at the airport in the evening as requested an got us safely through the delhi night to the hotel  When we arrived everything went smoothly   the first room we got was a bit mouldy so we requested to change no problem We got a room facing the street and it was nice and quiet during the night  The room itself was clean and nice excellent bathroom the ac  worked perfect  We felt completely safe there too The restaurant at the roof served excellent food I would recommend the ginger chicken a nice place to have dinner in the evening  The service was very good especially the room service guys When we left they got us a cab to the trains station and everything went fine got on our train as planned  I would recommend this place as a good alternative for a quick stay in Delhi  
N => Good clean budget hotel We arrived from Jodhpur early in the morning taxi waiting as promised when we arrived we couldnt check in until  however a room was found for us to freshen up we werent impressed with this room as it had a view overlooking a brick wall and a very garish bathroom  The room that we were given was fine clean bathroom very spacious and the furniture in the room very good quality beds were comfy also   Yes the towels were on the grey side but if you want white fluffy towels book a  star hotel At the time of our stay the hotel was undergoing reation which made negotiating the reception area a bit tricky but this was nearly finished when we left  The hotel restaurant was closed so meals had to be taken in the room due to reations and torrential rain only ate breakfast but had no problems  No hidden room charges rate quoted was what we paid taxi to the airport arranged no problems with that free wi fi all in all a good budget hotel with easy access to Delhi   
N => Excellent Hotel Not being sure what to expect as it was out first time in delhi we were pleasently surprised by both the hotel and the service  After being ripped off by people pretending to be the offical tourist office the staff went out of their way to make sure we got a refund  The manager himself spending all day in talks with the police until we finally got a full refund  Excellent staff and clean spacious rooms  
N => OK hotel not so OK service I stayed just a night before catching an early morning flight  Staying at Ananda was fine the rooms and hotel are clean way above average in India  They were rebuilding the reception area so the lift wasnt working  I was given the promised rate confirmed on the phone so no issues with extra taxes and charges However I encountered a lot of problems with extra services I requested   I asked them to book me a cab for a day and they tried charging me  Rs above the going rate  I neogitated it down with them and thought I was fine  However the driver was rather nasty always trying to make an extra buck trying to ask me for parking money at a lot with quotfree parkingquot sign  This kept going the whole day until I told him that unless he stops it I will simply get out of the car and not pay him  Again this wasnt really Anandas fault but wel they are responsible for choosing their partners and ensuring they stick to an acceptable standard nd thing that was totally annoying was when I asked them about a taxi to the airport They tried to offer me their taxi service but I lined and clearly stated that I want a standard pay as you go cab  I thought everything was ok until I walk outside the door at  AM in te morning and realize they called their own cab and want to charge me their inflated price  I almost lost it there   I asked them to call a normal cab which they said they did but the other cab was still waiting there probably thinking I am so pressed for time that I will just jump in and swallow the cost  After a bit of waiting I got annoyed at them and just hailed he first autorickshaw I saw  The price was about th of what they were offering me  Normal cab would be around half  They obviously werent that interested to satisfy me as a guest and just wanted to make extra money out of me I would probably stay here again if I was in Delhi for a day or so but certainly not for much longer  
N => very bad hotel my personal experience in this hotel was bad  hotel was dirty and staff was bad and greedy always making extra money from tourist by  charging so many hidden and not mentioned taxes I truly never recommend to any tourist 
N => Good home base We stayed here for  nights upon arrival in India  We had a comfortoble room with spacious bathroom  Everything was very clean and functioning properly  the staff immediatly put up two extra matresses for our small childeren  Room service catering was very quick the food was tasty plenty and not expensive to Delhi standards  The owner of this hotel was very helpfull working out our travelplan and transportissues  In all a very good home base for travels in Northern India  
N => Characterless The Ashok is reasonably close to the airport  Getting there is rather odd you have to drive down a dirt track and the hotel is at the end   we were in transit so it didnt matter much but you wouldnt want to stay there if you were on a trip to see the sights of Delhi  The hotel and rooms although large are characterless  Service in the restaurant was OK as was the food  When we arrived at midnight we were unable to get a beer   bar closed and no beers in the mini bar Reception did however find us a couple of beers which were delivered to our room  
N => away from the bustle of delhi useful stopover if visiting Delhi  good pool and excellent food  road works when i was there so getting to and from was a bit of a problem but was over come  taxi ride away from nightlife in delhi 
N => Much nicer than an airport hotel We stayed on our first and last nights in India it was our airport hotel  There was no queue at check in and our room was super with a very st ble bathroom  There was also a nice garden for a late night jet lagged stroll  We found the restaurant to be quite convenient when the buffet is on thats what you have to have   otherwise you choose from a menu  There is food available late from a reduced menu  The food was nice with Indian and Western choices  We also enjoyed the breakfast with plenty of choice available  The gift shop was small but pleasant although they did try to sell us an elephant with its tusks missing  
N => Very Good Hotel Really a good hotel  Foodservices room ambience everthing was really great  Not very close to town but good place to stay  
N => Very Average Stayed  night at the beginning and  night at the end of the Kuoni Taj Tour  Was nice and close to the airport so the trip to and from was very easy  The hotel seemed adequate for our hectic schedule as there was very little leisure time  The rooms on the ground floor are not as nice as the rooms on the nd floor as we discovered on our return visit  Grounds and pool seem nice but didnt have the time to explore that much  The food was reasonable for both dinner and breakfast  The porters were very helpful in carrying and collecting baggage however I have a feeling this was due to the group being Kuoni and not standard practise for the hotel  Changing money was a nighte  They have to get authorisation for Travellers Cheques from a bank before they will change the money which obviously can take time  Also they never seemed to actually have money at reception we were told come back in half an hour      which with a busy schedule was not ideal 
N => the last place to stay in delhi i was supposed to stay for  nights but ran after  could not take it anymore  The worst rooms i have ever stayed in  ive even stayed in motels with better service and rooms  The only thing good was some of the foods served in the restaurant  
N => a shocking experience We were arriving late from Bangkok with my girlfriend and on our way to Agra so we thought well stay near by the airports  I thought to stay in a nice hotel not having huge expectations but for this price at least expect to get a ent room   well not even close of it The welcome at the airport was weird we had to look for the hotel driver in the line of all the other hotels driver at the exit gate for  minutes before the guy showed up then it complain to us about the delay in addition of being plain rude   The room was horrible look  years old not even a proper mattress on the bed the bed sheets and towels were  years old   We ordered some room service at  am big mistake it took  hour for a club sandwich to arrive and it look like they went to buy it in a small food stall on the road side   When we checked out we where not asked how was our stay or gave any comment card or else meaning that they dont care what you think just show the money and after you pay not even a thank you for staying there or else We then jumped in the car back to the airport after that I charged the luggages in the trunk myself as the concierge didnt even move off the door to help or propose is help I was happy to be out of this crappy place they have no clue of how to run their business and obviously what hotel business is all about  
N => nice pool and grounds We stayed at the Ashok as part of a tour  We found this Hotel good as part of the tour but for independant travellers would probably be too far out of town No where to eat but at the Hotel   evening meal was ok for one or two nights and we found the breakfast very good Our room was quite nice but some rooms are probably a little noisy as this Hotel is on the main road  There was a kettle in the room The pool area and grounds are very nice not as posh as some of the Hotels in town but we found this place ok and would not hesitate to stay here again  
N => Not worth paying We booked our stay for only one night in this hotel  We reserved a pick up service and upon arrival at the airport we didnt see any one so we called at the hotel  The hotel driver said he was there waiting for us but we told him that didnt see anyone so the driver was upset and complaint and try to have an argument with us  He push us to talk to the hotel just to tell the hotel that he didnt lie  How strange  The hotel looks quite old and the room we got was not very clean  For the price we paid we could see at the beginning that it was way too expensive  The room was not very clean and look quite old  Even their towels are so old  For paying more than USD it does not worthDo not order anything from Room Service half of the menu are not available and it took about an hour to deliver  We order one sandwich and one simply pakora which is very easy to made they deliver the first one after half an hour and sandwich was delivered after another more than  mins and the taste was quite bad too  Breakfast was quite bad too and even the check out staff keep asking us where we are going then other questions which they suppose to communicate but at the end they keep asking the same thing until we left Overall we are quite disappointed for choosing this hotel the price they charge is really too expensive than the service and the quality they offerred TRULY  
N => No Hot Water   Evasive Manager We booked this hotel as it was near the airport and was supposedly a very high standard  We checked in at lunchtime and the manager greeted us an said quotany problems come and see mequot  They then charged the full amount of our stay on our credit card   very suspicious There was no hot water in the room   asked at reception   told to wait a bit an it would be fixed  An hour later still no hot water   call manager who on arriving at our room tried to maintain the water was hot He then suggested a different room but again the water was cold  I eventually lost my temper and called another hotel the Raddison to stay there  It then took me  minutes of very vocal complaining in reception to get my money back On leaving the hotel the porter told me the boiler had ben giving trouble for several weeks  If a hotel has a problem I expect them to be honest with their guests  
N => Avoid at all cost This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at  I had booked the room several months prior to the stay and had email confirmation of the exact cost  When checking in they tried to charge us  more for the room until I showed them my email  Next the bathroom had a strong smell of urine the room smelled of mold and the air conditioner made the smell even worse  The mattress was about quot thick  I have had more comfort camping in a sleeping bag  This hotel  be convenient due to its close proximity to the Delhi international airport but I recommend avoiding it at all cost  It is simply not worth it  
N => Nice quiet hotel not far from Delhi airport This was the nicest of the  hotels we stayed in on our tour of India  It had a lovely pool area and a nice restaurant it was upstairs and no lift but that was the only problem for one of our party who is less mobile  The owner of the hotel was in attendance and keen to speak to all the guests and made sure everything was up to standard  
N => Fine brief stay We had a very brief stay at the hotel but it was fine  We arrived around ten in the evening and they had the correct rooms twin beds non smoking ready  Everything in the room worked fine  We left for an all day trip to Agra at am the next day and breakfast doesnt start until  but they let us have tea and toast before we left which was nice of them  We used the half day rate that day and it was great to come back from the long trip to Agra and shower and change before our flight to the US  The long problem we had was the car they sent to the airport to pick us up was designed for two people and little luggage  There were four of us and a lot of luggage Instead of waiting for another vehicle my husband crammed it all in and we sat on each others laps  Fortunately it is a ten minute ride to the hotel from the airport I dont know whose mistake it was but on the return journey we had a much larger vehicle  
N => The worst hotel we stayed at in  weeks in India On a recent trip to India we stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for our final night before flying home to the UK  During our  week trip to Inida we stayed in a variety of accommodation from  star hotels to simple hostels and this hotel was by far the worst place we stayed in  The service from the reception was nothing short of rude and the prices for drinks and food within the hotel were  star hotel prices had this been a five star hotel with five star food it might have been reasonable Whilst on the subject of prices this brings us to the outragious prices they charged for an airport transfer  Earlier in our trip in Delhi we were able to hire an air conditioned taxi for a whole day for the price this hotel charged for a  minute ride to the airport knowing that being on a busy main road there is little to no chance of customers being able to get a taxi from elsewhere  Together with a dark and dismal room with terribly uncomfortable beds this was a very disappoining end to an otherwise fantastic trip to India 
N => Good value stay in Delhi We used the Ashok for a first night in India and were very satisfied  The pickup from the airport worked well and the hotel was comfortable and clean with a good pool where we got over any jet lag  It is not a   but then you are not paying   prices and it seems to be good value for Delhi  
N => Clean  Fairly quiet location just on the fringe of the city stunning gardens with a clean pool amp loud peacock  I found the Reception staff to be aloof and not very welcoming esp  as we were there on the first night of our tour and had to rely on them to exchange to our first rupees  The room was fine with clean crisp bedding and a descent size though the view was of a wall amp the window didnt quiet fit the frame but due to the nets and curtains we didnt have any flying visitors  As we also spent our last night in India there so we enjoyed a banana split while we sat under the sun by the pool  highly recommend  
N => Average hotel When we arrived in Dehli we went straight to the hotel  The room was cold and the bed damp we had to request an additional heater in our room Breakfast the following morning was okay  The staff were helpful and polite  This is an average tourist hotel  Good value for money  
N => Good place to sleep after your flight This is a good place to sleep after a long flight  The rooms were clean and quiet bathroom clean and adequate  Good varied buffet breakfast  Lovely gardens and the pool looked nice though it was too cool to try it in ember  Staff were pleasant and helpful  I wish I had been able to have a massage in their health centre but they were booked solid  
N => Nice overnight stay After checking lots of reviews we ided to stay in the Ashok The comment about the dew smell is correct but I think it is not only the rooms which cannot be opened and are only airconditioned but also the smell outside was damp  There was a huge cloud over Delhi and no fresh air in the garden The rooms are nice the bathroom a little old  The people at the reception very polite and gave us our call to the airline free The restaurant indeed advised to take the buffet at  rupees each but also mentioned the arate dishes and their price  As far as I could count this made the buffet a better price and the food was really good We didnt have breakfast as our planes left very early  We were taken to the airport on time and I forgot to mention also were received at arrival  This shuttle service was included in the price Considering the need to stay only overnight between flights I think this is a good place close to the airport  
N => Not up to k I selected this hotel because it was close to the airport and also price point is good  However the level of services is not up to k  There is no in room internet access  The gym is ok but opens late at am only  All else is ok  Not a suitable hotel for long business trips  
N => Disappointing I stayed for one day and was thoroughly disappointed with what I got  The food in the restaurant was tasteless the refrigerator in the room not working room service willing but incapable due to lack of experience  The surcharge on long distance calls as charged by them could not be justified on any account  Disappointing to say the least  
N => Worst hotel we stayed in This is one of the worst hotels we stayed at during our time in India  The check in and restaurant staff were rude the restaurant was very poor the carpets were stained the rooms smelt the sink was broken bathroom dirty the price was expensive compared with other hotels  Even for a quick overnight stay it spoilt what was a superb time in India  We could not escpae since it is remote  Value for money was also poor since it was not even cheap For a Gov  run hotel it needs to get its act together  
N => Fine business hotel    not fully luxurious but well above average I was put up here by a Government of India agency I was visiting  The hotel is owned by GOI I believe and so they get preferential rates  It was of the caliber of a nice riott    clean spacious I was in the quotannexquot wing relatively modern  Not glitzy Id stayed at the Taj Palace in Delhi  days earlier    that was about as glitzy luxurious as Ive ever been  Service was professional but not obsequious not overly solicitous  If Id paid myself I might have been disappointed but compared to other quotbusinessquot hotels I stayed at in India this was fine  Im from the US have traveled extensively in developing countries  
N => Big but not Luxury Hotel Jet Airways Provided us one night stay at this hotel As Jet Airways staff didnt board our baggage at origination Point Sothis stay was given by Airlines But we didnt find this hotel equal to  star hotel standards Rooms were smellyAC was not effectiveNo Courtesy by staffBreakfast was coldDinner was not good in taste Sowe will say this was an average hotel amp we will never prefer to go there  
N => stinky poo Worst room service foodand stinky Toilets   Dont use the hotel   Not for human beings 
N =>  not as horrible as expected I stayed at the Ashok this past week and was quite relieved that it was not as horrible as the other reviews indicate  My room did not seem dirty and housekeeping came daily   i left a tip each day so be that helped  Bugs i did see a small roach in my room on night one he was dead by morning from insecticide poisoning  Previous reviewers complained about a bad smell in the hall  its clearly insecticide i take it roaches are hard to eradicate in that part of the world  It was kind of gross to find the coverlet on my bed smelled of bug spray but what can you do better that than more roaches  It IS a third world country after all   i think the problem is that they are charging first world prices  If my workplace hadnt paid be i would have been more upset with the shortcomings  I def  wouldnt stay there if i was payingthe staff here i will agree  they were rude and impatient when i repeated things back to them to verify information about how to get a cab or where to store my luggage in the interval between check out time and the end of my conference  did not appreciate the attitude  i am a woman traveling alone be you could be a little patient that i want to be sure i have the information right and yes housekeeping are big tip seekers    despite leaving a tip when i left in the morning they would ring my doorbell at   at night to quotsee if i needed anythingquot I woud ignore the doorbell and then at least once they called on the phone go away they hang out in the hallway and pounce when you come back to inform you that they changed the fruit in your room or whatever  looking for a tip  Also i was supposed to have free breakfast in the coffee shop included in my room tarrif  Most days i didnt bother  My last night there i got ill and tried to exchange my breakfast ticket for two cans of sprite the next morning to soothe my stomach  they wouldnt do it  wanted me to pay  I tried to reason with them that whatever food i would eat if i came for breakfast would cost more than the sprite  i wanted two cans of sprite for breakfast right they had me sit down talked amongst themselves offered me canned juice  Juice made me sick in the first place  They wouldnt budge  This completely pissed me off  that is one star customer relations  WTF He tried to tell me the relative expense of the items wasnt the issue blah blah blah but i lost patience to hear his explanation and stalked out  They just wanted more money  Like every freakin Indian i encountered in Delhi unfortunately  hang on to your purse because people will be trying to sell you thingscheat you at every turn 
N => over priced   under whelmed   ashock ing hotel shabby smelly  tired and that was just the staff  Poorly trained they did not have a clue  The fixtures and fittings were poor the views awful and generally just disappointing  Our deluxe room had a comfortable bed and that was about it  One scruufy towel each a grubby bathroom and no sign of any love or care Of the six restaurants in the hotel only two were open and one of them was just vile  The other was average but top prices Our   night stay cost     do not stay here This was billed as a five star hotel with matching prices   I suggest they invest in some lessons from the Taj Group   felt completely ripped off and we were both very ill into the bargain  hope it loses down   would like my money back 
N => Smelly This place is awful  Our convention was held here and so in order to avoid the hassle of getting a trustworthy driver every day we ided to stay here despite the negative reviews  Hotel staff were a little creepy  Our hallway smelled very bad especially in the mornings  Luckily most of the smell remained in the hall and did not come into our room  Thats not to say that our room didnt smell it was just better in comparison  It was impossible to get internet in your room so you needed to go down to the main lobby to get any work done  And since only one of the electrical outlets in the lobby seemed to be working you had to make sure your computer was well charged before coming downstairs I did see one roach in the hallway luckily again not in our room  Stains of course on the towelsshower curtains  Our friends from Kenya were met with unacceptable racism from the hotels club  I cant possibly say enough bad things about this hotel  Stay somewhere else 
N => In my  weeks in India this was the worst In the  weeks and  cities Ive been to in India this was the worst of the worst and I stayed here more than once  The staff was the rudest Ive encountered anywhere the room was dirty the location was far from anything and it was of course overpriced  I highly recommend against staying here  
N =>  AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHH  We have never stayed in such a filthy crumbling insect ridden mold covered noisy smelly establishment in my life   and wouldnt wish anyone else to Had we wished to experience such a place we would have booked into a BampB in the bazaar  On second thoughts that would probably have been a nicer place to stayThe windows didnt fit properly so you had the noise and the smell of the traffic  We slept on top of the covers because of the state of the bed linen and would not walk on the carpets in bare feet  As for the bathroom   we washed in the sink rather than use the showerbath Doors to service areaslaundry were left open and you could see and smell the mold growing on the walls  Quite nauseating   it just made our skin itchOne night was one night too much but as wed arrived at pm we didnt have the energy to look elsewhereFor a government run hotel it was an absolute disgrace  The place ought to be knocked down as it is a health hazard  Even if this was the only starred hotel left in New Delhi we would not stay here again  We would take the BampB in the bazaar any day of the week 
N => Stay away  I would advise you to stay away from this hotel  I found that my hair dryer would not work nor my television not the desk light nor the floor light and some of the electrical sockets  As I discovered them most of these necessitated a visit from staff   at first I tipped those who fixed them but then ided be this was a racket to get more tips  I was also suspicious about the fact that they only turned down the beds and left in fresh water AFTER I had gone to my room in the evening no matter how late I returned   and waited around for a tip  They stopped turning down the bed after two days when i left them tipless for this  The shower curtains were stained as was the armchair   and i found dirty slippers with lots of dust under my bed  When my message light showed I discovered that the message key did not work the first person I asked to help me on this never came back to me on it  Eventually i found another staff person who managed to get my messages through an unknown code which he did not give to me   there were no instructions on how to access these messages anywhere in the room  The food which tasted quite good or at least the indian style food was very expensive   more than the price for a similar meal back in the U S  Service however was terrible   we waited  mins for some water to be brought to us  The use of wireless access cost  a day  The cost per night for this hotel is outrageous for a Delhi hotel    a day   best go elsewhere  
N =>  be OK one day Hayes amp Jarvis quotupgradedquot us to the Ashok from the Oberoi Maidens for the first  nights of our India tour  We read the reviews and hoped it would not be as bad as reported but unfortunately it was  Our rooms were dirty especially the bathrooms which looked as thougth they had not been cleaned properly for years  You could hardly see in the mirror and the last guests rubbish was still in the bins  It was very difficult to get rid of our creepy room quotboyquot who seemed to appear for no apparent reason every time we went to our rooms  My mother particularly was rather unnerved as she was sleeping alone and dreaded him just walking in   in the end she had to be quite rude to him which is not her nature at all and after that we hardly saw him which was quite a relief  The restaurant was OK but a long walk along a miserable corridor from the main part of the hotel  We were not keen on the buffet dinner but the a la carte meals we had were acceptable and not bad value for money  The good news is that they do seem to be in the process of refurbishing the hotel and the new parts like the quotIslandquot restaurant and the business centre are very nice  I think it will one day be restored to its former glory but they also need to train the staff to do something other than look for tips  
N => Krishna the porter We had a terrible shock at the Ashoka Hotel When we actually arrived in our room we found that there was a complimentary fruit basket which was mouldy and as old as or be older than the hotel    There were fake bottles of water   that were supposed to be mineral water but had been filled up with local tap water we figured this out from our stomachs that night and this was very unpleasent  As for the plumbing the toilets were over flooding and lets just say what went down came straight back up     Now for the service   the porters were constantly knocking at the door   waiting for tips and asking silly questions     me and my sister thought we had accidently checked into fawlty towers then again if we had we would have been some what lucky to an extent  One night the porter followed us in our room we thought it was a service to be dropped to the room but when he came inside withouth an invite we were shocked He told us he didnt drink alcohol and yet he managed to swig down half a bottle of bacardi He kept inviting us to go and eat with him and his family more fool us we didnt actually realise we were invited to foot the bill and tip the resteraunt The cheeek of it They also refused to take credit card payments and would only accept cash The only thing they would keep saying to us is quotmaam As polite as they were sounding it was very difficult to communicate    We could go on forever with the stories of how we survived for  nights but save urselfs from the misery Also being Indian me and my sister felt discriminated against as there were rules for people   Our final trip was to the Taj Mahal   we went for a day trip and as there were a few more spaces in our private transport the hotel staff invited themselves to come    and they robbed money and cheated my elderly father Be warned of these people and their hotel 
N => Okay in our section but not  stars We stayed at the Hotel Ashok B Chanakyapuri as part of a group tour making a brief stop in Delhi  It is a huge hotel with a number of restaurants and a shopping arcade and a fancy business center  It is in New Delhi south of the government area with no neighborhoodto walk to and no nearby subway  Would not have been particularly convenient if we had time for our own outings but we did not  Our room in what must be the reated wing far to the right as you facethe front of the hotel was fine but rooms in the other wing did not sound that great  We did not find it to be nearly as bad as the pans on Tripadvisor com and we found the service to be fine but it definitely does not deserve its apparent  stars or justify the priceapparently   
N => Sadly   Just about as bad as everyone says I went to the Ashok hoping that the earlier reviewers were just fussy and demanding  Sadly they were simply accurate  An average  star hotel trying to be  star  The public areas are ok but the rooms are old tired and dated  Service is patchy and the facilities shops restaurants etc set in something of a time warpI was able to put up with this and had to stay as a conference was being held at the venue  But others were paying  a night   sheer robbery For a few days relaxation I transferred to the Intercontinental Nehru Place   new hotel different universe  Excellent in every way and the same price as the Ashok  I notice the management at the Ashok have not used the right of reply faciliity on this site  That tells its own story  Avoid unless you enjoy wasting money  
N => A very bad Shock worst hotel ever This was the worst supposedly   hotel we have ever stayed in  The staff were extremely rude food was awful and the rooms were old and grubby  I so wish I had read the reviews before paying   for  nights  It was most definately an experience to forget  I wrote a letter of complaint to them and suprise suprise Ive had no reply  I would recommend that no one should even consider this hotel you are better off staying somewhere which is  We stayed in this hotel to get the best of our last  days in India and regretted every minute  It totally left a sour taste in our mouth we were glad to get back to the UK  
N => A shock at The Ashok As a frequent traveller to Dehli without a doubt my preferred hotel is The Imperial or at the other end of the spectrum The Park  However given the lack of rooms in the city I was forced to stay at The Ashok for my last business trip  A SHOCK certainly sums it up The government run hotel could be a splendid example of traditional Indian grandeur as its website claims  Sadly it is not  I checked in late at around pm and was greeted by surly receptionists who seemed more interested in getting an imprint of my credit card for Rs    not cheap than anything else  I was shown to my room by a bellboy so insistent on carrying my one small bag despite my resistence that he actually tried grabbing it from me  When I did get to my room I was mortified  Shabby implies chic nowadays but this was just shabby  Dirty fingerprinted TV light switches toilet seat tarnished mirrors dirty cutlery laying around and the piece de resistance   dark hairs on the pilled pillows and sheets of each of the twin beds  It took three phone calls and a visit by housekeeping to convince them that I didnt want the room nor did I want to wait for sheets changing I just wanted to move  The second room seemed more promising with a fruit basket and clean knife but on closer inspection the beds again were hairy and unappealling  I slept with a pashmina as a pillow and had a terrible nights sleep especially as after midnight housekeeping called to see if the room was okay on advising them no but I cut my losses they didnt seem to know how to handle it other than saying that the general manager would make it up to me in the morning  Didnt hang around to see what that  involve but suffice to say if you have any other choice dont stay here  What has the potential to be a wonderfully equipped five star hotel with spacious rooms and a warren of shops and restaurants turned out to be a disappointingly dirty stay in Delhi  
N => Shocking time at the Ashok I was staying at the Ashok hotel between the th and th of   for business reasons  During my stay I found the rooms to be unclean and unsafe whilst moving the hairdryer I received an electric shock  I reported this to the duty manager and asked to speak with the general manager  I was informed that the general manager was in the hotel but was in a meeting and unable to see me I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Hotel to avoid The room was very large the furniture was grubby and tatty  The bathroom smelled the bath did not drain the bidet did not work the W C  splashed your trousers when flushed  The mini bar was empty  The balcony was very dirty paint peeling off wood work and no balcony furniture  The windows were cracked putty coming away and dangerous to open The staff were rude dismissive and unhelpful  I was pushed by one member of staff  The dining room was small and the food below par  There was no bar available to residents closed for functions  One could not obtain a drink without going into a restaurant All this for US per night BB 
N => Very disappointed with the rooms and the service We stayed at the Ashok for one night in ruary as our Tour Company Compass Tours told us that the Park hotel was not available due to President Bushs visit to India  We were sent to dirty rooms that seemed like they hadnt been cleaned for weeks  We spent our afternoon trying to get cleaner rooms rather than sight seeing  We finally got some rooms that were a little cleaner than the ones we first saw and ended up staying there  We had paid the same rate as the Park Hotel we had stayed at the Park earlier in our tourwhere the rooms were a   better than the Ashok  The management was neither friendly nor helpful  Try to avoid staying here at all cost  
N => Pleasantly surprising stay not as bad as expected We stayed at the Ashok in   for  nights there was  adults  teenangers and a toddler  We stayed in a suite on Floor  this was well sized and we had  single beds put in the spacious living room  It seemed that there are  types of rooms standard and superior the superior ones are accessed by ble lined floors the standard is by carpet  On our floor was an attendant  who was very attentive  The room was good uk  star std the bathroom was not as good but adequate  The hotel overall is quite dated but in Delhi is probably quite modern  There is a lot of staff around who we found very helpful particularly with our toddler  The restaurants are ok but I would recommend eating out  One night we ate at the hotels Frontier restaurant food was northern indian fare very good but at western pricing later in the week we ate out for the same quality at  the price  There is a health club which is actually not owned by the hotel it has very good facilities but if you want to use the gym only they make you use the basic outdoor changing rooms as opposed to the clubs impressive facilities  Overall we enjoyed our stay but you must try and get a superior roomsuite it is worth paying a bit more  
N => Business travelers Stay Away General There is a big gap between terrible and okay but some problems  This property falls somewhere in the middle but closer to bad  Front desk To small and unorganized to handle more then three guests at a time  Took  minutes with a reservation to check in even after I got to interact with the miserable woman working behind the counter  Interior Carpeting in hallways threadbare and dirty Room International plug did not work no internet cable as purported and remote was non functional  So working or relaxing was more complicated then it should be  The scale is so big that if the hotel is not full it is almost depressing eating in a  person restaurant during the only hour you have with a business guest and you are the only two in the house  Restaurants Lots of options lots of range in quality  Korean rest was good Chinese was not so good the breakfast place could not handle the volume even a small event on the property  The new bar Steel is the best option this place had it was freshly done with good staff that tried and a great relaxed scene  It was the only real haven there where I did not dislike my stay  Conclusion I travel the world and this was part of a  day trip in India and I had much better results at other hotels so this is not about India or cultural differences  Everything in this hotel seemed to be old and tired and interactions with the staff were harder or more complicated than it needed to be  If you do anything other than sleep there as a business guest the frustration took more than it should out of you by the end of the day  It was an exercise in patience all day  
N => Prisoners in the West enjoy better facilities Well be not because i lack any experience to comment about prison facilities  But i had to wait  minutes in the lobby along with wife son and a cranky  month old dhter and four suitcases before i could get someone to show me my room  And that was ony after i got into and was the winner of a quotshoutingquot match with the staff  The corridors were dark and I came across some dubious looking people during my one day stay there  The bathroom was of s vintage and the toiletry was very cheap  Room service took forever  The thing that rankled me the most was the could not care less attitude of the staff  They were very grumpy looking and mean and behaved more like they did not really want to be there and did not want you to be there either  I really felt like kicking their backsides  The only saving grace was the performance of the musicians in the restaurant  Needless to say i left the next day for another hotel  
N => would not return  
N => A shock   not Ashok  
N => The worst hotel I have ever been to  
N => Hotel wasnt bad but not in the best location We stummbled upon this hotel accidently were originally stayed at Raj Hans down the road   but it was soooo disgusting we paid double to stay at the Atrium the next night   our last night in India  so after staying in the crappiest  star ever the nite before the Atrium was definetly an upgrade   but it felt empty   We got there late   about pm and were going to check out at  that morning so they lowered the rate for us  The location of this hotel sucks the area is unlit at night   desserted    so for a first time traveller it made me uneasy   it was basically in the middle developing hotels   construction surrounds it   I think they are trying to build a community of resorts  The room was small but nice modern  We ordered room service it wasnt bad  Room was clean but there was a door joining our room with another and we could hear the people next door clearly   the walls are paper thin  I dont think I would stay there again but it was nice enough    we never did see any other guests 
N => Terrible Hotel Terrible location We had the misfortune to be allocated to this hotel by a tour operator We were told we would be staying in a four star hotel in Old Delhi  However it transpired that we were instead booked into this hotel which is k from Delhi in another town altogether Faridabad an unattractive industrial area Our first impressions of the hotel were of a massive construction site spewing dust onto a building with peeling paint and dirty windows  The room was the worst we stayed in throughout our two week stay in India  It was dirty the electrical sockets were not attached properly to the wall the sheets were stained and had holes and for the first  hours we had no hot water  The construction site began at around six am and made noise which was loud enough to wake us through a closed window The hotel is arranged into four atriums which are massive and deserted  It seemed that our tour group and handful of others were the only people staying in hotel which had a capacity for at least ten times that amount  The service was not rekable but a little lax  A room service tray which was outside our room when we arrived had not been removed when we left nearly  hours later despite various staff coming to our and the adjacent room during the period It took between  and  minutes to get in and out of the centre of Delhi depending on traffic and therefore it was not a practical choice for sightseeing in the city I would not recommend that anyone stay at this hotel  
N => Horrible intrusive service at the Atrium I had the misfortune to spend around  days at the Atrium hotel while travelling on business  Really it was quite disappointing from start to finish  I was given a room with a tiny window in a corner facing out onto an active construction site that was active almost around the clock  Besides the noise construction workers could look right into the room as soon as a the curtains were open which left me without natural light most of the time  When I got to the room the shower didnt work and it took them ages to fix the toilet seat was broken there was hair on the bedsheets the carpets in the room were filthy and other small details in the room glasses etc were just not clean  I was never offered a new room The service ranged from being in the best case just very awkward to in the worst case being extremely intrusive  In general it was always bad  After a very disappointing meal in the restaurant I pointed out that the bill was incorrect in my favour  Two times I was assured that it was fine  Two hours later I was called up in my room by someone who refused to speak english but managed to communicate that I needed to sign my bill  After a while he said he would come to my room  It was almost midnight and I had already gone to bed so I said absolutely not  Minutes later despite my refusal the person knocked on the door barged in and forced me to sign a new restaurant bill to correct the mistake made hours ago  The difference was just a few rupies Laundry was returned at almost pm and was always incorrectly handled despite clear instructions I cant believe this hotel manages to ket itself as international standard accomodation as it is so far below what can reasonably be expected that it is just not worth it at any price  
N => good hotel but far from center I move to this hotel as i booked at Raunak hotel but it was nighte there  this hotel is far from center about  mins but its about  mins to airport and about  mins to big shopping mall which i am happy over there  the residence room is nice as its similar to service apartment  you got living area and kitchen counter with microwave and shower  but shower always leaking out from the shower door and i rang the staff since teh first day but never come to fix it  the water is all over the floor everytimes i had a shower but the overall of the room is good  the hotel lobby is nice with modern style  the staffs is ok but not really communicate among themself first  i was plan to go to lotus temple and reception guy call to chek that its open or not  he said its open on that day but when we went their it was close  also when we already booked the taxi to go to the airport   staffs keep asking did you book the taxi yet and they want to charge me for the taxi even my package in my guest profile said included  way trasfer to airport  the room service food is nice there but the breakfast is quite abit limit in choices  the internet is expensive also  its RS  per hour  we paid at RS per night and i stay for  nights which im quite happy with the overall  
N => Very nice Room Nice Hotel Awful Location Sutese were very nice  Very modern and well equipped  Terrible view from window of high canvas fence installed I am sure to hide the view of the quite awful neighbourhood outside Restaurant was nice with very pleasant staff  Food was fine if somewhat limited in choice  The restaurant was unlicenced and there was no bar in the hotel Swimming Pool Indoor was unfortunately so cold we were not brave enough to use it  Otherwise recreation area was very good  
N => Easy entry to India Very clean modern and reasonably quiet  Breakfast was served early for us as we were on an early train to Agra  
N => Spacious clean and good service Stayed at this hotel while on holiday in Delhi  Female traveller alone  This hotel was away from the centre of Delhi so make time to travel in and out  Rooms are spacious modern  Service was prompt and the food was good Pool area is a bit run down and not very well attended  As a single lady the attention at breakfast was a bit too much   lots of staring and people coming out of the kitchen to look too  Another downside was the lack of hot water in the afternoons had to wait until pm each day  I all a good hotel where single females will feel okay  
N => Good for our one night pre flight stay We stayed at the Claremont because we were looking for a reasonably priced clean comfortable hotel near the Delhi airport  Distance wise the hotel is not that far however it took us  minutes to drive to the airport at am on a Monday morning  We had planned for at least that amount of time so it wasnt a problem  The hotel also allowed for us to have  adults and  children in one room  When making the reservation it stated wed have  beds  Our room had  King and  twin bed that was brought in so it really only slept  comfortably  The room was clean apart from a few stains on the carpet  One bothersome thing regarding the room was that there was no deadbolt and no latch on the door  The only way to lock the door while inside the room was to use the key an actual metal key to turn the lock  Also the safe in our room was not functioning so we made certain not leave anything of value in the room when we went out to dinner  The front desk staff and restaurant staff were very friendly  The restaurant offered a dinner buffet or an a la carte menu  The menu offered Indian and Chinese options and we were happy with the variety of choices  Overall this hotel served our purpose of having a clean room with a hot shower before our early morning flight  
N => Horrible Place to Stay On the tail end of an otherwise wonderful trip to Rajastan India we were booked into this property by Castle and King TourServices  On our first day we were welcomed into a severelysmoked out room we had requested a non smoking room  We were told we would be transferred  After around fifteen minuteswe contacted the front desk and were told quotAll rooms sold outWe can transfer you in the morningquot  We then encounted a non flushing toilet and had to use the lobby facilities all evening  Noassistance to repair was available  My wife after coming out of the shower told me Stay away from the shower curtain it has a lot of mold on itquot  So went our stay at the Claremont We left for Khajarao in the AM with a promise that we would be upgraded to a much better room when we returned to Delhi  I thought seriously about transferring to another hotel but the payments for all three nights we already surrendered to the Claremont When we returned to Delhi we were surprised to be upgraded to the quotexecutive suitesquot  The toilet worked and the shower curtain was fine  Unfortunately the room was right above the disco or club facility so for two nights we had to listen to the unusual bollywood disco sounds until midnight or closer to AM Our general opinion of our tour all over India was great  The people sights sounds and food made for a memorable trip  The only bad thing was the way it ended in Delhi  STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL 
N => We had great time            As we have taken this holiday on weekend amp its pakage was great as the hotel was we were on triple occupancy amp the hotel staff were good enough to take care of us         We had blast amp enjoyed the weekend with all recreational stuff amp evening with great wine          Food is equaly good but expensive enough            amp as the the hotel clams to be star its fair enough to be           
N => Two nights at The Qutab I normally stay at a different hotel in New Delhi but chose to stay here as it was close to the location for my business meetings  Safe to say that I totally regretted my choice within  minutes of landing up The reception staff at check in was probably a trainee from one of the hotel management institutes   had absolutely no clue about my reservation even though I had a print out of the reservation confirmation with me   took them about  minutes to sort that out  I was then led to my room on the th floor via a very slow and temperamental elevator that stopped on every floor on the way for no apparent reason   as no one got in or got off   a pattern that was repeated for the two days that I was there The room was spacious and relatively clean  The TV was an old piece of k that made strange crackling and hissing noises  The bathroom looked as if it had not been cleaned since  with grime in the tiling and a couple if missing tiles Luckily I had no opportunity to sample the food except for breakfast on the first morning  Going by the cold congealed quality on offer Im fairly sure that the rest of the meals would have left a lot to be desired The straw that broke the camels back was the incident of the malfunctioning key card  I got back fairly late from dinner on the second night and my key car would not work  I went down to the reception to get that fixed and it took them   get this   about  minutes to get one that workedAn over priced worthless two night stay  
N => Great Value Great Hotel So clean a hotel  Unbelievable breakfast buffet bar  Loved the omlet stations  Clean rooms  On a less crowded road  Entry amp Exit very good  Parking OK  But the staff stood me out while they went to the room and checked the minibar status how much to charge me while I was in a hurry to get to the airport 
N => A shambles of a  star that provided doss house quality of life This hotel claims to provide a  star service and facilities but falls very very far short in terms of delivery  Having stayed here for  nights there are clearly systematic problems in terms of management and infrastructure  a plumbingwater  For one night we were without running water or in lavatory and often the water ran brown  The gurgling of the plumbing kept me awake long enough to have knock on effects for my meetings the following day  b noise   a colleague of mine suffered from intermittent but persistent electric motor noises in some service shaft near his room  When eventually moved a day or so later was moved to exact same position on another floor with same environmental noise pollution c food   the quality and upkeep of the food is questionable  At breakfast the sliced tomatocucumber was dried up and almost curling  The cheese board also in a poor state  poor range of food available for breakfast  In general bizarre discrepancies between room srevice and restaurant menu   such that when asked for a light meal of mushroom soup followed by cheese selection in restaurant was told mushroom soup only available via room service  So had to go to room order soup wait  minutes eat that then descend to restaurant for cheese course  d key system   on at least  occasions during stay the swipe card key to room became inactive and so had to make long trip via slow lift service back to reception to get reactivated   I should put in expense claim for the time and travel involved e overall staffing attitude   the patina of obsequiousness displayed by the staff was not matched by the concept of service provision to the customer   obstructive and just plain unintelligent The range of areas in which this hotel falls short amazes me   strongly recommend not to use this  
N => Would not be sad if I had to return The Qutab is a nice modern  storey building  Nice ble entrance helpful and very friendly staff bell captain porters okay reception staff and a nosy hotel manager who once happened to come into our room without knocking and then only could stumble quotoh sorry do you wish something from the room servicequot  Still no clue what he really wanted  Rooms are spacious some of them with great flatscreen tv others with standard equipment  Good beds minibar in room safe okay bathroom not much water pressure in shower  Cosy barbreakfast restaurant  Just around the corner same complex a very good Indian restaurant expensive though we paid  euro for two bottles of wine  Swimming pool looked good but too cold to try outdoor  Room airco should have heated room up it was only  degrees outside but did not  Everywhere in the hotel it was freezing cold  Internet access excellent WiFi  They also have saunahammanmassage did not try it out  Location a bit out of where interesting things are happening but for business meeting fine  All in all was good although a bit overrated perhaps  I would a next time still look for another option but if I would not be able to find a better one in terms of location then I would not be sad having to go back  
N => Had a great time We stayed here last ober  It was my first visit to India amp I was worried about what the hotels would be like  We stayed here for one night at the start of our tour amp for  nights at the end  We loved it  The rooms were very clean modern quiet amp comfortable The pool area is very nice amp there are two restaurants on site  The buffet breakfast was excellent amp the staff would cook Euoropean breakfasts  if you asked  We found the coffee shop staff to be really helpful  They suggested where we could eat in Delhi amp as we both love Indian food they made us dishes which were not on the menu  The other restaurant was a bit ster but was also very good  We booked thsi as part of a package so I dont know what the rate was  Woul agree with other reviewers about the attitude of the desk staff  Would stay here again amp would recommend  
N => Hotel Qutab Not the best value for your money HiI am an Indian national who stayed at Hotel Qutab along with my wife who is a US citizen  I stayed there for just  day during a  hour stopover before boarding an international flight back to the US from Delhi in ember  Firstly if you call them and ask they will tell you they are a  star or  star hotel  Hotel ratings are too inconsistent in Delhi and most likely hotel staff in Delhi will tell you what you want to hear about their star rating  I would not give Hotel Qutab more than a  star rating for classamenities and a  star rating for service  I paid  per night for my stay  But of course in Delhi demand is greater than supply for hotels so they charge you whatever they can think of  I requested early check in a week ago and it was promised when I paid for it a week earlier  Even if I wanted to check in at  a m  as opposed to the  p m  check in time if there are no rooms available they are not going to bother to let you know in advance  So I had to wait for an hour in the lobby while they waited on someone else to check out and get my room made  It was however nice of them to offer me some free tea   for making me wait though it did not make a difference to me Their air conditioning unit seemed like it was started just before we walked into the room and did not work right for the few hours we stayed there  Their room service was good the hot water worked great and the bed was comfortable  Their internet connection was down because their server was down Id think theyd be better equipped with all the money being charged for the room rates  I had wanted to check my flight schedules and they did not have a phone book with them to get hold of phone numbers  They did however connect me to the Yellow Pages hotline free of charge and I was able to obtain the required phone numbers Upon check in I had confirmed that the payment was already made for the room  However upon check out thanks to a lack of communication with the staff working in the evening they had to make a bunch of calls again to make sure the payment was already made and made me wait a good  min  during check out before confirming something they should have known Sriram 
N => I suspect that reception staff did not post our postcards My family and I stayed at the Qutab on  arate occasions in uary  On leaving we did not have time to go to the post office and post our holiday postcards   about  of them  So we left the money for postage with staff in the reception and someone promised to post the cards Now  months later nobody has received a postcard  Not one single postcard arrived What should I think  
N => Will Not Be Staying Here Any Time Soon Again I am still trying to figure out how this place considers itself a step above others We were booked to stay a couple of nights and we only stayed one  It was our last day in Delhi together and we wanted to get an early start to enjoy the entire day  Well that was quickly thwarted when for some unknown reason we could not get any hot water  The heater was on but it got lost in translation along the way from heater to shower head But let me back up a bit Our first problem was with the AC  At this property there are wall unit air conditioners  I dont know how the other units look but ours had a lovely brownish yellow water stain framing it  Truly unsightly How difficult and how long would it take to just prime and paint that The AC definitely had a mind of its own turning on turning off turning on turning off And every time someone came up to fix it they set it to an arctic C degreesSo lets go back to the hot water issue  After calling the front desk to report no hot water a young man was sent up to investigate  I think he turned a few knobs clicked the heater on and off and when I asked if it was ok a gutteral grunt was the response  I wondered if that was yes or no  I am thinking now it was a no because after about a  minute wait I checked again and still no hot water  Another call to the front desk  Now the front desk person along with gutteral grunter show up  They tinker around a bit and tell us to wait  minutes and the hot water will come  It didnt  Call again  This time a barrage of people show up at the door and all file into our cramped room to further investigate the situation  Again a suggestion to wait  minutes and they all shuffle out Still no hot water  Call again  At this point I am on the internet which by the way was great and perhaps the ONLY bright spot about this place trying to find us another place to stay We are told an engineer is on his way up  In the meantime they send up gutteral grunter with a bucket of hot water to accommodate a shower for two people  Are they kidding No thanks The engineer shows up and assures us there will be hot water  At this point we have now lost about  hours or more from our day  Well the hot water finally did arrive   we showered and promptly checked out much to their amazement How could they have been shocked over our departure The room was rather cramped pretty dark and the mattress felt like it must have seen one too many guests   definitely in need of replacement  Again the only bright spot was the internet connection which I will say was very good and although the room service was quite quick and the food reasonably tasty it was without a doubt way over pricedWe ended up in a   star hotel after leaving this place paying a mere  more for the night than we paid for our one night at Hotel Conclave Comfort but it was well worth it because our last night was spent in HEAVEN in comparisonThis place is WAY over priced for the quality of room and service and I do not recommend it not even for a one night stay 
N => great location   dirty hotel Stayed with family for three nights at the beginning of a  week holiday  Though the location was convenient to every place we intended to visit this hotel was a depressing first impression of what to expect in India  The tiny rooms could have been cleaner  Dirty cracked windows gave us our first look outside  Staff was friendly and helpful   a positive In retrospect it would have been better to do a little more research prior to just booking with the tour agency Indian Moments and selected a different hotel based on the experience of other trip advisor travelers  Fortunately most of the other hotels were of higher quality than the Corus  
N => Depressing experience Barely better than a backpackers hostel this quothotelquot wasone of the worst I have ever stayed in  Very noisy rooms offexternal corridor backing onto dirty back streets  Very basic amenitiesworn sheets bug tablets in quotbathroomquot no hot water No lift had to lug bags upstairs Breakfast minimal on patio next to streets Unfortunately next step up was to  star hotels more thandouble price but we made it and were relieved and thrilled  
N => Cought the door bell man STEALING from my bags Horrible experience Picture this  You go out for dinner and forget your camera  Go back to the hotel and when you open the door to your room surprise There is the door bell man INSIDE THE ROOM STEALING FROM THE BAGS I cought him in the act and I was shocked because he had broken into the room just after I left  The manager from the hotel asked me not to call the police and try to quotdigest itquot Do I need to say anything else 
N => not great but given location and cost probably a good option This hotel has a great location on connht circle and the funky asian fusion restaurant with nice garden downstairs is also really good had been craving california rolls so was happy to see the restaurant when we turned up The rooms however are not great  First time we stayed we had a standard room which could also be called worlds smallest room and the bathroom barely room to turn around  Still it was fairly clean but we didnt sleep well at all as we were right by the stairs so it was really noisy  Second time we stayed in the next grade of room up which was a much better size but had no window and had a funny mothball smell  They have little white balls in the sink according to my husband you get these in urinals and i found the smell really overpowering  Still from all my searching online for hotels in delhi it seems you either pay extortionate amounts for a luxury hotel and then peanuts for some really basic rooms so would say this is probably a good mid range option  
N => Best value in New Delhi Hotels in New Delhi are notoriously overpriced and after four nights in subpar but highpriced hotels we stumbled across the Corus Hotel in Connht Place  We liked what we saw and immediately booked a room for our return five weeks later  What a joyfull experience when we returned Friendly uniformed staff with excellent English skills and eager to help in every way small but spotless and beautifully furnished room with an excellent bathroom serene isolation from the chaos of the city interior garden restaurant  All the trimmings of a well managed hotel  Price was Rs    about US  The final graceful touch was after allowing a late checkout they offered us the free use of an available room in which to rest before our late night departure to the airport  
N => Make Sure You Dont Pay Much The Corus Hotels location is very good   right in Connht Place  The hotel itself is mediocre  Our room was small with a lot of ambient noise  The staff was friendly though the front desk was understaffed  As others have commented theres no real lobby to the hotel   instead you walk through a cafe up some stairs to get to a tiny lobby  The breakfast however was very good  
N => Avoid At All Costs The first problem we encountered was finding this place as it has no frontage like most hotels it is basically located upstairs inside the Bonsai restaurant  The reception area is small like a corridor but adequate nothing grand  We stayed at the hotel on two occasions over three weeks as the hotel was booked by the tour guide  On our first stay for  days the room was fine nothing luxury about it just a basic room with a good view of Connht Place central park  The next morning we discovered no hot running water and had to call for assistance the hotel staff made up a number of excuses regarding the boiler being broke this is already on some of the reviews for this hotel left by others so i was pre warned The third day the toilet stopped flushing so we had to call an engineer again later the cold running water ceased to work from the bathroom washbasin  In the end they brought us a bucket of hot water with a jug to wash in not very practical or hygenic but it was better than not batheing at all  The breakfast was absolutely rubbish a mish mash of foods not edible together  The juices were very warm and not drinkable the butter so hard you couldnt spread it on the toast  The restaurant itself was very basic not the cleaniest place weve eaten at  On our second stay things got worse we were given a room with no window and again it had only luke warm water to bathe in   and no bath tub only stand in shower  Apparently out of  rooms only  have windows so be warned we had the premium room with a window The air con was extremely noisy so we switched it off but the humidity in the room was awful as there was no air or natural light  Summing up this hotel i would recommend you pay extra and try somewhere like connht hotel  We stayed at  hotels during our stay in India and all the rest were good to pure luxury this hotel is really a    i couldtn give it even  stars as i dont think it is worthy of it  
N => Worst Value Hotel in Four Month Trip I picked the Corus after reading the latest review in Lonely Planet  Dont make the same mistake  This hotel was totally over priced for the quality of the experience  It cost  rps plus tax for a double room  For that we got  One hot shower in four days  The shower cubicle filled with water after  minutes and completely flooded our bathroom   The only way the staff could get the hot water to work was by turning on the hot water tap in the sink and then letting the shower run for  minutes  But of course that totally flooded the bathroom    No window   Only intermittent television and Internet reception   The air conditioning system was so loud it kept us awake at night   The staff were friendly but unhelpful  When we had problems they couldnt fix them and if they made any attempt they expected a tip  We needed an extra bed for one night and it took us five calls to reception over  hours to get it  We only got it because we were going to bed and refused to leave the reception room until it was done I was also annoyed at the price  When I rang the hotel to make the booking I was told it was  rupees tax included  When I came to pay I was told that tax was not included  I paid but said I was annoyed at being misled on the phone  The hotel then lied and claimed that I had booked through a travel agentWhatever you do dont stay at this hotel For this price you can find a much better place in Delhi  
N => Nice little place in the centre of town After looking on here for reviews my colleague amp I said it looked a safe bet  The hotel has a very good location  The reception area is nice amp was being refurbished when we arrived  My room was in the main block amp had no windows  It was very quiet  Air con amp fan worked really well  The only problem was getting hot water  There was never any  I didnt mind too much as it was extremely hot and humid so a cold shower suited me fine  The free internet was a bonus too  I would recommend this hotel to others  The price was good  A nice restuarant is included inside the hotel too  
N => Many probelms with the Corus We booked this hotel because a collegue from work recomended this place and because Hotels in Delhi are overcharged and we didnt wanted to spend so much  We booked directly with their webpage and also payed for the airport pick up since we arrived late at night  When we arrived to the airport no one was there to pick us up  We had to pay a pre paid taxi from the airpot who brought us to Connht place but once we were there he told us he didnt know this hotel  The streets were deserted so he entered another hotel to ask for directions at am in the morning No one knew how to get to the Corus  After half an hour of asking and being lost we finally arrived  We were furious to know why they didnt picked us up at the airport but to our surprise they didnt even had our reservation since their webpage took one day to process the information but didnt say so in the web page The hotel is ok the bed is clean but the bathroom is awful no hot water no comfort at all and found many big insects at the shower  The breakfast buffet is good and the restaurant staff very kind  However the front desk staff was almost rude and unprofessional  After this experience we suggest to pay a little bit more to be in a nicer hotel but be more confortable in Delhi and enjoy more the city  
N => False Impressions Their motto is quotHospitality Redefinedquot which after reading this personal account is quite apt but for all the wrong reasons Dirty old sheets one covered in blood which was not removed after  requests cold showers was told to run the water for upwards of  mins   but even longer running time led to no more than strictly lukewarm no restaurant  eating room breakfasts in your own bedroom no table only  chair   none of which is conducive to business travel generator blasting away just outside our rooms accessed via a balcony style corridor overlooking a shambles outside phone bills charged to your room no toilet paper only Pepsi in the room bar no offstreet parking no formal hotel entrance but instead a flight of steps up from street level a street covered in dust amp traders All this for the exhorbitant fee of U nightly plus    Delhi hotel tax fee  Owner would not budge when asked for a refund based on the above issues  It just so happened that Delhi was more or less fully booked for a Trade Convention so no chance of relocating otherwise I would have done so Definitely not  star material dont be fooled by the name their motto or the web pictures In short avoid like the plague  
N => Cashing in on their success As we are right now staying at Cottage Yes Please a word of warning to anyone who might get too excited from the good reviews on this site They have started charging on the Wi Fi use  rupees per day  Double room price at  and although the rooms are reasonably clean and quite nice most are nothing like the photos on their web site A big minus is that they seem to be happily giving a cold shoulder to people with confirmed bookings  They did it to us and to another couple this week just because we arrived late in the evening which we had told them before and they had replied it was ok  We had arranged the booking by e mail and the other couple even face to face at the hotel   no help they just told us they were full and told to go to their sister hotel Cottage Crown Plaza nearby  The guy at the Yes Please desk was rude and aggressive and said that he did not care if we had a booking or not if we didnt want the sister hotel we should go on the street and look for other places  We were tired so just haggled about the price and went to Crown Plaza which was ent but no Wi Fi As we really needed a place with Wi Fi we returned to Yes Please for this stay  OK value but not good service The Fiesta cafe just opposite this place has good breakfasts and coffee and free Wi Fi if you give them your ID  
N => The best in Phar ganj Area You  find dirt cheap hotels in the pahar ganj area but its really worth to pay a little bit more more a bit more calm and peace of mind and wi fi  They have an elevator free luggage storage they offer airport pick up and drop off for a minimal fee  They also offer city tour by a private taxi  So you wont have to ask for more  
N => OK Hotel Stayed here for  nights OK staff Good location for travelers Room service Good rooms  no hot water in the room  driver we organized to the airport through them kept falling asleep at the wheel not technically their fault 
N => not bad considering delhi standards    It was our first night in Delhi and we ided to stay in Pahar Ganj area  We arrived late in the evening and we booked the pick up from the Airport  We found a guy waiting for us with a big board and we arrived at the hotel around midnight  The ac room was a triple was ok and clean but very hot before the noisy ac refreshed it  The view from the balcony was a high wall around it but this area doesnt offer good point of view   It was clean and the staff friendly  The price  rs was high for the standard but sleeping in Delhi is very expensive In front of the hotel there is a sort of restaurant for breakfast or diner Compared to other guesthouses seen on internet it was a good choice  
N => Be careful    The hotel itself was reasonable and clean especially in comparison to the majority of places in new delhi  However the AC did not work for half of the time and there was hot water for about  minutes in total  The worst suprise came at check out time  We were billed for  nights when we had only spent two nights at the hotel on the spurious grounds that we had arrived before  noon on the first day of our stay  After losing our tempers the quotmanagerquot reduced the fee to half a day but in any case our last day in India was dampened by this example of dishonesty  
N => Warning about Crest Inns Bus Tour to AgraTaj Mahal I just wanted to let people know that you need to be very careful about bus tours to Agra  I took the bus tour that departs from the Crest Inn  I thought it would be a safe bet because the Crest Inn website has a page devoted to the bus tour so it seemed relatively professional and structured for tourists  Not so  It was the off season so I was the only non Indian english speaker on the bus  The driver was curt and didnt understand my questions and attempted to leave without me after breakfast  He was only stopped from doing so because they got a flat tire just a couple hundred feet down the road  Id like to think this wasnt intentional but I feel its pretty tough not to notice that the one white person is not onboard  Then when we came to the first stop in agra the Red Fort I split off from the group because they aggressively encouraged me to take a different guide that speaks all English promising me that wed all meet at the bus out front  But when we had finished our tour my bus was nowhere to be found  Luckily there are infinite transportation for hire options in India so I was able to make it to the Taj Mahal and home again using alternate transportation  But the trip is a long hot stressful one as it is so Id advise anyone considering a bus tour to consider alternate options or else make very good friends with the driver  
N => Everything is New The Crest Inn hotel is not located in the best part of Delhi but to their credit once you are inside everything is brand spanking new  Our hotel room even still had its furniture in a semi wrapped state This is one of the cleanest places you will find in Delhi it was the only place where the bedsheets and towels did not need to be changed out the minute we entered the room  We also loved the way the room was set up especially the presence of a large double bed  Two downsides remain with this inn  the shower area in the bathroom is not segregated so be prepared to have a very wet bathroom floor after youve taken a shower Secondly the hotel restaurant is not much for food so be prepared to head out for all your meals  
N => Terrible rooms I recently stayed at this hotel with my family  The hotel is very old  Even though the rooms have had a recent make over i would advise you to stay away from this place  The bathrooms have bath tubs which leak and the toilets do not flush properly  Breakfast is served in an untidy small room and is often not prepared preoperly  The staff were very pleasant however and tried to make our stay comfortable  Please avoid this hotel 
N => trashy hotel Bad tempered and dishonest people We booked the hotel through a travel agent but when we came AM they told us that they hadnt any booking  we were forced to look for an other hotel first night in India    in the late night    we found it thanks to the taxi driver The last day we came to settle the problem but they just told us that it was a mistake amp didnt want to pay us back     
N => Good value for the price We were staying in New Delhi for  weeks and wanted to minimize our expenses especially since we believed that we would also be using room service alot  The hotel was booked by a travel agent and the  star rating was lower than we had talked about  The room we had had not been remodeled yet however I thought that with a few repairs and detailing the room would justify a higher rating  We felt that the room was cleaner than we expected  We didnt see any bugs or big problems  During the day we could here alot of remodeling going on in other rooms in the hotel  The hum of the air conditioner pretty much drown out the road noise it kept the room plenty cool  Room service was good  The menu was pretty good and the food reasonable priced for room service  Chowmein and a order of spring rolls was less than  US and seemed to be plenty to eat for the  of us  The staff seemed friendly and helpful  We usually tipped    but some of the staffed seem surprized  The area looked scarey but we never felt in danger wandering down the streets  I would recommend this hotel for a budget traveler  
N => Appalling Food I lived n Delhi or a year and have to return once a month flying in from Mumbai  I have tried several hotels and this is without doubt the worst food I have eaten in any hotel in any capital the breakfast was so bad it defies description vegetarian omellete with bacon in it uncooked eggs served as an omellette hairs on the food so bad we left without eating  Room service we ordedred a salad wth bread ad they were  potato crisps inedible Therooms were ok but small  Stay if you are desperate foor a room otherwise avoid at all costs 
N => Quiet hotel in a busy city It was our first time in India and at a Crowne Plaza hotel  We were not disappointed in our choice  On arrival everything during registration was completed while we had a cold drink  Our room overlooked the pool and entrance to the hotel  The room was quite large with a very welcome fridge there were always bottles of water on our return every day The Atrium bar is lovely and quiet but like everywhere in India expensive  The first night we ate in the hotel think it was called Le Cafe it is where the breakfasts are served we did not have the buffet although it looked very good  Breakfast was excellent the best we had during our tour We ate a a Chinese not too far from the hotel and felt perfectly safe walking around  During our stay in il the pool was very cold but the pool area was pleasant Would recommend this hotel if you want to stay away from the very busy city  My only negative would be the price of using the business centre to access the Internet very expensive Staff were polite and helpful  
N => Exceeded Expectations Almost We were at this hotel for only two days  The service was way above standard for India about average by Canadian standards  The rooms were the cleanest of anywhere we stayed in India and it was a treat to stay somewhere where there were no major upkeeps needed  rare it seems in Delhi  The food was average in the restaurant but the service was quick  In fact the room service was above average  They delivered to us outside of hours and within minutes  The only problem we had was at check out  We had booked through Travelocity which charged our Visa two months in advance so we had already paid  They charged us again at check out so we were double charged  The gentleman at the front desk said that travelocity only held the room which I knew was not true  We are currently working with travelocity to receive a refund for the first charge  
N => Only So So Should be Improved I was here for a week plus  The hotel was booked by local colleagues for its location to the office and sort of good facilities  It was only a fair stay all around My room on the th floor was small and cramped feeling as was the bathroom  All of the typical business class hotel amenties are there ironing board TV bathroom toiletries internet access etc  Housekeeping was fine but the room is starting to feel worn We ate in every retaurant in the hotel since our days were very long we were too tired to venture out much  While none of them were bad none of the restaurants were particularly good either  The restaurant on the top floor that had some Thai AND Italian items on the menu not a good sign played dorkey s music at dinner  I recommend that you explore the area for dining ask for recommendations outside the hotel etc  if you have the energy  The pricevalue will also be better Im sure The staff are well meaning and try hard but are not polished  Better training would help as you can tell they are trying to please    its not an attitude problem The pool looks nice but I had no time for it The surrounding area is not that attractive but partly thats Delhi i e  trash everywhere traffic no sidewalks etc So the stay was not a disaster but Ill try to stay elsewhere when back in Delhi  India has traditionally not welcomed international investment in infrastructure and it shows in the pricevalue of the available hotels  But there are better in town Filed for my husband   he wont get his own account  
N => Could be better was there with some business partners from Japan overall OK but for the kind of charges they have it cld have been better they have customised services for japanese guests like TV channels breakfast in japanese style etc  Food is not too great for the kind of money they charge better to eat out in the shopping arcade outside the hotel 
N => Extravagant party The staff at the Crowne Plaza Hotel New Delhi is outstanding  I had price issues with our first night stay  The hospital that booked us waited to long to get the lower price rooms  I was forced into the higher price and didn t know until check out  We paid and went on to the hospital where I was admitted  One of the managers came to the hospital to speak with us  I was impressed  We went back after I left the hospital  Room was lovely  Used hotel guidedriver for  days  Awesome He made our trip Service slow in main restaurant and food not to our liking  The Japanese restaurant was awesome 
N => Only Price If you are just looking for a good hotel just to stay for a couple of days  This hotel is a good choice Just expect a ent Room adn nothing else including service 
N => Dont stay there We had three arate one night stays here during a tour in India Night   we were put in a disabled room not ideal as we are both able bodied but as only one night we put up with it Night  we arrived early evening and when we switched on the lights some worked some didnt the TV and air con did not work  The electrician arrived quickly but by then we had been allocated what was supposed to be a premium room and as the paperwork had been completed we moved  we had originally had a superior room  The smell of urine hit you as you walked into the room we quickly realised that it was coming from the air con  By now it was getting late to eat so we again thought  only one night we will leave the air con off Night   we arrived   pm  This room again smelled of urine but was superior room on the nd floor again the air con was the problem as all we wanted to do was sleep we left the air con off The reception area was pleasant some of the staff were surly others OK Restaurant overpriced and staff not particularly helpful Business centre charge for mins minimum for use of computer      on current exchange rate Would never recommend this hotel  
N => Reasonable business stay   India style After  visits to Delhi this has become my hotel of choice three different times  due to my company budget policy  around  The recent Indian currency depreciation helped  so   rp now translates to just  vs  over   months ago PositiveHotel management responded to my complaint  at the managers reception I was upgraded to club room with less noise Certain issues  Short power outage happens several times a day even in the lobby  after terror attacks I was kind of alerted   Avoid connecting room  noise from neighboring room is too loud  I heard the cough next door all night long the first night   Flush noise from toilet  you are out of luck everytime your neighbor flush the toiletIt is really important you know which room to check in completely different experience     Food Chinese restaurant serves typical European Chinese food not interesting for Asians especially Chinese people at all  Tried once reluctantly after invited by fellow Western travellers  Chef was trained by Chinese chef before Indian food  seven is great  my favorite  Prawn CurryNew club room is okay with flat screen which visually enlarged the room  Better than InterContinental Grand feel safer than Le Meridien     Payment  be careful about DCC conversion which adds    on your bill in   Took me several months to ontain refund  check clearly when sign insist on paying in local currency Location is not ideal  only close to Humanyuns Tomb and Purana Qila good to visit plus Lodhi Garden for a relaxed afternoon  no way to get a taxi back     
N => Great Hotel surrounding area not so good Great hotel with good service overall  The rooms are well equipped but on the small side  Tried out the  restaurants   the top Chinese restaurant was very good although quite pricey for India standards   the bottom one was not all that great on the food seems to cater more for buffet dinners  Staff generally very helpful  The pool area was a bit small and lacking but then who goes to Delhi to stay by the pool Not much in the surrounding area except small shops and restaurants  
N => Better after moving to a deluxe room We first booked two superior rooms through their website and requested a non smoking room  However when we checked in we got a smoking room and one of the room was a wheel chair accessible one which we did not ask for We then changed to one deluxe room  The room was nicer and at the end of the hall so be a little bigger  There was a king size bed but because we were three of us we had to pay for  extra persons  I dont understand why this was so because we only asked for one rollaway bed which at first was a arate mattress on the floor We refused to accept the mattress and asked for a proper rollaway  If they are going to charge extra why should we have to sleep on the floorService at the front desk was polite and efficient  They guided us well with all our inquires  In between we checked out for  days to visit Jammu and they let us keep our extra luggage for free and kept an arriving parcel for us  They brought us a free fruit basked and mini chocolates in our deluxe room but not to our intial superior roomThe dinner we had at their restaurant Seven was nice  There was a ghazal group singing  It was my parents anniversary so they brought us complimentary cake  Their morning breakfast at Le Cafe was good with variety Good stay for good service  
N => Not worth the money The hotel is out of the way from the airport and main tourist areas  According to staff there was nothing to see within walking distance of the hotel  Rooms were OK but walls were pretty banged up and the bathroom smelled awful   a damp smell that would seem to come and go for no reason  Worst part was getting ripped off for the airport pickup  My room was booked through work and no one mentioned airport pickup so when I arrived I went to the pre booked taxi stand paid  rupees got my receipt and headed towards the taxis  On my way there I noticed my name on a sign from the hotel  He told me the ride was complimentary one of the services the hotel offers so I cancelled my taxi  Upon checkout I questioned the  rupee charge and was told it was for airport pickup  Staff refused to accept that I was told it was complimentary and demanded that I pay it  I was with a co worker who also heard it was complimentary  Now I dont even really care about the money work pays for it but it is the principle of it that bothers me  I was told it was free then charged X more than the regular taxi rate  That left a bad taste in my mouth  
N => Nice hotel but good distance south of centre We stayed here on the first night of kuoni taj tour  Arrived early morning am and they managed to get us in a room for half eight which we werent expecting  First room hadnt been serviced but a quick call to reception got us another room  After a few hours sleep we went a wander to the local shops to go to an ATM  Its obviously an expected part of india to encounter fairly stark poverty but it was still an eye opener  But we felt perfectly safe There are a couple of ATMs within  Mins of hotel quite handy as you cant get rupees before you go and the exchange desk at airport didnt take debit cards only credit  Hotel will obviously change currency for you  Staff were very friendly and hotel was very modern and clean  we were obviously a bit wary of the dreaded quotdelhi bellyquot so we played safe and ate in the hotels indian restaurant quotseenquot which was excellent lovely indian food and fairly reasonable from a western perspective  We also had a couple of drinks in the atrium bar which was lovely if fairly quiet  A few of our fellow travellers ate at a local chinese called quotlotusquot  i think without any ill effects  As mentioned you are a fair distance from india gate and connht square certainly not walkable not a problem for us as we were on a escorted tour but worth bearing in mind  Overall a good choice for delhi would stay here again  
N => haven of rest in crazy city We stayed here twice during a recent tour of India  Both times it was a welcome place to stay in a hectic city Spacious lobby spacious roomextremely clean and well kept Staff was helpful breakfast was good I wish all the other places we stayed had been as nice and comfortable 
N => Very Helpful Stayed at Crowne Plaza with group of  girls for whom this was part of India experience  Asked for and got all the help I needed in providing girls a once in a lifetime experience  They arranged day trip to Taj Mahal with meals and guides  Could not have been better  Gave us free late check out  Girls loved the gift shop in the ground floor level  Finally surprised me with complementary transport to airport on our departure  Cannnot fault the attitude of the staff in all areas  Would unreservedly recommend this hotel to any group like ours  
N => The Crowne Plaza Surya Sucks On entering the grand ble lobby I was immediately struck by a very damp and unpleasant smell  This remained the case for the entire week I stayed at this hotel  I found the service in the hotel to be below average and at times was totally ignored by staff at the hotels reception  The breakfast was very average indeed  The hotel lacks atmosphere and beware the rooms on the st floor often the very rooms offered by some travel websites  These rooms are damp and the one I was offered had the carpet lifting from the damp  I asked to be moved to a room higher up in the hotel at an additional  per night this was done  Definitely not worth the extra in fact a total rip off  I have been to Delhi a number of times and this was by far the worst hotel  No atmosphere and definitely not recommended  
N => Overall a bit pricey and not the best experience  Was clean with an impressive lobby but the room was smallish had old or and had a shakey door that needed to be repaired  There were reations going on so the pool was out which i was not informed about although the gym was well equipped and modern  Management were rude to my friend when she checked in and the post cards that i gave to the bell desk with money never arrived in Australia  Would not return to this hotel  
N => Very mediocre but expensive hotel Everything at the Crowne Plaza is mediocre  From the food to the rather tacky room or to the service  The rates are rather expensive and you could stay at a much better property for the same price  I was upgraded to the Premiere Club floor but was unable to partake of the amenities and perks  I was told that I was not able to use the Club as I was upgraded  I checked and it is indeed the policy of the hotel that upgrades to the Club Floors are not welcome or able to use the Club floor facilities  I complained and explained that it is like being upgraded to a First Class seat on a flight but not being able to have the food service or amenities of it being welcome to use the seat only  They gave in and told me that I could use the Club floor facilities but I felt very unwelcome and like a charity case  I booked a very expensive auyervedic massage in the spa  The spa is nothing fancy but does have a large amp interesting menu of auyervedic massages  My  hour massage was a nighte due to the construction going on  floor above  I listened to pounding and jackhammers the entire time  I obviously was unable to relax and enjoy the massage and ended up more tense than before the massage  I complained and was given an apology about the construction  They did not offer to give me another massage gratis or even give me a discount  You can get much better service or food and quality for the same price at many other Delhi hotels  
N => OK   but    Booked online with hotel website for  rooms under  name  When we arrived they said they had  room for  people and were sold out  After a few minutes of haggling they had made a mistake in their hotel reservation system and accomodated us  The hotel was OK but quite far from the airport if youre just staying overnite as we were  
N => Awesome Staff Nice very clean hotel  The staff at this hotel is outstanding  I had price issues with our first night stay  The hospital that booked us waited to long to get the lower price rooms  I was forced into the higher price and didn t know until check out  My husband was furious  We paid and went on to the hospital where I was admitted  One of the managers came to the hospital to personally speak with us and clear up the issue  I was so impressed we went back after I left the hospital  So glad Our room was lovely  We used the travel desk and booked the nicest driver and guide for  days  He even took us to his home for tea We loved this hotel  The only draw back was the main restaurant  Service was slow and food not to our liking  The Japanese restaurant was awesome Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in New Delhi  
N => Get the feel of Crowne Plaza Delhi HiThis time I traveled with a group of friends and found this hotel in Delhi as an upket property to stay with  We all were booked for two nights and our stay at this hotel was an experience worth sharing about  Our Check in was done with soft drinks and warm welcome by the Reception lady room was on the reated floor with paintings in the corridor reflecting Indian artimpressive Room was upto the international standards with cozy Bed and latest furnishing  Our Breakfast at Coffee shop was served by smiling and professional staff  Yes one must try the Health club which they have recently introduced with good equipments for health concious travellers It was truly a  star experience in all the respect  There should be more hotels like this in every city of India ThanksJames 
N => Excellent Product supported by Good personnel Hi my name is Wilson Garry stayed between rd   and th    well this was my first ever vist to India I was highly worried about my trip to New Delhi  As soon I reached the hotel I was impressed by the warm and grand Lobby of the hotelcheck in was prompt and welcoming was given a room on the nd floor which was fresh and contemporary  Room had features like LCD screen TV Cubicle bath bedside console etc Staff was highly helpful and warm in their approach  Had my Breakfast at Le Cafe which was lavish in choice and taste On my last night I had my Dinner at Sampan the chinese restaurant and my experience with food was ok but staff was extremly professional and knowledgeble specially the Captain Only thing with little sluggishness was their Travel Desk which I used for my way back to Airport and it took some  minutes to get the Car at the porch Overall a good experience to be with Crowne Plaza Delhi Thanks 
N => Dirty To be avoided in Dehli  
N => Did not live up to the hype  
N => Good even without an upgrade  
N => Flughafen in der N he  
N => No pude casi dormir  
N => Best Effort by Ratan Tata for the middle class I found it extremely comfortable very near to New Delhi Rly station travelling to the hotel by a cycle rickshow only  There is a metro entry just out side the hotel  A very good restaurant with a very reasonable price If compared Room rent vs Cleanlilness  it will rank  in India  Normally the middle class cannot efford a lot of money in hotel but desire cleanliness  a good restaurant etc which is very well available in Zinger  It is also located extremely well convenient place  For Train Traveller even better  Now onwards I even prefer to spend some money for this hotel to stay rather than choosing to free stay in our guest house in Noida Thnak You Tata Pankaj Kr Baruah 
N => Terrible place   Avoid it We booked Ginger Delhi for  days and left hotel with in  hours of checking in My expectations were not great  I was looking for quotcleanquot with no frills accommodation  But the room was far from being clean  There were bunch of long hairs on the floor  The hotel staff did not even check if the room was clean before handing over the room  When called housekeeping   they cleaned the room and only cleaned what we showed  After a second glance there were more bunch of hairs on the other side of the bed that the cleaner royally ignored The walls had shoe prints   be that previous guests wanted to make their footprints before they left  But at least I expected housekeeping to clean those ks from the wall  The quilt was almost black from one side and had couple of yellow spots all over  When called the housekeeping to change the covers   they came with two quilt covers   one was dirty and the other was less dirty  We asked him to change the less dirty one The hotel staff cared not to clean anything as they have enough guests who keep coming on the name of Ginger   The Taj Group The bathroom was clean   but there was no hot water  You can fall sick if you would take cold shower in winters  There was no toilet paper in the bathroom  We had to call thrice to get the toilet paper There was a very small window in the room and the room was damn compact  I would have appreciated if they could at least make a bigger window  That would have given the room a bigger look  Stay there only when you have no option or  be when you just have to spend few hours and keep your expectations level for a usual Pahargunj hotel for which you would pay not more than Rs  We moved the same day to Quality Inn Gurgaon and paid hefty amount for that hotel as it was the last minute booking but at least our stay was damn comfortable there When complained to Ginger customer service   we only got the regret letter for the inconvenience caused and there was no refund I would strongly advise to avoid this hotel  This is not the place where you can spend two days  
N => Centrally Located Our journey to the Ginger Hotel didnt start too well  We booked a vehicle at the airport taxi counter  Once out of the airport our driver claimed he didnt know where the Ginger Hotel was located  We gave him a map but this didnt seem to help him  Fortunately he could take us to the tourist office who could phone Ginger for directions  The very helpful man from the tourist office phoned Ginger Hotel and was advised that theyd over booked but we could stay at their sister hotel for free When we didnt believe this they passed the phone to us where the manager apologised profusely and explained how the sister hotel was so much better  We still werent convinced and realised it was a scam and after we demanded that the taxi driver take us to the Ginger Hotel manager we were given a ride to New Delhi railway station where we made our way on foot to the hotel  Of course we were immediately able to book in When we were at the so called tourist office we saw other taxis pull up outside  The moral is that if you book a taxi from the airport then dont believe anything the driver or anyone whose help he enlists tells you about your hotel The Ginger Hotel itself is quite bland but has clean rooms with comfortable beds and a TV for those who cant live without the box  They even have Wi Fi at a price and there is a gym  Security is first class  There is a self service cafeteria on site which provides exceptable food  The major downside was the booking process  Wed originally enquired about a room in ust but it wasnt until  months later  days before we were due to arrive that the hotel was able to accept bookings  The only other problems were we were promised IT assistance when we experienced difficulties with the Wi Fi connection but this never arrived despite our phone calls and there is no luggage storage facility at the hotel  
N => Cant ask for more   Real value for money Hats off to TATA for gifting us Ginger  Delhi  I booked this place after reading several reviews  but when I stayed there it exceeded my expectation  Positives    Spacious and spick and span rooms for just Rs night  LCD TV  Very neat toiletshower  Complementary mineral water   small bottles on daily basis  Centrally located   Connht Place outer circle is hardly  km  CP is the best place to dine   hrs restaurant  Water dispenser on every floor  Very courteous staff including room service staff These were just to name a few Negatives   No auto stand in front of the hotel  got to walk abt  mts  Restaurant not that great  They are not capable of handling more than  customers at a time  I had to wait for  hr to grab my breakfast  I suggest that you have food here only if unavoidable   The travel desk has very few Indica ACs  It has more bigger cars which are more expensive  Indica AC Rs   hrs kms but Esteem   Rs  more Otherwise no complaints  I think Ginger should open similar hotels in Mumbai also Wish you a very happy stay RgdsVenkatesh 
N => Descent hotel at excellent price I was travelling to Delhi from Mumbai and this hotel came as a surprise choice after me completing the train ticket on irctc co inI was directed to www railtourismindia com and booking of this hotel was easy  Thought what services would I find for K room Went to the hotel and voila its an excellent located hotel Central Delhi  Rooms are well maintained lobby is good They dont serve food in the rooms but Comsum restaurent at the lobby provides yet another surprise  Good hygenic food at very good price Overall very good experience  
N => Noce Place But Not too Good I visited this place on my Recent visit to New Delhi  This hotel is good but is not ar per the desired standard  I know this is a budget hotel but the quality is not soo good  I have also visited the Bangalore Ginger hotel but this one in Delhi is not so good  Though rooms are neat and clean but the area where this is located is not good at all  Also there is not any room service at all  So this is also a problem  
N => The Best Hotel In Delhi After so much hassle in Raunak hotelit was a relief to come to Ginger Hotel I always searched for  stars hotel But after seeing the  star Raunak Hoteli didnt want to anymore Even though Ginger hotel is a budget hotelit is the best value for money The service was goodthe food was splendidthe room was spacious and cleanthe staff were very helpful and understanding I really enjoyed my stay there    I really look forward to another enjoyable stay there 
N => if you can only find this hotel    This was one of my worst experiences I finished a whole days work in delhi amp had to return to this hotel in the night  The arrangement for my stay was made by my office in Mumbai  I tired calling the hotel serveral times during the day to inform them that i have arrived amp will be checking in only later that day only in vain as no one answered the phone all throght the day When i left to head to the hotel we reched the new delhi railway station but NO ONE seemed to know where this hotel was located  I tried calling them up one again  As there was no answer amp since it was am i began to panick amp called a colleague in mumbai for some assistance  He gave me the same nos to dial but again all was in vain as no one answered After almost  hrs I finally managed to ask around amp we got to the hotel  I was furious  As i walked in i realised that there was absoluteley no one at the front desk the phone too was ringing after looking around the front desk executive came amp asked  can i help youquot I gave him a piece of my mind amp asked him what kind of a hotel do you run  This was a chain affiliated with the TATA group i the went to my room apart frm my bad experience this a budget hotel costing apprx rs  a night  There is no room service or house keeping  You have to dine a self service restaurant  The food is similar to your meals alavailable at a food court in any mall in mumbai  The food is average for the price If you have a low budget then this is the place for you if you can find it 
N => love the staff commitments towards service               it was a gud exp   been serviced by the ginger mgt    at the cost tat i iccured i cant even imagine a service like the one i got                   its true to say tata as the most trustable brand of world                 
N => A Good Basic Transit Hotel A Basic Service Hotel right next to New Delhi Railway Station  we took a  Bedded Family Room as were travelling with  Kids and wanted a Hotel Near Railway station as we were transitting next day to Goa by Flight As we had seen Ginger in Haridwar and Goa and were impressed with the cleanliness chose this hotel Very Nice Hotel Location was bit bad due to Metro work on in the near vicinity  The Railway station Parcel office etc making it very noisy and dusty  But once inside it was nice Rooms needed a little bit more care by guests as well as by staff  On checkin found that Soap dispenser was empty and was taken away bu housekeping who forgot to replace it  The Toilet seat is installed too High making it uncomfortable  The size of the Toilet was too small  They should have selected better wc to fit the size Linen was good amenities Ok size perfect Restaurant at the Lobby level was good economical and good Best part is that you can go anywhere from here due to its central Location  
N => Inexpensive but know what youre getting into My friends and I booked a room at Ginger to save some money  It came highly recommended by my friends coworkers in Bombay  However we ended up not staying there  On the drive there our driver muttered in Hindi that cheaters go there  Then as we waited to check in the fellow customers all men started casually inching closer to my friends and me  We were a group of   something women and two of us are white  While we  very well have been perfectly fine it would have been nice to know about the area and clientele before we booked the room  Later in the week my friend reconnected with a friend from Delhi who told us its located in the Red Light district  That reaffirmed our choice to return to Claridges Couples men families   Im sure its a great deal  Women traveling without male companions    it might be prudent to stay elsewhere  
N => Good Place Good place for a   days leisure time  The room service was quick and the food was satisfactory  The rooms were neat amp clean I would recommend to the viewers to stay at this place  
N => Great value and excellent location Ginger was just what we needed for the final  nights of our   week stay in India It was basically an Indian travelodge so dont bother staying if you want an authentic heritage experience but the room was immaculate by western standards rather than Indian and complete with a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities TV comfy bed AC etc The location just outside New Delhi station was perfect for arrivingdeparting via the station within walking distance of Paharganj and Connht place and a short metro ride to Old Delhis main attractions Red Fort mosque etc  The  hour restaurant came in handy for our day trip to Agra and early morning flight back to London   staff at reception were also happy to ring for a metered cab to the airport when the travel desk in the foyer tried to charge us Rs to get to the airportAt Rs a night this was slightly expensive than other hotels we stayed in in India but worth every penny  
N => Value hotel in a good location Good value hotel Clean rooms very close to the train station  good choice for a nights stay in Delhi before your onward jurney  
N => good value for Rs  I stayed here once alone and once with my wife in uary  for Rs   Overall a good hotel but there is a problem in getting taxi drivers to find it  Most don t recognize the address whether spoken or written down  But I eventually go there on every ride with perhaps a ten minute delay  It is a forty five minute car ride to and from the airports don t use a rickshaw  Rooms were Spartan but spotless on both visits  The lobby was slightly less clean yet more than adequate for a quick stop over in Delhi  The restaurant had reasonable food and prices Rs  entr e but the menu was limited during any given meal  
N => Good Hotel Hotel was good and neat and clean  As I presume they are a no frill hotel where we need to fetch our water as well  I guess they can modify those a bit  The toilets and the bath does not have any buckets or mugs  If you have a kid you are in for some trouble with that  No room service or bell boys are there  Not a bad choice for a stay next to NDLS station 
N => Nice enough close to New Delhi railway station We pre booked a room in Ginger hotel for our first night in Delhi  The taxi driver had serious problems to get to the hotel as the hotel is next to an enormous parking lot for rickshaws as well as the train station  However he got us there and we were greeted by the friendly staff  Our room on the th floor wasnt that spacious but nice  Clean sheets flatscreen TV and complimentary bottles of water as well as teabags and coffee  The bathroom wasnt the cleanest we have ever seen but good enough  As we were leaving for Rajasthan we ided to spend one more night a week later  We asked the front desk staff upon checkout about making a reservation for that night  They said that there were rooms available  However they could not make the reservation   we had to do it through the Ginger website    To use their internet access we would have to pay more than a  rs for a wireless card   hour costs about   rs at any internet caf  in townThe next time we came to Delhi we found out that the metro is extremely close to the hotel about  metres from the hotel gate  There is however no metro sign so you have to ask the guard to show you the direction  Ginger hotel is also very close to the railway station which is convenient for early morning departures but also causes noice at night  The hotel isnt five star but for the price its definitely recommended 
N => RESERVATION NOT HONORED  left stranded My friend is stranded in Delhi because Ginger Hotel didnt honor her reservation  They had record of the reservation but there were no rooms available  Its the middle of the night her first trip to India and Im here in the US desperately trying to google some kind of alternative  So   BE CAREFUL  Double check that they are ready for you  Otherwise its a great place to stay  
N => Great value for money with few kinks As an NRI family from USA including  teenagers  and traveling in India for the first time we were a little apprehensive about our Indian travel agents recommendation re this hotel  However overall experience for our  rooms over  nights turned out to be excellent   We checked in at AM on  and checked out on  without any problems  They gave us partial credit for the st night which was a pleasant surprise  Access to the hotel is cumbersome but since we had hired a private car with a driver this was not a problem for us Best things were front desk svc hr restaurant cheap lots of variety mild food good svc laundry svc cleanliness uninterrupted hot and cold running water free water bottles free tea amp coffee and access to a safe  We did not miss not having room service  Although the family room does have  beds it is very small and quickly got congested with all our baggage  So our ision to book  rooms and have access  bathrooms and extra space turned out be a good one  The biggest issue was inconsistent housekeeping svc e g  some days we got only   towels or no TP for  people one day no svc at all  They always fixed the problem promptly upon complaining but it did not have to be this way  The only other issue was night time noise at the Rlwy Stn which we drowned out by running the Ac fan without the Ac  Also WiFi broke the nd day and never got fixed even though they said it would be fixed within a couple of hours   a problem not unique to Ginger but commonly encountered in India If you want a  star hotel Ginger is not for you  But I would definitely recommend this hotel to any family that wants basic modern value for money  
N => Good value for money and good location Stayed at the Ginger New Delhi mainly because of the location   it was a few mins walk to the train station and metro line so that is why we chose it Overall it was really good value for money clean hotel and friendly staff ROOM   room was an adequate size wooden flooring and clean  The bathroom was a wet room but I found the toilet was a little high   such that when you were sat on the loo your legs wouldnt touch the floor  The complimentary water provided in the room was really good and a nice touch SERVICE   there was a restaurant bolted next door to the hotel with access from the hotel which served food which was great as it meant we didnt have to start hunting around for breakfast LOCATION   it was very conveniently positioned which was handy as we were catching the  train to Agra so we just had to hop out of bed and walk to the train  The location meant that you could hear the station announcements and was noisy at times but we were in a city after all so noise was expected  Ear plugs are something I now carry with me at all timesOTHER   there was a little room which had complimentary water iron and ironing board and newspapers which was nice to have COST   very good value for money   cant fault this hotel on thisOverall I would definitely stay again great little hotel clean good value for money   what more to do need By no means was it the Ritz but it was functional   just what we needed 
N => Leisure at very low cost I usually go on my bussiness trip to New Delhi  I prefer to stay in in Ginger Hotel  It has all the facilities that any four star hotels would have   Moreover easy to check In  Good Bed and superb guest service 
N => Superb Best choice at New Delhi Train Station We have been there in t  It is directly located at New Delhi Train Station Cleanest hotel we had in whole India in this price range around Rs  Reservation by internet or phone  TV aC h warm water clean linen  
N => Awful service from managment Stayed there last year when Delhi was the first stop on the India trip and I wanted to make sure that we had a reservation somewhere before we arrived  The rooms were OK not splendid relatively clean though  Substantially overpriced however compared to those in hotels on the same street including those with larger nicer cleaner rooms  We were there for several days so re negotiated the price after the first day based on comps but then the management did not honor that when we checked out  I am Indian but grew up in the US and my travel partner was American so not sure if this was because of tourist gouging or just horrible service  Anyway if you make any agreements on price make sure you a get them in writing and b have management sign off immediately or youre screwed  
N => Ok ish We had a semi deluxe room we had booked it on their website a month in advance  We arrived late at night and it took a while for them to find our booking confirmation  The room wasnt too bad by no means spotless the usual peeling paint etc but it was pretty clean compared to some of the dives we had previously stayed in India  The restaurant was OK and bfast an interesting buffet affair but not awful  
N => BAD SERVICE I made a reservation weeks before arriving in Delhi and specifically asked for a driver to pick me up because it was my first time in India  They sent me a confirmation with booking and pick up driver but upon arrival on the airport nobody was there  
N => a popular choice in the area This is the best and also the most popular hotel in the area  The main reason lead us to book there in the first place is so we can catch the early train to Agra and late train back from Jaipur  Other than that location does not matter so much as Delhis landks are quite spreadout you would need to get a car from places to places no matter where you stay  The hotel travel desk can arrange a sedan for a very reasonable price  We take full adavntage of that and used cars for three days to save the hassles of negotiation everytime getting into a local transportation  Overall we are quite pleased with our stay  The room is ent but bathroom could be better equipped to avoid the floor getting wet so easily  The roof top resturant is not bad the breakfast was better than we expected as we read bad review about it before we went and dinner is even better  
N => Terribly dirty and tricksters The bedroom was terrible very dirty and we found some cockroaches in the bathroom The receptionist was a trickster we booked it in advanced paying and they didnt keep our reservation when we arrived in the evening we found that our room was sold and they tried to give as a lower category room for the same price after one hour of argument we got the room we had booked The breakfast wasnt good  
N => Poor   not nearly as good as the websitereviews made out As per other reviews at booking it promised a free airport transfer  After informing the hotel of our pickup time car didnt arrive called up and was told that we had to pay extra and that the car would be with us in mins if we were willing to wait   forcing us to get our own taxi and make our own way there Area around the hotel is utlra poor  True this is where the budget hotels are but its pretty dire no pavements on the roads did not feel safe even though we were a group of three  Was promised internet access in the rooms for rupees per night only to find that internet actually only works on the ground floor in the lobby so anytime I had to use it I had to sit in a lobby full of ppl to use   not what I had in mind  Rooms are ok size there is no bath just a wet room shower and its clean  Breakfast on the roof top is poor only the omlette or cereal is worth eating the milk had congealed fat in it  Coffee is instant coffee that you make yourselves  Travel desk   gave us a taxi which had a dodgy driver took us to too many places bazaars without asking fake government travel agents that we didnt want to go in the end we had to send him away   no refunds tho  Overall the interior of the hotel is clean but location breakfast and staff service terrible  Dont trust the staff too much  
N => Mixed bag Generally great    clean st good location but   generally little niggles Firstly the food especially breakfast is utterly dire  breakfast is a buffet set up and was cold and generally quite disgusting  You are better off trying to get a discount by getting a room without breakfast  Evening meals meanwhle are overpriced and nothing special you are better off going out to eat Our delux room was extremely comfortable and easily the cleanest place we stayed in India but had no window and had an annoying dripping tap i found the service to be good One thing and I am being pedantic but    laundry is overpriced and then it all comes back with a number written in ker pen on each individual piece that even now  weeks later refuses to come off  It was also late coming back turned up with extra items that I sent back   and was promptly charged for anway  
N => unprofessional and unhelpful staff It the damaging for me when i was arrived in India  I booked the hotel  they inform me your pickup is free at the time booking  But there is no taxi for me at airport in midnight  When I reach the hotel  Guy behind the front desk was sleeping  Next day I book the taxi for Delhi sightseeing hotel book the taxi  He charged very high price to me USD  Breakfast quality is very bad  They charge me the room rent also high INR    Tax for one day  I check the room rent out side of this hotel was INR double and single with breakfast    paid to touts and autoriksha drivers  I cant recommend to any single lady couple senior citizen to stay this hotel 
N => Budget hotel not very clean I booked this hotel on recommendations from other reviews  I am a bit surprised at the reviews that give a  to  star rating  I have traveled extensively and can say that this hotel does not deserve anything more than a   Stayed  nights and the biggest problem was the cleanliness of the room and in particular the linens  I read in previous reviews of others stating the same  The bedding on both beds had many stains and soiled areas and seems to have not been washed bathroom was also less than adequately clean  I had a room on the back side of the hotel only to be kept up all night by barking dogs they moved us the following day to a room that had no window  Another concern as also in other reviews was the fact that upon check out I also experience the front desk asking for more money although this room was prepaid including taxes  I firmly stated I would not pay and they backed off  Location is desirable for good access to Delhi train station  
N => Safe landing spot to get over culture shock Reserving mid range to budget hotels is rough in India but we managed to book through laborious direct email process bring print out to prove payment youre likely to need it  Aside from normal odd Indian stuff this relatively bargain hotel is fine  Delhi is a shocking dirty din at first so this hotel was a nice safe haven for us  The rooms were clean bathroom okay Indian budget bathrooms you take your chances nice people working there and a good spiral staircase is I think where the quotGrandquot part comes in   anyway we stayed a second time when we passed through Delhi again for a night so there you go  Indian breakfast buffets not my favorite thing but this one was as good as any weve had so far  Hotel Grand Godwin isnt a place youd stay too long but just fine for arrival and regrouping a couple of days or a stopover  We arent the youthful backpacker types and we did well enough here  It wont do if your the oBeroiTaj kind of traveler but otherwise go ahead and stay here  
N => Great service at the Grand Godwin Our time in Delhi would have been miserable if we had not stayed at the Grand Godwin hotel  Our room and the service were really good  The breakfast on the rooftop restauant was fantastic  No other hotel Ive stayed at in India does breakfast like the Grand Godwin Our room was serviced daily and we also had a newspaper delivered every morning The travel desk was helpful and able to sort out travel to Agra and back  We opted to hire a driver for Agra and were really glad we did this  No hassle at a reasonable price  We also hired a driver for the day to take us to Delhi fort the Crafts museum and Santushti shopping mall The hotel is at a good location  We were able to walk to Connht Place to shop at Fabindia and the official Cottage Industries shop and beyond  You really didnt need a rickshaw or taxi for this  Just keep walking down the road 
N => Very good hotel even more so for the money Great hotel to stay at in the less touristy part of paharganj but does not suffer from it The roof top bar is good too Rooms clean beds comfy Will be going back to this hotel when I return to delhi  
N => Ejoyed our stay at the Grand Godwin We booked one night at the Grand Godwin our first night in India as well as the airport taxi  which was worth it  If our experience was good and there was no quotextrasquot charged by the staff we would book  more nights after two days in Agra  Our experience at the Godwin was good even great and we are very glad that we stayed  more nights after Agra  This hotel seems to be really trying to teach their staff about service and what a western tourist might be used to  The more you engage their staff the more they are friendly and try to help  The rooms are nice and include wide screen tvs  The breakfast is delightful on top of the roof and all other meals we had there were good as well  Dehli is one crazy and intense city but staying at the Grand Godwin was a delightful experience  
N => Okay hotel but you get what you pay for     We just returned from a trip around India and stayed at the Hotel Grand Godwin for  days  The room was clean and nice but Id be hard pushed to recommend it We stayed in room  no windows and were constantly woken by the noise of other people showering in their rooms noise came through the air conditioning shaf above our bed When we went to leave at am the hotel staff tried to charge us an additional fee saying we owed a luxury tax  We showed them our email receipt as we had booked through their website which clearly stated our online payment was inclusive of all taxes and they still continued to demand an extra  in rupees  It took them about  minutes to begrudgingly agree that we had actually paid everything This really left a sour taste in our mouth and we can only imagine that they try this trick on most people in the hope of getting extra cash  
N => Rooms are clean but organisation  Hotel is ok but the team is a very big problem  If the manager is not there its not possible to find a solution  Twice we had to pay more that was agreed  If we didnt we have missed our planes Whatever is your agreement on the prices even by mail they finally oblige you to pay the standard prices  As people at the reception change regulary during the day you never meet the people you dealt withI met people at the reception that was upset because they have booked on the net but reception didnt book the rooms  And the hotel was full     One day There was a girl arriving at midnight she had to find an other hotel despite her booking  
N => Very good hotel We arrived to Delhi and took a pre paid taxi for rps we had a little argue with the driver as he was very rough with us so I didn t give him any tip and he wanted to hit me         you will notice that the people generally is very rough in Delhi  We apparently book a luxury room at this hotel for  euros a night so the gave us a suite and I the room was so good a room that you can find in a  stars hotel in europe with plasma tv and etc    I saw the standard one and is nothing to do with the luxury one so I recommend you to book the luxury one for  or  euros more you won t regret  The room was very clean and the hotel installations very good  The restaurant small but good food and the serve a buffet breakfast very good  They also have a travel agent who can arrange you a pre paid taxi or any other thing you need for a reasonable price  The hotel is located in the heart of the city close to cannht place and the railway station The only negative thing is that when was the time to check out and pay the recepcionist told me that the credit card machine didn t work who I didn t believe so as we didn t have enough ruppies to pay the bill we had to pay in euros with this transaction they rise the original price because the exchange so I think they are use to do this with the foreigns to make more money so if that happens to you tell them that you have no other way to pay and force them to use their credit card machine what I should have done in that ocasion If you take a train to any other place once you buy the ticket and go straight to the platform to wait for the train do not show the ticket to anybody who ask you to see the ticket because there are so many cheaters who seem to work at the station but they will try to take you to a travel agency to sell you a new ticket just by telling you that your ticket is not valid Do not believe them just wait for the train to be called and get in  It is incredible that in India as you are a tourist everybody will try to rip you off so be carefull and have a look on the travel blogs to see the experiences and taxi fares of the other people who have been already  
N => Adequate rooms poor service The room was reasonably clean but not free of the occasional scurrying cockroach  The hot water facilities were pathetic but otherwise the bathrooms were clean and functional  The room service was a consistent problem I had to call to get the room cleaned  The night staff at the reception were rude and ill trained  My offense apparently had been to check out at  AM and thus trouble their normally scheduled program of doing nothing  It shouldve been Monthy Pythonesque funny except it wasnt  Word of advice establish your superiority in the pecking order quickly and firmly else the staff will be inclined to take you for a ride  The over friendly tourist is an exploited tourist  
N => Good location A block away from the Ata where we had stayed at the start of our tour we ided to try this place on our way through Delhi to the South  Modern bedrooms and helpful staff  The rps cost included a good breakfast but not an airport pick up  There is a taxi service desk in the lobby Good value for money 
N => Good hotel Excellent Value What a good stay  It is really difficult to find a well priced reasonable hotel in Delhi   stars go for  and all the rest just have very mixed reviews  Of all the hotels this looked like the best on trip advisorand was also mentioned in Lonley Planet They did not disapoint  The hotel cost  for two for the night so brilliant value  The hotel was clean very nicely appointed and service good  We were in room  a little noisy but we slept fine from the street but we wanted to look out  Just ask for a room on the side if you need very quite sleeping time Great location between new and Old Delhi right next to Connht Place and New Delhi station We also booked a driver for the day through the hotel and it was excellent value rs for the day hrs or km Breakfast was fair with a nice selection was offered on the roof  no viewsBathrooms and shower all in one but worked well and this seems to be common in India If you are looking for nice hotel and are not wanting to pay much this hotel will deliver far more than you expect Staff were friendly except for reception Auto rickshaw to Connht pace will be about rs  I think this was too much but out off all the places in India you need to watch out in Delhi  Just set a price before you leave and if you are comfortable with it it  not be worth the argument for an extra few cents off when you convert back  Much better than I expected 
N => Bad experience This hotel will aggressively try to sell you as many things as it can in terms of guided tours etc  The lobby is nice enough   and thats all they show you on their website  The room was dingy and smelled  When I asked about going to Agra the hotel tried to book an exensive guidedriver and would not give me directions to the Delhi train station as an alternative   because there was no commission in it for them  They also said no trains were available   which was a lie  I was promised an early breakfast because I had an early check out and was not given the breakfast  There were other problems and the staff was unpleasant to deal with  
N => Watch for bait  Nice and clean hotel but do not prepay They raised our rate when we got there although we paid a month before arriving with a credit card through their website  They gave us an employee room not the superior room we booked until we paid an additional amount  While we were there every night there were travellers at the reception yelling at the front desk managers because they were asking for additional money vs  the prepaid amount so this seems to be standard practice for this hotel  The staff is not friendly and not accommodating although this scam goes against all international hotel reservation rules  Even when you show them their internet printed receipt and E mails they wont give you a room until you pay an additional amount  This is too bad because otherwise its a nice hotel  
N => Dingy hotel Room was very dark and dingy with only one window that lead to a concrete wall  we also had a guy outside our room all of the time who kept spitting  try to avoid as they clearly dont clean the sheets 
N => Only with Caution      We booked to stay here th ober  on our first night in India then again for the th   nd ober  for our last  nights We were picked up at the airport on the th ober at gone midnight and fair play to the driver he waited a good while for us because our plane was delayed The check in procedure is a bit lengthy but we eventually got checked in and taken to our room  Room seemed clean on first inspection but arriving at that time of night we didnt really have much choice  The sheets to the bed however were really disgustingly dirty but wed thought ahead and brought our own sheets and pillow cases Our real problem with this hotel came with our quotCONFIRMED BOOKINGquot for the last two nights of our holiday  I called to check the reservation after hearing of other peoples hotel problems and was told that we had no booking that they had never heard of us and that we had never previously stayed at that hotel  Which was news to usThe chap on reception told us rudely that there were no rooms free but if we came to the hotel there might be this we didnt understand at all  I asked for the reservation manager who is the only person apparantly who could use the computer system to call me and explain what was going on  Needless to say he never called and we found somewhere else to stayIncase youre interested the other place we stayed at was a b and b in the Defence Colony and it was really good   orchidretreat bednbreakfast com So if you are planning on staying here bring your own sheets check your booking several times and dont be surprised if they deny you exist  
N => Rude and unprofessional staff I tried to check in to the hotel but encountered unprofessional discourteous and rude staff at the front desk  I was asked for a picture ID and I gave my international drivers license  The hotel manager sent it outside the building to get a photo copy  I waited for over  minutes to get back my license  Meanwhile I paid the advance for the room and my personal details were entered in the hotel register  When there was no sign of the hotel staff returning with my license I was told that the license will be delivered to my room and I could now check in  But I insisted that I get my license back before I move in to the room since I did not want to take any chances with it  At that point the hotel manager told me rudely that my ID was not good enough and wanted a copy of my passport  I was told that his name was Joginder Sharma  I expressed surprise at his behaviour and called for his supervisor who apologized and offered to help me check in  But Joginder Sharma kept on arguing that he has to follow the rules of the hotel  I asked him why he accepted my drivers license for an ID if he needed the passport and he did not have an answer  Needless to say I refused and moved to another hotel  
N => Ok My friend and I stayed in a quotsuitequot  The room we were given had no window  We asked to be moved to a room with a window which was only granted the next day  Both quotsuitesquot were clean and fairly spacious  The showers were open no doorcurtain  The toilets were a bit dirty but ok  You generally have to lower your standards when staying in India  Breakfast was served on a roof terrace  The selection was modest but tasty  The hotel provided cheap Internet access  Beware when checking out I paid with Visa card and I was told that I had to pay a fee for using the card  I refused and in the end I did not have to pay the fees  
N => Beware the pubic hairs We originally stayed in this hotel for a few nights in  after being recommended to it by a couple we met at another establishment  They had pre warned us that the sheets although apparently cleaned did have some mysterious stains   as if theyd been stored on a floor and that was certainly the case  However having seen and heard many horror stories about Delhi hotels we figured that wasnt too bad and at least the showers were hot it was conveniently located to New Delhi station and breakfast was included even if it was fairly ropey  So we ided to book it for our last night in Delhi before we flew back to the UK  Well that was a mistake  First they claimed that they had no deluxe rooms booked   even though theyd confirmed our booking via email only  days before   and tried to charge us for the a Super Deluxe room  When we refused and pointed to where theyd handwritten the correct room booking in their reservation book they agreed to charge us the rate we wanted   which was lucky because Super Deluxe and Deluxe are exactly the same Sheets were revolting   covered in pubic hairs and clearly not laundered in between guests  We demanded they replace all the bedding and towels but even then the sheets were still covered in hairs  It was all so gross I barely slept  At  rupees its not a cheap hotel for Delhi so I would definitely recommend NOT staying here EVER 
N => good value We arrived early morning to Delhi and a lift from the airport was arranged via the hotel good idea especially if you come for the first time to India  We had no problems to get a room immediately but double check at the reception the check out time to avoid paying extra  The room was fine perhaps not up to European standards good cleaning could help  Staff was rather helpful  The best was the restaurant quite cheap and really good the most important no problems whatsoever afterwards As regards location it is only two minutes walk from the Grand Bazar and the New Delhi train station and certainly the street is slightly less crowded that the Grand Bazar  Overall it was not a bad choice especially compared to other hotels in the area  
N => Average Hotel Our stay at the Grand Godwin was simply average  Its located in the back street of Delhi and looks like a quotdodggyquot neighborhood  Only the day manager in the front desk seems to be helpful the others dont seem to speak or understand english  Their travel desk is too expensive  Avoid using them if you can  The rooms are clean but the washroom do not have bath tubs or proper shower areas  If you are looking for clean washroom DO NOT stay here  Its quite basic but cheap  
N => Hotel correcto pero no contrates nada con ellos     
N => Excellent Staff  Very Courteous  Accommodative  Careless Owner  I am very pleased with the staff  Staff is very courteous  The ownermanagement is lucky to have such a wonderful staff  It is not enough to have good staff  The ownermanagement should have good outlook and try to improve the condtions  Air Conditioning is not adequate Staff maintains the rooms and bath rooms to their ability  But the ownermanagement should care to update the fixtures  Any bath tub or commode will go bad inspite of regular maintenance  It has to be replaced at one point  Similarly the Air Conditioning  If the ownermanagement can wake up and replace the old fixtures with new once at least oncer a year this hotel can get more than  stars  But for now this is a  star or less I give   credit to the staff  The restaurant is good  The staff in the restaurant is excellent  This hotel was arranged for us by GetsHolidays Breakfast is included  We had to leave the hotel early morning by  AM to go to places twice during our stay  Since we went from US we were only trusting the food at the hotel and were affraid to buy any thing on our way in Dhaba etc  We requested the kitchen staff to pack some breakfast for us  They did an excellent job by packing toast jam muffin and fruit  I really appreciate the efforts taken by the staff to pack the breakfast in such a neat manner for us  Even though the hotel is away from the central Delhi it is in a quite neighbourhood  Close to Delhi IIT and AIIMS Since we were there in y the weather was un bearable  It was very hot and once we go out we sweat  Even though we travel in an air conditioned car once you step out you sweat  We had vacate the room by noon  But requested the staff to allow us to take shower once we came back to pick up our luggage that we left in their cloak room  They were kind enough to allow us to take shower before we left for the Air Port Overall this is a nice hotel and I would not hesitate to go back again  I would highly recommend the hotel to others  
N => Value for Money We wre around  dors stayed in Grand sartaj   execlent Hospiltality given by staff neat n clean place to stay at reasonble price  Food was execlent   Parking a little problem  Good Interior   
N => Dirty and overpriced We stayed at this hotel for one night out st night in Delhi it was a horrible experience It is close to a main road but not within walking distance to anywhere very noisy all nightBugs in the room The breakfast was terrible and overpriced We were booked at this hotel for another night after our tour and our last night in India we did not stay here as we couldnt bring ourselves to enter this hotel again  
N => extremely helpful Our first stop in India looks nothing but comfortable rooms and well sited for shops and sights  The staff couldnt do enough for us we left our safe open in the room while we went for breakfast and the boy making up the beds drew it to our attention when he could have easily helped himself  Also when my husband was struck with Delhi belly pretty inevitable they immediately let us have our room for another night and made all the phonecalls to tourguide taxi etc  for me which was a great relief to me  Very clean so I dont think he cht it there  Restaurant a bit pricey but some european food on the menu  
N => Dont Do It When our car pulled up it appeared to be an abandoned parking lot  The outside of the building looking like it was being prepared for demolition with scaffolding covering the entire front of the building and the building looking old and repit Upon entry through narrow make shift entry we were told to take a seat without being informed why as it was  hours passed check in time After waiting ten minutes with no one approaching we were served a cold drink on a coaster that had been used many times before and had the stains to prove it Finally a staff member approached to say the room wasnt ready just yet  The request was then made by ourselves to see the room first  Shortly afterwards we were told we would receive an upgrade and room would be ready in another  mintues  We were escorted to the th floor to where it was clear the lobby matched the rest of the hotel in being old and lacking maintenance  Whilst walking along the hallway paint in large areas could be seen peeling off the walls Upon entering the room initial presentation looked okay  When looking near the window the white curtain was extremely dirty below the glass   An inspection of the bathroom revealed an old bath and shower in one and then on looking at the sink human hair could be seen  We immediately requested to see another room to which we were told we would have to wait further  We waited in the room given for about  minutes before being moved to the th and top floor  The room slight better presented than the other still showed many signs of age including a horrible repair on the side of the bath that was all blistered and cracked Later in the evening we received a recommendation from the front desk for an indian restaurant and confirmed we would a taxi with a meter  The staff member said he would tell the taxi directly of the address after I asked for the address in case we got lost  Instead of telling the driver he passed it onto the front door staff When we walked outside I heard a loud speaker coming from next door and could see some taxis parked around the corner these taxis are repeatedly used by the hotel  Not long after a very old taxi struggled to pull up and as we got in the driver a boy lucky to be  was hurriedly putting on a blue shirt and clearly had been asleep  The front door staff told the driver three times of the nearby restaurant it was very clear to see he didnt know where it was yet they allowed him to leave  We left the hotel and not  metres up the road the driver stopped the car and run off to find directions  He returned  minutes later proceeded to drive on the wrong side of the road and then tried to tell us a fixed price  As soon as possible we got out and walked back to the hotel  On the way back the driver was following telling us he would take us for free  Upon our return to the hotel we immediately complained about the situation where another staff member lied to us and told us the fixed price was the mimimum price  later the price it would be not even   After being questioned further the staff member agreed the rate should be by the meter  This clearly brings the question of corruption and hotel allowing the taxis to charge more and makes you wonder about kick backs Not nice when the hotel is being eptive and trying to rip you off  Finally another taxi was arranged and after we refused the same driver another was found  This driver again to our dis did not know where the restaurant was and after stopping for directions several times gave up and dropped us off somewhere near the restaurant where we walked around for  minutes getting directions before finding it  turned out it was not difficult to find and close to where we were dropped off except we were sent in the other directionThe following morning whilst using the shower my wife slipped over in the slipery bath which had not bath matt  Breakfast was ordinary with no chef there to cook a fresh omelette or eggs which is standard in every good hotel  Then we waited for  minutes for the lifts to leave the building  With only two lifts for the guests they cannot cope so much so that we later found out one of the lifts jammed a full load of guests were actually stuck in the lifts for  minutes  After all this we checked out  days early what a bad hotel  This hotel claims to be  star it would be lucky to be a  star Find somewhere else its old service poor its dirty and smells of corruption 
N => Customer friendly attitude of Hotel Staff This Hotel located in the Heart of the City is best suited to travellers whether on a pleasure trip or business Staff extremely attentive to your needs and my room stay was extended when they realized that i had an evening flight to catch and my room was also automatically upgraded from executive to deluxe upon my arrival really appreciate their efforts  
N => Loved the Room and Location We had been to a conference in Delhi We happen to stay at this hotel for two nights  This was my fourth visit to this hotel  Every visit of mine was same with warm welcome  They serve welcome drink on arrival  The Rooms are on very higher floor with view of the city  It is just excellent  If given a chance to travel to our national capital I shall surely stay with this hotel on my every visit to Delhi 
N => Great experience It was a great experience at Hotel stay  Staff and service was excellent  Location of the Hotel was good  Close to shopping area CP of delhi Timing and quality of breakfast was good Overall it was a nice experience 
N => First Hotel experiance in India   loved it The hotel was part of a tour package  My room was clean the bed comfortable and staff very attentive to this tired travlers needs  Although the outside noise could filter up to my top floor room one pull of the drapes and all was blocked out  Highly recommend  
N => We enjoyed this hotel but asked to change rooms We have no idea what we actually paid to stay at this hotel for three nights as it was part of a package that included airport to and fro transfers transfers to train to Agra plus Agra Taj amp Fort tour with a guide  Having said that given the overall package price I think it was very reasonable  We got a guide one day to tour Delhi itself then the other two days were arrival and Agra so we did not see much of the surrouding area of Connought  We did speak to some guests who thought it was fine to walk around the area and they said they felt safe both during the day as well as the evening  There is a pretty good mixed AsianNorth American breakfast buffet included so anyone should be quite happy  The lobby is pleasant and the staff were always helpful  When we arrived and were shown to our room and we were really disappointed  The bed looked so small I knew that two of us could not comfortably sleep in it for three nights The room was also very small and if there was any window it was not immediately obvious  It  well be that is what we paid for   so hard to know what they actually book for you in a package and call a double room but the porter himself made a call and the next thing we knew he took us to another huge room with a king bed huge corner window views complete with loveseat and it was great  There was no additional charge when we checked out so I think the hotel is pretty ent for doing that  Big difference between the room though so try to check to see what it is you are getting  Often a double room is simply a double bed   not even a queen and many are not used to that This hotel was only a few minutes drive to the train for Agra as well  
N => Excellent place to stay at while touring Delhi After a disastorous start to our trip to Delhi with a different hotel we booked into this hotel at the last minute Excellent staff excellent rooms and service Rooms are on par with a  star hotel in UK and all the amenities were present like table chairs flat screen tv nice king size bedsafe etc The walls are quite thin so you could hear next door which was the only down side The breakfast was included although it adequate and not spectacular Overall good place to stay to explore New Delhi  
N => Good start to a tour Located close enough to many restaurants and shops but the hotel floors are high enough that you are not disturbed by traffic noises  Very clean and nice hotel  Excellent breakfast  
N => great hotel stayed  days in the hotela great reward to end your trip in indiathe best hotel i have ever beena bit expensive for india but worth it 
N => Quite pleased The hotel provided a welcoming plate of fruit and cookies upon my late arrival after  am  The room was very clean had a flat screen TV and nice little extras such as free bottled water and a kettle  It was a nice start to my trip  Overall it was utilitarian rather than elegant but the condition of everything was excellent  
N => Hans Plaza   Not Bad At All Arrived in India in Delhi with prebooked premium double room for  nights at Hans Plaza  Spent night including taxes thru Travelocity  This was in beginning of high season end of tember  Arrived at midnight and was told that our room was not available until the next day but they had an upgraded suite for our first night  At first the suite seemed quite nice but the ac wasnt adequate and in the morning we were constantly disturbed by what sounded like a sing songy door bell  It was the service elevator bell which was hidden right next to our suite  Really horrible to hear every  minutes when you are whacked out on jet lag  If you stay here beware of this suite location next to the service elevator  Next morning they switched us to room  on the corner and it was splendid ac worked fantastic the toilet flush was powerful the hot water shower was fine  Room was bright quiet clean and comfortable enough  I have the feeling that the rooms  differ greatly in this hotel  Dont know what the regular doubles look like  Desk personnel were very very helpful with our many inquiries  Room attendants were eager to please when we asked for extra towels etc  Staff overall was really very nice  An ordinary but large buffet breakfast was included  The Indian food was better than the western  Odd to be offered chicken cacciatore for breakfast Location of hotel was very good walkable to Connht Circle and easy to get rickshaws for other attractions  Note I noticed the prices for the Hans vary a lot on the internet travel services and I missed out on a night quotGood Buyquot from Travelocity that came and went fast  I recommend staying here if you want a large convenient hotel in Delhi in the   range after taxes  It is an overpriced city  
N => Dont be duped by the  star label We were travelling for the first time in India for both business and pleasure and part of our trip had to include a visit north to see the amazing Taj Mahal  We arranged a stopover in New Delhi and because it was our first time we used the Flightcentre website based in Australia to review and book a hotel there  We are used to travelling in business class and it was important for us to have a good quality hotel whereever we stayed  Flightcentre had rated this hotel as four star but when we arrived we were in for a real shock   more like a one star than anything   the rooms were dreadful small and pokey and threadbare Certainly none of the amenities one expects from this rating accomodation were there   by the way this was halfway through our trip and we had stayed in some amazing  and  star hotels throughout India NOT booked through flightcentre so this was not a case of misunderstanding the quality provided in India  Anyway we grabbed our luggage and got out of there as fast as we could and moved to the stunning Imperial Hotel that was one of the best hotels we have stayed in ever  So moral of the story   be wary of ratings   especially from Flightcentre Australia   and if you are looking for a budget style very basic hotel with a  star price tag then Hans Plaza in New Delhi is the place  ps   flightcentre refused to reimburse us for our booking because we didnt give  hours cancellation notice  
N => A lil expensive for an average stay In the  hotels that weve stayed during our trip in India covering Delhi Agra Sheraton Mughal amp Mumbai Ascot Hotel the Hans Plaza was expensive for a pretty average hotel stay  We paid Rs for a triple sharing room amp Rs for a twin sharing room incl  buffet breakfasts  The lobby was modern seems newly reated in the minimalisticquotzenquot look and we were offered cooling welcome drinks while we were checked in  The reception staff were cordial amp efficient at checking us in The conciergebell person was friendly amp helpful in helping us to get our bags to the room  We got both rooms side by side and right near the elevators but we slept well without much disturbances from outside though the doors were pretty thin  The rooms were clean with woodish floors and ble flooring at the entrance amp to the bathroom Twin rooms were a good size but it gets a little cramped with the extra bed in the triple sharing room  TV has over  channels but most were in Hindi though there is StarMovies amp HBO Bathroom only have showers no bathtub but clean and water pressure is good  We had some problems with the hot water kettle and some of the power points did not work  The staff were very helpful though and fast in responding to our needs You do get very good views outside as the rooms are all located above the th floor  The only downside is that the two tiny elevators are a little slow and sometimes you have to wait a while for it There is a good selection at breakfast buffet for both local amp international tastes  However the variety is the same daily so after a few days youll get kinda bored with the food Overall we had a comfortable stay  It was well located within minutes of walking to Connht Place and the area was safe I suppose this  be good value in Delhi where hotel prices are known to be sky high at times We did see quite a few business type people staying at the hotel so I guess this is considered a business class hotel  
N => Good business travelers hotel well located We spent the first two nights of our Indian holiday in this centrally located hotel close to shopping and with easy access to both New and old Delhi  The breakfast was good though it felt a bit warm in the sunshine through the windows of the breakfast room  The room was adequate in size modern in facilities comfortable and clean  The staff was unenthusiastic but adequate  We would stay here again  
N => A Bad Experience We wish we had read the reviews before choosing this hotel  It was truly a bad experience  Firstly we arrived at  p m  and needed to rest after a long flight  They were repairing a sewer pipe in the next room hammering it out of concrete this went on till  p m  When we complained to the manager he turned his back and walked away  The restaurant had been moved to the second floor our hotel directory stated it was on the top floor  The wait time for food was exceptionally long and the restaurant Manager lined up three of the restaurant staff and started shouting at them in front of customers  The front desk was not helpful in arranging transport to a tourist attraction that we wanted to visit  I could go on but I think that is enough  
N => Among the Worst in more than Eur  per night hotels in the World Staying in this hotel is really an awful experience which started from the reservation for me  This hotel does not respond to e mails and their booking forms on the website  You get welcomed by a poorly lit entrance shabby lobby and reception area  Cable TV was out of order in  out of  nights I stayed there  From hot water tap once muddy water came out  The electric kettle for teacoffe in the room had a UK plug which of course does not work in India  The remote control for TV was broke  This hotel needs a big overhaul repaint and motivated staff  It does a great damage to an already bad image of Indian hotels  Just a week back I stayed at otel in Madrid for  Eur per night it was just perfect  For  Eur per night this hotel sucks They do not have indoor swimming pool as they advertise on Expedia  In fact in India there are hardly many indoor pools  
N => Expensive not  stars We booked this hotel on line  The photos shown were not like the hotel  Internet connection was done via WIFI and very expensive because it was so slow  The bar staff at the roof top bar were the slowest people ever no imported beers avaliable There was only a hand full of chairs no where to sit The roof top resturants was closed too  The resturant on floor  was clean and newly orated but very slow again we waited  hour for our food and drinks and there was only  tables of people eating  The place needs a good clean up outside rubbish blowing about etc  Food for breakfast was always cold  The toaster was broke too  The plus point is that its only a  min walk to the Inner Circle of Connht Place 
N => Not a good hotel Please do not stay at this hotel   especially if you have kidsWe got to the hotel very late in the night   amthe room was below average the toilet looked clean but there was a nasty smell the shower was brokenTo top it off though our electricity kept cutting out that was because I was trying to warm up my babys milk in the kettle provided   basically everytime I put the kettle on the electric would go it took  phone calls and a visit by the duty manager to rectify this I asked the manager if our breakfast could be sent to our room as a one off as it was very late now and we  not get up in time he said he was not sure if he could do that but he would get back to me guess whatnever heard from him after that Dont stay here if you can help it   disgusting service and manky rooms 
N => really really bad I stayed here recently and had a really bad experience First of all reserving a room was a hassle  One person says rooms are available and an other says not available  They also seem to cheat people on the rates mentioned on their website  As soon as you talk to them they change the rates especially if you are foreigner  I had to get a person in India to book in Indian Rupees to get a cheaper rate  So if you are a paying in dollars good luck   The customer service is bad  The rooms lock is broken tv signal is of very poor quality  Had to wait for a long time to get response from reception  Tried to get a car at the front desk but did not get the car on time or a hotel car as promised but instead given a third party car which is barely running  The driver assigned was also rude drove recklessly even for indian standards and did not bother listening to anything i said and stopped at places for his own errands Th breakfast was below average also very few varieties and they even charge exorbitantly for drinking water  And finally while checking out the receptionist calculated the bill wrongly and cannot even do basic math like    and they charged me more than they quoted  When I questioned the bill they tried to trick me by saying that the dollar rate changed blah blah blah    after which i told them i booked the room in indian rupees and told them its really not good cheating customers just because you can get away  In sumy I am never ever going to stay or recommend this hotel to any my friends  
N => Economical no frills hotel right on Connht Place  It was a clean and economically priced hotel right on Connht Place  Surprisingly quiet seeing as how we had a room next to the circle  Nothing fancy but great as a centrally located place as we came back through Delhi for one night on our way home  
N => one star only Stayed about three nights safety and courtesy was not an issue for us we were an all female entourage staff was nice and helpful my emails were always promptly replied to  This is a one star hotel described as mid range by Lonely Planet and in some other sources as a three star  but its not  Hotels in Delhi are expensive which  explain the cost of this place  But for a thousand more rupees  you can get nicer rooms that are a welcome respite from the craziness that travel in India can be  Rooms are small bathrooms are purely functional but grotty and inconsistent of our three rooms only one shower actually worked only one provided hot water  To be fair we did not complain but only because we did not expect the problem to be solved within the time we had  There was no internet access from what I could see For backpackers looking for a great deal this is not it  For travelers who want just a touch more amenities or if you are staying more than a night Id look elsewhere  
N => Wildly overpriced After we were stood up at the airport by Hotel Blue just as well they didnt turn up by the look of it from the outside we had to wander round Connht Place in the dark looking for a hotel  Hotel  was the cheapest we could find but rp about  for this dump was a complete rip off  We only stayed there because it was too late to be lugging our backpacks around  OK sized room dirty bathroom fantastically noisy both from outside and in  Anywhere else in India youd pay about rp for this standard  
N => utter dump our hearts sank when we walked into our bedroom  it was a complete dump with a rubbish bed and whilst technically it did have an ensuiteshower i wouldnt have washed a dog in it  bearing in mind it was costing about     a night it was atrocious  another aspect was that at night time there were permanently men sleeping in the corridor right outside our room   i dont know if they were meant to be security but one was a really skinny old man with a big long beard dont think he would have been much use in a fight   and you hear them talking when you used the toilet or even when you were lying in bedalso when we checked out the owner tried to charge me for  nights despite the fact id paid online for the first night  at the time i thought it was an innocent mistake but having read some of the other reviews im now wondering about that would never go near this dump again and certainly wouldnt recommend it to anyone 
N => Beware Hotel  I booked their driver to pick me up from airport and he didnt turn up  When I came to check out they overcharged me for the room and I mistakenly paid without checking amount first  When I noticed they admitted cheating me out of money but refused to refund it  They said they would call the police if I didnt leave immediately without refund and would tell them that I had physically attacked the manager  All staff started nodding vigorously and I realised I was outnumbered and left having lost  rupees  On recounting this story to my tailor later that morning he nodded and indicated that this was not the first time this had happened  
N => Stay Away We ended up staying here after our travel agent switched us last minute  By far it was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in  Staff were rude and dismissive rooms were like a prison cell and really dirty  The worst thing was the bad smell that was everywhere the lobby the rooms the corridors Yuck 
N => The Worst Hotel Ive ever seen Hotel Alka is a place you really have to avoid if youre planning to stay in Delhi for a night  We booked a double room from Italy looking at the pictures on their site  When we arrived the room not cheap as it costs at least  Inr was the smallest room Ive ever seen and without even a WINDOW  The bath was terrific and very dirty and the bottles of water we found in the fridge were refilled as they were already open  The lights were only NEON and the result was that we were really upset  I asked to change my room and they showed us a room even worse  The hotekl terrace was a inch square full of destroyed things and garbage and my girlfriend wasnt able even to smoke a cigarette  So for the st time in my life I ided to live the hotel without paying any rupee telling the manager we didnt want to spend a single minute in such rooms  The area of the Hotel is out of Connht Circus because the P Block is not in the circle only A to N blocks are in  
N => location good but hotel not good This hotel is in excellent location but is quite dingy and not even two star rating in my opinon  Hotel arranged airport transfer it cost  rs really too much  On arrival the hotelier was keen to arrange tours but fortunately that put me off  Most rooms has no natural light The offical goverment delhi tourism office is at coffee house about  yards from the hotel  A full day tour in a air condition coach with an excellent tour guide costs  rs but you do have to pay the entry fee at each site  I thought the tour was good value  
N => bad choice the smell is the first sign we wanted to be centrally located but didnt want to pay luxury hotel prices and Alka was recommended at the airport   the elevator was being torn apart in the lobby that was ok then there was the smell of the hallways with the rotting carpet bad sign  The room was ok the only window looking out to the stairwell  why they put a window there I will never understand  Anyway the smell of the hallways started creeping into the room and we couldnt get to sleep until am  Its central but being central in Delhi isnt neccesarily a good thing its a really dirty city  We left first thing in the morning and made our way to the Hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar south delhi which was clean and lovely and smelled great     
N => One of the Worst Hotels I have ever stayed One of the travel agents booked this hotel for us myself wife and two children for two nights  The lobby itself gave notice of what was in store for us  We were booked into a deluxe room which when shown brought my wife to tears  I managed to talk the receptionist man to upgrade us to a quotsuperior deluxequot room which was slightly bigger  No hot water unclean I am being polite linen and floors  One has to bend down to walk the corridors of the hotel  Luckily we were out shopping most of the day and were dead tired to notice anything upon return The hotel is a text book definition of a quotseedy hotelquot  THEIR CLAIM OF FOUR STARS IS A SHAM    STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL Did not even dare try the complimentary breakfast    had breakfast at the adjacent Saravana Bhavan most recommended  We checked out as fast as we could on our last day to check into the Intercontinental Grand  Could not stop my wife and kids grinning ear to ear just entering into the Intercontinentals lobby  
N => I wish I read the reviews before I went Spent  nights there and it WAS a disgrace  I was in tears the moment we got there  The lady at the desk was rude and just did not seem bothered she kept answering the phone instead of checking us in  Got to our room and realised why it was so dark    there was no windows it was small and cramped and no facilities were available On paper it was   but in reality this place had no class to it at all  The room was hurrily cleaned the bathroom was worn into and the place smelled of stale urine The male members of staff just kept staring its bad enough outside  but in a hotel just adds insult Our complimentary breakfast they tried to charge for and the breakfast was a waste of time  Only thing we could have was cold toast and coffeetea from a dirty thermos  I asked for a banana but that was too difficult they cannot give  banana as its not on the menu they have to give me a fruit platter as that is on the menu     I questioned whether this was a   and was told that they were no doubt  But trust me  I seriously had doubts Do not go there even if you are desperate  The only positives things were that it was close to Connht place  which is good for shoppongeating and the Vega restaurant had good food  
N => Dont believe the   rating Stayed in Alka for  nights do not believe the   rating the hotel would be lucky to score   in any other countries  The room was falling apart with mirrors all around but no natural light  The airconditionining had to be turned on by ringing up the reception  Do not ask the quottravel deskquot to put you in touch with an agent as they will charge you through the nose for a quotcity tourquot consisting of the driver ferrying you from shops to shops where they get commission  While youre at it try to arrange your own taxis as well as the receptionists only call their chums who charge you through the nose and refuse to switch on the meter  The only good thing about the hotel is probably their vegetarian restaurant Vega  
N => Service was atrocious creepy place for women to stay My friend and I stayed here as part of a Geckos tour  Our room was cleaner than the Hotel Perfect see my other review but what really was astonishingly bad was the service  The staff were intent on a getting tips from us and b entering our room for various quotreasonsquot  At one point one of the staff knocked on our door to tell us they had beer for sale   Each time we opened the door they tried to get into the room and I had to stand directly at the door to prevent this  When we arrived we offered the porter the standard tip for each bag that he carried to the room but he tried to tell us that it wasnt enough and even went so far as to take a  rupee note out of my hand without my permission They scowled at any tip we offered for service and when we were in the cab just about to leave for the airport out of the blue they raised the cost of the taxi by  rupees Stay in a nicer place you deserve it 
N => DISGUSTING DUMP This was the worst hotel experience in my life and I have been to about  countries during my travelling time  There was supposed to be an airport pickup in the deal   that did not happen and neither did I get a refund on my taxi fare to the hotel  Breakfast was supposed to be included and that did not happen either  The room had NO windows the bed had a bottom sheet and on the top was just a blanket   no top sheet  I was supposed to stay  nights but I took a taxi into town and got a flight out of India for the next day  I was charged double the fee back to the airport than the amount I paid for a taxi to the hotel as well and it was driven by someone connected to the hotel  This hotel was listed on an International Hotel site and I have written to them about my concerns about this place and note that they are no longer on that site and for the sake of other unfortunate travellers like myself I am glad at least for that  
N => A good middle range businesstourist hotel This was our first stop in India and was organised through the tour company  There was nothing wrong with this hotel the rooms were clean the staff were friendly and honest and the location was quiet at night I left all of my valuables which amounted to a few thousand dollars US in the care of the front desk  I was a bit worried when they didnt give me any receipt but shoved it in a locked draw  No problems when I got it back as everything was still there It was only about m away from the main shopping street and if you need a landk then quotPunjabi Sweetsquot a very busy street side eatery is in the same lane  
N => pleasant surprise A clean placefriendly staff  a good place to startAn India tour  Although it was  a m when we arrived everybody was extremely helpful  I cannot imagine a better place A simple but tasty breakfast  Nothing more to be desired as far as hotels go   I shall be back soon  
N => Gateway to delhi     thiz was the statrting point in india   as my flight got delayed   the driver was still there a fresh waiting for me with a smile   i waz imprezzed   while smoothly chekin in  in the morning i was happy that theze people have real pictures on there website of the room they were havini got one of them   yeppei   room service was quick in the morning nice room well orated amp good staff with a smile  
N => Worst Hotel I stayed at in India DO NOT BOOK HERE This place was awful The location is terrible possibly one of the worst areas of Delhi  The Hotel itself looks okay until you get to your room    the bed had a bottom sheet and thats it No top sheet I asked for one and got a Single size sheet for a double bed  I asked for a double sheet and got another Single Sheet Then I noticed that the bottom sheet had some questionable stains on it but was told it was clean    I pulled it off the bed and told them to replace it Finally I get a bottom and a top sheet but had to make the bed myself And that was the last time I saw a clean sheet for my entire  night stay They dont make up your room during your stay    no clean sheets or clean towelsThe Hotels web site states quotDirect Dial Local amp STDISDInternet Surfing on requestquot let me explain that a bit    Internet surfing is about  blocks away at a disgustingly dirty place that provides computers to use for internet activities  Long Distance Calls can be made at the Reception desk    while standing    right beside the front desk in the way of and within ear shot of everyone coming and goingTheir web site also states quotRunning Hot amp Cold Waterquot which is true but if you want a Hot Shower you have to ask for the Hot water    every morning even if you asked the night before you still have to ask again in the morningRooms are Air Conditioned but it is turned off every time you leave your room and you have to ask for it to be turned back on when you get backThe Hotel does not have a kitchen that I could see and the food is awful It arrives on yellow plastic plates toast wrapped in tin foil a dead giveaway that this is take out from somewhere else I had an omelette one morning that was too big for the little plastic plate I even had to argue with the guy in the dining room abut getting an egg for breakfast I was told it wasnt breakfast On asking for advice in regards to storing my luggage at the Railway Station over night so I could take the train to Agra I was told without a doubt that they no longer store luggage at the railway station but the Hotel could store it for me and I could even stay at the Hotel for another half day at half the day rate when I return to rest up before my flight  Well that was a lie    the train station does store luggage The staff are not quotQualified amp Trained Staffquot as their web site states I had nothing but problems with everyone from getting bed sheets to food and at one point someone came to my room knocked once and tried to come right in    good thing I bolted the door as I was just getting out of the shower a cold shower My room rate was inclusive of breakfast but when it came time to check out I was billed for two cups of Tea  I was told breakfast does not include Tea WhateverFeel free to contact me of you would like more info about the Hotel or visiting DelhiI was asked to come here and write a good review    there is no way I could say anything good about this Hotel And just to qualify this review I stayed in  different Hotels during my travels in India and this was not only the worst    but the worst Hotel I have EVER stayed in 
N => Friendly modern and clean Although situated in what was not a great area the hotel was an oasis   friendly attentive staff and clean rooms  It was also close to the metro making it easy to get about without having to shout for a taxi  
N => Dont stay here cheap but definitely not cheerful      We chose this hotel after hours of searching on the internet and reading in books as there is so much choice in Delhi and we definitely made the wrong choice in many ways  We were only in Delhi for the night as we were flying out to Kathmandu the following morning and this hotel served its purpose but thats as far as it went Good   The location is pretty good for the centre of Delhi but is way too far away from the airport   The bedroom was a good size and contained  double bed and  single along with a table and TVBad   The hotel offered a free pick up from the airport but we couldnt manage to get through to them to arrange one  They refused to pay for our taxi when we arrived and also refused to take us back to the airport the following morning to compensate   The room was very dingy even for night time   The room was very dirty and there were flies and even a cockroach in the bathroom   The area immeiately around the hotel was not very nice and you wouldnt want to venture out the hotel at nightOverallIt  be very hard to rate a hotel when you have been there less than  hours but this place is simply awful  It  be cheap compared to a lot of choices in Delhi but theres a reason for that  Pay a little more and get a better place  
N => Hotel ok but    The hotel is ok as backpacker hotel  The staff is very nice and helpful  BUT be careful not to accept any extra service from this hotel  The hotel offered us to get a taxi for the airport and charged us RS  which is what you normally pay for renting the car for a whole day  A prepaid taxi will cost RS  Later we learned that the hotel had asked the driver to pay them the tip we had given him and they told him that we had not payed for the trip in advance  That made us very angry and we shall never recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => QUICK SWITCH TO A FLEAPIT HOTEL This hotel did not honour our booking through Hotels com on     il   We were travelling with two children one   and the other  months  We arrived in Delhi at  am in the morning of  il the booking was for the night of  il  We cht a Delhi Traffic Police controlled prepaid taxi from the airport to the address provided with the booking receipt  The taxi driver could not find the address and took us at  am to a  tourist office  travel agent  The travel agent rang the hotel and my husband spoke to the hotel reception who claimed that the hotel was full and that we should make our way to the sister hotel   Hotel Ivory Palace in Karol Bagh New Delhi  At this hour of the morning and with two children we had no choice  The Hotel Ivory Palace can best be described as a flea pit  We subsequently found out through a travel agent that the room that we were provided was worth  AUD or about  INR  We had paid for a super deluxe room their premium room with arate bed and a cot for the children at   AUD a night  INR  We were provided with a room that had  One bed for all four of us and when we complained an extra mattress was thrown on the floor  Unclean bedding  A hot water system that did not work and after repeated complaints it was fixed on the last day  Strong kerosene odour for the entire duration of our stay  No  premium bedding and pillows   No clock radio  No coffee and tea making facilities  No complimentary newspapers  No housekeeping for all the days we were there  No in room safe  No refrigerator  No rollaway bedsThe Hotel Ivory Palace was not close to Connht Place or the railway station which the Hotel Balaji purports to be  This was the reason I had chosen to book it  We tried phoning the Hotel Balaji Deluxe in the following days but we could not get through on the number provided on the booking sheet  After unsuccessful attempts to get through to the hotel we ided that it was a short stay and we should devote our energy to seeing Delhi and getting organised for the next part of our holiday  There was obviously a connection between the two hotels as the Hotel Ivory Palace was happy to take our booking sheet as proof of payment  Our feeling is that if the Hotel Balaji could not accommodate us they should be obliged to provide an equivalent or superior standard of accommodation as opposed to the significantly inferior option we were given  The only recompense we received after several complaints was that our room service breakfasts were covered by the hotel Approx  INR  We feel extremely ripped off by the experience  I was trusting that Hotels com is a reputable booking service and be we should have paid more attention to the review  DEN OF THIEVES   RUN FOR YOUR LIFE  on Trip Advisor as they document the sort of contempt that the Hotel Balaji has for guests booking and prepaying over the internet  
N => Den of theives RUN FOR YOUR LIFE We booked a suite thru expedia selecting the hotel based on its free airport pick up advertised  We arrived at midnight no one was there  We called and eventually we were met by their employee who got us a cab  Certainally we could have walked thru the doors amp got a fixed cab ourselves  The driver got lost  Eventually we arrived gave our itinerary   and we given a small room  We said ours was a suite  adults  kid the clerk waved expedia papers he possed in our faces and said that was our room  No problem we would get is sussed out in the morning I was too tired to argue  We showed our papers in the am the manager said the clerk had bad eyesite  We we upgraded to a slightly larger room  I overlooked the construction painting in the lobby the luke warm hot water the roach filthy blankets I dare not use all to check out    where the clerk insisted on paying for the lift from the airport  x the amount we would have paid if we got the taxi ourselves I said it was included and I paid for a suite for  nites amp only got one lets call it even  No he said  Expedia charged us too little we should not have gotten what we paid for After  hour and  failed called to expedia disconnected I paid as not to miss my connection  So I paid twice the amount for a room and x the amount for the taxi      and had a lousey stay  Back in Delhi staying at a much much better hotel for hte same cost  Avoid the Balaji unless you want to get riped off deluxe  
N => good place It was anice place to stay  You could enjoy a nice place to live as well as a nice location to wander about  So i liked the place while my stay with some of my friends We had a great time out there  
N => quite surprising Its not a particularly quiet hotel to be honest  We seemed to be lucky in that we got one of the rooms in the back with a view of the Mosque which was entertaining  Its a beautifully furnished hotel and has a certain old world charm to it The service we received was quite good  We had to leave at  to continue onto Agra and the staff very kindly gave us some breakfast we were a bit too early for the buffet breakfast Thugs Bar is also quite fun  We wanted to try the restaurant in the hotel as well but didnt get there going by all accounts its meant to be fantastic 
N => Disgusted with Broadway hotel Delhi I stayed here in a mixture of rooms for approx  nights    nights in cheaper rooms which were dirty noisy and old so upgraded to most expensive rooms at front which had been refurbished for far greater price only to find out that they too were noisy as all rooms are adjoining with thin wooden internal door so you can hear everything from other rooms no hot water for days sheets covered in human hair  A complete arogance by staff and careless attitude of management when we complained  The bar is seedy as they come food overpriced and general hotel over rated  Were going to stay  weeks but left after  nights  I was sick of being harrassed daily by staff to buy a service from them either a taxi a tour a driver etc   even being told it was dangerous to go out alone rubbish Wouldnt return here ever save your money and go elsewhere where they want your business and treat you like a guest rather than an inconvenience  
N => jack hammer broadway I read all the reviews and tried to keep an open mind  I have stayed in some hell holes  So I was ready for anything  I was even ready for the bully attempt to make you buy expensive tour packages or when leaving finding added charges you did not make  So we arrived at the airport and please try to remember to go over to the front entrance of the airport thats where the taxi they send will pick you up  When we arrived in the lobby everything went smoothly I was so surprise  They took us up to our room where the hall was cluttered with carts I got worried until we entered the room  spacious beautiful bathroom  comfortable large bed tv  loved it  overlooked the mosque enjoyed call to prayer  The only thing that was not so great was the work that was going on in the mornings the sounds of jack hammers  but after a while you tend to ignore it  the area is rather disappointing but cabs are plentiful  the resteraunt chor Bizarre was very busy and the food seemed more for tourist but there are really good vegetarian places only a few blocks away  I totally would go back really enjoyed my stay  
N => Hotel Broadway We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Broadway  The room was OK the view was nice but the room was quite noisy the breakfast was great and the staff were very friendly  We ate at the restaurant Chor Bizarre several times and really loved everything we ordered in particular the gulab jamun  
N => It smells bad We were  persons staying at this hotel for some days I booked there because I had read about it in a Lonley Planet Guide but we did not like it because  The single room had no window  Outside our room there was a mosque very noisy very very early in the morning  The staff was not very friendly or helpfull   Yes the rooms had AC but the corridor and the lift were hot  But most of all Everywhere there was a very bad smell    But when all this is said I have to add that the location was good  We walked in the small streets behind the hotel and it was near several places   we could go by rickshaw or Tuk Tuk in a few minutes I will not recommend this hotel   it must be easy to find a better one 
N => value for money this hotel was good value not luxurious but good size room good shower room nice and clean clean sheets and towels attatched to chor bizzarre restaurant which is very nice 
N => Quirky clean and comfortable When we arrived at the Broadway early in the morning we were shown to room   This room had clean beds and clean bathroom facilities with reasonable aircon  Other than that it was pretty shabby  When we had slept and got up to go out of the hotel the receptionist advised that our superior room was now ready  We were shown to a very st room spotlessly clean room  at the front  It felt like we were in a different hotel  Its worth checking to see what room you are in  The road outside however at the front was really noisy  Vehicles going all night  On balance it was a great place to stay  I cant comment on the value for money as it was part of an inclusive deal  The restaurant was good always busy you need to book yourself a table  Breakfast included a choice of hot food and the usual toast cereal etc  The staff were a little stiff in that slightly brusque Indian kind of way but after a couple of days they were really friendly  Prices for the phone and room service were cheap id expect to be paying over the top in Delhi  
N => Not a good experience I booked this hotel after reading the one good review on tripadvisor and reading in various guidebooks that this hotel was a good value  I disagree  Although the hotel succeeded in providing us with a reliable pickup at the airport we then used that driver for our tour of the Golden Triangle for what we paid we did not get a good value  The hotel placed us in a room that was next door to a room that was being gutted  This meant we were woken up at  am every morning while we were on holiday by hammering men talking and sounds of drywall and plaster coming down three feet from us  After looking into the room next door it was apparent that we were sleeping next to potentially unhygenic conditions there was a pile of trash drywall plaster and cement blocks in the room Breakfast was less than desirable the restaurant was dark and gloomy with a buffet that was questionably fresh  Suprising coming from such a highly rated restaurant Chor Bizarre  Needless to say we did not eat dinner there  The area is convenient for sightseeing around Old Delhi but honestly it doesnt matter as you should hire a driver while in New Delhi to alleviate yourself from the frustration of traffic and getting ripped off by taxis and rickshaws Overall we would not return to this hotel  The hotel room was clean but given the conditions of the room next door two feet from our beds I would not pay US for this room  It was worth perhaps US at the most  
N => Hell on earth The hotel is filthy the staff are all dishonest  The Manager is even worse than the staff I am used to travelling in India but this hotel and any in its group are to be avoided Room service tried to charge  INR for  bottles of coke menu price less than  INRSandwich  rupee menu price  rupee We needed a room on our return to Delhi the manager promised to upgrade us for the one night the room in in the nearby Yuvraj was just has filthy someones period stains were on quotclean sheetsquot The upgraded room is listed as  rupees on their website the manager tried to charge  rupees  there is not a hotel on that street that charges over  rupees per night Avoid this group like the plague  
N => Do Not Stay Here Do not let the reception fool you we got a warm welcome but it went downhill from there  The room was dirty and smelly  We got ripped off due to taking the services offered by the hotel and the one time we got food from the hotel we couldnt eat it as it wasnt cooked right On a more positive note there was security in the hotel and once youve stayed here anywere else will seem lovely  
N => Terrible in every aspect We stayed there for  nights in uary It was by far the worst and most expensive room we had in our holidays    No daylight VERY loud Dirty  Very cold no real windows  Slum like neighborhood No hot water we actually paid for hot water VERY unfriendly staff Very expensive in comparisonAt the checkout they cheated with the account So just stay away from this      hole and look in Lonely Planetfor ent rooms   RegardsChristoph 
N => Terrible slum Dark dingy room with leaking toilet wierd unfriendly service yellow dirty cold and smelling quotshowerquotpipe water  Stayed only one night thankfully was worst night of month trip even the hotels own driver rips you off rps to conht place via an unwelcome stop at his friends restaurant  Place accross the street is a falling down firework factory   take care If you are used to any sort of basic comfort then stay somewhere in southern New Delhi not Paranganj Positive reviews must be from hotel owner or staff this place is not remotely acceptable even to a backpacker certainly not at GBPnight in India We stayed in many other places in India and hence I know how poor quality this places is compared to others around the country  Dont be fooled by the front desk these places seems to spend their whole budget on the lobby alone 
N => Total Dump Dirtiest and filthy place we had ever stayed expected better in the capital Holes in the wall with area around the Air conditioner open noise cold air and polltuion of delhi can be well savoured here Place was dirty we changed room  times in  nights hot water problem not on till the reception want a shower Room smelt of Shitand Urine  be the Delhi aroma as all Indian ciites now a days  POLLUTION Fake reviews  be from locals not from poor foreigners who are conned into these hotels  Even the ELECTRIC SWITCH IN THE BATH ROOM WAS HANGING OUT OF THE WALL  hEALTH amp SAFETY IS  zeerroo  
N => Good Hotel Good HotelIt was great  We had a clean comfortable room  Checkin amp Checkout service was greatamp quick  
N => Not a any star hotel no airport pick up unless advance payment   reservation didnot mean anything      endup picking up taxi rs for twosalty running water and it is yellow non filtered from river yamunaother people airport pick up was charged dubble becuse diffrent flight    promished Rs per person   charged      per person we stayed two night group of  people  since was schduale gethering there   we had no choice cocroch runs for life soon as light turn on    rooms are not near what show on site    showed on site is model  rooms    not a deluxe ac rooms bed sheets had a blood spots  replacement had similer other stain      resturent will bring food from outside and charge guest triple price     no big vehical go in a doorway  unless you have small economy car      it is not on main road    forget about parking no parking at all   place stink like dump site    or rotten egg        no running hot water       only for  am    other wise take a bath peal    tea and  tost cost Rs  charge guest for bakery not for bread     i ask him i dont want to buy bakery   place is worst than privet motel in us          
N => Good security It was a bit quite Good SecurityRoom and bathroom were clean Bed was so comfortable Everything was Good  
N => Hotel Chand Palace poor Having already booked with Expedia I was expecting worse when I read reviews such as those atandHowever I had only paid the minimum rate for a room and I did have a window a fridge a TV my own loo which leaked and a fan the noise of which was very necessary at night to blank out other noises  There was no hot water the room was dirty but not crawling and many fittings were broken  There were a lot of friendlystaff who never a seemed to do anything unless you actually gave them the bin to empty It was just about OK for me but I could not recommend it unless you are desperate to save your last dollar 
N => Never Again In the middle of nowhere  mins into delhi town just feels like a lifetime with the taxi drivers American breakfast Have I got it wrong do Americans now have curry and ommlette for breakfast As I was there on business I required internet access this was unavailable for  days and when it was available I learnt that the whole of the hotel has only purchased around  hours for a  day period I was aware that internet was chargable so was surprised to learn that the maximum logon was mins Swimming pool was unavailable Restaurants consist of  with  menus food was not greatBar area was so dimly lit it was like sitting in a mine with no atmosphere Staff not very helpfull Expensive in comparison to many others in better positions Left a day early I would not recommend this hotel and if my PA was not my wife I would sack her 
N => Sleepless night We stayed for one night at this hotel on the first leg of the Golden Triangle tour therefore this hotel was booked for us by our tour operator Much to our disappointment the hotel was a good   to  hours drive from the centre of Delhi  Some members of our Group had previously arranged to eat out in Delhi but this would not have been possible  There was nothing much to do in the vicinity of the hotel We ate in the hotel restaurant  The food was very nice though terribly expensive even by London standards The biggest problem we had was that of sleep or lack of  After travelling for around  hours and with only a few hours sleep on the plane we were hoping for a good nights sleep here During the night my wife and I thought someone was on the balcony trying to break in until we discovered that around  to  pigeons were sitting on the balcony banging against the bedroom window A bigger nuisance however was that a wedding was taking place at the hotel that night and at around pm they congregated in the car park below our balcony  They played drums and trumpets loudly until  am  At midnight I called reception asking to change room but my request was denied only to find out in the morning that other guests had moved rooms during the night The following morning we complained to the staff at reception who were totally disinterested in what I had to say  They offered to change our room     even though we were in the process of checking outBreakfast might have been good but I was in such a grumpy mood that I couldnt possibly comment on it objectively The butter was rock solid and was unspreadable  thats about as much as I remember I would not stay there again  
N => Depressing setting This was part of the Golden Triangle Trip so Hotels booked for usamp we had stayed at The Oberoi Maidens Delhi for  nights at the beginning which was excellent so this Hotel was depressing by comparison even though the food was fine There was nowhere to walk to  the Cinema quotcomplexquotnext door was bleak amp semi derelict  There is a slum just next to it with we were told Bangladesh refugees with sludgesewagek on the pavement   so it seems a bit spoilt of us to complain about the Hotel neverthelessthe carpet in the bedroom was covered in stains  It also felt a bit malevolant outside as men were being sleazy to me a female even tho walking with my husband in daylight amp it was very noisy at night with shoutingcar alarms amp pigeonsdogs as others have said  A highlight was an Extreme Sport chipmunk which sky dived down from the roof of the Hotel Tower block amp swam across the swimming pool 
N => Nice hotel to stay in and to get a great exp  A  star hotel having all the star facilities and amenities at a great pricewill love to stay here again on my next visit to delhi staff was very friendly and helpful the environment with in a hotel was gudand food was excellent specially yellow chilli      an indian restaurant       
N => Lovely to look but beware      We found ourselves at the City Park for one night in between internal flights in India  Hotel space in Delhi is at a premium so we were glad to get a centralish room in a supposedly good four star hotel  We were pleasantly surprised upon arrival as the lobby and surrounding areas looked welcoming spacious and well laid out  The staff at check in were cordial rather than friendly  Our departure next morning was early and we had to be at the airport for around   a m  so the car was coming to pick us up at   We had our young dhter with us and didnt want her to travel on an empty stomach so we made arrangements for a small breakfast before we left  We were assured it would be there  Their full breakfast which we had paid for doesnt start till after    When we arrived downstairs the following morning the cafe was shut and the manager wanted to charge us for providing a sandwich from room service to take with us  All they would provide was a cup of tea or coffee and toast and bits of fruit There was no flight information which a lot of hotels  star and upwards have  In short no one cared So I would say looks can be eptive and if you dont want to be done   avoid this hotel  This is a  star hotel with  star customer care standards  
N => city park we stayed here as the st night of our golden triangle tour  it wasthe best of the  hotels we stayed at   very clean good rooms and good service  the breakfast was not so good but we got much more than we expected it was overall excellentand i will definitely sty here again on my next visit to delhi 
N => Do not pay to sufffer   Never Again We were on a World trip in il through to e   We saw this Hotel rated as a  star and recommended by all major airlines  Whilst in the Hotel we were advised NOT to drink the water let water when showering enter your mouth eat washed fruit or any salads  Strange for a  star which should have had water purification All staff were atttentive but held out their hands to make their wages not tips  Other people we met in the Hotel had the same experience  All staff were underpaid yet room rates were from US per night  One would bring  towel get a tip and return with a helper and another towel and want more money for his return PLUS his mate  Then flowers then soap then more bottled water at US per bottle  We met several others with the same experience and they paid more than us Tthe owners ate in the restaurant and when they did all staff left us and other guests and served he owners who did not care  I saw the owners wife order six drinks in succession as she just changed her mind sent the untouched drinks away and was so rude to the staff I could not but interupt and tell her off  She said we could leave the Hotel if we did not like it  How rude as she was just so disgusting and I have not seen animalss treated the way she treated her staff Everything organised from the Hotel was upwards of  times the price of anywhere else  they were reating with jackhammers from am up to pm every night and regardless of complaints ignored us and other guests who were lined up to complain I felt sorry for the staff who tried so hard but the management despised their guests and their staff I wrote to this Hotel and the Airlines who recommended it because I want to make sure others do not pay to suffer  Not even a reply Never againcus 
N => Adequate rooms friendly staff but beware of being ripped off The rooms in this hotel were adequate though super super deluxe far nicer and more spacious than lesser rooms  Not great value for money and very noisy due to construction work and the busy road outside  Staff on reception were nice and friendly with the exception of the travel agent who charged extortionate prices for hiring hotel taxis and double charged us service charge for booking train tickets to Amritsar  We were also told that Delhi was closed on a Friday in order to sell us a trip out of Delhi when in reality it wasnt This gave us a bad impression of the hotel as a whole  
N => Dont stay at this hotel  Rooms were ok but everything else was terrible about this place  The staff changed their pricing on us many times and of course they over charged us  They dont have a restuarant although they say they do  Instead if you order something they will just find it on the street and bring it to your room  Every person you see in the hotel expects a high tip for doing nothing  They say they have internet but it is the computer they use at the front desk  Overall this was the worst place I have stay at in India and the price was one of the highest  
N => Average hotel but lots of hidden costs We stayed at Clark Heights for  days in ember  Original my boyfriend and I were given the wrong room   we had paod for a super deluxe but they put us in a delux   after arguing our case they graciously put us in a much better room  Some of the staff were very nice but we were charged extortionaly for organising taxis with the hotel including a car to Agra and service charge on train tickets were high  Recommend to get Rickshaws than use their taxis  Overall a noisey but average hotel  
N => Poor value for money This hotel was nothing special  Firstly it is currently undergoing building works so you are staying on a construction site  The rooms were basic  The reception staff were helpful except for the woman who arranged our trip to Agra and Amritsar   she ripped us off and then told us we were untrustworthy when we refused to pay charges that she hadnt told us about  This was after she had told us that the whole of Delhi would be closed on one of our days there which we found out later wasnt true  There was always someone available to drive us places though at an expensive cost  All in all we werent very impressed with this hotel and if you do stay here dont book any trips without negotiating the price first  
N => Seepage in the Room Paying more money than the nearly hotels we expected more standard butthere was seepage in our rooms and it was smelling  We do notunderstand as to then give the room to customers  
N => No Limit for cheating  I book room from internet  No pick up and no refund   Kms  small taxi for  Rs   km  cheating travelers coming for st time to india  High price hotel guest house  
N => i m loving it as i wnt to d hotel i was really impresd by the intrir                 the staff was really good and coperative              i enjoyed hotel         the food i had there was delisious        
N => Noisy The hotel was clean room mid size No pick up at the airport  Very noisy all night Staff was nice location was ok we prepaid  IR for a car taxi from airport 
N => Truly home away from home  The experience at clark was better than any five star hotel I v stayed in and I v stayed in many as I m a flight attendant   The rooms are way bigger n nicer than most  The staff was incredibly attentive and caring  especially to my kids who did nt want step out of the hotel as they were so at home there  The food was divine  and they took every care to cater to my kids special out of menu orders  All my out of town tours to Amritsar n Agra were very well arranged The only thing I think They could improve upon is the toilet ameneties and external facade  
N => Constantly mislead me I arrived in  in Delhi with my family  We booked hotel clarck online because it was easy  As expected we were picked up at the airport  The rooms were not as nice as the photos online at all  We arrived late so had little choice  the y cheat us badly          
N => Excellent service pleasant and helpful staff Warm ambience Hi I visted india in month of  with few freinds fro a wedding Since we wanted to stay closer to central delhi and were on abudget  we chose this hotel Good value for money The staff was courteous  freindly and very helpful  The rooms were nicely done and clean  The late night coffe shop was a blessing for us due to late night at wedding function The staff even helped us in getting few things that we had missed to carry along They even got our gifts packed in a very elegant way I would recommend thsi hotel to all my friends from US  and would definately go back and stay ther e everytime i visit Delhi  
N => Run Away Many time you think for the best but you get nothing and you get bad experience yes I had a bad experience as the room given to me was very dirty and towel was smelling I booked this hotel from internet as the hotel fails to pickup me from airport even the service at night was not good  Big ManMushtaq 
N => ent Hotel Great Staff This is ent hotel if you want to live around patel nagar but it is on a very busy intersection so be carefull to while booking room  Do not book room by metra side or you will not be able to sleep  Hotel staff was very good  I had an issue with my rental car and I had to call  KM away and my cell phone gave up because it was changing network  Receptioninst lady gave me her own cell phone to use as it was early in the morning  Accept one minor incident of overcharging by room serviceThis was corrected by front desk right away and they apologized so I will believe it was just a mistake   Rooms are clean bathroom is great with international standard and property is very clean  
N => just a small lodge not a  star hotel The rooms were dull and not clean a thick layer of dust covered mostof the furniture the bathroom consisted of a shower an overflowingtoilet and a bucket the ceiling was covered with small flies thehotel was noisy children running around and constant unidentifieddripping in each room during the whole night and the breakfastcutlery was not clean  
N => Really enjoyed i been to this hotel in this month only and find it worth it for money check in take just  min to get our rooms housekeeping manager is really helpful all the staff members are really nice n helping   even there travel desk is very helpful for us Awesome nad enjoyable trip grt memories 
N => not recommended The air con make so much noise that you can t even get a nap for minutes not recommended  Room is ok but all fixtures are old  
N => Excellent budget hotel in Delhi The hotel arranged to meet amp collect us from New Delhi Railway station at  am and we were transferred efficiently to the hotel  Check in was friendly amp efficient amp we got a free upgrade  The room was spacious enough everything worked fine amp the included breakfast was very good  I would highly recomment this place for anyone passing through Delhi  
N => Not Worth It This hotel is in a very busy are  There are many hotels nearly  Therecharges are higher and services are not at all good  We checked out ofthe hotel next morning and the reception took  minutes to check usout  The bill was not ready and excuse was that there is someconfusion  If I had a flight to catch I would have missed it  
N => Open lobby    This hotel has its reception area open to a very undesirable tour operator who walks about the hotel giving the impression he is a hotel employee who attempts to sell you a golden triangle tour for a very high price  Of greater concern is the fact this man somehow manged to find what room we where in and infact made an internal telephone call to our room to attempt to arrange to meet us to sell his tour services  I wonder if the hotel is taking a commission for this He was present in the hotel lobby bothering the tourists on all  days we where there  His office is around the corner from the hotel and he will attempt to take you there to do a hard sell  Despite this negative first impression the food was great as was its price service could be better  Hotel pick up was relaible  Front of house staff attentive but aloof at times  Air conditioning was not working in our room and it took over  hrs to relocate us  The drains are very smelly and the room had a musty smell to it   Generally clean and well presented  No window in either room so no natural light  
N => ent Hotel Good Location This hotel was just fine  Its a little pricey but then so are all hotels in Delhi  We arrived having booked in advance and check in was very smooth  In the first room given the toilet leaked so we asked to move  This was not a problem as other rooms were available  The second room was just fine  Rooms are on the dark side but they are clean and comfortable with satelite TV Air Con and a Fan  Also we had a fridge which is always nice in such hot tempretures  Hot water only worked in the morning  I like the neighborhood of Karol Bagh  Its in a local Indian ket for Sarees mostly so its interesting to walk around and you dont get hassled too much comparatively  I always felt safe here  The metro is a  minute walk if you want to get around independantly  Also there is always a AutoRickshaw Driver to hand to haggle with  You are close enough to all the attractions by these transports  I would recommend this hotel  
N => A lotus in a ket and traffic pond As i am aregular visiter to delhi due to metro project this time i made the booking through web and finaly landed to clark which is located in a busy street But was realy surperised once we enter it was really cutting you from outer busy environment to clean atmosphere where you can easily relax in clean rooms staff was realy helpful free breakfast and free pick up from airport is really a big advantage will visit again in ember thanks to there hospitality  
N => liasoning with wrong people Me my wife stayed here for a good  days good  Rooms were not that bad but not that good too  Breakfast was average  High price for hotel like this they have arrangement with bad travel agents and they took almost more than double price for a tour to agra jaipur  We know from our friends who did same tour in quiet fewer prices car and hotel were same  Rippled off  
N => Friendly clean and safe Airport pick was very helpful  Little expansive but Delhis hotels are expansive compare to other cities  Use travel sites to get good deal  
N => Wonderful Stay I booked an executive room in this hotel for a one night stay which included an airport pickup  First i was bit worried about the airport pickup but was glad to see a car to pick me up at the airport however had to pay the driver extra to turn on the AC  The room was clean though small in size including the linen  The staff were friendly and all queries were looked ater  Will definately recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay And yes the bed is amazing 
N => not great but good We booked our stay at Hotel Clark International before we left home which turned out to be st because we met other guests who said that they booked by going to the hotel once in Delhi and they were charged double what we paid  Overall my b f and I had a good stay here  We got free pick up from the airport and the hotel was in a good location but the drawbacks were that there was construction happening on the rooftop which woke us up in the a m  they tried to charge us for items n the fridge we didnt drink and phone calls were pricey  One of the major pitfalls against this place was that the staff wasnt all that helpful  When we asked if they had a map of the area we could have we were told to follow a man in the lobby who would get us one  We were then taken to a travel agency who tried to talk us into booking tours to Agra and sight seeing around Delhi  They also charged way more for a lift to the airport than a taxi actually cost  Our room was spacious and clean although the washroom was a little dingy and the TV was broken  The bed was comfortable and the AC worked  The breakfast that was included was ok  
N => Put us into a I booked the Hotel Clark International directly via their website   The hotel requested my credit card information for a confirmed reservation  When we arrived in Delhi from the airport at  am we were told the hotel did not have a room for us the hotel was fully booked  They never mentioned this to us when we called from the airport for our transfer They said they would put us up into a quotsister quothotel down the road  The Hotel Surya was awful    We were so tired from the flight and it was in the middle of the night we just slept in the room in our sleep sacks Thankfully I had the insight to buy them  The next morning as we were flying to Varanasi my wrist started itching and I noticed I had small red ks bed bug bites  I booked the Hotel Clark International so our first night of our  day trip to India would have a smooth start  it was anything but that  I was charged the same quoted rate even though we stayed in an inferior hotel something I would never had booked  I could not recommend them due to this poor customer service  I felt I had been ripped off with their bait and switch   
N => One star status budget Accomodation It was their third offer of a room before we ided it would get no better  First room had creatures crawling around the shower floor  Second room offered had blood on the towel The so called romantic roof terrace restaurant did not serve winewe had to locatebring our own and the roof of same is lined with bamboo above which numerous pigeons reside dropping feathers etc into one food while dining  Only one of our partyof three was sick over a five day period but we spoke to another resident whose friend was confined to their room for a couple of days with food related problems Tried to charge for a non appearance as one of our party coming from Thailand to meet us in India had to alter bookingdue to Bangkoks aport being closed only refunded us after several days of verbal discussionsculminating in our having to remind manager of our post holiday review intentions Most definately would strongly advise against booking this establishment  
N => Tiny overpriced  Our room was very small with a heater and AC unit that looked like they were made  years ago  The TV was also dated The staff were not friendly but capable enough  They organised a free pick up from the airport but this was a dusty  year old tiny car  Luggage would not fit in the boot and had to go on the front seat  They organised a lift to the domestic airport for the  Rupees in a slightly better small car but not much  The plus points are a nice restaurant up on the roof with a very nice breakfast  
N => Not that bad at all but greatly overpriced For CAD USD  a night greatly overpriced like all hotels in India  The good conveniently located in the quiet street of Karol Bagh  minutes walk from metro  Nice rooftop restaurant  The bad heater in the room didnt work properly  Electricity outlets were so outdated that small plugs cell or photo charger required support to stay plugged  Hot water was in fact just warm so shower in the morning was challenging  
N =>  we love being care  It was really a good experience with my partener to stay in this hotel the pick up was free and efficient as we arrive delhi mid night The hotel was good and clean Hope fully i get what i payAs i fall ill was taken care of the staff with medicene food and service etc which touced my heart  god bless them all will recommend this hotel to everyone  
N => worst hotel ever stayed in I would like to explain firstly that indian hotels are not of the quality you find elsewhere  That is a common theme i found throughout my stay in india and all travelers must bear this in mind before they travel there  However I was very shocked as to the state of the room especially baring in mind the positive reviews on trip advisor The room was of a relatively nice size  However the room I stayed in would have gotten a  star anywhere else  There were very big cracks in the walls the room was dirty  The airconditioning unit was very grimy the bathroom was very shabby the bath was cracked  All in all i am sure I could have found a hotel for the price I payed in am much nicer room  But i loved being in delhi such an incredible stay and it barely dampened our stay  
N => Hotel Clark treated us awfully My partner and I have just returned from a holiday in India where as part of our itinerary we had pre booked our first two nights at the Hotel Clark International in Delhi through Expedia for which we were charged    per night   a lot for India but we wanted to ensure our first nights were comfortable As part of our booking we had requested the free airport pickup to the hotel advertised on the website  We received our confirmation and were looking forward to our stay at the hotel However on arrival at Delhi International Airport there was no one from the hotel to pick us up  As a result after lots of trailing around the airport in the middle of the night we managed to find a driver who was prepared to take us to the hotel in the city at an extortionate rate On approaching the city I phoned the hotel to get their exact location  I was first told by the receptionist that we only had a reservation and not a booking  I informed him that we had prepaid in full and that I had a full confirmation voucher from Expedia He then told me that yes we had had a booking but they were no longer able to give us a room and had ided to put us up in another hotel nearby instead  We were utterly dised given that wed spent a lot of money on the first nights of our holiday to avoid this sort of hassleGiven it was so late at night we asked for directions to the alternative hotel   Hotel Blue Sapphire  Although we were told this hotel was of the same quality as the Hotel Clark International it turned out to be pretty awful   It certainly was not near the quality wed be led to expect from the Hotel Clark International Until now  our experiences booking through Expedia to date have been an entirely positive experience   but this was a nighte  At best Hotel Clark International messed up   at worst they scammed us into taking a cheaper hotel and didnt honour a prepaid contract  
N => Over priced Mediocre     Well it would be unfair on my part to discard this property altogether but at the same time I am unable to find justifications for having it at No  on TripAdvisor s popularity index  Let s start from  to the last whistle i e  the moment we checked out  Check in was anything but smooth  Despite having an explicit pre paid reservation for two adults and two kids   front desk was insistent to have  INRnight for extra bed  Breakfast was not at all impressive   yeah even taking room rates in account  Bathroom standard should have been better  TV was not working there is only   channels tuned in   we never tried to tune in more nor did we complaint to be fair  Room service was prompt and efficient  Wi fi was complementary and of acceptable speed  To conclude I would say that you don t really get value for money at this hotel  I am not satisfied let alone impressed  
N => What a shock but a good one in the end I have been to Delhi  times in the past two years due to my hubby working out there  This time we were on holiday I booked the Clark International via there web site which was so easy We arrived in Delhi late at night the hotel car picked us up from the airport when we arrived at the Clark I nearly called a taxi to take us to the Imperial Hotel where I had stayed previously  We appeared to have arrived in downtown Beirut but once inside the Clark International I was presently surprised  We were taken up to our room which was lovely the bed was very comfotable with crisp clean sheets air con cooled the room very fast and a great hot shower The next day we got went up to the top floor for breakfast which had everything you could want to eat with a great view  We then went for a walk and headed down to Connht Place to do some shopping when we arrived back to the hotel later that afternoon we realised we were positioned slap bang in the middle of the ket district of downtown Delhi it was great it had street kets lovely people great places to eat and shop and a great carnival atmosphere until late into the evening  I couldn t believe that my hubby had been to Delhi so many times and never found this area  I loved the hotel and loved the area next time I go to Delhi I will stay at the Clark International TIP Take a card from reception when you travel about as we found a lot of taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was as tucked down a side street the card has a map on the back with address and phone number  
N => excellent value this was our first time in Delhi   we wanted a not too expensive but well kept hotel   and the Clark International conformed to our expectations  Clean smallish but well kept room with noisy ac friendly and helpful staff The area is noisy and colorful which we rather enjoyed  no bad surprises  recommended  
N => good value the hotel is in the heart of new delhi in a non touristy area be prepared for a different culture but do not be afraid of the neighborhood  free breakfast buffet was great with a mix of local and american food  the bed was comfy and the room was clean  you  need to use ear plugs at night because of dogs barking and autos honking  if you do not use the free ride from the airport you can use the free ride to the airport  the hotel price was okay not too pricey and not too cheap  
N =>   quality at   price A really recommendable clean friendly hotel with all mod cons inc wi fi in a busy   though not exactly central   part of town  By Indian standards its very fairly priced too so book well in advance to be sure of getting a room  
N => very good value hotel Efficient good value hotel  Reception staff not particularly helpful or friendly but efficient  Included breakfast was good and Nepali quotheadquot waiter very friendly  Evening meal good value and good  Room was clean quiet and secure  Had coffeetea making facilities which is unusual  Also minibar with reasonably priced drinks including water which is useful if you have just arrived from the airport  Efficient pick up from airport even though plane was delayed  Handy for Metro  
N => Little Gem Stayed on two occasions in   One night at first then  nights after a  day train journey We were met by friendly courteous staff they helped us to locate an ATM on the first stay as it was a little daunting in this very bustling city  The rooms were cleanthe bathrooms had bath shower all very clean mini bar amp air conTV and free internet connection  There was some traffic noise but unavoidable in such a busy city and no fault of the hotel  The breakfast was very satisfyingcerealshot foods eggs etc  Lunch and snack amp dinner menus varied amp were very nice and the waiters very nicehelpful  We would recommend this hotel it was quite a quotlittle gemquot considering the price of some hotels in New Delhi we would stay there again should we return someday  As we didnt take advantage of their free hotel pick up on our arrival in New Delhi they kindly gave us a free drop off to the airport for our departure  
N => Highly recommend the Clark International New Delhi Have just returned from a week based at the Clark International New Delhi  Our rooms were spotlessly cleaned each day bed linen was changed daily hot water was plentiful though the wet room style bathroom was a little inconvenient staff were extremely friendly courteous and helpful  Restaurant facilities and breakfast was very good  Room service excellent  The only downside was that the location was a little rough as a party of four women travellers we did not feel particularly safe stepping out alone and we were glad that we had booked the services of a driver for our stay  Would highly recommend the Clark International hotel as being very good value for money  
N => Good moderately priced hotel We stayed at the Clark Hotel in y   My husband is Indian but not from Delhi and we really didnt know much about hotels in the city except that there seemed to be very few moderately priced hotels  After a great deal of research on the Internet we selected the Clark Hotel  It was very clean with good airconditioning except during the daily power cuts  This was important as we were there at the height of summer  The staff was very helpful but not all spoke good English  They tried their best and we managed  This is not a five star hotel obviously but it was clean and comfortable  The morning breakfast buffet was good with toast available for picky eaters like my children  Indian food as well as some quotinternationalquot dishes like chinese food etc was also available for all meals and was not hideously spicy  Even the Indian food was not too spicy  They are trying to cater to AmericanEuropean palates I think  However I think that they are bringing in the food from another location as the quotrestaurantquot appears to be a room with no kitchen attached  This can cause rather long wait times for food think   minutes after ordering  This can be a problem after a long hot day especially with small children  There is a neaby McDonalds  The area is really really busy with cars people beggars etc  all the usual India issues and at night there is a ket which might be fun to explore if you dont mind the mosquitos  We didnt do this as the kids were exhausted at night  The area might be a bit of a shock if you have never been to India before  Overall it was a good place to stay for a few nights especially if you dont want to spend spend hundreds of dollars a night for a  star property but you want a clean hotel with western toilets very important and AC  The pick up from the airport was included but the drive back was not  One other note for female travelers is try to get some Indian clothes like a salwar kameez  Even during the hottest of days it is very comfortable as they can be made of very light cotton  I saw several women wearing tank tops and shorts and they are usually being followed by groups of strange men  Not pleasant  In India if you wear shorts and sleeveless tops you  as well be walking around in your underwear  
N => Good mid range hotel in Delhi My friend and I stayed here in tember the only fault was they were revamping the reception which was transformed in the space of hrs   no mucking about And it really didnt affect us just added to the adventures of India We were picked up as promised from the airport which I highly recommend the room was excellent we chose to stay in one of the suites The travel guide in the hotel sorted us out for our private car trips around Delhi Taj Mahal and then onto Japiur Food here is excellent so we ate here on both evenings 
N => Would avoid I did not have a great stay here  Initially when I booked they told me a taxi from the airport was part of the package  When I arrived they charged me rp for this  Then when I left they tried to charge me another rp because the car was airconditioned  Also when I arrived my room smelt like a sewer so much so that someone had to come in and spray air freshener  The next day I changed rooms and this was OK so try NOT to stay on the bottom floor  The restaurant is OK with nice views  The hotel travel agent is dodgy and tried to make me go to Kashmir  However the internet was free  The service was very mixed  Some people were helpful others were downright rude especially the man who asked me to pay extra for the taxi  I would recommend this place ONLY to budget travellers  
N => Nice clean room Pleasantly surprised about this hotel that we booked for the last night of our stay in India  Very clean and functional room  helpful staff  They agreed without problem to replace the free airport pickup which we didnt need by an airport drop off early morning  
N => Ok hotel but not great we expected better stayed in this hotel  nights    transfer from airport good as we were  mins late the driver waited for us  our room was dissapointing room   no view blacked out widow  a concrete wall behind I guess it was quiet apart form hearing the lift go up and down all night No hot water at all during our stay  Roof top restaurant average lacked a few green plants lots of bird poo on the edges of the terrace but delhi is delhi  food nothing special  wouldnt serve us beer but others seemed to have it  whether they took it to the table themselvesWe booked with late rooms and when we came to pay extra tax luxury tax  was added on the bill this was a lh as this hotel was clean but def not luxury  not at all like the website pictures we looked at before booking staff ok but not as friendly as other hotels we stayed in  
N => Bed smelt of wee no hot water  We hit the Clark International Hotel after  weeks in Bangalore and a couple of days in Udaipur  It was the worst hotel in our trip My wife and I are from Australia I was in India for work and my wife joined me after  weeks for a bit of an explore  We booked through Otel com and paid online for an Executive room one up from the normal room type  However when we checked in we got given the most basic crummy room which had been painted that morning paint still wet to touch and found that the booking had somehow come through to Clark from Otel com as quotstandard doublequot  We were there  days and did see other nice rooms but were told that these were not available No hot water we had to call the lobby each time and request  Then a man would come up to our room and put his hand under the shower for  minutes while the boiler or something fired up and my wife stood around in a towel  Ah the romance of India  The bed smelt of urine and we did eventually get it replaced on day  which was good  Lots of reation going on but they did give us some free meals at the hotel restaurant which was some compensation  To go shopping we booked a van and driver at an exhorbitant price from the hotel travel desk  The driver got sulky when we wouldnt get out at the quotcommissionquot place that he recommended and dropped us in the middle of nowhere which was quite scary  Avoid   try somewhere else    
N => Not bad for Delhi Hotel was ok was being orated so constant smell of turps  No window which I found a bit weird  Breakfast was good on top floor restaurant staff generally helpful  
N => Bad Dont Stay Here  Booked via Expedia  weeks prior to stay  Included in room price  AUD was airport pick up  On arrival day had to email hotel to make sure they were going to pick us up they were not bothered  We pulled up to hotel and parked   an auto tuk tuk accidently scratched the drivers old rusty car the driver got out and smashed the auto guy across the head   meanwhile we were stuck in the car  Nice welcomeCheck in typical India   cold fill out forms etc  Taken to room way way down back of hotel near generator  Room tiny and in disrepair but neat on surface  We thought O K   it is Delhi overpriced and poor quality Within the hour   quotbang bangquot the sounds of drillingsawing and metal banging  After  hours we called reception and asked when will the sound stop   quotoh  minutesquot  So after about  mins we thought lets go and see reception desk  Upon leaving our room the door was open adjacent  We walked into room where  guys were painting the room was luxurious compared to ours and large  So we thought as we booked a superior delux we can change room  We walk up a level to see what the banging was and found all floors under maintanence people everywhere painting just crap everywhere So we went down stairs and asked to see another room  quotNo roomsquot we were told  We asked to see the manager   quotYou waitquot  So we sat in foyer    after  mins of waiting we went up to the room expecting the manager to call us when he was able  No call  About  mins later we ided to pack backpack and go into central Delhi for better hotel even though the Expedia  hotel took our money upon booking and credit card had already beeen charged At reception the manager appeared  He was not bothered by our request nor concerned that we left  We did mention we would be complaining  We think they preferred not having guests at this time cause we did not see  single guest during our  hours here We complained to Expedia the next day and they contacted the hotel and a refund was in the process  week  We would recommend not to stay here  No restaurant no alcohol in mini bar We travelled for  weeks in IndiaPakistan and by far this hotel was the worst we encountered  
N => Comfort in Unknown Territory Being a woman alone and an inexperienced traveler you bet I was nervous when I arrived in Delhi at  a m  My flight was  hours late and I had no idea what to expect  A huge wave of relief washed over me when I found my name being held up by a friendly face at the front of the overwhelming crowd  The hotel was definitely dedicated to taking care of their guests I was further comforted to be met with a strong display of professionalism at the reception especially at  a m  The other hotel staff were patient with my conflicting sleep schedule and did their best to help me obtain whatever I needed during those first hours The hotel s choice of tour agency to help me plan the rest of my journey to Rajasthan Kashmir and Daramshala was outstanding  The employees of Abyss Tours were friendly and personable  I completely forgot the fact that I was alone in a strange land very far away from home  All recommendations of hotels throughout the tour were superb I will always recommend all my family and friends who wish to travel to India in the future to stay at Clark s and use Abyss Tours to ensure that they will find the whole Indian experience as delightful as I did  
N => Better than expected For our arrival in Delhi my partner and I were looking for a clean but basic hotel at which to spend our first night  After reading reviews for other hotel in the sprawling city we ided upon the Clark International As promised the hotel duly provided the complimentary pick up from IGA as promised  Although we were informed by email before we arrived that as we were to arrive at  we would not be able to check in until  this was not the case  The hotel was able to accommodate us immediately which after a long journey was greatly appreciated The room was basic but spotlessly clean with a working air cooler rather that air conditioning which was noisy but apply drowned out the street noise below As anticipated we were offered trips booked through the hotels travel agency but when we lined their offer there was no hard sell unlike a lot of India The hotel is not centrally located but is a short five minute walk from the efficient New Delhi Metro  
N => Beware of being bumped We booked three rooms in advance for the Clark International   but despite having our bookings confirmed and our credit cards charged on arrival we discovered that the hotel had over booked itself and were abruptly ushered round the corner to a much lower standard hotel Although our booking was with the Clark we can only review it on the basis of the accomodaiton they supplied us with the rooms were dull and not clean a thick layer of dust covered most of the furniture the bathroom consisted of a shower an overflowing toilet and a bucket the ceiling was covered with small flies the hotel was noisy children running around and constant unidentified dripping in each room during the whole night and the breakfast cutlery was not clean When we confronted the manager of the Clark International about being moved to inferior accomodation he claimed that it was due to a business conference and as a result the cost of our evening meal was waived   but we still left feeling shortchanged and somewhat disappointed with the experience The communal areas including the restaurant in the Clark seemed of an acceptable standard   the roof terrace is worth a look for the sight of a heaving city However even if we had a cast iron guarantee of a room at the Clark we would probably not book there again as the hotel does look rather tired  
N => You get what you pay for in pounds dollars  As several other visitors have noted there are very few mid range priced hotels in India  I am an American and have lived in Bangalore almost two years and find its low end or Taj properties all over night with not much choice in between  The Hotel Clark International itself was nice but was on a narrow side street in an older part of town  I appreciated the pick up service from the airport even though the plane was over an hour late  The driver tried to hustle me to a travel agency almost immediately but we needed time to rest because my traveling companion was not feeling well from the flight  After an hour he took me one minutes walk to Indian Tribal Tours see my review in Delhi info  The dining room is on the top th  floor but the very old elevator only goes to the fourth floor so its not handicap friendly  Check in and out was efficient  The buffet breakfast was fine omelettes could be cooked to order  There is both inside and outside seating  I asked for a quiet room and we were given a small room with no windows  Actually the AC unit was in the window  The hotel was a bit pricey for India and what we got but Im not going to complain about it  
N => Clark International  Good Hotel in Budget Price Peter Goh Hi There this is my first exprience in Hotel Clark International New Delhi India  And it was extremely good  They provided good service beyond my thoughts  The hotel clark is three star amenities but they have some five star facilities  I got pick up on time as they promised  Food was really goodbit spicy but i like  Staff was very friendly  And one of the best interesting thing is free wi fi  Room was neat amp clean amp specially beds amp linen  Finally we enjoyed lot  My suggestion for travellers Avoid any type of reviews amp use your exprience amp mind Peter Goh 
N => nice stay The hotel was good  Rooms were clean with clean cloth covers Over all nice stay as it was only one night 
N => feel allright  
N => Quite acceptible but certainly not luxury    
N => Its a complete rip off  
N => Clark was Unfriendly  
N => Super Preis Leistung und Top Service  
N => Ok hotel in a poor area Ok hotel if you need somewhere to crash not near anything useful except the metro and kets  Staff were helpful area was dodgy  
N => Loved The Classic Hospitality Hotel Classic is Classic in all means  I was planning to cancel my trip to India due to disturbances in India but Owner Jitendra Chadda helped me on email and assured that he will take care of us  I am happy that I believed on him  He made our trip easy by making all our trips confirmed  Pickup person was always smiling I was very annoyed with Cusom person at Airport but he took care of our luggage  Rooms were cleaned with all basic amenities  We were upgraded to executive room on third floor at no extra cost which was surprise for us  Breakfast was good in room  Wifi was complementry at lobby and I found it very useful  We would be returning here next month on our way back  
N => Excellent Stay I have been visiting Indias cities for last Months  This hotel has been most comfortable and memorable experience  After being picked from Airport in Air Conditioned Car we were given upgraded room on arrival  Service was good  Hot showers worked early morning Surprising in Indian Cities  Even breakfast was served at AM on my request  Location is good with all food joints nearby  Lots of shopping also  Overall my experience was excellent  Thanks to management  
N => Bad Experience I booked the hotel on internet after seeing good reviews but on my arrival uncleaned room given to me but when i request the front desk they tell me to wait for  hours but after that they shift my room and again there was same problem  But at last they solve the problem  Over all experience was bad the room service was not good  The front manager was polite and good but service was zero My over all experience was bad even manager approach me to put good review for the hotel and agree to give me the discount     
N => great for two women travelling alone pick up at airport was spot on the man with placard with my name on it waiting for us with the hustle and bustle of Delhi airport this was abonus for RS to arrive safe at the hotel I also booked day tours to Agra and JaipurRS each AC bus for both mostly Indians are the tourists that board these buses so you have some good times joking about how much extra westerners have to pay to visit monuments  The hotel was clean comfortable beds and occationally hot water but to be fair we were geting up at am to go on the trips  Breakfast we had in our room as there is no dining room but this was nota problem as a couple of times we had a meal in the evening there is a good SIndian restraunt round the corner and a modern food court   The area of the hotel did not make us feel afraid to walk out in the evening sometimes we did not get back from trips till midnight  The staff are a real jolly gang and could not do enough to help us they booked a local taxi to take us round Delhi for the day and this is probably the best way to see most things in Delhi I had been e mailing the owner for a couple of months prior to my visit so when I met him it was like meeting an old friend  I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel it is a quiet retreat in the busy noisy city that is Delhi  
N => Stay in Delhi Hotel was refered to us through common friend  But before placing booking on Expedia we crosschecked the reviews and foud it very satifactory  We were picked up from Airport on request to hotel and were given room on rd floor as requested in mail Hotel is central located  clean near to metro tube station  Nearby Mcdonald was a blessing for us Hotel Manager arranged tour for us to Agra and Jaipur We loved to stay here and recommend it to our friends surely  
N => Not worth it There is nothing really wrong with this hotel but you can do better for the price The room was clean with TV hot water etc The staff were fine   although sent me to get ripped off when buying a SIM card from their friend Airport pick up was good but you can do it for MUCH cheaper  They charge  INR when you can get there easily for  INR  
N => Perfect Hotel for Our Short Visit This is Nice Hotel in ket Place Koral Bh  We were very worried for our agents choice of hotel before arriving India  But our worries vanished when we arrived at Hotel Classic  Agent made a perfect choice as we required clean but not costly rooms  Hotel was extremely clean  Staff was very cheerful and replied to my queries about Agra  We are a group of  persons came for Taj Visit  We were provided with our choice of breakfast in our bed as we did not wanted to have breakfast anywhere else  Dinner was also very good  We will visit again on our return trip  
N => Love It Our Uncle Booked  Rooms for us in this hotel  Before comming here we were very afraid to travel to India due to Bombs and terrorist attacks  But for a rige sake in MoggaPunjab we had to come  But we are happy that we were in safe hand of this good hotel in croweded Delhi  Pickup was excellent in Big Cab with one of hotel person standing with placard at morning odd hours  Rooms were very comfortable  Free Wifi is available at Reception area due to security reasons  Staff very helpful  We are moving today to Punjab and will be back in this hotel again next week for overnight stay  
N => A most excellent starting point in India This hotel turned out to be the PERFECT starting point for our visit to India  Mr  Jitender made arrangements for our driver and car and also set me up with a local travel agency to make other hotel arrangements in India There is no room for error when traveling in India   so the driver Mr  Jitender arranged for us was most important  His name was Suresh and he was incredible  The hotel was very inexpensive by my travel standards as I am used to paying  to  per night  Classic was our first impression of India   and the staff there was friendly warm and welcoming  As we arrived late they even took my morning breakfast order and then delivered it to me right on time Thank you Mr  Jitender for making our India trip a success  
N => Loved the Classic with Classic Service Hotel has the best service you could want  They made us feel right at home and went out of their way to supply all our needs and more  All of the staff made us feel comfortable and were very respectful  Arriving in Delhi at pm we got off the plane to find Madhusudan waiting for us with a welcoming smile  We found the service and the staff a delight they did everything to make us feel at home  They indeed provided me assistance in providing air tickets to Mumbai for tomorrow without any service charge  I recommend this hotel to everyone in my friends and relatives  
N => Great little hotel I booked this hotel for  nights after having seen some positive reviews on Trip Advisor  Rechecking Trip Advisor shortly before I left for Delhi I was concerned to see that subsequently a couple of very poor reviews had been posted one of which suggested that guests had been somehow induced to write good reviews  It was therefore with some trepidation that I ided to stick with my original reservation and in fact it was too late to cancel anyway  I am happy to report that for me this was an excellent choice of hotel  I thought it was full of real charm  The pre booked transfer from the airport could not have been smoother especially given that my flight was over  hours late arriving  Most of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly  I really liked the room I was given  In fact I simply cannot understand why the poor reviews were posted  Were they really staying at the same hotel Can the other rooms really be so different in terms of cleanliness this would seem highly unlikely to me  be the hotel has simply got its act together following the unfavourable reviews  My room was extremely clean cosy quiet and had everything one might need television fridge telephone writing desk comfy chairs extremely comfy bed  The furniture  not have been very new but it was fine  The bathroom was also extremely clean nothing flashy but perfectly adequate  There was also a nice roof terrace for sitting out   with the addition of some chairs and plants this could be an extremely pleasant place to lounge around for a while  Breakfast served in room also worked well  I would definitely stay here again  If you do ide to stay at this hotel or indeed any other hotel in Karol Bagh check out the nearby Ajmal Khan Park to see the local population enjoying all this small park has to offer  
N => The Pits    Stay Away Do yourself a favor  Stay away from this hotel  Stay far away  We were looking for a hotel in a good location with a reasonable price but is an undervalued diamond  We often find such hotels on TripAdvisor and we will continue to try but this was definitely not one of them  If anything it was worth much less than the  a night we paid  The rooms were not clean  We had to ask for towels  Three or four people hung around asking for tips  Three guys carried up two bags with their hands out the whole time  And then the security guy came up to show us how to use the air conditioning so he could solicit a tip  The bedcover was filthy and my wife slept on it with her clothes on  The smell of mothballs was everywhere  We left after one night and let them keep our prepaid second night  Yuck  
N => Bit of culture shock This was a good hotel with air conditioning and a back up generator  Delhi can be quite a shock to the system but this was a nice oasis  The metro was very close and easy to use  The rooms were clean and the front desk staff spoke English  
N => Service tr s attentionn   
N => Mehr kann man f r das Geld in Delhi nicht erwarten  
N => opinioni sullhotel cpark inn  
N => With friends  This Dee ks hotel was selected by me amp my friends on certain aspects like reasonable rate package was the main out of which security was the prime  As this hotel had given a good security but as compared to the rooms were also reasonably ok  But if we come on room package amp what hotel is providing on other aspects  then it was upsetting as many things was not in working as I have seen on net like swimming pool  No WIFI Complementarywhich was mention as complimentary on net check It didnt provide aurvedic message as that was also mentioned amp on these main few things like swimming pool WIFI Complimentary Aurvidic messageetc we saw on net amp as on comparison with other hotels price it was quite reasonable as it was other part that they didnt provide me those things for which I was not happy As comparison with food amp sweet item I found many items were not there as that again upset me Apart they have good collection of wine     Rest more or less I have found it overall that the kind of hotel what we see from out side it is not like that as we have to be care full with cross check of bills which might be wrong some time as it happened with me  
N => ruin your stay at dee ks it was a last min ision to travel to india for business  i tried to book in to a   hotel as usual however at such short notice was imposible  i rang rates to go and was suggested the dee ks without an option i booked the super deluxe suite with them on the phone at a price of   for  nights  when i arrived at the hotel they charged my card then was shown to my room  as a frequent traveller in instantly realised that this was not a suite  i challenged the reception and he told me that this was their equivelant to a suite  after some arguing i reluctantly i want back to my room were i found a brochure outlining there rooms in which i found details of the suite i had reserved  once again i went to the reception with the brochure  to this he said that this room is more expensive and would cost me an additional    i explained that at rates to go the prices are confirmed and he should honour the suite as confirmed  he said he would need to confirm it with the manager in the morning if i stayed in the room for tonight after a  hour flight and am in the morning i agreed the next morning i was sceduled for meetings and was away from the hotel for am and returned at midnight on my return i was told that the manager has said that i will have to pay the difference  to this i asked him to check me out and i will go to another hotel  a quick phone call to the manager soon resolved this as the manager agreed to let me have the suite however i didnt recieve the super deluxe suite but only the deluxe suite i ided that i dont want to spent the duration of my trip arguing with the hotel as it seems to be going that way  so i accepted it once in the room the juccuzi didnt work at all nor did any water come from the taps  it was just as well that there was a shower that had luke warm wateri was not honoured any of the deluxe complimentary serviceson business i usually swim duing the evenings however when i went to the pool it was disgusting and cloudy  it was no wonder that it was deserted overall i would not recommend it nor do i feel that it justifies the catergory of a   hotel i can catgorically say that because of the hotel  my business trip was a nighte  
N => modern hotel close to airport We stayed here one night in early il   A new modern hotel inside we didn t get to see the grounds since we got there late in the day and left early in the morning  The folks who checked us in were professional and assured us a taxi to the airport the next morning was included in the price of the room  However the next morning a different person tried to charge us for the taxi ride  I argued with him and when I mentioned that the older gentleman I d spoken to the night before said it was included the guy backed off  Not a big deal just something to be wary of  be get that kind of stuff in writing at this hotel  We ate dinner in the restaurant it was very good  As we finished a wedding party arrived and we tried not to get in the way of their photos Phone in the room didn t always work when calling the reception desk and trying to make an international call was a hassle  Nothing special about this hotel but it is clean and modern if that s what you want  
N => Proche de la roport et plut t propre  Rien de plus  
N => Definitely Not Recommended We stayed at this hotel with our  children in the Family room  I wouldnt trust any of the staff they took our passports to quotphotocopyquot details for check in but took a long time to return them  they asked us to go to our room without them but we refused and finally they brought them back The room itself was ok but not clean especially the sheets which were changed and changed  but there were apparently no sheets without rips or stains  so we just put up with ripped sheetsThe area around the hotel is terrible the smell the dirtiness as well as people ready to hassle you as soon as you stand outside Also for breakfast you have to go to the Ata a hotel just in front of this hotel  You have to walk through a dirty and stinky alley way which  put you off eating your breakfast anyway  The staff there are not interested in service anyway We definitely will never stay there again 
N => Awful hotel dishonest staff misleading website   dont do it Pretty appalling  BEWARE   this has a quotsisterquot hotel The Hotel Ata  The photos on the website are of the Ata which look quite reasonable not the Hotel Delhi Centre and if you go there you will find out why  The Ata is cheap and cheerful but this is not even that good  Having looked around before checking in I challenged the staff and they lied to my face several times but when I threatened to leave without checking in they moved us to the Ata  
N => Defination of the word pathetic I was on a business trip to Delhi and fortunately I had the privilege to book the hotel of my choice and unfortunately my destiny took me me to this hotel  people are really pathetic room service guys look into your purse as though its their birth right but anyway let me put it like this quot its not a three star hotel pls dont get misguided and secondly its a place you are destined to deserve the worst possible respectquot 
N => Escort    HelloEscort girl entered by the back door with her client customer of the hotel  Though they were discreet they were not hiding  This hotel is probably not to recommend for family Best regardsSt phane 
N => Good Hotel   just dont try and leave early for any reason My dhter and I had booked in advance  nights at this hotel  We thought it was overpriced for India  The hotel is operated by the Ata Hotel and is located behind the Ata  Breakfast is also served at the Ata Hotel  It had advertised being adjacent the the train station  It was not  The train station was about   blocks walk and the Main Bazaar and Connht Place were not even close to being in walking distance  The staff were friendly and helpful  Mr Manik the tour director pressured us into a tour to Taj Mahal in a private car rather than taking the express train as he said it would take the same time and wed be back before dark  After two nights and finding out that the tour operator was less than honest with us we cancelled our tour and ided to check out and leave India for my own health reasons at am  However we were not allowed to do so without paying the full  nights I had booked but not yet paid for  After much arguing and upset and threatening to call the police they settled on making me pay for  nights instead of only  that I stayed and made me write a note stating why I was leaving   I did so under duress just to get out of there  We felt like we were being held hostage  The hotel owner later came to try and talk us into staying but never offered us reimbursement for the extra nights charge we did not stay  Upon returning home I checked the website and they had no right to charge me an extra night Had this situation not occurred when we wanted to leave early I would have totally recommended this hotel  But since it happened I and feel cheated I would not  Never has this type of thing happened to me at any hotel Ive ever stayed at on my world travels  
N => Acceptable Room No Wifi I stayed in a quotFamily Roomquot with a couple friends  The room was smaller than expected and not especially clean found condom wrapper next to the bed  The location is convenient as noted by other reviews  The staff was friendly spoke good English and was helpful  We were disappointed that the quotfree wifiquot that was supposed to be included in the room was non existent  At check in I asked about it and was given a password to access the network   minutes later I tried to access it in the room and found no network  I went downstairs to ask and they said there was no internet  Go figure  
N => made my stay in delhi much easier the staff at this hotel makes it a great place to stay  mrs  ravi helped us plan a great trip north of delhi  our trip to delhi would not have been nearly as good if we had not had the staff of this hotel to guide us  the room met my expectations and the breakfast was good  
N => Modern safe and very Friendly brand new modern hotel picked us up from the airport gave us a nice hot meal at  am at night and woke us up the next day our breakfast was ready as per my prescribed medicinal diet which i had emailed them about They dont have a erate conceirge but hotel staff spent enuf time to answer my questions  I will be back and have recomended them to my organisation   
N => So Bad  
N => Not a bit like the website We were disappointed with this hotel We should have researched it better The pictures on the website are misleading My tip would be to make sure you read reviews carefully before you do your booking and be only book  night at a time until you see a place The airport pickup was a plus  
N => A Warm friendly  We booked this hotel from the airport through lastminute com and we reluctant to leave the taxi upon arrival basically a very busy commercial street  Once out of the taxi we were greeted by friendly doorman who took us to reception and from there on the experience was great Staff were very friendy going out of there way to help us to ATMs at night safely and to get to and from India including help in booking a great taxi service to the Taj Mahal competetive with train fares The shower water pressure isnt the greatest   but that is possibly a consequence of being in India  Rooms were cleaned   food service was efficient and tasty Is a bit further from Connht Place than we thought   but is reasonably accessible by taxi at  Rs each way  
N => Great stay we reached delhi at about   pm we were exausted as we came out of te Airport the pickup cab was waiting for us as promised by the Hotel It took  min to reach the Hotel from the Airport As we reached the hotel lobby a guy was standing there to welcome us with a glass of refreshing drink Then we asked the front office manager to show the room we were offered the executive room which was in every way very comfotable AT VERY LOW PRICE according to my budget As we were late we asked if they could serve us the dinnerand they said yes they can so we ordered for Indian food and it came in approx   min  the food served was hot and delicious We stayed in the hotel for three days and we never felt that we are away from home as the staff was very soft and polite and was always ready to help                              In short we had a GREAT STAY and enjoyed a lot  
N => not bad stayed here for  nights   good service friendly staff at front office rooms were clean and was informed that these were recently reated    looked better than the ones on the website quite surprising  use of jazzy wallpapers and wooden paneling not bad     
N => not great i booked this after finding it in a search engine and reading some favourable reviews  our  night stay was our final leg of a month travelling around india  it was very disappointing from the outside and i went to inspect the rooms before we unloaded the luggage as i thought it couldnt possibly be the same place  it is located on a very busy main road home to the timber and aluminuim industry which is in use  hours so if you are a light sleeper like me then not ideal  the room and bathroom were clean apart from the room floor as our feet soon got dirty walking around barefoot after our shower bathroom is modern and has a shower curtain which is always a plus in india as all bathrooms tend to be wetrooms so everywhere gets wet there is no restaurant and you have to order breakfast which was included in our package and any other food via room service which is then brought to your room  a service charge of   is automatically added to this bill which we didnt know until checking out  as we were out all day sightseeing etc we ided to eat at the hotel in the evening too also becuase there didnt seem to be any ent eating places around the area and opted for plain food  macaroni cheese with mushrooms  even this was spicy and made with tomato sauce and cheese just melted on top  nd night we had chips and cheese toasties which werent too bad  rd night my husband and friend had the macaroni and mushrooms but they both ended up leaving it as it didnt taste right   they have been ill since  i had the vegetable noodles which werent that great either  my friends husband stuck to eating curries and he was fine  we had to leave at  am for the airport and transfers were included  i had asked for a large car but we were given two small cars so had to travel arately  the male receptionist had to be woken up so we could settle the bill and seemed to fall asleep whilst talking to us there was some confusion over the complimentary breakfast on our last morning  my husband had asked for plain omelette which turned up with spices and onions  they charged us for one of the juices as we should only have had one glass as complimentary i think this was the gist of it  i asked to check our food orders for the previous days and pointed out that we hadnt been charged for any breakfasts on the other mornings as it was included in the price so they waived it  nothing is walking distance   connht place and karol bagh are accessible by a  wheeler dont pay more than  rupees for this  on exploring the are we found that there are lots of little shops in all the side streets off the main road  i wouldnt use it again 
N => Shocking vicinity but folks try to do their best Arrival was a shock smog smoke dust metal traiders wires    Hotel starts from d floor  No trees around  Nobody knows the street and the hotel  Exterior looks totally different  But the room was clean normally equipped  Personnel tries to do their best but it is not a normal hotel for normal people  It suites for local to stay between railway travel   New Delhi Railway Station is in  meters Ive spent IR per night it costs such a price but for IR they ask now its better to find a hotel in another quarter  You cant open windows both because of dust smog and noise  WiFi doesnt work  I was transferred to another room without my will but nothing was stolen Finally we even ate there no stomach problems  
N => Good value in Delhi We stayed at Express for  nights  The hotel was clean and represented excellent value for money in Delhi  The external appearance of the hotel differed from photos that we had seen but rooms are as they appear on the website  The hotel isnt on the best street in Delhi but at least its not in the heart of busynoisy Paharganj  Our deal included breakfast but there is no restaurant so this had to be taken in the room which isnt ideal  Overall we would recommend this hotel  
N => EXPRESS  one more  to hell I stayed one night in Delhi and I did the choice for Express believing in what other reviews said about it  When we arrived the zone seemed devasted by war  the smell around was terrible and everything was filthy and ugly  The hotel entry looked like an ugly storage buiding with nothing nice  once inside the hotel wasn t that bad looking but when we entered the room many details were wrong firstly we tried to swich on the TV it didn t work no conectors  When i told to the staff they send one guy whom after looking the conector he went away and never came back with solution  The room we booked it was a double twin beds and they said on arrival they only had one bed double  When I tried to turn on the light on the bed table the light wasn t connected either  there we was surrounded by dust everywhere  then the morning came and I had to go to airport early so i went reception and i asked for place to have breaksfast wich was included in the room deal  they said quotdon t worry we ll take it to your roomquot so I went to my room and we waited  after one hour the breakfast never arrived and we had only  minutes to left to the airport so I went reception and they were there looking at me from a very lazy position showing too much a lack of care we got so upset that we didn t want to take the drop off with them and we left without breakfast by rikshaw to the airport for less than half price of the car  we came back to Delhi a few days later and we stayed in Ata Hotel about two streets behind where Express is located and believe me i got double quality for half of the price  clean nice and very professional staff  who did the votes high rates to Express themselvesFran 
N => Do not be cheated This hotel is run by frauds We had selected this hotel based on its high review on TripAdvisor and its relatively low price The hotel is in a very shabby part of the town  There are some abstract paintings on the walls but thats about it  The room had a damp smell  The hand shower in the toilet did not work  Complaining to the manager did not work  We rented a taxi for half a day to roam around the city  When we got back within the half day period the travel desk said the minimum charge for the taxi is a full day  This was clearly not what the manager had said who was not there later We asked for advice on how to go to our next destination   Jaipur  The travel desk just wouldnt give any advice other than taking their taxi at a high price  When I enquired about bus routes he gave me a myriad of logic not to take a bus  At first he said there were no AC buses to Jaipur then he said there are no buses except at night then he said it takes  hours to reach Jaipur then he said it costs Rs   for each person  Each of these were a lie One reason for selecting this hotel was their free wifi  But it was a hoax it did not work for more than  minutes One guy slept on a sofa in front of our room and we could hear him cough the whole night At check out time came the biggest shock  When we had taken the taxi the manager said the charge would be Rs   per day  But they billed us Rs   for a day The room charge was Rs    When we said we wanted to pay in USD they used a conversion rate of  Rupees instead of the bank rate of   Its not the few hundreds we paid extra but the attitude of ripping off customers that we disliked  
N => Better pay more but stay at      The place shown on the map has nothing in common with real location of the hotel and thus it was one of the reasons I had chosen Florence I was very disappointed  The breakfast on the first day of our stay consisted of scrambled eggs and toasts with jam though we expected buffet  We were told that only  rooms are occupied so there is no reason to cook for a buffet and when we asked for at least some vegetables we were offered to pay additionally  And there was no hot water when we arrived at  oclock at night  The rooms faced a street so it was too noisy  Then we wanted to change the period of our stay at Florence but staff could not help us at all saying we should do it at local Indian travel agency though we not able to connect it  The only good thing about the hotel is a building itself nice and clean but it is not a sufficient reason to stay at Florence again  
N => Excellent hotel in Budget Class The Hotel Florence is a comfortable place in quotBudgetquot style conveniently located close to Delhi s most famous shopping hub called Karol bagh in fact every shopping location was near to the Hotel Actually we were on a shopping tour to delhi so it suited us the best  The hotel facilities and rooms are of excellent quality We had booked Deluxe Rooms through www resavenue com but got upgraded to higher category after speaking to the Hotel General Manager We enjoyed our seven days tour The Pre arranged air conditioned coach for Airport pickup Sightseeing Tour amp Agra Tour booked by the Hotel Manger was very comfortable amp luxurious  The trip to Taj Mahal was a memorable one Room amp Toilet   Spic n span clean at the corners pleasant colors clean n comfortable bed clean linen and towels well stocked mini fridge Staff Extremely friendly cooperative and supportive  Restaurant amp Room service was very prompt amp food was very deliciousBut overall the Hotel Florence proved a welcome oasis every evening after the hustle of Delhi  Knowing the city better now we would probably not go back and try to find a slightly cheaper hotel with more character but for a first timer with some money to spare this is a good choice 
N => ok hotel but a bit antiquated and not exactly cheap    We stayed at Hotel Florence just the final night before flying back home after  weeks of travelling around Rajasthan  The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly but the whole d cor was rather old and stuffy Delhi overall is very expensive compared to the rest of India so the double room at Rs was probably not bad for Delhi standards but an absolute rip off compared to what you could get in other places for that kind of money Our room rate included a Welcome Drink a glass of super sweet Coke could have done without that and breakfast Breakfast buffet was ok   not very big and  very Indian  but ultimately you could also get non spicy food if you asked for it  
N => Big Mistake Staying in this hotel was a big mistake  Next time I will do my research on tripadvisor and stay somewhere much nicer  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone SUBPAR ROOM The room and bathroom were of ent size and cleanliness  But upon entering we noticed a musky and unpleasant smell  We paid a little more for a quotdeluxequot room with a window but the view was horrifying   there were hundreds of tiny beetle like bugs crawling around outside on the other side of the window  In fact a couple of these critters actually made their way into the room not sure how as the windows seemed to be sealed  There was also an inconsistent supply of hot water  One of us got hot water at night but the other was forced to take a cold bucket shower the next morning UNDESIRABLE LOCATION The surrounding neighborhood is run down and far from the colorful ketplace I expected  Definitely not a nice area POOR SERVICE I couldnt find information about internet availability in the guestbook so I called the front desk and asked  They told me that there was internet available on the th floor where breakfast was served  I specifically asked if the internet was free and the front desk confirmed that it was  While I was using the internet I heard a lot of yelling in the kitchen next door  A man walked in from the kitchen I assumed he was the boss because he could speak english whereas the rest of the staff spoke little if any english and he proceeded to tell me that I needed to pay for the internet in a very unpleasant and brusque tone  I politely explained that I was told internet was free but he dismissed my claim and demanded to be paid  I didnt want to upset him any more than he already was Im pretty sure he was the one doing most of the angry yelling in the kitchen and it wasnt that much money so I just paid him and left  
N => Take it From a Solo Female Traveler The deluxe room where I stayed for two nights was a bit small but not cramped  It was passably clean but the smell of moth balls that were placed in different parts of the room was an assault to the senses  What I liked most was as a solo traveler I felt safe here  I also appreciated that they immediately replied to my email asking about room availability and then reservation  Well it also helped that I also gave them a call  Ditto for giving referrals for package tours by local travel agencies  
N => Perfect place in Delhi Really nice place   close to the metro station helpful staff clean and tasteful rooms  We felt really lucky to have found this place  
N => Deos not leave a lasting impression We stayed a night and wanted to extend for  more nights but the hotel staff was very greedy and the rooms are old  We moved to other hotel  
N => Surprisingly good hotel  We did not know what to expect since we never been to India  For us India was at first a bit of a quotculture shock there is still a lot of poverty and the traffic OMG But thats a first impression To be honest the area didnt look all that appealing at first But the hotel is surprisingly nice The rooms are pretty big and clean and better then a lot of hotels weve been to in European countries The staff was always helpful and the owner let us use the computer as much as we needed When we had a question there was always a staff member to help us Called taxis for us and told us what the price would be   helpfull And they gave us good recommendations what to see and where to go India and the streets of Delhi are a long way from what we are used to in the Netherlands the subway at rush hour ehm   an experience But I must say when we came back in the evening to our hotel it was a nice feeling And the breakfast was simple but good We made a trip that many take Delhi Jaipur Agra   Taj Mahal Orchha Varanasi and from then on into Nepal to end the trip  weeks in Katmandu Nepal We took buses trainstaxis tuk tuks riskhas    and elephants In all those cities weve had hotels but I must say this one was one of the nicest ones Weve been to European hotels with  or  stars but this hotel was just as good I can recommend it fully  
N =>  Racial Discrimination  They like only white europeans and can discriminate you beouse of your low potential to pay for tours your cloor they can trouble you be being bad to you and will give you a very bad room like dungeon 
N => Great service and after care The staff here are fantastic  Always polite and very quick to respond to all your needs  What was particularly great was that after we had checked out they kept our bags for us whilst we went sight seeing and gave us a room after to freshen up before our over night train journey to Jaiselmer  Then two weeks later on our return we arrived in Delhi around midday but our flight wasnt till am  They kindly kept our bags for us whilst we did a last bit of sight seeing and they also gave us a room to shower and freshen up before our flight home  The rooms were very clean and tidy basic but comfortable  The after check out care was fantastic they really went the extra mile  
N => Will Not come Again The hotel did not pick us up from the airport  The rooms were very basicand at cheaper price we stayed in better rooms in Karol Bagh as wechecked out after one day  Not a good choice  
N => Good place to crash between airport and station with helpful staff We needed to crash for one night between a late flight and an early train  We needed somewhere cheap basic with a good airport pickup all of which were satisfied The airport pickup was ahead of schedule and polite  It cost Rs for  people which seemed to be about the going rate The room was basic but had free bottled water clean sheets towels and bathroom The staff were very friendly and helpful even when we had to wake them up at  am to check out Staff provided a late night Thali for us which was very tasty Could not comment on location or other hotel amenities  
N => Shows Ageing Air condition was not working doors make sound while closing salt stains in bathroom wall life seems old too and surrounding area is bad economy hotel  Good for few hours stay at cheap price  
N => Undoubtedly the nicest hotel staff Ive ever met On the strength of what I had read in TripAdvisor about inexpensive places to stay in Delhi I ided on Hotel Grand Park Inn  I traveled to Delhi on my own to attend a wedding in another part of the city altogether  Not to worry  not only was Vikash the driver from the hotel there to meet me at the airport but the hotels owner Mr  Madan Pai arranged for Vikash to drive me to and from the wedding parties   and also to take me to interesting sites around Delhi on the days when I had no activities planned  I cannot over exaggerate the kindness and attentiveness of the staff  nor the helpfulness of Mr  Madan Pai  When my plans changed  I was invited by the brides family to stay with them the last part of my visit  Mr  Pai did not charge me for the remaining two nights for which I had booked  and then presented me with a gift upon my departure  I can honestly say that I felt very sad to be leaving this hotel and its staff    now THATS a first I am a very frequent international and domestic traveler and I have never felt such a friendly atmosphere within a hotel  In addition Nor have i ever felt compelled to write a review for TripAdvisor It was Mr  Madan Pai who suggested that Vikash take me to AKSHARDAM  the most enormous templecompound one can imagine  containing a lotus garden a main temple containing over  statues and a  long high elephant plinth  it was only finished fairly recently   and it is absolutely mind boggling to imagine how this incredible place could have been built in only five years  many visitors have never even HEARD of it  DONT MISS IT 
N => Bad Location Situated in a busy road Honking   ponking will not make you sleep  
N => Friendly management   good service   convenient location We only booked a day before we arrived and it appeared that the booking from the Hotels com website had not reached the hotel  However they were more than accommodating   we got a better room than wed booked and were impressed by the cleanliness Breakfast is basic but enought to set you up for the day Location is convenient for the metro station auto rickshaws and buses to travle round Delhi  The ownermanager  Madan was so welcoming full of restaurant recommendations good ones helpful hints and couldnt do enough to help us Would recommend the Grand Park Inn to anyone wanting to stay somewhere thats not a global chain has some Indian characteristics and wants good friendly service  
N => Have a Safe Conscience My friend and I read great reviews of Grand Park so we ided to call a couple days ahead to reserve a room and rate  It turns out the quoted rate by phone was less than any online offers and when we arrived after a convenient airport pickup for a reasonable price we were given a large corner room with more bed room than we could have needed  The mattresses were high quality and the room was nicely modeled  The bathroom had a arate shower a rarity in Indian hotels and included extra amenities such as soap shampoo and shaving kits By far the best part of our stay was the staff  The ownermanager helped us with everything from arranging a low priced visit to Agra food purchases the hotel provided food is only adequate and restaurant recommendations Sandoz nearby is to die for and even beer runs  The staff was overly helpful at times but thats difficult to complain about  The location was great to reach some of the best parts of Delhi and New Delhi and the night ket nearby was nice  The hotel was easy to find as well because of its proximity to the gigantic Hanuman monkey god statue down the road  The most important part of my stay besides the quality of the hotel and staff was that I never felt like anyone was taking advantage of us  The value was good and as much as was provided nothing extra was asked  I will definitely return on my next stay in Delhi  
N => ent enough place not in the nicest street  This was between Average and Very Good so really just Good Price was fair for what we got ac was not good though noisy and ineffective Hotel organised a taxi for us for the day recommended however we got annoyed when he kept bringing us to places shops where hed get commission if we bought something Would recommend if you cant find anywhere else that youd be sure about but there must be better places in Delhi Expect a few short power cuts until they boot up their own generator Food is good  
N => Value for money The room i stayed was clean  The room service was good  The food served was tasting OK  All in All value for money  
N => Great value no nonsense rooms  Excellent clean rooms Good Food Value for moneyDownside No internetIf you want a ent room to crash out in the night go for itCheap  
N => Service Excellence beyond par   Having stayed at Grand park inn on  prev trips and experienced for myself the service excellence and clean comfortable rooms i booked my parents on their India holiday with Mr Madan Pai who efficiently also arrnaged their entire tour for them  But what prompts me to write this is this During their last few days in India it was Gods grace that my parents were staying at the Grand Park Inn as my motheran asmathic fell critically ill  Mr Pai immediately took matters into his hands personally ensuring my mother was hospitalised that my father ate he even topped up my fathers mobile phone with airtime from his personal funds and gave my father over a hundred rupees in small notes so that he could travel by auto to and from the hosital  He ensured that at all times one of the room boys remained with my father who was emotionaly a mess with my mothers illness  Then when my mothers condition worsened he personally contacted us in South Africa and informed my husband of the situation  When we arrived in India my mother was criticalin ICU and was transfered to another hospital in Vasanth Kunj which in Delhis traffic was min away from the hotel  Mr Madan provided us with a car and driver at his cost for  days further when i had to remain in india with my parents after my husband returned home Mr Madan saw to my and my fathers every comfort ensured we ate on time and then also topped my mobiles airtime to the tune of Rs and refused to allow me to reimburse him  His constant concern at my mothers condition was touching and every one of the room boys prayed each day for auntys recovery  With Gods grace my mother recovered and almost a month later we travellled back home again transported to the airport free of charge by Mr Pai who made a personal visit to the hospital to bid my mum goodbye  I cannot express how grateful my family and I are at this mans genorosity  No other hotel no matter how much fancier would have given us the same care  Not that the Grand park Inn lacks in comfort the ample sized rooms complete cleanliness friendly and attentive staff will put many of the other more expensive and fancy hotels to shame  This is a true gem of Delhi and to Mr Madan Pai and Team I salute you from Prinitha Dowlath and Family South Africa 
N => Came to India sick   left India well We visited India for two weeks and the Grand Park Inn was our base  Mr  Madan Pai and his staff were the ultimate in pleasant but serious service and hospitality  The trips we booked with Mr  Pai were A   The neighborhood is colorful but the Inn is clean which was what we were looking for  We came as strangers we left as friends  Thank you much for everything Mr  Pai  
N => great hotel  Located in Karol Bagh this hotel is not included in the regular guide books Dont be put off by the location surrounded by motor parts shops as the hotel is well situated for the metro amp local ket area  mins walk away Rooms  rupees doubleare spacious amp immaculate and all staff smiley amp helful Mr Paithe extremely pleasant amp efficent managercan organise trips to wherever you want and current min price of car amp driver is  rupees per day same as govt tourist info office We took a trip to Shekawatti to see the havelis which was well off the beaten track amp driver found everything we asked to see Dont miss this if you have a few days available  its stunning  
N => Excellent location ent rooms great price We were very happy with our stay here  The rooms and bathrooms were immaculate and spacious with polished ble tile floors and sufficiently comfortable beds    everything seemed near brand new  The staff was helpful and knowlegable  Breakfast was served in a conference room where we met fellow travelers   local business travelers and others from abroad  Grand Park Inn was an excellent value The location in Karol Bagh was great  The hotel was on a small busy Delhi street a cow was parked nearby one of the days we were there  We were walking distance from the Delhi metro which if it takes you where you need to go seemed to be the best way to get around Delhi    its a new system with trains that come every  minutes or so although it does get PACKED during rush hour  It still beats sitting in dusty Delhi traffic  We were able to explore all over Delhi from our base in Karol Bagh  We did however have to cross over a very busy intersection near the Hanuman temple to get to the metro station so some might prefer a short rickshaw ride  
N => Excellent hotel grand park inn Delhi india We had booked this hotel initialy to start our tour in india but it happened so that arrangement was cancelled and all due to terrorism that happened in that time in mumabi our flight was cancelledand when contacted the management they were so considerate and without any fuss it was dealth with sympathy and we eventualy stayed their upon return leg of the tour I found the hotel manager Mr Madan Pai a true gentleman who greeted us with utmost courtsey and welcomed us with warm heart that impressed us greatly service and accomodation was excellent a true peaceful experience throuhjout the stay will recommend highly to all visiting delhi a clean hotel with reasonable charges and above all no value can be put on the hospitality and service a truely honourable management and creditworthy staff definetley  star in my opinion Will visit and stay always at GRANDPARK INN HOTEL  
N => Loved the Hotel  After an extremely long search of trying to find a reasonable place for a reasonable price to stay we luckily found this very nice hotel in new delhiThe hotel was spotless amp the room very pretty luxurious for Delhi standards specially for this price rangeThe location was pretty good close to quotcity centrequot   Connht Place although you will need to cross some dangerous roads to get to the metro   but that was all part of the fun of dodging traffic in India amp being seen as quotalienquot taking the metro funny The manager was extremely helpfiul amp I recommend to use him to get a travel package set up to see the golden triangle amp other locations this will save you looking for hotels in other parts which was also extremely difficult but Mister Pai the manager arranged good hotels in other cities like Agra Jaipur etc  The breakfast area is a little small amp the food is so so however the good part is that you meet other travelers in the same room and share experiences which is very nice as well So Generally speaking this hotel is an excellent value for money for your stay and Delhi amp comfortably If you ide to take the travel package I recommend you to ask for a driver called quotRaquot  we enjoyed the travel with him he was a great guide amp fantastic company during the whole trip and an extremely funny guy HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
N => Very nice place I spent three weeks in the Grand Park Inn because I was in Delhi for business and had made some bad experiences in other places The first night I had to spent in the annexed lower priced hotel next door   this did not make me very happy but then the next day I could change and I liked it As I stayed there for an unusually long period I need to say that I enjoyed itThe room was very big the TV worked well the fridge even had a generator which continued working during elecricity blackouts the hotel staff was friendly all young males but sometimes struggled with their English  The Hotel Manager was also friendly  He and the other guys always helped me when I was looking for something or trying to figure out a quotrealisticquot taxi price for a certain route The breakfast which was included was basic but okay but was served to my room there is a sort of dinner room in the other hotel which was not very cozy  The room was cleaned on a daily basis and the towels   were always fresh  The bathroom   usually a nasty place in lower priced hotels   was surprisingly clean  I had a room next to the street which was quite busy but in Delhi you always have the noise problem The area is certainly not a posh touristic neighbourhood but across the street there was a convenient superket and also about hundred meters away a liquor store to buy beer or wine  The metro was a   minute walk away   quite convenient In general I had a good time at the Grand Park Inn and would definitely recommend it to people who want a nice and clean hotel for a quite fair price compared to others with a good public transportation close by  
N => Great Rooms Bad breakfast This was our first hotel in Delhi and we found everything apart from the breakfast and location to be very good  The location is fairly near to a metro however crossing the busy roads is required which for some  be a little tricky outside of the toursity areas where its a free for all Its also in a fairly chaotic area you will get to see a more real delhi than connht place though  The breakfast was abysmal Very little choice and what there was was not good at all The foil wrapped toast mentioned before    not good  On to the good The rooms were very spacious we only had a standard and felt it was far more than most hotels gave us the staff were very friendly and helpful we got a car organised free to take us from the airport on arrival and to the station on departing free of charge and they gave us good directions without pushing us to certain places  So all in all a good stay Between a  and a  definetely  
N => Our stay was peaceful and pleasing While searching a ent clean hotel to stay during our Delhi Agra trip I really did not know that I have to spend lot of time in the web to find one for our budget  We wanted a very clean and ent hotel  After a lot of review study from different websites finally me and my wife ided to call up Hotel Grand Park Inn Got really good response for our call Till the moment we stepped into the allotted room we were kind of tensed about not getting our expectations met  Our main concern was the cleanliness of the bathroom We were glad to see the clean bathroom Food was good Felt homely calm and safe Room interiors were above average We did not have any major problem other than little bit of noisy AC and had to call up reception every time we wanted hot water except morning hours  Management need to train the staff on communication skills  
N => good idea It was almost impossible to choose a reasonable place to stay in Delhi  Reading reviews left no hope  But this hotel was quite good after all location   not far from CPmanager   competent very unusualrooms   quite big newly reated and literally spotless   highest k for cleanlinessbreakfast area   too small people have to waitbreakfast   rather poorroom service   quite good  if you close your eyes on a bit of cheatingGenerally   practically best solution in that price range 
N => no good we stayed  nights but our experience was terrible  A lot of noise and the staff sometimes was insistent  the sheets werent clean  
N => Clean and comfortable We were very impressed with our room at Hotel Grand Park Inn and especially the fact that the bathroom had a bathThere wasnt much hot water and you had to call the reception to turn the hot water on and that took  mins to heat up  But that was fine and we got used to that The food was good and the service also  
N => We had a great Stay We had a great stay in this hotel  Find the room and hotels is nicely maintained  Rooms are clean service are excellent Almost wasnt sure if the previous visitor was staying in the same hotel For USD a night we had a suite with  beds  I guess is designed for a family Room is large amp clean and the bathroom is clean and with good hot water supply  Sounds insulations can improve a bit as we can hear dogs barking throughout the night though that didnt really bother us Manager was very helpful in advising us on where to go to find food internet and organise day tour for us to go to Agra or transport to airport  Overall find the staff very friendly and helpful  Though the reception desk tends to over rely on their boss sometimes we find that every question goes back to this big boss who is very helpful Hence only problem is if the big man isnt there sometimes or is busy you cannot get your answer quickly I agree the stuff can appear pushy for tips  We had  porters helping  us with our two hand carry luggages Though we did tip a bit not every time we find the staff deserves them as they really go out of their way to help us  For example they went outside to look for beer for us after pm because the kitchen was closed already when we ordered room service We also tried their bargain tasty dinner there and is great indeedOverall we find this hotel at a great location  mins walk from metro station  stops from Connht Place and great value as long as you dont expect  stars hotels for less than USD a night and good service  We will definitely go back again if we do visit Delhi again just hope they will maintain their high standard as this looks like a pretty new hotel to me and I am hoping thats not the reason why they are so good now 
N => Ok hotel   depending on the price you get  We were originally set to stay at the Hotel Ananda  Apparently the management staff from the Ananda has moved to Grand Peepal and when I emailed to confirm our reservations they said they would switch us to the Grand Peepal for the same price  Rpsnight for a deluxe room  We had complimentary airport pickup   the driver was there on time and very pleasant  This was helpful having just arrived in India  The rooms here were ent   ok size and generally clean  The bathrooms were a typical wet bath style  Our drains didnt work properly and so our bathroom was covered in a half inch of water everytime we showered  The water pressure was also poor but the water was warm  The toilets did not seem to accept toilet paper very well  The rooftop restaurant had good food and we had breakfast included in our room price  The location of the hotel is very good for browsing the Karol Bagh kets and is also close to the Metro for getting to other parts of New Delhi Our first day the management offered to take us to get a free map   this included a hard sell on a car and sightseeing for the day  We ended up going at what we are sure now was a very inflated price  I would suggest just getting a taxi on your own  Overall this was an ok hotel but if you look at the website it shows the tariff as     Rps per night  This hotel is certainly not worth that kind of money by any stretch of the imagination  
N => Not Recommended We were originally booked to stay in the Ananda Hotel and were then moved to this more expensive hotel as apparently the Ananda was full   despite our reservation  The lobby of the Grand Peepal is a bit drab and depressing and the rooftop restaurant didnt really appear to be a going concern whilst we were staying there  The room was ok although we stayed for  nights and it was not serviced once  The main problem with this hotel was the service  The only time anyone at the hotel displayed any interest in us was when we were ushered into a travel agency and given a hard sell about a driver for  days around Rajasthan  After we lined this offer we were pretty much ignored for the rest of the time  We were given no information about local services such as the metro the easiest way to get into central Dehli or restaurants etc We were asked to provide feedback when we checked out and I said that a little more information about the local area would have been helpful  The man at reception then took my feedback read it and then started to argue with me about my feedback that I was wrong to write that that I should have asked more questions    which I found unprofessional Also when we were leaving we booked an overpriced taxi to the train station through the front desk  The taxi never showed up  I kept asking the reception staff about the taxi and they kept fobbing me off but not actually doing anything about it  Eventually I just flagged one down from the street because we were about to miss our train and they tried to tell me that i couldnt take that taxi as I had booked one from them  Naturally I ignored them  Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else  
N => I was not impressed I wouldnt stay here again  We booked in for  nights but started searching for a new hotel after the first day  The rooms we stayed in were ok and the bedding clean enough but there was this overwhelming bad smell that I could not take The general staff waiters etc were very nice but the people at reception could take a lesson or two in etiquette  The food I ordered was really good too They refused to give us a receipt as proof of payment unless we paid them an extra  rupees The man and woman at the desk started got into a fierce argument about something and didnt care that there were guests in their presence  
N => I Do Not Recommend This Hotel At All  I stayed at this hotel for  days and I couldnt stop myself for not posting any review about it cuz Im pretty sure that most of India tourists search Internet to find a proper hotel before traveling just like me  I hope this info help them First of all notice that here is not a luxury hotel and those tourists who look for economy hotels  choose this one  this hotel is small but located near a big shopping area so I could buy foods water fruits and juices etc very easily  shops and restaurants were accessible CHECKING INWhen I arrived I told the lady at reception that I already have booked a room on the phone but she was not aware of it  It was funny that they picked me up at the airport but she didnt know any thing  she called the manager and finally noticed about my reservation which was done a day ago She requested my passport to write my information in their records  she also asked me to write my address there  I just wrote it and signed it  she was waiting until I write the address completely and after I delivered her notebook and pen she crossed a line on my address and told me very rudely and impolitely that the address is written in a wrong row  quotwrite it here  quot she said I was shocked about this kind of behaviour with a new traveller who wanna stay there for a couple weeks  simply she could write the address again in the appropriate row by herselfSo I told her that Im regret and wanna change this hotel right now  please hire a car for me so that I will visit the other hotels and will choose another one  here is not good for me at all  she didnt expect this reaction from me and so she tried to cover her fault  quotSir we can hire a car for you tomorrow morning Its night now quot she said respectfully  I knew that they understood their stupid fault and they wanted to keep me at least for  day and charge me for  day  but I didnt agree and I told her that I will not pay you and I wanna change my hotel cuz Im not happy with your behaviour  She talked to the other staff in Indian language for a couple minutes and after that they all tried to keep me there  they called the manager to come and talk to me very friendly so be I stay there but I told quotno its not possible  I need to move right now  hire a car please quotIn fact I didnt want to move to any other hotel cuz I was not sure about the other hotels and the quality of their services  I just wanted to scare them so that the next time they will understand how to treat with a new traveller  they finally hired a car but begged me ALL not to book any other hotel   Finally I came back to the same hotel and ided to stay there before they cry Inside the hotelThe worst problem was their Wi Fi connection cuz It was going down occasionally and this was annoying  It was not reliable at all  for example It was going down at nights up to morning in the next day and I had to call at reception and complain about it every   days  Although they tried to fix it but the problem was more serious than just restarting the modem and changing some cables Im pretty sure that this problem still exists there   My room was very clean and bed was comfortable bedsheets were also very clean  Foods were good but most of the times they were a bit rare  some kinds of kebabs were always NOT available  dishes were clean but not always  Hot water was always available but I had to call at reception  minutes before taking a bath  Air conditioner was not working properly Room service was not ent and was always with huge delay  some times I had to wait for  hours and call them several times to come and clean my room  Im sure they were trying to ignore me cuz It was free Resturant was not bad but do not try quotcheese sandwichquot at all their cheese is not tasty at all Refrigerator was working properly  Room was safe  you can be sure that no body will steal your belongings   Staff were very polite and friendly The hotel was in a busy area but my room was scilent Checking outThey were just trying to rip me off  for example I didnt have Indian rupees  all I had was Euros and they tried to exchange it with the worst rate  they wanted to make a huge profit in exchanging euro to INR but I didnt agree with their rate So they had to exchange it with the real rate at that time  breakfast was free of charge for me but they included all the bills for breakfast in the final receipt and tried to trick me but again I didnt allow them to rip me off I took all the bills for breakfast OUT and asked them to calculate again  they wanted to charge me for  more day but they couldnt cuz I was ster than them They didnt give me a penny discount  for example I owed them  rupees which is around USD  and I didnt have rupees  but they wanted it and I had to exchange my  EUR bill to Indian rupees so that I could pay them  rupees and this is very funny when I stayed there for  days I was ster and didnt allow them to rip me off after all BUT NEVER TRUST THEM My overall reviewYou can find very better hotels with cheaper prices easily in just walking distances around this hotel  so I dont recommend this hotel at all  I also moved from this hotel to a new hotel after  days One important tipTHE PRIY PRICES THAT INDIAN HOTELS GIVE YOU ARE ALL NOT REAL  ALWAYS TELL THEM THAT THIS IS TOO EXPENSIVE AND WE CAN NOT PAY FOR IT  THEN THEY WILL LOWER THE PRICE TO THE REAL PRICE AND THE REAL PRICE  BE HALF OF THE FIRST ONE GIVEN  
N => Big improvement in this hotel Was having some trepidation about staying here due to earlier reviews but was pleasantly surprised at what we came across in the hotel  Yes the temporary reception quotroomquot is not ideal but new reception due to be ready by next uary  The rooms were excellent large clean and well equipped  However we were in rooms which have been upgraded and as far as we could find out approximately half of the rooms still require upgrading  Restaurant food was fairly good but a fairly limited choice  Bar area was okay but dirty from dust from construction work probably would be closed by EHS in UK  
N => LOcation was good Not worth the rent charged food not very good rooms look old with stained walls albeit large should be maintained properly  not stay their the next time 
N => Rip off I know this review is coming late but when I saw the hotel on the dirtiest list of India I had to weigh in  It was the worst rip off of my life  Paid  USD for one night at what was supposed to be a  star hotel  It was just horrible  Driving up to it I knew something was wrong as it looked like a govt  dept building  Lobby was shabby but proved to be the best thing about it  Lifts corridors and path to room was filthy and badly lit  Room was horrible  Wouldnt lock properly  Toilet was grimy  Beds were uneven  It was  midnight and I couldnt find another hotel  Slept with a chair jammed against the door  Stay away  
N => Hated It We stayed at path to get our infant son out of the Diwali noise and air pollution When we arrived the staff were doing their Diwali worship in the lobby and we had to wait over  minutes just to check in  Not a single member of the staff volunteered to help us check in and get us to our room before they were done  We were left hanging around in the lobby frigid while the staff sang songsThe beds were too narrow and uncomfortable the wooden tiles on the floor were creaky the AC was turned on full blast turning the room into an ice chest the food was too full of chillies and not really good anyway the hotel staff were shouting across the corridor to each other terrible when the sound echoes To top is all they have the nerve to call the path a  star hotel and charge a quotluxuryquot tax It would be hard to call this hotel a  star on all counts We would not stay here again or recommend it to our friends  
N => Awesome Build I was sponsored by CNN IBNnews channel a trip to Delhi to watch the st ODI between India England in ch   Upon reaching Delhi I was transferred to Hotel path for my stay  The hotel was awesome and I have never experienced such incredible service before  Dinner was the best I had over there and the accomodation was simply satisfactory  It was an old structure but was simply magnifiecient in its serenity and beauty If you want a mix of the old and the new then this Hotel is a must  
N => OMG yikes  I didnt stay at this hotel  I was strapped for a hotel at the last minute amp this hotel was in the CP section of my Lonely Planet guide  The first shock was the location  while its in the CP area the hotel is located off of path in a dilapidated looking side alley  The building from the outside read quotMAJOR DIVEquot all over it   dirty and unruly  I took a hotel tour of the rooms which was like going through a depressing mental asylum maze of green walls semi dark hallways and flourescent lights where they were on  The rooms I was shown had NO windows and while it seemed like it might be clean my Rs budget hotel at Cozy Hotel in Pahar Ghanj was looking a lot more chic clean and safe by the minute  The only visual peace I could stammer was the restaurant patio area which was the only place that wasnt as claustrophic and offered a bit brighter of a vibe  This was a HOLE not a  star hotel and definitely NOT worth the price theyre asking There was no way I could stay there amp I even considered throwing my LP guide in the toilet  I ended up going back to my Pahar Ghanj budget  
N => Not worth it First of all this hotels lobby is very cold but I wonder what happens to the AC when we reach the room  Food is very overpriced at a cup of coffeeif ordered through room service costs more than Rs   Food is good in the Sagar Rathna restaurant which provides South Indian fare but the Gulnar restaurant which provides a variety of cuisines is just about okay and priced at slightly higher rates  The rooms are quite spacious but have minimal facilities  The cupboard is also small  The walk from the lift to my room was so long that I felt I was walking from the left wing to the right wing of the Salarg museum  Also do not expect fast billing before  noon and do give notice atleast   hours before  Hotel staff are not very friendly and seem quite cold  
N => possibly the worst value in the world We were booked into the path by a reluctant colleague when we simply couldnt find anywhere else  It is not filthy and there was hot water but that is about all that can be said in its favour  The staff were unhelpful the food below average the rooms ill equipped  Many rooms appear to be derelict and abandoned or being refurbished  We both agreed we had stayed in far better hotels in major European capitals for less than a quarter the price we paid here  
N => Not a place to lay your head I did not stay at this hotel but I did visit prior to ouractual stay there  I toured the hotel withhotel staff and they graciously showed us a roomon the th floor  The location of the hotel is greatand by the appearance driving up it looked veryfavorable considering the price  The lobby was small not grand at all but clean and presentable The elevators were the old English lift type andworked well  Upon our accent to the th floorI was the first to get out of the elevator  Directlyto my left was a part of the hotel or not I wasntsure that was in the midst of construction  Noplastic tarps no barriers just a hallway with toolssawdust wood and construction materials thrownabout  The hallways were bare and deserted  Itreminded me of a mental hospital you saw on TVfrom the s  The room doors were old didnt see safe and I couldnt believe what I was seeing  I would not spend  minutes in that room let alone a night  The furniture was damaged the pillows looked y ears old and it was so very dingy and dirty everywhere  Black ks from dirty hands wereon the walls  The bathroom was completely disgusting  Granted old and clean is fine this was old filthy anddisgusting  I looked in the tub and it was peeling  Crusted dirt and scum was around the rim  I couldnt bare to look any longer  I had to leave  We cancelled our reservations forthe return trip to Delhi  Im so happy we went to check it outbefore checking in  Not recommeded unless you will sleepanywhere  
N => Good  Star HI This is Alam  Me and my Friend stayed in this hotel in the month of ober and we found hotel is good  star You will find all the basic aminities that  star hotel should have  overall its good  star   next time we will stay in this hotel  
N => Filthy Dirty Great location just off the circle but upon check in I was thoroughly disgusted  I was given the filthiest hotel room I have ever seen The quotsuitequot consisted of carpet that looked original and contained more dirt than my garden  The sofa and other quotsuitequot furniture had grease stains across the entire headrest areas the spilled items under the warm empty refridgeration unit should and probably did invite bugs  The windows did not close properly sucking the mildly cool air from the air conditioner right out  The bathroom walls had mold including the shower which only provided ice cold water  Dont be tempted to stay   even for a minute  
N => There are better  star hotels than Hotel path We were in Delhi early    We were told that we could not our first choice of hotel because it was fully booked  The agent told us that she had booked a  star hotel which was better than our first choice so you can imagine our horror when we booked in at the path  Its a run down hotel which should never be classed as  star  The rooms we were given were very basic and from the looks of the doors it looked like the rooms had been broken into  Thankfully we were there only for two nights  I have stayed in better  star hotels in India  
N => This hotel doesnt even deserve  star  When we made reservations we were told this hotel was a  star  This place doesnt even deserve a  star  The rooms were dirty  no hot water at anytime  Bathroom had mold everywhere  Staff was rude  We were promised a free breakfast and ended up having to pay for that  I didnt mind paying I just wanted to get my things and get out of there  
N => path overpriced for mediocre stay We usually stay with family when in Delhi but they were out of town so we had to find a hotel which was safe and clean  Our four year old children were visiting India for the first time and have a complicated medical history so we didnt want them getting sick either  path was recommended to us by cousins who also had children visiting India for the first time and they said they had a good experience  We paid way too much for the stay we got   rsnight  The room though large was very worn the bed was inadequate sized  The bathroom was as clean as can be expected from this kind of hotel I guess not well maintained  We had several maintenance issues while there but the staff was quick and effective in responding  Room service was prompt but often messy in service  The food was reasonable both in taste and price  I was told this hotel was a good transition from America to India  It is not  You will feel the culture shock when you stay here  Our train for departure was in the evening and we asked for delayed check out but they charged us a whole extra day for it  The area was safe and my kids didnt get sick on the food we bought our bottled water elsewhere  Still I wouldnt recommend this hotel because you could get a similar hotel for much less but you have to be careful in Delhi  
N => Bad bad bad I stayed in this hotel with family for one night  It was terrible  The rooms were very dirty with torn carpet  The carpet looked like it has never been cleaned from several years  It is definately NOT a star hotel  It was much worse than some hostels where I have stayed In spite of all this the charges for food were like    hotels  They charged Rs for a cup of tea and more than Rsperson for useless breakfast The staff was rude  At first they told that the breakfast was complimentary  But after we had the breakfast they said it is not  After lot of arguing I had to pay for that  All of the staff was desperate to get tips    no matter how poorly they have maintained the hotel and how poor their service is AVOID AVOID AVOID this hotel  
N => Awful The hotel was an absolute disgrace there was no cleansiness we stayed  night and we did not even unpack our suitcases slept in our clothes  They insist on payment upfront which should of got the alarm bells ringing  DO NOT STAY HERE 
N => Like a Prison We prebooked the hotel online with Asia com  When we arrived at the receptionist it didnt too bad  Once we got to the third floor where our room was the ambience resemble that of the under funded s Lunatic Asylum  The room was horrendous   windows were covered with wooden board  The electric sockets were hanging out  No hot water at all despite the fact that the staff came up twice to fix it  The staff was aggressive and all they wanted was charging extras as much they can  Be very careful before you pay the bills A deperate hotel   only to be used in the crisis  Not recommended to stay more than one night 
N => Absolute no no for this hotel  Terrible horrible pathetic despicable bad cant find enought negative adjectives for this hotel  Rooms are like they have never been cleaned bathrooms are like everyone in the hotel uses one single bathroom  Very dirty  Cant imagine this hotel is still functioning  Service very very bad  no water to drink     just plain out lousy  
N => Terrible experience   Avoid it My experience was terrible  I called the day before to confirm our booking with path and it was confirmed  When we got to path from Jaipur we were rudely told that there was no reservation  I showed the reservation from the internet and he was challenging me that it was not a reservation  He was very rude  It was only after he was going through his reservations did he finally find it and then his tone changed  We had two other bookings for the hotel and he said that there were no other bookings for the future  We even phoned the booking agent twice and they confirmed that there were no other bookings  More later The room was not comfortable and for the first time we both ided to forgoe on the bathshower as it was stained  It was also dark and noisey We were glad to be out of there in one night Now back to the horrible experience   while I was touring around we found out that path hotel charged us for one night as a no show I found this out by email  I immediately contacted path and they said that we did not show  They then argued with me that we did not cancel  I told them we confirmed with hotel and booking agent twice that there were no other reservations  They were very argumentative and would not relent and this went on and on for months  I told my credit card company and they finally stepped in and looked after it  Word of warning   get the name of the front desk person and be cautious about your bookings  They tried to get the money out of us and did not succeed  This was the only real negative on an otherwise wonderful adventure  
N => No puede ser peor  
N => There has to be a better place     We had a choice of this hotel or Yorks Hotel  Sorry to say our group was booked in this place  Upon check we only needed  rooms the hotel was not confirmed with a credit card and the front desk had a fit and we had to take the th room  After a grueling  hour they agreed to give the single rate for the person in the room  The staff took up most of our groups baggage and very clearly stated they wanted a bigger tip then what the individuals gave  We had  rooms with inoperable showerstubs  The water backed up the drain under the sink and flooded the bathrooms  There was only  room that they would change and changed again and again and still flooded  The hotel was not very helpful with problems  The beds were comfortable and clean There is not liftelevator so be prepared to walk up  flights of steps to the second floor There was a roof lounge and we did use it well into the night The hotel wanted payment the same day we checked in  They then insisted we pool our money for all the rooms and pay at one time since they had no change to give us they said We tried to change money at the front desk and they refused Even the bank next door refused to change money  Thank heaven for Thomas Cook across the street The worst part was their so called security guard  We were kept getting a bad feeling about him  One of the single room lady returned to her room to freshen up and he followed her into her corner room  She stopped him dead in his tracks and went face to face with him asking what the bleep he wanted  Complaining to the front desk was worthless  They just said he is security I would not stay here again since there were many choices in the area  The area was nice for shopping  The hotel did have internet for INR  minutes  The straw that broke the camels back was at breakfast  The ladies ate early for INR however when the gentleman came down to eat the same breakfast exactly their bill was INR We noted this to the front desk and they said he ordered less items  Not true  Thank goodness it was only  night  We would have relocated if it was more  
N => No Business Sources here I can t use my laptop here no internet access  my client wanted to visit me but can t find this hotel the telephone operator was bad and rude with him while helping him with the directions  A backpacker area  
N => Good value for the money We chose this hotel for our over night stay in Delhi  The place is good value for the money  It definitely needs a little polish here and there    but our bathroom was spotlessThe staff was very friendly and did their best to make our stay as comfortable as possible  Moreover we can recommend their restaurant  
N => Service was Crap My spouse and I arrived at the Hotel Legend around pm after a long flight  Our bags had not arrived so we were tired and all we could thing of was a hot shower and food  Upon arrival at the hotel we received a very cold welcome at the reception  We were told if we want food to call the kitchen however upon calling to place an order we were told they didnt have any food  The staff ordered food for us from outside and charged us  times the price  When it came time for a shower one EACH night we had to request the staff to turn on the hot water so we could have a hot shower  We also had to tell the staff to turn on the AC in our room very frustrating  Our bed sheets had to be changed twice because they were blood stained and it seemed like the sheets were never changed from the previous occupants Yuck I know this is a budget hotel but these simple services should at least be mandatory in a hotel thats boasts about hr hot waterAC and a simple smile would go a long way  
N => Budget hotel nothing more Given Ive travelled to India previously and stayed in some very cheap but great accommodation I was happy to book Hotel Legend as the reviews were good despite it being super cheap  AUD per night  However compared to other properties we stayed in during this recent trip Id have to say that I dont agree with many of the reviews currently listed for Hotel Legend  My husband and I found it to be a budget property with not much else to offer    the room definitely didnt look as nice as those in the pictures the only sheet on the bed was quite stained and I had to ask for a top sheet to use with the questionably clean blanket  We did have hot water but the toilet didnt flush which wasnt a huge surprise  Staff were OK location was always going to be busy given its close to the train station and essentially in the heart of backpacker district but all in all I dont feel Hotel Legend deserves the average quotvery goodquot rating that its been given  
N => Looks impressive on the website but pretty average hotel Hotel Legend International looked impressive on their website but was a fairly average hotel  The location was fine   walking distance to restaurants but a lengthy rickshaw ride to Chandi Chowk fort etc  Lots of staff at the hotel that seemed to just sit around and argue but not do a whole lot of work  The rooms were fine   clean amp comfortable usual wet bathroom but the toilets didnt really flush nor was there always hot water  The rooms were noisy   there was a telephone that rang continuously on our floor all through the night and was never answered or turned down  The restaurant food was awful   old rice that looked like it was half ricehalf grubs tasteless curries bad chai with rice in it and bad service   only one menu for the entire restaurant when we were taking too long all of a few minutes looking at it the hotel staff whipped it out of our hands and gave it to someone else  For  INR per night I think you could probably find a better value hotel in Delhi  
N => Fantastic Value for money I booked the hotel from england before travelling to delhi as all previous reviews had been pretty positive  I was not bothered about the location as I was only stopping in Delhi for the one night before going to Punjb next day  There were  of us in total  families including kids  We were picked up from the airport taxi driver waited even though we were about  hours late taken to the hotelcheck in was quick and I was really impressed with the rooms  I booked two trible bed rooms which has one super kink bed and a single bed  Rooms were very clean and were ensuite  For the price no one can complain we ordered food at around  am and although they had to go outside to get it but was really good  The whole stay cost me around   that includes airport pickup and drop off at the railway station  I liked it that much that before I flew back to england i stopped there again  Really recommend this hotel to anyone who is unsure about budget accommodation in delhi as i was before I booked  
N => Uneasy ambience and pushy travel agent We booked here after reviews on this site seemed good but only stayed here for a quick nap as we arrived  hours late at am the next morning  We rang and told them to pick us at the domestic terminal but the driver didnt show up   we rang him but he couldnt find us but couldnt tell us where he was and told us to get a taxi ourselves  When we arrived at the hotel the travel agent tried to charge us Rs for the non existent pickup   after some arguing on two occasions we didnt pay him  The room was clean enough but there was no hot water and the toilet didnt flush   it just sprayed water from its pipework across the bathroom floor  The main concern was the number of people loitering on the stairwells and in the lobby which didnt make us feel all that secure here so was glad we only stayed for a very short time before catching a train  The good thing about the hotel is it is only a  minute walk to New Delhi train station   cant think of much else though 
N => nice retreat in busy delhi We enjoyed a  day stay at this hotel We were able to negociate a slightly cheaper price on arrival which is worth doing approximately  rupees They arranged pick up from another hotel near the airport The man organising tripstravel at the front was a bit pushy but otherwise the staff were ok not overly friendly but not rude We ordered room service a few times whcih was really nice The room itself was very comfortable and spacious air con and bathroom were good Would happily stay again Also free internet in the lobby  
N => Great location clean good value This was my first experience of a hotel in India the first stop in a three week trip  Of the horror stories I had read about hotels I wasnt sure what to expect  I was pleasantly surprised  This hotel was as advertised  the price as quoted it indeed had hot water as I was to discover many places said they did but actually didnt it was reasonably clean and it even had toilet paper   The staff were friendly we were able to use the Internet in the lobby whenever we wanted  I would say it was good value for the money  Also I arranged for a car to pick us up at the airport and it was there   So overall we were quite pleased  
N => A ent Place to Stay I chose this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and was pleased with my ision  The rooms are pretty basic and the towels could definitely stand to be replaced but the bed was comfortable and it was nice to have TV in the room  The travel guy in the lobby is definitely shady and will change his quoted price every time you talk with him  However if you do bring up a price that you got at some other travel agency hell definitely move on his prices  Breakfast is okay but dinner is fantastic  Personally I didnt find the hotel to be particularly noisy but they did seem to be doing construction somewhere in the hotel as there was a constant pounding during the day up until about pm  I just chalked it up to it being India and didnt let it bother me  Paharganj is definitely not the nicest place in Delhi but it is close to the railway station which when youre catching a am train is exactly where you want to be  Overall Im happy with my stay  
N => terrible  bad location The hotel is located in one of the worse locations in New Delhi There was no hot water limited amounts of toilet paper the TV channels kept going and the noise from outside was so bad that even ear plugs could not block it out  I would not recommend the breakfast also the guy who sells the tours was very shady kept changing pricesI would not recommend this hotel as its not in a safe location and your bound to get ripped of 
N => Patience is needed   especially if you dont have any laundry Looking back our stay here was so comically and surreal Very nice location close to the train station but it is also a very noicy street The staff english was quite limited and even upon arrival we were asked if we had any laundry  Since we were going home in two dayes the answer was no The rooms are quite smallish but comfortable enough  However the walls are extremly thin and you can hear every word being said in the hall  We even had a bellboy stationed outside our room and even thought he didnt understand a word of danish privacy was limited Every time we went outside our room we were asked if we had any laundry and imagine their dissapointment when my tailormade dress arrived at the hotel and they thought we had our laundry done elsewhere  I actually had to show them my dress to make them understand Roomservice came to the immidiatly after all he sat just outside but they usually forced their way into the room which was quite annoying I would recoomend this hotel after all we ended up having a blast and some very strange and funny memories of this hotel o 
N => Terrible service poor location We booked to stay at the hotel legend for  nights in ruary  We informed the hotel via email that we would be arriving late at night and they agreed to meet us at the airport  When we arrived in delhi no one from the hotel was at the airport and we could not get through on the phone We eventually got a taxi and when we arrived at am there was a group of men sitting in reception  We were told that the hotel was full and when we said we had a booking they got another gentleman who just said they were full and to come back tomorrow with no apology or explanation as too why our booking had fallen through  By this time we were exhausted and the road the hotel was on looked very dodgy so luckily our taxi driver found us a much nicer hotel in another area  We will definetly not be coming back  
N => comforts of home in Delhi For our first few nights in intimidating India we booked with the Legend Hotel and we were glad we did  Its a little higher than our usual budget but having a comfortable place to get over jet lag was worth it  The street is still pretty busy but the interior of the hotel was very nice  Everything is very new  We had a great bed good TV and mostly hot water  Room service was good and pretty cheap as well  Id highly recommend this hotel while youre getting used to the chaos here or simply to anybody who enjoys having a larger room  
N => Pretty good hotel This was quite a nice hotel in a good location  We stayed there twice in a three week period  The room was pretty clean and the staff were very helpful   there was always someone available to help out  We had a couple of small issues   there werent any sheets on the bed only a blanket not uncommon in India though   Id recommend carrying a sheetsleeping bag liner and on both visits we had to ask for the air con and the hot water to be switched on  On the whole though a pretty good place for the price  
N => nice    id tried to book hotel ata close to hotel legend but it was booked up so i was placed in hotel legend instead  i liked it  had a room on the top floor and it was a pleasant surprise clean spacious and quiet  
N => One of The Best hotel expierience I have     After exhausted day of touring colossal city of New Delhi was great experience to find retreat and refreshing in Le Roi Hotel  Atmosphere is so nice  Staff was very friendly and professional  Very clean hotel  I already recommended this place to my friends  Hope to be back next year   
N => ExcellentFriendly  Atmosphere I was on my business trip to Mauritius and India  New Delhi   in ember st week  My all travel arrangement done by Trip Advisor  It was all goodthanks to Trip Advisor  Because I had a very good experienced at Hotel Le Roi New Delhi during my stay it was very comportvery clean amp tidy best room service with respect   Best regards to all staff at Hotel Le Roi New Delhi Gurinderjoingurinder yahoo co uk 
N => Bad Area and Average Hotel I came to this hotel on the recommendation of TRIPADVISER but on thecontrary it was not that good the location is very crowded  The roomservice is poor as they do not listen to us for older of food  It isaverage hotel  
N => Horrible hotel DO NOT STAY here I read the reviews before I booked this hotel  There were a total of  reviews  of them mentioned filthy sheetsstains  I was not sure and I took my chances since it was so close to the Dehli airport and it was the true reason why I chose it  The bed sheets were in fact filthy and disgusting  We checked in the hotel around pm that night and left very early the next morning to catch a flight from Dehli airport so thankfully we only had to stay in this hotel for a few hours  Regardless I couldnt get any sleep thinking how filthy the bed was  We asked for a change of sheets and what they brought was as filthy as what was there before  When we started taking out the old sheet to put over the new ione the amount of disgusting stains on the matress and bed padding was simply disgusting  I do not recommend you stay here if you want a clean place  I tend not to be very picky but this was too much  The have made an effort to put a reception desk as if it is a really fancy hotel dont be fooled by it the rooms are not good and they smell  You are better off in any other hotel 
N => This hotel is terrible There were blood and other unknown stains on the sheets bugs on the floor and neither the hot water nor the heater worked  this was an issue because it was very cold at night and the window was ajar due to the window cooling unit  After a complaint to the front desk the hot water in the bathroom sink began to work but not in the shower so we had to use the dipping bucked to transfer water to the shower to take a ladle shower  This is a terrible hotel  you would be better off at some hostels  
N => Use as a last resort    Some pros and some cons  No hot water  Beds and room okay but bathroom not so clean  Three agressive bell boys insisted on helping with our two bags upon jet lagged arrival and all wanting tips  Had trouble with AC  Breakfast adequate  Desk staff helpful  Dont stay here unless you have to  Not a good experience  
N => good hotel for the money stayed for  nights whilst we did the taj and delhi sightseeingthe hotel arranged for our pick up at airport everything went very smoothlywe did tours thro the hotel and they were worth every penny driver was excellentonly problem not many places to eat around the hotel but we found a little veg restaurant up the road and had a superb thali for   hotel restaurant             well its not arestaurant really they fetch food in at least we can now say we have had the ultimate indian takeaway lol it seemed odd while sat waiting for your meal to see a man run in with a carrier bag food was good but a long wait whilst they fetch it from wherever all the staff were helpful especially the managerwe upgraded to a luxury room it was large and clean but not luxurious but it did the hob ti was supposed to 
N => It had its ups and downs Well our stay was ent  When we arrived at the hotel they told us to go here so we got cab and arrived at the hotel  When we arrived they said were out of triples sp we will upgrade you to a suite so we thought greatwe got a suite  It turns out the room was so so with a refrigerator hot showers  At night there was a lot of street noise and one mourning outside our hotel there was a parade at  a m  All these things we tolerated but when we went down to ask for towels they said quotwell bring them to youquot so they could get a tip and one guy just sat outside our door until he got one  The location is so so and its really near anything  They did have wi fi not in room cable tv and by the way the restraunt sucks when we ordered they ran out and got from a different restraunt Overall you can find a better place us this as a last resort 
N => Avoid We booked our stay at Hotel Madonna through Expedia prior to consulting a print travel guide on India  The lobby is just as pictured but the room we were given was nothing like those on the websites  The room was adequate but definitely NOT worth the price  The surrounding area is far removed from many tourist sites and not really an area you want to explore on foot  We asked about the complimentary internet access but the hotel staff were unable to get their computer running Windows  to work  they just kept checking the cables and turning it off and on  There are much better places to stay in Delhi  Avoid the Hotel Madonna as it is overpriced and not in a desirable location  
N => Loved the maddona We were warmly greeted at the airportby hotel driver no charge Taken directly to hotel  Greeted by Mr Singht at the hotel manager asked if I wanted dinner and after a  hr  flight those were the words I wanted to hear  After dinner was escorted by the bellman  Sanjay  to my room which was immaculate and very clean with all western amenities including A C  Staff was very accomodating any requests I had were fufilledeven when I left hotel I was offered a hotel business card Staff was always concerned and wanted to make sure I always knew the way back I had the pleasure to meet the owner Mr Pinto who was truly a gentlemen and even sat down with me to to show the city center and directions to the popular places in town  Many Thanks to the staff at Hotel Maddona 
N => Dont Book Here We had contacted the hotel a few days before that we would need to be picked up from the trainstation at  pm  We had done this as we wanted to be safe and the hotel ensured us this would not be a problem Once we arrived and  minutes of waiting and on the phone the hotel told us to get any taxi and they would cover the cost  Once we finally arrived at the hotel the manager who was very rude proceeded to argue with the taxi driver and try to get us to pay  He tried to do the same the following morning when wanting to check out  By now all we wanted to do was go to bed  When we finally got to the room it was horrible Large ants all over the floor dirty bathroom no towels and rubbish in all the corridors  Couldnt wait to get out of there 
N => not clean Just kept seeing cockroaches  
N => Unpleasant stay Rooms were dirty staff was unfriendly  I know I shouldnt expect much but it didnt fulfill the lowest standards  
N => Hmmmm We booked this hotel not knowing much about Delhi  It turned out to be quite expensive for what we got although the location was pretty good very noisy street but where isnt in India  The rooms have carpet which is filthy and quite frankly carpet anywhere in India is a bad idea  Staff were friendly enough the breakfast staff had very limited english and the breakfast was very average      I dont think I would stay here again 
N => loved the complimentary cookies was picked up at the airport and taken to the hotel   delightfulCheck in was quick and easy  The owner was in thelobby  a nice gentleman  He made arrangements fora car to take us to Agra  the charge for the hire wasnot bad  The driver was very nice and helpful  Enjoyedthe complimentary cookies every eveningWould certainly visit again  
N => What a DUMP Arrived in middle of night by taxi very expensive rider operator did not have reservation put us up in room dirtY smelly slept on top of bed as someone had already slept on sheets  Had help with luggage but would not leave until tipped and tipped wellBathroom was very small you could sh t shave shower all in one position as you could not do anything else Supplies were limited to a little toilet paper no soap one wet towel Checked out early they do not take credit cards   what we were told only cash   I paid  and friend paid  only bills we had on hand In very bad area     STAY AWAY 
N => Not a place to recommend The Madonna hotel was reserved for us by a travel agent reputedly a   hotel  We arrived late at night am and there were thankfully people awake  Two guys brought our bags up and stayed in the room until they were tipped  I had only INR  but as the porter said quotthat is a small tip  is a large tipquot   Well indeed  is the most i ever tipped in India and definitely way to much The rooms were a bit grungy the bathroom definitely a mess although the shower was allright warm water wise  The beds very very hard and the rooms incredibly noisy  I must say i feel bad for those people trying to sleep when we arrived  Breakfast was included but they first tried to get us to pay for the breakfast when i pointed to the fact that it was included they withdrew the bill  The breakfast we got was not that well plain toast en egg with a lot of water it seemed Definitely not something i would every recommend to anyone arriving in Delhi Especially bad ks for the rude and very tip minded staf  We had left our passports at the reception to copy the next morning at  i was woken by the reception on the phone that they needed our passports we had arrived at  am      After reminder that they already had the passports nothing more was heard  
N => A ent Delhi hotel A ent Delhi hotel at a reasonable price  Clean and comfortable  Near the Metro   minute walk so accessible to much of Delhi  In a lively neighborhood with shopping opportunities all around  Just two doors down from a fast and inexpensive internet cafe  The staff was helpful but not friendly  Also not particularly attentive they took my passport when I arrived but failed to return it when I checked out costing me an hour could have been worse if I hadn t remembered  Breakfasts were good and the one dinner I had was very good  
N => New Delhi Experience Found this hotel through contact at Delhi airport and what a wonderful experience it turned out to be  The rooms were very comfortable and service excellent  We were also able to avail ourselves of the excellent service of Naresh Bhatia in organising a driver toshow us the sights of Delhi and a tour of Agra and Rajasthan for  days where his knowledge is second to none through his experience of booking everything including private taxi knowledgable driver Ramesh and city guides who ensured that we ha athoroughly wonderful time  We then travelled back to Delhi and stayed at Hotel Madonna before going on to Amritsar where yet again the service provided was excellent through organisation of flights and trains including pickups to hotels etc    After this vellous experience we returned to Madonna to conclude our stay before returning to Goa  We would definitely recommend this hotel and the services of Naresh wishing to have an excellent visit to Delhi and further afield  
N => Our Great base in Delhi At the end of e my partner and I returned from a once in a lifetime trip to India  Our first and final  nights were spent in Delhi were we stayed at the Hotel Madonna  As we had been warned it would be difficult to find good hotels in Delhi not including the luxury ones we struggled to find an option of hotels in Delhi which we felt comfortable with and within our price range  We finally settled for the Hotel Madonna which looked okay on the web  Upon arrival at about am in the morning we were warmly welcomed by the night manager and  people assisted with our bags  Although we booked a Luxury Deluxe room and were really a bit worried about what to expect  however we were very happy with our room  It was a good size bright and most importantly clean  We also had airconditning fridge and International TV channels  Also in its favour we found it convenient travel to all the sites we wanted to see  Staff were always friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble  And after we spent  days travelling to other parts of India we returned and it was nice to come back to the Madonna for our last  days 
N => Didnt like it We went in expecting the quotunexpectedquot given the mixed reviews so we brought our own sheets and towels which came in very handy as their sheets were dirty and our towels were much better The hotel in general is clean the restaurant underground does have an odor and the helpers are very nice  The location is not too bad  blocks away from subwaymetro station  Keep in mind that the metrosubway itself doesnt cover much of Delhi Our experienceUpon arrival after a  hour flight the front desk guy was very welcoming already concerned with our next day plans We saw a couple of people walking in with a bottle of mineral water and we figured we leave everything in the room and go get some of our own  On the way out again the receptionist asked about our plans for the next day  We walked just down the street to the right which has a beat up sidewalk which is taken by some vendors anyway and found a little tour store which we used for just about everything  Read on for whyThe next morning again same thing but we were firm and just said we wanted to explore by foot which is okay but you cant really get to many monuments by subwaymetro I dont recommend bus  At night we ided to take a driver from the ever so concerned receptionist to go to dinner at the Intercontinental he charged us  rupees to be paid when we checked out Two problems there first they way overcharged us so we used the office listed above and during check out they tried VERY hard to up that charge even more  So between spending  per night here and   at other places close to Connht Place dont bother trying to save the extra few bucks Pictures to come    
N => Cool orations but loud with pesky staff We found this place via their website which makes it look like a fairly hip jazzy location  While the exterior or is in fact cool Hotel Madonna disappointed on many levels  Overstaffing in India is common to provide jobs but every time we came and went a different guy grabbed each bag   meaning four arate tips  On one instance I didnt have anything small to tip one of the porters who was also in charge of delivering toilet paper so I told him Id tip him later guess who ran out of TPThe location is out of the way and the neighborhood is truly India   loud all the time with plenty of honking to keep you awake at night  Compared to the place we stayed in Bombay thicker walls this was like sleeping in a rock concert  The bed was uncomfortable the bathroom was fairly grungy  They do have an internet connection but speeds are at  levels  They threw in free breakfast mediocre and set up some a driver for the day who repeatedly lied to us and took us to quotthe only open restaurantsquot in Delhi until we made him take us to one out of the guidebook that was magically open as well Bear in mind we stayed here after three weeks in India so we were getting pretty sick of the tourist exploitation that goes on there  Still you can do a lot better than the Hotel Madonna   we did everywhere else we stayed in India  
N => My first contact with India  I was in Delhi last year my first time in India  I was a little bit afraid going alone but when I arrived at the aerport a guy from the hotel was waiting for me and brought me to the hotel at that hour and in a strange city very pleasant  The owner Mr  Pintoo helped me the first days learned me more about India and what to do and NOT to do  Leaving Delhi he helped me to reach every place I wanted to visit  The hotel is located near the metro so very usefull to see the city  Im going back in a few months cant waitBernard 
N => Do not stay here Everything started out OK   phoned the hotel ahead of time got a rate in USD  and arranged a hotel pick up which was there when I arrived  The people were nice enough but I got the sense that they would try to eive me  Sure enough at check out time they attempted to overcharge me  Once I pointed out the mistake they quickly rectified it The breakfast is included but nothing special  The dining room is subterranean and smelly  The room was clean but very basic and my bathroom had a direct opening to the outside and during the night when I got up to use the bathroom there was a  bird  inside my bathroom   nearly scared the life out of meThere is a dearth of good midrange hotel rooms in Delhi  Try the India Habitat Centre if you can find someone with a membership This hotel is not up to western standards and should be avoided if at all possible  
N => cheap budget hotel The hotel was good but the restaurant was of poor standard every time you entered it smelt really bad hygine was not of top of the list  However tour organiser was good and we enjoyed the tour  our room was clean but basic  If you do visit delhi be aware of profit making scandles your guide and taxi driver are usually in to make some money We came across this when our guide would not let us go where we wanted to go and kept taking us places he wanted and forcing us to buy things that we did not want buy  
N => Not Good Stayed here for a total of three nights and didnt really have much say on where I stayed as it was booked as part of a package  I couldnt agree more with the second to last reviewer especially with regard to the moth ballsThe bathroom suite was black and the bath itself was peeling and a bit of a safety hazard  The toilet had one of those quotsanitized for you conveniencequot labels on it which was a joke as it was not clean  The shower curtain was filthy  The rest of the room was adequate but I didnt feel it was all that clean Breakfast was OK With regards to the new wing mentioned by the previous reviewer I dont think this is being keted as part of the Mehar as it looks from the photos in a completely different league I would chose not to stay here in the future  
N => sets the bar low Im not one to complain much but as my first hotel in India this really set the bar low even though I wasnt expecting a lot  From the green slime covering the shower head to the rot in the corners of the bathtub to the mothballs scattered throughout the room to the infernally noisy air conditioner   i dont know where to start  Ill start with the dead bugs i was picking out of my bed before i went to bed  And the noise that woke me up at am   it was daily street noise that felt like it was just on the other side of thin walls  Or be Ill start with the bed that felt like a plank of wood covered with a thin blanket The cold shower is not something i would complain about since I didnt get it at  of the  hotels I stayed at  The area around the hotel is in the main shopping area of Karol Bagh  Its not the safest area to start out in but you can get good bargains and its close to the metro  They offer free internet but its really slow  The phone in the room is on a rotary dial system  On the bright side the room was large the hard bed turned out to be relatively comfortable and room service was attentive if not on the annoying side  
N => A fairly ent hotel My wife and I stayed in Room    Double Deluxe Room at INR night as advertised on their web site Location within about  minutes walk to Karol Bagh metro station  Plenty of street shops and vendors in the daytime Quite a spacious room with sitting area ble floors  Not spotlessly clean be but quite ent  Hard mattresses aircon working but wouldnt set to heating though staff provided additional blankets on request  Still as the drht was coming through the window we had to move our bed to the middle of the room every night and back every morning  Noise protection next to non existent so all door bangs and loud conversations in the corridor are heard very clearly and so is the work in the street No reading lights Bathroom has definitely seen better days  There was hot water in the shower though the pressure was barely adequate Good staff  Excellent food   probably the best vegetable fried rice we had during our two week trip  
N => unreliable the hotel provided a very uneven experience al round  Certainly there were some nice touches in the room such as the beautifully carved bed but it looked out on the interior service stairwell  The staff who actually did the work were lovely   but the management were dreadful and couldnt have cared less when we arrived back after travelling for  hours to find that even though we were pre paid theyd put someone else in our room and we had nowjere to stay After a huge row they transferred us to a scruffier sister property closer to the ket and with much more pleasant management  The Indian breakfast is great   dont even bother with the European one  I guess it all depends on what you want in a hotel   were not after  star treatment but some consistency would be a good start  
N => clean and convenient We were particularly happy with the convenient and central location Metro Heights had to offer us in delhi near the metro sation connecting to all parts of delhi  We reached Metro Heights at middle of the night and had our confirmed bookin so were checked in and found a ent accommodation in what we had paid  usd The next morning the buffett breakfast was well laid and was hot and were served eggs to order as well  We ided to continue our stay in the hotel instead of looking for another hotel in the area The staff was proffessional and friendly dont expect out of the way service  BUT WE DIDNT REGRET THE ISION TO STAY AT METRO HEIGHTS  
N => metro height was good value for money and safe We booked the hotel through the website which looked quite attractive and were promised a pickup from airport The pickup as promised was there and were taken to the hotel which took about  minutes  we were greeted at the reception nicely and were checked in   staright went to the bath room and had nice hot water shower i was not sure i would get hot water we were hungry so asked for food and was told that it is available  hours The food took some time to come as we were ttold that it is cooked fresh Food was not bad Next morning we went to the restaurant serving breakfast somewhere down it was good set up and ent enough considering it was in the package as complimentary MOST imp  Part of our stay was that the hotel was clean and safe for family  
N => OK We stayed at Hotel Metro Heights as part of an Intrepid tour so had little choice in the booking of it  I think because we were part of a tour group we were reserved the worst rooms availableWe stayed there at the start and end of our tour although if we hadnt pre booked as part of the tour we probably would have chosen not to go back Our first room didnt have a window which struck us as a bit odd until we discovered that you have to pay extra for a window even odder never before had I considered windows as an unessential luxury Although I guess one benefit of no window was that there were fewer traffic sounds to keep us awake  The second room we stayed in did have a window after arguing with unhelpful staff and was cleaner and larger but was next to the first floor office of the hotel so we were kept awake by the phone incessantly ringing and people shouting in the halls All in all I think Hotel Metro Heights was fine but not great value for money especially as it is out in Karol Bagh not particularly central or interesting part of Delhi  The staff were largely unhelpful and the included breakfast left a lot to be desired  Cost approximately RS  which I would say was daylight robbery for the level of service provided  If you shop around Im sure you could get a lot more for your money  
N => Reception staff are awful This must have the worst reception staff ever  You could have up to  behind the counter doing nothing and yet it seems too much trouble to even acknowledge that a customer is waiting to ask a question The hotel rooms appear dark and uninviting  There are many hotels in Karol Bagh so just go to one of the others and check out the rooms  Avoid this place if possible  
N => Returned later in trip and walked out  We had stayed here earlier in our trip  At that time we were given the promised room number   However we were showed two new rooms this time as  was taken  The two new rooms were bad compared to   One room had the smell of sewage  The front desk could not find us a comfortable room  The front desk again refused to provide air conditioning  We were disappointed in the take it or leave it attitude which is becoming more prevalent in New Delhi with the paucity of hotel rooms  We chose not to support this behavior by staying here again and we moved next door to the Hotel Singh Sahib  
N => Terrible Looks O K at the main desk but rooms are very average We had to stay here twice at the start of our trip and at the end a few weeks later as it was already pre booked  days in India at various hotels but this was the worst Hotel staff are unfriendly and un co operative especially towards females Only stay here if you must or if it is part of you tour package  
N => not metro heights Metro Heights The ambience of a budget hotel but not a price to match We walked into the foyer and thought this place looks ok and that was as good as it got  Our room had water ks on the wall  The timber door frame in the bathroom was rotten and the air conditioner hardly worked The day staff on the counter delivered a service that was akin to that of Faulty Towers where any request was received as an inconvenience  We asked for clean towels which arrived after  minutes and an additional request  A Request for an extra bed in the room took a couple of hours   To actually get the attention of the staff was an exercise in patience where we had to wait for them to stop watching the telly in the lobby or to stop chatting to their friends who would often drop by for a social visit  The location in Carolbahg is now in the middle of a car services area where every second shop seems to specialise in car speakers or window tinting  The meals were OK  We had a couple of breakfasts and a dinner which werent overly expensive   The table cloths looked like the same ones that were on the table after we retuned from a fifteen day tour  
N => Poor service at the Metro The Hotel Metro Heights in Karolbagh Delhi was our base in Delhi during our  week trip to India  This was my first trip to India although my wife and her parents whom we were travelling with had visited before so I kind of knew not to expect too much The hotel itself is in a dusty busy side street some  minutes by autorickshaw from Connht Place  Its within walking distance of the Karolbagh shopping areas which is a bonus if you are into shopping The rooms are okay  We stayed in three different rooms on three different occassions as we were travelling and staying in other towns as well  The hotel kindly and safely kept a large number of our luggage that we did not require while travelling  The quality of the rooms vary  Some do not have bath tubs while some do  Some are smaller than others  Generally the bathrooms and rooms are clean and tidy if not of the best quality The problems If you do not hand your key in when going out in the morning your room does not get made up We were given damp pillow cases and towels the one night  The excuse being that due to it being winter laundry does not dry Breakfasts are appalling and is served in a dinghy basement that does not really encourage you to eat  We had requested a packed breakfast for one early morning start  Instead the hotel insisted that they would have a hot breakfast ready for us  This did not happen and we ended up eating just bread and a boiled egg  The overall service is just poor and they have to be pushed real hard to get anything done  Warm water is not hot water a concept that this hotel just did not understand  The rooms can be quite noisy given its location there is a flyover quite close by  The staff are also noisy during their shift changes  They are also reating some rooms and have a tendency to work till quite late unless you shout at the the night clerk Stay here if you must but skip the breakfasts and be prepared for poor service  
N => cheap and good for a night We chose this place to be near the train station as we flew in at midnight and needed to catch a am train the room was small but he Ac worked and the twin beds were clean and not too hard  The shower was not totally clean but for our  hours it was fine  Only problem was that we couldnt find the hallway lightswitch and it was dark trying to leave the hotelCant comment on the veiws or location as we were too tired and it was our first night in India Paid  for the double  
N => Please do not stay here Liked most LeavingLiked least Hard sell of tourtravel packagesWe only stayed for two nights but wouldnt have stayed for any had we not already paid via the internet  If youre thinking of staying at this hotel please dont  I just dont want anyone else to have the same experience as us We arranged for transport from the airport which proved very useful and the car driver was on time and very friendly  The hotel itself was down an alleyway but I guess a lot of Delhi hotels are  The room was a good size but even if the sheets and pillowcases had been cleaned they certainly didnt look it  We ended up putting tshirts on the pillows before we dared lay our heads on them The area is very noisy at night  We couldnt shut out the noise from outside as there was an air con unit fitted to the window   not that it worked as the plug had been cut off  Inside the hotel was also very noisy with staff shouting to one another and music playing  Could also hear another hotel guest being very ill in the room upstairs    Yuk Always seemed to be about  staff around and except for the very smiley doorman no one seemed to do much unless they thought there was a good chance of a tip On the first day we asked reception for directions to the train station but he insisted on calling the manager  The manager arrived  Again we asked directions  So when he led us outside and through the streets we naively thought he was taking us there   no he was taking us to the Mohans sister hotel where he proceeded to hard sell his tour packages  After an hour of explaining we werent ready to buy anything we left and he was obviously unhappy about it   not offering any help in locating the train station or even returning to the Mohan  We were now in an area completely unknown to us in the middle of Delhi on our first day there  To say this was a bit scary is an understatement and just underlines how little the Mohan International thinks of their guests   perhaps people who do buy their travel packages get treated a lot better Please dont stay here unless you know the area dont mind the noise are able to say no very forcefully and are completely financially unable to stay elsewhere  I honestly think the good reviews on tripadvisor must have been put up by the manager employees or friends of the hotel because I cant imagine any other reason why people would recommend this hotel to others Please dont stay here  
N => Not worth it Bottom line   dont stay here  Its totally over priced and there must be better hotels nearby  The guy who worked the front desk was horrendous   when I asked him for directions to a specific restaurant he asked me why I didnt just order room service and refused to help me  When I tried to book a taxi to the airport he tried to charge me double what we paid on our way in  The hotel is very noisy and the free quotbreakfastquot was pretty disgusting  
N => Avoid this dump  Avoid this place   you  have seen in advertised on the STA website but I would guess that STA have not stayed here  It is a very basic hotel and the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired  We paid  UK pounds per night as we wanted our first few nights accomodation sorted out before we arrived but with hindsight there are a lot of similar hotels in the area which are much cheaper if you just walk in off the street The management also hassled us to try and get us to book tours through them and were very reluctant to accept NO for an answer The only advantage to this place is its proximity to New Delhi Railway station but as I say there are many other hotels in the immediate area which offer better value for money Get a Lonely Planet and make some phone calls  
N => basic but clean and central We ebooked in advance and arranged a car to meet us at the airport a very good tip as you WILL be ripped off by taxi drivers they can sense newcomers  the hotel was clean the loos flushed and the showerfan and ac worked  On arrival we felt we were stuck down an alleyway in a seemingly grotty part of town  It turns out most of Delhi looks like this it takes a bit of getting used to  Mohan is easy to find as it is directly behind the sheila cinema  we had no problem with the management however do not use the inhouse travel agent for taxi tours or car booking we chose to use the ata hotels m away even then we were advised to book from the company directly as commission is charged by all operators involved  Also bring your own loo roll although it can be bought from the shop std phone stall at the end of the street  I am sure we paid over the odds but as i say it was worth it to avoid the hassle that you will get from touts taxi drivers and helpful strangers who want tipped for their advice  
N => Awful Yes its cheap yes its close to the station but its awful  was not under any illusions as to getting much for our money   wasnt expecting an amazing place for the price but i wish we had paid a little more and stayed somewhere better  The room was horrible the bathroom was filthy   i did not wash while i was there we arrived to find cigarette butts in the toilet sheets where dirty We also saw several cockroaches although this isnt exactlyt unusual in Delhi the tipping point came when we could hear buzzing in the room which we though to be the electricity or fan so after turning them on and off afew times we were stumped as to what it could be went to go back to sleep picked up my pillow to reveal  huge cockroaches underneath it  WRANK  
N => Disgusting    Dirty bathroom fan was so loud that we cant sleep dirty bed clothes  We paid for pick up from airport and driver didnt want to show us where the hotel is without a big tip  
N => hot hot hot Hotel Namaskar has just  pluses first   its really cheap  rupees per room for four peoplesecond   has great locationThe other way is terriblle  Was really hot fans are not enough our room didnt have windows bathrooms are owful  People are ok  Next time in New DElhi we will choose sth different  
N => friendly staff hot water and a bed what more do you need I stayed at the Hotel Namaskar when I first arrived in India on the th uary  I had arranged for their airport pickup which was waiting as promised at the airport  The journey to the hotel was hair raising to say the least but then it was my first experience of Indian drivingOn arriving at the bazaar the car had to park a bit away due to the road being dug up but the driver carried my bags to the hotel for me  I had a double room clean and reasonably comfortable for  rupees a night  The toilet worked and the hot water was supplied by a boiler outside the room which also worked  The staff were very friendly the young Nepalese boys were great and the other counter staff could not have been more helpful  The owner is a little intimidating but once you get used to him he is actually quite nice  They searched online for me and found me a great flight price for my return from Goa  I stayed three nights before setting off on my travels around India  I returned for one night after flying back from Goa prior to flying home the next day  Unfortunately the booking had been missed but they did find me a room not quite as good as the first but adequate for one night  Overall I felt very safe here and it was a good introduction to India I stayed in hotels that cost far more and provided less in other places 
N => Hotel Namaskar   No Thanks I recently booked a room at hotel Namaskar and arrived around  am  By the time I arrived at the hotel the door was locked  The rickshaw operator knocked on the door and was told that the hotel was booked  I waited around for a few minutes and then called the hotel while standing outside the door  After wasting about  minutes on the phone while looking at the guy I was talking to he finally let me in the door Even though I booked the room online and got a confirmation email I was told that the room would not be available until noon  Around  am the owner came in and let me have the room  hours early  He said the usual charge for early check in was  what I was quoted by the guys when I came in  Once entering the room it did not look very clean I took the  rupee room  The bathroom was fairly small and the toilet looked very dirty  The bed did not look like the sheets were clean either  Luckily I took the advise of another traveler and brought my own sheet to cover the bed and sleep on I stayed another night and was moved to a smaller room  rupees  The second room was dirtier than the first  The sheets had not been changed and the room had not been cleaned since the last guest left  Upon entry into the room both of the sheets covering the mattress had blood stains on them  There was an empty package of lingerie on the bed  The bathroom was a lot smaller than the first one and this one did not even have hot water in it  To get hot water you have to take a bucket down the hall and bring it back to your room As far as the room being cheap not really  Yes you can get a room as cheap as  rupees  But it is not clean and there is nothing in the rooms but a bed and bathroom no tv nothing  Also international flights usually arrive very late or very early in the morning  You pay for the room from noon to noon  If you get the larger room with the water heater no ac you will pay  rupees for the room until noon  Of course you will not leave at noon so you will have to pay another  rupees to stay overnight  Thats  rupees for pretty much  day in their hotel  For  rupees you can find a much better place The staff was friendly but in a crooked sort of way  When I asked about a good restaurant in the area I was told that they would get me the food and deliver it to my room  I gave them  rupees for the food  When they returned they did not provide me with change or a receipt  When I asked about the cost I was told quotIts okquot and they left They are proud of being recommended by Lonely Planet  I was shown a copy of Lonely Planet and the recommendation by the author to stay there and book tours through Namaskar  They do take a rather large commission on the booking of the tours  The cost was about   higher than the cost the driver normally charges  While on the road the driver stopped at some local shops so that I could do some shopping  Of course these were shops where he would earn commission if I bought something and the prices were grossly inflated   shops I did not even ask him to stop at or even make the slightest inclination that I was interested in purchasing the type of goods sold there  He just stopped and said it was part of the tour The hotel offers to keep your luggage for you if you go out on a trip  I would not recommend this  While leaving I was handed someone elses bag  If I were a dishonest person I could have walked away with somebodys luggage I stayed at Hotel Namaskar after reading some reviews on a website that claimed it was a good deal and it was clean  If you want a clean place at a reasonable rate look elsewhere  
N => Friends from other hotel This hotel is recommended by Lonely Planet  The problem of accomodation being recommended by Lonely Planet is that the hotel will tend to be over booked or over popular  This Hotel Namaskar is the first on top of the budget hotel list so we called to make reservation two days before we reach Delhi  The person who takes the call said the rooms are alway available and we can come to stay any time When we reach Delhi we went straight to the hotel which we had made reservation and I saw my name on the reservation book too  Then the man at the counter ask his man to show the room for me  At the point of time I realised something was wrong the man took me to other hotel which do not even known to me  I realised later that the hotel that we want to stay is full  So in order not to loose any chance of earning a little more income the owner without even telling us what happen took us to the other hotel nearby which probably will give him some commission if he quotdeferquot a customer to his hotel  
N => Super Service  gute Adresse  
N => My Stay in Delhi Booked via Makemytrip  Hotel is average  Location is midst of Karol bagh the populated area of Old Delhi  Close to many places though  We stayed here as we needed to visit US Consulate for an Interview  Room was very good though no balcony  AC was good  Had a problem with the bathroom lock  Got locked out from inside  Bathroom has new jacuuzi but it was not that effective and was malfunctioning  Room service was very good  Got value for money to some extent  TV was good  Was an LCD  Would recommend  
N => oh ma gosh    plz never stay here i went to Delhi for a tour with my family consisting of  members we had actually booked rooms in an other hotel but we reached late at nite coz of the big traffic block in delhi  the other hotel people said that the room was not available at nite and that they have arranged room in a nearby hotel i e omni  we agreed and when we reached there the chechk in counters we gud but the room were just horrible    it was very small and very conjusted   we could hardly move around    the bed spread  linens etc were so untidy and had a foul smell   now to talk bout the bathrooms i better dont say anything  it was so untidy and i think it hadnt been cleaned for an year   the rooms were so dark and we couldnt differentiate between nite and day   it was such a horrible experience   the services were ok   next day we were shifted to the hotel which we had bookednot omni   thank god i was shifted   the other hotel was gud  but i wud say to everybody that never go and stay in this hotel  
N => No I dont want to go to Agra  I am used to staying at inexpensive Indian hotels as well as Western style hotels in India  Usually the Indian hotels above a certain price range like more than USnight are fine with some shabbiness in the facilities  Other than the bathroom my room was clean and comfortable and even the bathroom was okay if not spotless  They provided a kettle and some instant coffeetea too although the mug was dirty with dried coffee inside  The hotel has free  wireless Internet a real convenience  But I would never stay here again because its pretty clear its a scam for the travel agency that ownsis partnered with it I should have known when I arrived this place was into fleecing people  I tipped the guy who carried my bags  Later he hunted me down because the bill was ripped  I know that India has this wierd thing about bills not being legal tender if they are ripped but theres apparently some exchange process where you take the old bill to a bank and theyll replace it and this bill was ancient but intact  not actually ripped  Im   sure this guy brought the bill back because he thought he deserved a bigger tip and of course since I didnt have any other small bills of the same denomination I did give him a bigger tip  I wouldnt do that now Can I just say I am sooooo sick of the following sequence of questions  Sir where are you from What is your good name   How long are you in staying in Delhi answer  days  Have you ever been to India yes  times  What are you doing today ummm some work be going to visit some friends  Would you like a package tour to the Taj Mahal in Agra or the more forceful you  would  like a package tour to the Taj Mahal  And usually a refusal to take no for an answer I was asked  seven  times to go to the Taj by the hotel staff  desk clerks bellhop including one extended conversation in which they claimed there was some problem with my hotels com reservation then took me to a travel agency a block away to have them check my reservation and give feedback to the management and three guys took turns trying to sell me tours  The next day I get an unscheduled wakeup call  Im dead asleep a call to the room wakes me up and he asks about my hotel voucher quotI gave you the reservation sheet yesterdayquot quotWhat are you doing todayquot quotWhy do you want to knowquot quotYou should go to Agra todayquot I slam down the phone  Even just leaving the hotel the desk clerk stops me asks my room number then interrogates me about my plans again same guy as that morning on the phone I dont know  Im used to touts  But the hotel staff honestly seem to think I owe them a booking on some overpriced tour  Its like one of those condo timeshare sales pitches that lasts your entire stay in the hotel  Never again will I stay hereChecking out was more of the same  Again with the upselling  So first they get all huffy and theyre like quotyou have to pay at check outquot Um yes I normally expect that at a hotel  But again they are frustrated because my voucher is not a voucher but a reservation through hotels com not prepaid in this case  Okay so I try to pay  Despite the lovely lucite stand sitting on the check in desk saying quotWe accept visamasteramerican expressquot they refuse to take my card  quotWell we dont take cards for such a small amount quot Yeah like  is too small an amount to charge  in India where Ive seen merchants set minimum charge amounts near   And its not like its some old al stuck in a place where it cant be removed or some sponsored sign that has other information on it  Its a brand new sign sitting on the desk that says only that they take the credit cards  Okay Ill pay cash  Then they refuse to give me a receipt  And the reason Because they say my internet reservation is my receipt I just hand this guy a wad of cash and hes telling me the same piece of paper I had before I paid is now proof of payment  I pushed the issue and got upset and refused to leave until I had a receipt fearing that they would then charge my credit card used in the reservation as well and claim theyd never received the cash  Again with the trip to the travel agency around the corner to speak to the management  He says well have to charge you more if you get a receipt  We have to include luxury tax then  and I say and you would have cheated the government of the tax otherwise The guy says again and again quotwe are very honest how would we stay in business otherwisequot Right after admitting to me hes stealing from the public coffers  And again with the upselling  quotWhere are you going now You should just hire a car for the day only  rupees quot In the end the ride to the airport cost me  even though my Indian friend had taken the same ride also booked through the hotel the previous day for   As Im getting into the car the hotel guy says well its  for the ride but  if you want AC  Well fine then I dont want AC  I spend half the ride arguing  Driver tries to sell me on how great the AC is then he tries to pull the quotI am but a humble servant and its so hot wont you please pay for AC Please sir Pleasequot I know full well hes getting   of the real fare and Im not gonna pay him one paisa more on the bait and switch  I tell him if he wants the AC so badly he should pay the  rupees and hed still be making more than normal off me  At this point its not the money its the principle of the thing with the hidden charges etc  Ive had to yell at three people from the hotel just to get them to leave me alone  And in approximately  months of traveling in India over a period of several years Ive had to resort to yelling when someone just wouldnt take no for an answer only twice before this hotel  once with a beggar who tried to stop me from walking down the sidewalk by blocking my path for about  minutes straight and once with a dishonest internet cafe host Please please dont even bother trying this hotel  Karol Bagh is full of comparable hotels at generally lower prices that dont come with a fulltime harrassment program  
N => Hotel Omni is not a hotel I got hotel booked from my indian partners amp this is the worst hotel Ive every stayed in I happened to stay here last month amp everything from the service to the rooms were just terrible  The first thing youll notice would be the smell of damp linen    everything from the bed sheets to pillows stunk with the smell  Check In system was horrible   I left the next morning since it was late in the night and staying in a neighbouring much cheaper but much cleaner and nicer hotel I didnt get enough time in India to be able to get the hotel closed but if I ever do this is the first thing I would do 
N => Feel like  star hotel  Excellent place to live Stayed there for a week  Great service  Awesome staff Rooms are  star standard  Definitely you will get value for money to stay here  I will strongly recommend  
N => Good but noisy We stayed only one night and our room was close to the reception  All the noise from the hall way and reception could clearly be heard in our room all night  Also there were some cat fights under the window providing more noise  Try to get a room far away from the reception andor wear earplugs Eevrything else worked OK  
N => Clean rooms great service good location and value The staff were very attentive and our room was exceptionally clean  It was also quiet which was great as it was daylight when we finally got to sleep due to jet lag yet we didnt hear any of the usual daytime traffic noise  The hotel was also kind enough to store one of our bags for a week while we visited some cities in Rajastan  Overall a very enjoyable stay at a great price   Dont be put off by the exterior its great inside  
N => Took our money and left us stranded on the streets of delhi at night My husband and I have traveled widely around India yet nothing prepared us for the predicament we faced when we booked in to this hotel Having consulted TripAdvisor and seen the high rating of Hotel Palace Heights we clicked on the booking which led us to hotels com expedia in through which we booked this hotel for  nights  Our booking confirmation from hotels  com came through and my husbands credit card was charged the full amount  We took a print out of the confirmation and having travelled via train from shimla we arrived at new delhi at  pm at night to be met with bewilderment at the front desk of the hotel palace heights They saw our booking confirmation and said that they had not received any booking and that they had no rooms available for us  Without any apology they said that it must have been hotels coms fault as they had NOT RECEIVED ANY BOOKING We being visitors to Delhi did not know what to do next  Attempts to reach hotel com at that hour failed so we were left in a dilemma as to where to spend the night  We eventually did manage to find an overpriced and badly located hotel later that night but our trip had been ruined by our experience Hotel com say its the hotelss fault and they have our money which HAS NOT YET BEEN refunded nearly three weeks after the incident To sum it up  THIS HOTEL IS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL BUT UNTRUSTWORTHY and brings this websites recommendations into disrepute  Be warned that if you book this hotel through this site you too  end up in our predicament having to pay for a room that you are unable to stay in and with weeks of trouble trying to reclaim the money in vain  
N => Clean modern hotel We stayed for  nights in late e and then for one night in early y on our way back home  The hotel was modern and very clean  The AC worked very well and it was a good escape from the very hot temps outside  Rooms were on the small side and there isnt much of a lobby so if you wanted to sit aroundlinger this isnt really the place to do that  Our first room faced an interior air shaftcourtyard but the second one faced a side street  Staff was friendly and helpful and we met the owner one night who was also very pleasant and accommodating  Breakfast is included and there were both western eggs pancakes options and Indian options  There isnt much to see in Connht Place but there are many restaurants in walking distance  It was strange to walk out on our first night for dinner and be one of the few people in the street in what is considered the center of town  The hotel arranged a car to pick us up at the hotel and the driver Bobby was nice but tried to sell us on his tour guide services the entire ride to the hotel  He even tried to take us to his office BEFORE dropping us off at the hotel but we politely lined saying that after such a long trip we just wanted to get to the hotel and showersleep  This worked and he took us to the hotel  Because he was so friendly and seemed like a good guide we hired him to drive us around on a tour of Delhi a couple of days later and he barely spoke throughout the entire day that we spent with him  It seems he used all of his Delhi facts to get us to book with him and once we did he didnt have much more to say  His company seems to work exclusively with Hotel Palace Heights so beware when booking tours through the hotel  He was nice and honest but didnt offer much in way of a tour  Overall the hotel experience was a good one  If what youre looking for is a modern clean and safe hotel in the quotcenterquot of Delhi then you cant go wrong with Hotel Palace Heights  
N => ExpensiveAnnoying for the price We could hear incessant banging in the first TWO rooms they put us in  After finally getting settled into a quiet room we put on the do not disturb sign but people kept calling and knocking on the door to give us things like cookies   nice but annoying  They also pressured us into using their travel agent for a tour to the Taj Mahal  The car and driver was over priced and had barely working AC  The driver didnt really talk to us for the  hour there and  hour back drive and kept making us go places to buy stuff we didnt but he stopped anyway  The car didnt have seat belts  The staff at the hotel also told us differing info on how much things were going to cost and Monday through Friday the electricity goes on and off every so often  
N => take your chances We stayed here on two arate occassions  We landed in Delhi and stayed the night before leaving elsewhere  Our first night was awesome  The room was small but adequate  It was nicely orated and clean  No complaints  When we returned a few days later it was a different story  Our room was even smaller than the first night  We were given dirty towels and bed sheets  The walls were scuffed and dirty  The thermostat control was so filthy it was black  When we complained the staff apologizedbut that was about it  It was hard to believe this was the same hotel It wasnt cheap either  We paid   Cdn through Expedia not good value for the money  We paid for a hotel transfer and didnt get one nor did we get a refund  The outside of the hotel looks very rough but once inside it is nicely orated  The restaurant attached to the hotel Zaffron offers great value for the money  The food and service was one of the best we had in India  
N => Highly recommended   comfortable rooms with modern flair good food Situated on Connaucht Place  Spacious bedroom and bathroom  Furnishings all round elegant and in very good condition  Amenities Airconditioning functioned well safe upon arrival complementary fruit basket  apple  orange  bananas  chocolate biscuits and daily two large bottles of water facilities to make tea or coffee free daily newspaper  We like Indian food as authentic as possible i e  spicy and hot  Hotel Restaurant Zaffran satisfied both criteria  In fact the food was absolutely delicious delicately spiced and not too hot  Two main dishes plus two portions of Naan bread and a bottle of water average cost between  and  Rupee  Although the breakfast buffet was rather simple the food was good  The usual cereals two kinds of fruit bread butter jam and honey  Orders for eggs baconsausagesham toast coffee or tee are taken by a waiter  The coffee was absolutely fantastic Each cup prepared arately with freshly ground coffee beans  The hotel amp restaurant staff was competent very friendly and helpful  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this hotel  
N => A Haven of Peace My husband and I stayed at the Palace Heights at the start of our Indian holiday in ember  We had arranged an airport pick up with them which sadly wasnt there when we landed  We called the hotel who immediately got a driver to us so we were not really delayed  On arrival given that this was  in the morning they got us a welcome drink and told us our room would be ready in  minutes  This was a real bonus as it meant we could have a sleep before hitting Delhi Throughout our stay the staff were really helpful  Changing money for smaller notes booking cars etc Each day we had complimentary water and fresh fruit  The hotel was a real haven away from the bustle of Connht Place and the food in the Zaffran restaurant was really good and service was also excellent  
N => An affordable gem Recently I was looking for a centrally located hotel in Delhi which was not  night Happened to go through the reviews on your website and came across Hotel Palace Heights in Connuaght Place that seemed to fit in my budget and scheme of things   both in terms of location and just the general feel  I was able to easily make my bookings through emails that were promptly answered and all doubts were clarified  From the moment I entered to the time I checked out  days I knew I had made the right choice and had found really good hotel in Delhi  A place that I would like to come back to and recommend to others  The rooms were very clean and done in a very fashionable style but most importantly comfortable to stay in  Some hotels take fashion to an extreme and make it uncomfortable But this place seems to have struck the right balance  The in house restaurant was an absolute treat  Seems to be a very popular choice as there was a long waiting even on weekdays  The hotel was very courteous to keep tables for hotel guests on hold and never made us wait for a table  Plus a special discount for hotel guests in the restaurant  Also the room service was very efficient and even at  am in the morning the food was served with a smile  The Internet was truly wireless and truly unlimited with no snags or hidden costs  In India many a places advertise about their wireless but it really is pathetic  Initially I had some technical difficulty getting on to their wireless on my MAC but the front office guy came and solved everything within no time  A suggestion to the hotel it really is a nice place though they do have a long list of wines cocktails and all kinds of alcohols being served available in the rooms and in the restaurant  A small watering hole that one can go to after a long day of work in the city will go a long way in making me feel even more at home  Wink wink  
N => Friendly  Ive booked this hotel via Desiya an Indian website and got a good price  I was a bit concerned as I was going over with my small fella and the wife  It has been a wonderful experience   breakfast was brilliant as they had continental as well as Indian Poori Bhaji which was delicious As my wife was indisposed for  days they made hot chapatis to take into the room and my son enjoyed his cereals  I had my Beer amp dinner all days at the hotel and the service was attentive   they served good mughalai dishes My son had Rice amp Dal Makhni all the time which he call Brown Sauce As mentioned already the TV is good as all rooms had independent SKY receivers for entertainment  This is a very well located hotel for shopping trips to Pallika Bazaar and short distance away from Ghafaar ket thoroughly enjoyed the walking until I got dehydrated Very clean place which has recently been reorated   recommended  
N => Clean Modern cozy central While travelling to India I booked through the internet this hotel There were not many pictures and not much information but reviews seemed to be good enough so I took the risk  It was well worth it  This small hotel in the centre of New Delhi is not only close to everything but  be the the best choice for an affordable yet clean and beautiful stay  It was recently reated and although the rooms are small it has good service it is clean and quiet unlike the rest of India  has aircondition but no heating   even though the temperature on uary is quite low   I definitely reccomend it as a safe cheap and clean choice  
N => Did not honor reservation agreement I shared a room with two friends  The manager confirmed via email that we would have the room for six nights before we paid our deposit  On arrival they told us we will only have the room for three nights  Different people manning the hotel reception gave conflicting reasons why this is so  However their reasons were not convincing as from the booking screen on their computer we noticed that two other guest were booked into our reservation  Furthermore the manager that agreed on our six night reservation is nowhere to be found even by his own staff  They tried to move us to another related hotel that is out of the city center which we refuse to due to their prior breech of trust  We were in Delhi for a conference and had to skip part of it to look for another hotel  This was extremely disruptive  The impression I have is the hotel tries to get you there before moving you to a less popular co owned hotel due to quotunforeseen circumstancesquot  I recommend not using this hotel for important business since they do not honor their reservation agreements unless you do not mind finding another hotel at the last minute  Apart from this the rooms are well furnished as expected for the price that they charge and service is prompt  
N => Great Choice for One Night Overall this was a fine place to stay for one night however no one met us on arrival at IGIA to take us to the hotel even though we had previously booked the transfer and re confirmed prior to arrival  Not the best way to start off our stay  The hotel claims someone was there and we just didnt see him  We waited for  minutes then ided that no one was coming  There were TONS of drivers with signs waiting just not for us  We took a pre paid taxi which was easy and reasonable but taxi drivers dont seem to know where this hotel is  If they can get you to Connht Place which they DO know just stop someone on the street and ask for the hotel telling them that its located behind the Odeon Cinema there is more than one cinema in Connht though  The hotel is very small and unassuming somewhat difficult to spot from the street its on the secondupper floor above storefronts  There is an entry door on the ground level which was well lit and staffed by a security guard and two other employees e g  bellman and restaurant maitre d I think  There is a lift to the second floor  The lobby area is tiny just the front desk and two chairs off which is the Zaffron restaurant attractive well staffed but we only had drinks so I cant comment on the food  Our room was tiny as well just enough room to walk around the perimeter of the bed  The bathroom was a ent size with standing shower and Western toilet  Some basic toiletries were provided  Hairdryer upon request  The room was very modern and pleasant looking with a comfy bed suede throw pillows and flat screen TV  Complimentary wi fi access in the rooms worked perfectly  Two bottles of complimentary water were provided along with chocolates and a fruit plate we did not get to sample the included breakfast due to an early departure welcome drinks upon arrival  The hotel was able to change money for us there was no ATM machine visible nearby  I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again its a great value approximately  USD for a double room once you find the location  
N => Excellent hotel stayed  night extremely helpful staff clean modern room good restaurant a sanctuary in the middle of delhi very near excellent metro system stationi have only positives to say about this hotel 
N => good central hotel This is a really good hotel to arrive to in delhiIts in a central location and the staff were very nice even though there were too many knocks on the door for one thing or anotherIt was clean and comfortable but the towels were old and greyWhen i started looking for a hotel in delhi it was really difficult to find one that wasnt either really expensive or that looked dirtyThis was neither even though it was more expensive than any other hotels i stayed in in india but it was definitely worth it 
N => Wonderful Boutique Hotel The Hotel Palace Heights is certaintly excellent value for a stay in central Delhi The service overall is outstanding  Full of nice touches   complimentary fruit bowl amp chocolates on arrival   the best hotel soaps amp lotions I have ever used   and very good breakfast with courteous amp professional staff  The rooms  are  small as is the hotel   no large foyer or bars you enter via lift so I would not book for an extended stay   but they are as modern and stylish as you will find anywhere for a weekend or overnight you couldnt ask for more  I booked direct via email   and though I had change my original booking to  night from  in email this was not acknowledged   so ensure you are clear from the outset  But I was not penalised so all went well  Im in debt to the fellow reviewers on this website   I would not have found or chosen it without your help   so I am glad to add my voice to chorus of approval   my only regret is not staying in Delhi for longer  
N => Heaven after Hell We stayed here for  night on the th ember after  nights at the Hotel Ata see erate review This hotel is in Connht Place section D  We booked with the hotel after turning up with our suitcase I was trying to work out where to stay in the taxi from the Ata Hotel it was that bad This hotel worked out at approx   bed amp breakfast for the two of us Room was small but had everything you needed reminded me of a riott hotel back home  Bathroom was lovely water was either very hot or cold but hey a small price considering where we had just come from Plasma TV on wall coffee amp tea facilities  They also gave us fresh orange juice and a fresh fruit platter   nice touch Breakfast was freshly cooked  This area is very western with KFC Macdonalds TGI Fridays etc but we ate at a restaurant next door from our hotel called The Embassy   nice food but be aware as not only do they add a service charge they also add output VAT   I would recommend anyone to stay here but as its a little bit expensive it would probably be ok for the  night  
N => A pleasant place to stay in New Delhi My girlfriend and I stayed one night at Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi on   Having spent most of our holiday in India Rajasthan in budget accommodation we ided to spend a bit more to just chill out for our last night in India Our double room cost Rs     tax including breakfast  The room was excellent   comfortable extremely clean a nice ambience the staff said the hotel had been refurbished around ruary this year  There were some nice touches like complimentary welcoming drinks apple juice and later a fruit platter during our stay  Service at the hotel was reasonable without being fabulous  Reliable hot water but in our room it was very difficult to find a comfortable temperature ie  temp was either very hot or cold Because we didnt really spend much of our holiday in similar accommodation I am unsure whether this price is reasonable or comparable to other hotels in New Delhi  The only thing I could compare it to is Hotel Jukaso Inn Connht Place recommended by Lonely Planet which we booked online in a last minute rush for our first night in India for which we foolishly paid Rs  tax for a double room   it was terrible dirty small    completely different to Hotel Palace Heights which is literally a few doors away  
N => Great hotel great location Hotel Palace Heights is a great hotel in a great situation in Delhi The staff were lovely and the level of service was amazing  The room was small but very nicely furnished although there were no views  The bed was very comfy We ate lightly in their restaurant on our last night in India the food was good and I felt that we should have taken advantage of this earlier in our stay Although our room was small I felt that the Hotel Palace Heights is aspiring to great things  
N => Excellent place to stay This Hotel is located in CP in Delhi  Simply VOW    I think its a boutique hotel Its truely amazing  Room rent was around Rs   for single room and experience was fantastic Room was very small but stylishly done  It had flat screen TVand the interiors were superb Thumbs up and  stars to this hotel  
N => Awful Hotel I was travelling with a group of friends and we ided to stay at this place  Big mistake  We booked far in advance but they managed to book us one room to few  When we argued with them and showed them various emails that proved booking they said that we had not asked for enough rooms and that it was our fault  At first they told us that some of us would have to stay elsewhere but in they end they finally relented and found us another room  The staff were rude and pushy barging into our rooms at odd times of the day and evening  Also we had to wait for about an hour at the front desk whilst they checked various booking details   they seemed determined to find a reason not to let us stay  The rooms were dirty pokey and noisy  
N => dont stay here Not a good place to stay We were there as part of a Geckos tour  The room was dirty the bathtub was stained and they use moth balls in the sinks which end up smelling up the entire room  Service was really weird  We were two women travelling together which  explain the quotextraquot attention we received  The bus boys would knock on our door for various quotreasonsquot and when we opened the door they would attempt to push their way into the room I had to start standing in front of the door to prevent this  There was also a knock on the door at pm we didnt answer which was not followed up by a call from the front desk so who knows what they wanted There are much nicer neighbourhoods in Delhi   dont stay here 
N => Not a good place to stay The hotel was booked by a travel agent and for the price they charged I have stayed at much better hotels for the price I paid here I expected much much better  The floor was dirty bathrooms were wet  i was disgusted  Dont know about food and restarant quality as I ided not to eat there after I saw the rooms  Also the area is very noisy and crowded  I have attached some pics I took    
N => Far from Perfect but not that bad Really not as bad as previous reviews suggest in my opinion  The exterior doesnt bode well and it is definitely budget but we found the staff delightful and helpful  Room was OK not dirty  It had TV fridge and large bathroom  Did not use the restaurant so cant comment on it  However do not use this hotel if you are looking for luxury 
N => Cheap place RasikaSri LankaThis hotel is not so good but its a good budget hotel  Staff is not so friendly but supportive  Room boys dont speak English we had a bad time with them due to lack of communication  Food was not up to our expectations but ok  since this is a budget hotel  Rooms were clean amp tidy enough  Bathroom was clean amp ok You can find a PIZZA HUT amp a MACDONALDS little far  but working distance from the hotel Also if you like to have Indian food there is a good clean restaurant very close to the hotel and there is a big night ket too  Also you can find lot of money changers near by the hotel  Roads are really busy amp noisy  So considering all these I think a person cant expect something more than this from a budget hotel  I would like to recomond this hotel for travelers who look for cheep hotels  Remember to bring bottled water along with you       
N => Dirty hotel By far the worse hotel Ive ever seen Been to India a lot and for half of the money they charge you can get much better Dont go to this hotel people they will try to rip you off after youve seen how dirty and cheap the rooms are They have one suite and they put these photos on the net Absolute misguidance When I stayed there I called my travel agent immediatly to find me a different hotel  
N => Strange Strang strange hotel  Far from perfect  Booked by a travel agent through this tour we did  By far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  We ate in the restaurant once  We were alone  The waiter took our order dissapeared for about  minutes and returned with the food to stand the other side of the restaurant and stare at us eating  Another waiter also stood and watched us and also took photos of us with his mobile phone We ordered room service from then on  Still they dont knock just come into the room close the door behind them   I know the culture is different but the hotel only seems to get Australian American and British guests and they should know that we find this extremely rude The area was absoloutely awful  We couldnt even find somewhere to buy a bottle of water  We felt very scared always being followed and were not happy here at all  
N => Dont bother ided to try this place after reading the two previous positive reviews which I am suspicious of their origin as our experience was not great  Our lift arranged by the hotel was not there when we came out of the airport at  am  No prob got a taxi to the hotel which was all dark with people sleeping in the reception area on arrival and one snoring very loudly in the back roomso much so that I thought they were digging the road up  That was ok until we went to our room which smelt like a sewer and was right next to the noisy lift shaft which kept going all night  Our bed was damp which in  is not great as it is cold  After about  hours in our room we couldnt wait to leave at  am so went down to reception still staff all asleep in reception area so we picked our way over them and outside where it is dead no rickshaws anywhere  Nobody moves around here until am  Someone from the hotel came out and told us to come back in and call us a taxi to the train station as we needed to book tickets to get out of Delhi asap  After half hour of wasting our time finally a man arrives who turns out to be a travel agent he then spent the next  hours trying to terrorise us into hiring a driver for US for  days He took us to the back entrance of the train station to make it look as bad as possible we later found the front entrance which was fine and then convinced us we would be better booking our tickets with him just a lure to get you into the office then the hardsell starts  When we finally realised we were being done over we ided to leave and they proceeded to try and intimidate us about  women using the rickshaws etc etc  We left and had a bit of hassle with the rickshaw drivers but just got out if they wouldnt take us where we wanted to go and eventually we got to the train station about pm Got our tickets in  minutes and went straight back to the hotel and checked out and moved over near the train station  This hotel is not in a great location as advertised it is totally dead and not really Karol Bargh it gives a bad impression of Karol Bargh area  Wouldnt like your chances if you need to get to the Train station early in the morning  You are at the mercy of this hotel once you arrive so be careful  The night staff were pleasant when they woke up and nobody was rude to us but they tried to take advantage of us and our room was rubbish so would not recommend for rupees including tax  would be a fairer price compared to what we found  Especially if you can get a room that doesnt smell and is dry and not near the lift  
N => Not a Trust Worthy Service Provider Hi Guys I am writing this negative review to buzz you in advance to think once to stay at this hotel  I visited their hotel and chosen super deluxe I went to shop in Paharganj  When i back and saw that my expensive camera was lost  I asked the Manager to call the police but they denied to Call and miss behaved with me that i am putting false allegation  I lost the trust completely  
N => Not a great start to our trip On arrival in Delhi this really isnt where you want to head  The hotel itself is fairly grotty and basic  Its difficult to find ent budget accommodation in Delhi but I really recommend paying just a bit more and youll find the quality greatly improves  We mainly chose it for the location near the station and the advertised pool  Both of which turned out to be extremely dirty and horrible  Didnt feel at all safe We used the travel desk advertised to book our train journey onwards and a driver to take us to Agra for the day  After spending a few weeks in India it was obvious they ripped us off  The car we were taken in was very dirty much like its owner  The driver kept stopping the car and disappearing whilst leaving us with the windows down was none to keen on switching on the ac for people to come and harass us with monkeys They also added about   service charge for booking our train tickets for us  Unbelievably slyThe restaurant on the roof was nothing special whilst the sprite I was served was evidently not sprite nor anything of a a fizzy nature  We also never got out included breakfast It really was the worst place we stayed during our trip  For budget accommodation it was not good value for money  
N => Good location great rooftop restaurant We chose Hotel Prince Polonia for its close proximity to the New Delhi train station its affordable rates and the good reviews it got from Lonely Planet authors and other travellers  The reviews were the isive factor because the other hotels we were considering had multiple comments about travellers getting ripped off while checking out  Were happy to say that we did not have such problems at Hotel Prince Polonia  The only thing that bothered us was that they never returned our passports to our room as promised after obtaining the necessary information for their records Rooms were simple and comfortable which was great because we just wanted a quiet place to sleep without having to pay for all the frills of other western style hotels  We found that inside rooms were much more quiet than those facing the street  This was significant since the main road and ket are just down the road and are busiest from pm to pm  Unfortunately the lack of windows in the inside rooms deprives you from enjoying sunrise and sunsets The two most useful features of the hotel for us were free internet access and the rooftop hotel  The rooftop hotel had Indian and continental dining options good prices and courteous service  We always ate the Indian fare which seemed to surprise our server at first and then just made him really happy to serve us and it was in retrospect probably the best meals we had during our trip One thing we did not like was that the guy at the front desk was not particularly pleasant  He seemed to respond reluctantly to our questions but at least he was never rude The taxi service was very convenient and the drivers themselves always friendly  
N => Clean on a quiet street I made the reservation by email and called to confirm before I traveled  The staff was helpful they let us check in early since the room was ready  It was a little pricy compared to the rest of the hotels in the area but it was clean and on a relatively quiet street  It was great for our first two nights in India  
N => Dont believe the others  They Lied Twice I have traveled throughout India extensively and am use to the horrible hotel situation in Delhi  Upon seeing this hotel ranked so high on trip advisor I thought Id give it a try  I booked two nights over a month apart  The first night on il   I arrived and they did not have the room I requested even though I booked it a week in advance and had an e mail confirmation I asked to see several other rooms but ended up having to take a lower grade room  Then they tried to charge me the more expensive rate  This first night the room was ok  Not the cleanest but for Delhi standards okay  The main problem came on my second night e    This time it was me my wife and three kids and my sister in law  We booked a triple room two weeks in advance  According to their website the room was supposed to have a balcony bathtub  king bed and  twin beds  When we arrived I ask to see the room first  They took me to a small room with only two beds and no bathtub  Needless to say I argued with the manager for almost an hours while by wife and three small kids all were just waiting in the lobby   They eventually gave us a room with three bed and a balcony but still no bathtub  In all the  rooms they showed me there were not any with bathtubs  I dont think they have any  The room itself was not clean  Broken wall fixtures  Dirty bathrooms  There was even still trash in the bathroom from the previous occupant   Piles of dirt and dust behind and under the bed didnt make me feel safe to let my young kids play and the gritty floor  We had booked three nights but ided to change hotels  The manager and staff were very rude to me and refused to come with me to look at their website that stated what I should have had  I even presented my e mail communications with the manager stating what I had booked  Basically dont trust the hotel manager he lied to me several times  We switched to the Grand Godwin and so far it is great  I would not recommend this hotel and will never stay their again  
N => no complaints basic and clean this hotel was just fine no problems room was cleanamp bright staff were courteous  in hindsight be a little expensive but its a good idea to have somewhere like this booked before arriving in delhi 
N => When you follow an Indian guy down an alley blame yourself  So you ve wandered into Paharganj down Main Bazaar rd amp stepped off the main street into a small back alley past a dozen hole in the wall businesses selling hot curry the food amp the stomach bug tobacco toilet paper amp  bottle water  straight from the local tap amp found yourself here or more precisely been led here by a guy from another hotel promising you the cure for cancer amp your very own private jet  Welcome to the Hotel RAK International The young reception dude has a suspicious mustache wears a buttoned shirt with the top  buttons undone tight pants sandals amp wears gold jewelry yes I know he obviously pulls the foreign girls no doubt probably works for his rich uncle it s the sort of place you remember when you regret things in your youth We paid  rupees for a  bed room without air con fan amp hot water we paid this much to avoid a few other rooms with more mould amp filth in the bathroom  Negotiating for a price is a must no matter how poor your skills are just check out the bacteria amp germs we paid for Yes im not very good at it I know  Most of the rooms are of such quality in this hotel as well as most of Paharganj s alternate budget accommodation you are spoilt for choice for this type of humble dwelling so take your time choosing your rats nest there are always plenty more available  Our cm TV at least worked amp didn t blow up our fan didn t fall off the ceiling amp we didn t  really  require a mosquito net  Nor was the water green or brown amp there were definitely no ghosts in our room  We had to climb up  levels worth of stairs amp yes there was no elevator this is a health warning to fat people to look elsewhere The Hotel RAK International has a roof top restaurant staffed by ethnic Asiatic Nepalese who answer to the cool reception dude with the moustache amp gold jewelry you know they are paid in crumbs so tip well as they are cheerful amp friendly unlike the reception staff who are friends with the mosquitoes there  However for a fraction of the restaurant price I suggest you wander down Main Bazaar rd amp sample the foods that the locals come for such as fresh lassi amp fruit juice samosa s amp chicken kebabs Don t bother booking any taxis or motorized rickshaws with the hotel staff as they charge almost double the street rate but if you did amp you stayed here to save money I shake my head at you The management here operate  more hotels of similar quality next door amp around the alley as well as a main one on Main Bazaar rd they will promise you the world to shuffle you around once you agree on a price so they can keep the better rooms for those willing to pay the most  Remain calm amp try not to start any fist fights with management as us foreigners are clueless as to the true meaning of the side ways head wobble which could mean anything from a simple yes no a combination of both or a coded signal to masked Indian ninjas waiting to jump you Stay in Paharganj if you can hack it it s a seedy place full of shaddy Indians hippies wannabe hippies ignorant holiday makers amp true travelers  Bring a silk bed sheet to avoid the rashes amp old mattresses bring an open mind your travel guide amp enjoy India as it should be enjoyed the hard way  
N => Dirty cockroach infested room and terrible front desk service After spending much time selecting this hotel for our trip to Delhi I would strongly advise anybody not to stay here  Our room was dirty filled with coakroaches woke up with one on my pillow the front desk service was terrible we were made to feel awful because we didnt book our driver through Rajasthan through Ranauks travel desk and wouldnt let it go it took forever to get simple things like clean towels had not hot water and almost missed our train to Delhi because the man at the front desk forgot to provide us with a wake up call luckily we had set our alarm and instead of telling the driver to take us to the trainstation the taxi driver tried to take us to the airport Overall the room was filthy and the front desk service was terrible  The only good thing about this hotel is its proximity to the Metro   which makes for easy travel around Delhi   and a lovely breakfast included in the price  
N => Recommended  Our stay was fine there  Their tour assistance was good  We appreciate these guidance given for our trip  
N => as we wanted We are an old age couple and our third time to india  Hotel is good  Wi fi lobby and restaurant are few of the good things in the hotel  A construction site nearby was the only turn down  Orver all fine  
N => I would not recommend this hotel to anyone We were very disappointed with this hotel  I have stayed in Delhi three times before at better hotels for the same price  To begin we waited at the airport for over an hour to be picked up  I phoned twice and was told the driver was there  They did not tell that he was not in the airport but ouside in the parking area because they are not licienced and so can not wait inside  Then we were sold a very overpriced tour as I found out later again because we they are not a tour company or have no licience we were told if there was an accident to get out and run  The car was not the best with bad tires etc  We we arrived back at the hotel the next night we were told we had to stay at a different hotel which actually was better bigger room  The one in the Raunak International we could hardly get in  We went off touring India and when we got back we were told again we were in another hotel  This time we were not picked up at the airport at all and ended up getting a taxi  There was no late check out available even though we had checked in late in the evening  The restaurant in the Raunak was fairly but at the other two hotels owned by the same man the food was dreadful I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone  
N =>  promt service  Our pickup check in and checkout was swift every body knows what they have to do  I liked this kindness and dedication towards making improvements  You will be taken care  
N => Safe Heaven For Female Travelers Large rooms free internet on my laptop flat screen TV s in lobby andin room DVD was provided to us free of cost  A good holiday wasplanned to Agra amp Jaipur by the manager and he gave us his own car  Wewere females between   years of age and were so safe in thishotel  We wanted to walk in the street at night the manager sent theguard with us  
N => Good Hotel Great Hospitality I went to Delhi for my business trip and happened to stay in HotelRaunak international  To my surprise I found the hotel at par with the star hotelsin the city  Nice ambiance good interior soothing music latestfacilities friendly and courteous staff   putting all these togethermade my stay very comfortable  I really enjoyed my stay  I woulddefinitely recommend it to all my friends and colleagues  Keep up thegood work  
N => Close To My Heart Going on a honeymoon to India  I checked in to Hotel RaunakInternational in Delhi  The moment they came to know about this  Wegot a special treatment  A bunch of flowers was sent to our room  Inthe evening the boss came to our surprise this was a party at theroof top restaurant  All staff and great were invited  It was kept forus  Next day the hotel organized a trip to Taj Mahal a symbol oflove  We were touched by the gesture  This hotel will always remainvery close to our heart  Special thanks to Mr Singh  
N => Awful Hotel On our recent visit to India we passed through Delhi  times and this was by far the worst hotel that we stayed in     be even in the whole on India  It started with Check in  On arrival I noted reception staff telling guests that the metro was too far to walk to  This is incorrect it is  minutes  I assume this was a prelude to a sales pitch but am not sure  The whole check in process took over  minutes  The reception staff was constantly interrupted anwering the telephone calling out to other staff speaking to other guests etc and we were completely sidelined  Not what you need especially after a  hour train journey in  Finally we got to the room which smelt stale and sheets were dirty  My pillow case had dried food encusted into it  This was too much  My boyfriend complained to reception who said we would have to wait one hour to speak with the manager  This was not good enough and we ided to go directly to the managers office  In fairness the manager was kind and courteous and arranged to change our room and upgrade us  However I would say the upgrade was hardly worth the bother as the new room though bigger was also not clean  By this time we were beyond complaining further and ruining our time with arguements  The water was also never hot  If we had not prepaid in advance we wold have left the hotel  I really like the Karol Bagh area  There are hundreds of hotels here  One thing is for sure is that this one is not good value for money  They charge European prices with substandard quality and service  I would never recommend this hotel to anyone  My advice is not to book in advance and have a good look around the area  
N => Raunak International Hotel is International We were very fortunate to find this hotel in Delhi  We were doubting on the service because the rates are very less  But when we got world class service and beautiful rooms  We are surprised  We are really impressed  Everything we could think of was available and very well placed  We will come again and please give us room no   because we have sweet memories in that room  Good wishes and try to please all foreigners like this  
N => my new home in delhi i went to delhi in mid tember with our dancing troop to participate in our inter university feast  we stayed there at hotel raunak arranged by the organisers only the hotel was really fantastic and we all had a great time staying there everything related to it was great my earlier experiences with hotels in delhi hasnt been great but everything was just so good     staffs were so cordial and provided brilliant service again food was really good in the restaurant again according to their standards maintained it was reaaalllly a place to go for  i think i have found my place in delhi now  
N => Worst hotel I ever stayed i was confirem at Raunak Plaza but upon arrival ended up staying at this hotel owned by same owner  This is form on Con by booking traveller in to higher rated hotel then making them stay at lower rate hotel  management should be ashamed of themselves the following did not work hot water internet access shower doors AC water dripping on pillows unclean towel not to mention the bed sheets worst experience of my travel  
N => Good value terrible service apart from the Manager The hotel was ok although no hot water and a shower glass panel sitting in the bath wasnt ideal  The manager was really helpful when we arrived and arranged train tickets for us for the very next day the train station was closed at an inflated price  The general customer service was very very poor firstly they didnt pick us up from the airport although after much insistence they paid for our taxi fare room service kept knocking on our door and rang us whilst we were sleeping to give us fooddrink that we hadnt even ordered  The next morning the waiter in the restaurant became really aggressive with us as he kept trying to insist that we had to pay for our breakfast even though it was complimentary  It appeared that none of the staff actually communicated with one another at all  I havent stayed anywhere else in Delhi for a point of reference so perhaps my review is harsh but bad service is my pet hate Im afraid  
N => Excellent service than expectation We have got excellent service in low cost  All are enjoy the moment in a great joy  So at the end we must visit this place again when we got leisure time so thanks to all the staff and owner of this hotel for their service   
N => Splender Property This budget hotel is conveniently located few meter away from the karol bagh metro Station and close to shopping ket  Staff was friendly and well trained  Service was quick and prompt  Room was well maintained and finely clean and have all the modern amenities  Food was very tasty  Location was very convenient 
N => Terrible hotel I checked into this hotel on the recommendation of tripadvisor However I was very dissapointed I checked in at   am I would expect that the hotel would be clean at the least The room was not cleaned and was dirty The room had a garish blue backdrop on one of its walls The bathroom sink was broken and was leaking We had to check out at   in the morning This was informed to the hotel staff the previous day Inspite of repeated requests there was no hot water in the shower The hotel staff was rude and least helpful  
N => A hotel with outstanding service I go to delhi with my life partner we stay in raunak hotel we find there good service and friendly environment  i make good shopping in the ket what is close to hotel  we were happy with hotels service and there cleanness                      
N => perfect stay in delhi I came to Delhi in  with our friends  We all planned to stay in Raunak Hotel Karol Bagh  The stay was very good  All staff was great  They are very helpful  The ket was nearby  We all enjoyed our stay in Raunak  The rooms are very neat and clean  The food was very delicious  Overall everything was perfect  If i got a chance than i will definately go there again 
N => i didnt expect what i got it was vellous experience it was excellent experience i was little scared before i entered in quotraunak hotelquot beacause i did not have a good experience in same area with some other hotel but when i spent my half of the day i observed that staff were very cooperative and stood up with me  in to  whenever i want food was too delecious  My friends were also shared the same experience  Furthermore i can say whenever i will get a chance surely i will take there service without any second consideration  i wish them all the best  KUNAL MAITHANI 
N => living like king it was pleasant stay thr   hotel was very neat n clean   staff is always thr  u n ready to fulfil ur demands   room service was quite good    aaahh Above all the food thy prepared was very tasty   n hygnic tooo     i loved dat place   if i again got a chance to go to Karol bagh New Delhi   ill defintly stay thr     
N => awesum it was nice stayin dere    i loved d way i was treated 
N => Very good service   could be best with small improvements Very good service by the manager and all the staff Hotel quiet  safe and near the metro stationPoints to be improved   good infrastructure but rooms need to be refursbished sometimes  provide hot water after pm  provide taxi pick up without failure  payed the service if not offered is not enough  
N => good business class hotel i stayed here for india art summit in pragati maidaan  pick up was on time room was spacious and well cleaned  location was something i dint like much  venue was easily approachable from the hotel via metro wi fi in room was a great relief  
N => lovely hotel nice clean hotel pick was prompt and my agra jaipur tour taken from hotel was pleasurable  
N => Awesome Place   Awesome People My visit to Delhi was for a hiring event for my organisation and I was put to stay in this awesome place where very good people with very high values work  This was my very best hotel stay so far  The rooms are excellent very clean very good services   Actual value to the money being spend  I am sure this can be one of the best hotel that anyone can find in and around Delhi    To know more i would suggest to visit once  
N => Never Never Consider this hotel even in your dreams    We were packed into a small car with our luggages but this was a free pick up so we couldnt say anything When we reached there our worst nighte was about to begin    We went up to the room to see it first   There we saw the worst room  The bedsheet was an old and dirty one and the room was dusty We started to say that we cannot stay in that room They showed us another room which was equally bad We called up our friend in Delhi and explained our situation He told us to just leave the hotel immediately When we went to the lobbywe explained that we cant stay in this type of place We sitted in the lobby about half an hour waiting for our friend to come and pick us up When we were about to leavethe receptionist asked us to pay RS  We were taken aback as we stayed in the room for less than ten minutes We just ided to ignore and leave The receptionist called the mananger and he stopped us He asked us to pay We said that this is injustice Instead the manager said that we were cheating him The manager said that we cannot leave the place until i pay the RS  The security guard blocked my friends car from moving WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO TO THE NEARBY RAUNAK PLAZA WHICH WAS THEIR HOTEL TOO Luckilythe staff there were so much better and kind even though the room was just as bad The staff understood us and made us feel comfortable For RS THIS IS DAYLIGHT ROBBERY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HOTELI WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU GINGER HOTEL AT RAIL YATRI NIWAS WHICH WAS SO MUCH INEXPENSIVENEWERBETTER QUALITY AND SERVICE THE RESTAURANT AT GINGER WAS SO CLEAN AND DELICIOUS FOOD AND THE PRICE WAS REASONABLE SOIF YOU ARE IN NEW DELHIGO TO GINGER HOTEL INSTEAD OF RAUNAK HOTEL 
N => home away from home Raunak became my home away from home  I was picked up at the airport as planned Staff was very quick to get back to me on verifying airport pick up  I was able to store my luggage there as well so I could travel lighter  There was WIFI and a great restaurant  The staff was friendly and extremely helpful and accommodating  Very relaxed comfortable environment  Staff really extended themselves to make sure I had everything I needed  Comfortable clean beds too 
N => Good place to stay We stayed in this hotel for two days and this place is werth for the amount u paid  clean place with all  star aminities  the food they served also good   the staff is friendly  nice place to stay if we are going to delhi again we will definitely stay in this  GOOD PLACE  
N => Go for the upgrade room My first trip to India   not be my last but my last to Delhi and Northern India  Stayed two nights  This hotel is ok  Friends made reservations  Had I known about upgrade rooms I would have insisted on one  Should have checked with them on what hotel they made reservations for  In the future in India   will insist on  star hotels  Have stayed in  stars in Europe and in Russia   but not the same  Would recommmend with explanation to get upgrade room  A friend did leave clothes in the room  When we came back a week later they had her clothes for her  So that was a plus  
N => Regent Continental   OK for an overnight in Delhi Arrived at hotel late pm after  hour drive from Agra  Lobby clean and quite and impressive compared to surroundings and check in ok  Room average air con and TV worked but strong air freshener smell which turned out to be the insect repellent device in the bathroom in fact there seemed to be a paraffin type smell in the corridors too  We went to the restaurant and looked at the a la carte menu but the maitre d was very persistent that we and all other guests had the Indian buffet already prepared  We eventually acquiesced rather than chance Delhi at night as the area around the hotel was not too inviting  Turned out the buffet was expensive compared to the menu I think we were misled  All well and went to bed  Breakfast was buffet style and ok too and there seemed to be a predominance of business people  Overall adequate for an overnight stay and like most people you have to modify your thinking and expectations when staying in India on a  star basis   
N => be careful which room your given when we arrived we were given a room that resembled a dungeon  we complained and were assured that a better room would be given on our return  weeks later  it was better but not much  make sure you see all type of rooms  silver is smaller but much better  service and food was very good however and location very good 
N => my money is well used   good shopping n staying place in the capital i visited delhi in ch  n stayed in hotel regent continental for  days before i went ahead to jaipur it was a good experience for a first timmer to india  India is a good countrythe people are also very nice  My stay in the above mentioned hotel was done by my travel agent as i wasnt very keen on spending too much money on stay but off course i wanted a safe cosy confortable n economical place as i was accompanied with my partner  The hotel took good care of us for the  days we stayed there  Service was good n so was the food Being centrally located in delhi it was very convinent for us to travel to different place using the sky train  It was a lovely experience n i would certainlly like to go n stay there if ever i go to delhi next time  
N => wonderfull experience I am staying in Bangalore  I would like to share the experience of my delhi stay which part of jaipur trip  We reached quite late night in Delhi  It was our first visit and we were in quite tension  Booked this hotel through internet  And to our pleasure we were received by the reception with a warm smile  Our rooms were already allotted  So had hassle free check in  Quite ent gold class room  Clean and tidy  But what impressed me the most was the room service  We were served food as late as  a m  and it was delicious  Thanks to Mr mukherjee we were offered huge variety  we had to check out the next day for our trip to Jaipur  Loved the stay though  The staff did a commendable job to make our stay comfortable  Thank u all 
N => Value for money   nice place to stay i visited this hotel in ch  as some of my colleagues were comming in from the US  Since their visit was only for  days and they wanted to do some shopping as well so i ided to put them in a hotel in the heart of the city A friend of mine recomemded me this hotel in karol bagh called regent continental On my instructions the hotel made arrangements to pick my guests from the airport i booked  super delux rooms along with a full time cab for  days  In these  days i visited the hotel very often By the end of the stay all my guests were very happy with the room service as well as the staff courtesy When the bill came to me for clearance i was surprised to see such a descent price of everything It was a nice experience with hotel regent continental  great going guys  
N => Terrible experience at Regent Continental Noisy at all hours of day and night in the middle of the night you could hear staff shouting and talking loudly and dogs barking incessantly outside Room dirty asked to change the room we were given cause the shower was filthy second room wasnt much better Dining room disgusting dirty tables dirty cloths dirty cutlery  In the end they also claimed that we hadnt paid something false and receptionists started shouting and cursing against us and refused to give back passports until we paid what we wanted Would never ever go back there 
N => Disguting Hotel This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world  Do not be fooled by the pictures on their web site the rooms do not look like that at all  The hotel is situated in a rundown dirty and overcrowded area in what can only be described as virtually an alley way  Our room was too small to swing a cat in  The bed clothes were dirty  It was situated internally within the building so had no outside window  A small window overlooked a shaft reminiscent to a coal mine shaft  This was lit and hence lit our room at night  The bathroom was disguising ancient and filthy  The towels were grey  The air conditioning unit was so noisy you couldnt sleep  It also did not work and it must have been  degrees plus in our room  We complained to the front desk and they virtually ignored us saying they were full and there were no alternative rooms  It was only after my wife said she would sleep in the reception that they reluctantly took action  First they showed us an identical room and only after further complaints showed us to a so called VIP room  This was also disgusting but was larger and had a window to the outside world or should I say alleyway  The air conditioning also worked slightly better  What sums up the hotel was the employee running his fingers along the bed headboard and all surfaces to check they were clean  Of course they were not  There were also kids running up and down the corridors screaming all night  Apparently they also have student accommodation This hotel had been booked for us by an Indian Agency who otherwise was very good  We have registered a complaint with them  Although we were supposed to stay two nights we moved out and paid for another hotel  We tried to get our money back at the reception and asked to see the manager  Needless to say he did not turn up  This  be India but I have stayed in many hotels in this country some simple but always clean  This clearly is the worst my wife and I have seen  
N => Average We arrived   pm  our room was on the st floor  very bad smelling room After complaining we were upgraded to the nd floor Still not happy The next day we were upgraded to a platium room This was much better  However all the bathrooms are bad  Water pressure is low amp cold We stayed there for  nights Breakfast is not very nice Staff dont speak English but helpful Dont eat dinner in hotel Will not go back 
N => Worst Hotel     Beware Beware of Checking in this Hotel  Despite our Advance Payment while checkin had to wait for  minutes just to complete Formalities  No room allotment planning despite  rooms were booked  Pathatic food Water was leaking from cieling    in monsoon    Hostile and rought staff     Despite feedback to the Hotel no courtesy  approach towards improvement  Beware of cleanliness and services also  
N => Stay at your own risk  I stayed at the Regent Contenental for  nights in uary   Even from the start I should have known better  I arrived early and was pleased to be shown to my room right away  BUT when we got there I was told by the clerk that there was no key for this room and they were busy trying to find it  I thought that was strange but was so tired from a long trip on the Indian trains that I just put my stuff down and tried to relax   hours later I called the desk asking about the key  Nothing in the room would work with out the key  No power at all  No no word on the key     yet  I waited an additional  hours before calling the desk again and telling the clerk that I was NOT willing to wait any longer  I had not had anything to eat or drink since the day before and it was now after  pm  I could not even leave my room to go find food and drink and none was offered to me  Finally they brought me a key  From the housekeeping people I think  It had no fob and was just a key nothing else  Good enough   And he finally told me that the previous customer had made off with the key and they were quotwaiting for him to bring it or send it backquot   That night after finally getting some food and drink I crawled into bed thinking that the noise would die down as the night wore on and I would get some badly needed sleep  Did not happen  The noise is almost unbelievable  All  Night  Long  The street noise is bad enough but the outer hallways and stairways are all stone and people yell up and down them all day and night  You can hear phones ringing constantly  The floors are so dirty that you have to wear shoes all the time  I finally found the room service menu stuffed in the bottom of the beside drawer and covered in big spots of mold  EWWW Once I found out about room service I did order tea and dinner  It was fine  No problems with that  On my second night I went to the hotel restaurant for dinner  I could not even get served  There was a buffet on so I grabbed a plate and some food  Never did get asked if I wanted so much as a glass of water  The next morning I thought about having a shower but there was no hot water  The tub was kinda dirty and the towels were a very deep grey so I guess it was a good thing I didnt   I had to call the desk yet again to get someone to come up and fix the hot water just so I could wash  I DO know how to operate hot water tanks in India and it was not working for me  The next day the toilet would NOT stop flushing so I called the desk again to ask someone to come up and fix it  You would have thought I was the worlds biggest pest Imagine to want hot water a operating toilet and some food I was always very careful to be polite  I did not show any disrespect for any of the staff   In desperation I tried to get my reservation for the next two nights canceled but I had paid up front through Orbitz and could get nowhere with that so I ided to stick it out  It never got any better  I dont know if the staff were rude and ignorant to me because I was a woman traveling alone or if they were that way with everyone  When it came time to check out the desk clerk manager tried to make me pay for another night saying that I stayed one night longer than I had paid for  When I asked him to get the receipt I gave him when I checked in  from Orbitz he claimed it had been lost  I had to go on the hotel travel desk internet right there and then and pull up a copy of the receipt from my email in order to prove that I had paid for the correct number of nights  The Regent Continential is definately the worst hotel I have ever stayed in  I have pictures of the room and the view if anyone is interested   Stay at the White House or Wongdhen House in the Tibetan Village  A MUCH BETTER way to spend your Rupees  
N => Dreadful not fit for my dog What a nasty hovel  The photos you see published in no way represent the squalor immiediately outside the front door or the mouldly noisy rooms you find inside  Staff either choose to speak no english or are just quite surly  The hardest thing to grasp is that when you ask a question they will lie to your face trying to get you in their cafe shop whatever  
N => poor value dishonest staff crooked travel agents I booked this through a travel agent Travel Zone India in     It was noisy dirty and overpriced  Beware of the people at the tour desk  They are cheats as well  When I came back in ust to Delhi my new agent tried to book this place again for me telling me that my other choice Clark International  block away was a far inferior choice  The agents office is within blocks of both  I stayed at the Clark  It was great and cheaper  I know I will not deal with this agent again Impact Holidays  I believe agents should be more interested in serving me ahead of the hotelThe Clark has since doubled their rates so next time I will try to find another place but certainly not the Regent Continental  
N => Bring earplugs The hotel was horrendously noisy well past midnight till  am or later  From our room we could hear incessantly the loud slamming of doors the clatter of kitchenware being cleaned hotel staff talking loudly furniture being dragged across the ble floor  This made it quite impossible to sleep  We also encountered problems with the shower whereby we could barely coax out a trickle of hot water  
N => Regent CON Dishonest Liers Complete misrepresentation Incompetent Theives I would only recommend to STAY CLEAR AT ALL COSTS The website claims they have hr internet a money safe tea and coffee maker business conference centre When I asked the manager about these facilities he pointed over to a computer over  years old which the internet did not work on one day of our stay and said theyre you go he said that was the hr internetThe state of the rooms was DISGUSTING with dead mosquitos on the bed linen floor bathroom etc The floor was dirty un hygenic opposite to the photos The room had a horrible smell be from previous guests who did GOD knows what The bathroom was Disgusting with Mold growing on each and every corner  the bathroom was enough to put you off your whole day The water was cold majority of the time They are so tight that when you leave your room they go in and switch of the fridge and ac which means you can say bye to having a cold refreshing drink in your fridge after a long day of walking around even after we said not to switch it off again the next day they switched it off again The staff are basically   year old boys who go around in groups of   who stand around waiting for tips No one understands english which I think is disgraceful considering the hotel is called Regent Continental I would Rename it Regent CON as this is simply a very dishonest service and misrepresentation of services Stay clea from the restaurant unless you want to have runs and stomach aches for days on end I had only one dinner their and felt sik for days after would highly recommend to stay clear The a c Units are afterket units which make so much noise and rattles that you would rather put up with the heat than the noise The location of this hotel is in the most awaful place you can imagine it is surrounded by gangs beggers loud barking dogs and general traffic horning outside from early hours to late The only reason why I stayed for more than one night was that they threatened to charge a cancellation charge if i ammended the orginal booking I booked and paid for the classic deluxe room which at the time of booking I was tgold that the main difference was that the classic deluxe rooms offered a view with balconyhehehe the balcony could not even squeeze one person on their without squeezing past to get the door closed it was terrible absolutely no point whatsover They also claimed to have sky tv yer when it works and their are only like  channelsall indian ones so good luck if you dont understand the lingo In overview I would only recpommend to stay as far away from this hotel as poss they are lots of hotels in the area which offer a higher standard of facilities cleaner enviroment for half the price I would sum up the Regent continental as being a farse con rip off dishonest untrustworthy disrespectful I forgot to mention that the price they quoted me at the start was not the price they demanded when departing after a few days they had added a  per night charge on and removed the   discount and said it was only available if discussed at the start which it was At that point i was so fedup with them i did not have the energy to argue anymore as they didnt understand anything I was saying and just paid them and thought well at least I know to stay clear for the future  I wouldnt want my worst enemy to experience what I experienced at Hotel Con BE aware stay clear at all costs 
N => BEWARE OF SCAM PLEASE Anyone planning to book with this hotel should be very cautious  My family and I just returned from our trip to India and this hotel is overbooking people and then transfering them to smaller  star hotels in the vicinity they have special arrangements with them  We were lied to by both the manager and the co owner of the hotel and after two days of fighting squabling and hell we finally never got our room  They even promised to keep our suitcases and after our day out on the town wed return to our rooms      alas nothing they then said were sorry but the hotel is full second night in a row   anyways i could tell you all the details but please just take my advice and avoid this hotel and its sleezy partners in the area Perfect Hotel amp Crest Inn  If youd like to have a chat with me about the experience drop me a line at travel astralize com  Cheers SameerLondon UK  
N => Good Value We stumbled across the hotel trying to look for a Travel Agents we were introduced to a man called Muztapher at the Regent who arranges Flights cars whatever you want from that point our holiday started we had an amazing trip  We had three nights here the first night the room was dark with no windows and cramped     but the second time we checked in we asked for a room with a window at the front the room was much better ask to see the room before you stay Restaurant Ok breakfast hectic staff perfectly helpful if a little slow  rooms clean fantastic location Hotel shop a rip off Muztipher made our trip with good recomendation obviously he is making money of tourists thats his job but we didnt feel he was asking to much he knows his stuff  We were two young women traveling together if we needed to be walked anywhere he would send a chaperon with us drivers were always good cars mostly clean  The hotel was good value at about   a room  Would deffinately go back felt very safe  
N => not a  star hotel at all We had booked the hotel on recommendation by a Delhi travel agent against our will as they told us it is in a super location and a good hotel where everybody they booked there has been satisfied  We have not been We stayed there twice in tiny rooms with small windows opening to the next wall  You can not leave them open as around there all outlefts from AC in other rooms  One room was in the reach of strolling cats  The rooms were dumpy even with the AC on and had a bad smell  Room and bathroom were basic and not clean  The hotel had school children a noisy clientele  The restaurant was rather expensive for what it offered  Room service was long and did spoil the content with opening bottle without even thinking of cleaning it up  The location is not that good in a unlit road when you step our ot the door you are quotattackedquot ba various people wanting something from you  We would never go back there again  
N => disappointing Overall we found the service and facilities of the hotel adequate  The big problem was the rooms  We stayed in this hotel twice during one trip to India and both rooms we found to be very dark no windows and small  The bathrooms very very dirty  We also had to share the one room with numerous cockroaches  Would not recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => incompetent staff I stayed here for  nights in early tember  The location is average hidden down a back alley but not too far from the excellent metro system  Whilst the communal areas were clean and well kept I found the room to be very spartan and it was only cleaned twice during my stay  The quotcolourquot TV was particulary bad quality and virtually unwatchable The room service was good the wait was not too long and the food was of an acceptable standard as was the price However my biggest gripe was the level of service provided by the staff  It took them  hours to finalise my bill when I came to check out and they then charged me more than I was originally quoted  hint   if you can get a print of their original quote then take it with you  I didnt and was charged an extra   when I checked out There is no money changing facility at the hotel but when I enquired one of the porters took me to a local money changer   who tried to short change me to the tune of rps I also gave the staff a couple of postcards to put in the mail for me    weeks later and they still havnt arrived I doubt they got round to posting them      
N => Disliked the Regent On arrival a staff member tried to downgrade us from a double regent suite to a classic deluxe room because they wanted to charge more for the suite even though we had agreed on a price  They showed us the classic room which had a cat living in it  We demanded the original room at the set price and they gave it to us without further quibble  Room service was awful as they brought things we didnt order and charged us for things we didnt order though management rectified this after complaining about it  The room itself was large and clean with hot water on tap and a television with good reception  Travel desk was very helpful and during our stay the hotel staff tried to be as helpful as possible and we didnt run into any problems paying them at the end  The taxi I arranged with the travel desk to the airport was also set at a fair price and I didnt feel ripped off  I didnt make use of the restaurant because of their questionable room service but found other restaurants within walkind distance as a replacement  Its definately a budget hotel but I wouldnt recommend it  
N => Never again      We recently stayed at the Regent Continental Hotel in New Delhi after booking online having read a good review  We experienced many problems  Service from staff at reception was poor   promises made to do things were not fulfilled  Pressure was put on us to use expensive hotel taxis instead of reliable local transport  We were not able to successfully make phone calls from our room  The bathroom had a bug infestation  The complimentary breakfast consisted of four or five plates of things like bread curd and filled parathas   which is fine on the surface   but the food was almost inedible and led to one of us getting sick  We attempted to book a taxi through the hotel for our departure and found at the last minute that they had not done it and we had to go in the hotel car which was far more expensive to do  The room itself was ok  The TV worked and power cuts were minimal  The location was also good  But overall our experience was a very negative one  We certainly wouldnt recommend that any women travelling alone book themselves into this hotel  
N => la plus mauvaise note du voyage  
N => Beware of Expedia booking I book this hotel through Expedia my credit card was deducted yet no confirmation from Hotel  Wrote many email to Expedia amp hotel no reply from anyone  Any one can advice what to do next 
N => well locatedfriendly and helpful staff for india it was a little priceybut that shouldnt take away the fact its in a good location and we found the staff very willing to help when needed the rooms are clean and they offer a pick up service from the airport which helps to avoid any early stress would reccomend to anybody 
N => Not the value for money Hotel is near a construction site  Non professional staff dusts in the room a filthy place to stay  i can t recommend to anybody who can pay at least  a night  Book at your risk  
N => Do not go this place We had an awful holiday in this hotel  The staff was not professional and they even tried to cheat us many times  They were really    holes towards to us  When they didnt get us as many tips as they wanted they tried to cancel our connection way to the Agra  It was scary and very unpleasant  So we left this place before our check out date  And   of course   we didnt get anything back  These pictures in TripAdvisor of this hotel are fake  The street is very dirty and full of everything you might even imagine  The rooms are very dark dirty and water comes   when it comes  So if you want to stay in a place what is called hotel   dont even think about this ratt hole  
N => great place staff very helpful and lovely We really enjoyed our stay here the welcome and airport pick up made a really smooth and pleasant transition when very jet lagged  room was clean and comfortable the room was quiet  we could not have been better looked after better by the staff breakfast was delicious Arif was great helped us find our way round and deal with any difficulties  Thanx 
N => Unprofessional reception According to the booking by Expedia airport pick up was included and the rooms should be two quotsuper deluxe doublesquot  The hotel had been notifyed about flight number and arrival time  The flight arrived at Delhi airport somewhat delayed and there was nobody from the hotel waiting for us  Fortunately this was not our first visit to Delhi so we knew that there is a prepaid taxi counter outside the airport  At the hotel reception we were told that someone had been at the airport for us  Shouldnt they check if there is a delay The reception staff was not interested in discussing this matter  The double rooms we got the first night were disappointing to say the least  Very small dirty rooms with leftovers from previous guests only double beds although twin beds had been booked  Not what you want after a long flight The next day we got two ent rooms with twin beds  In spite of this our first impression remained   that some of the staff was not professional and showed lack of interest  
N => Overpriced I stayed at this hotel mid  for one night and couldnt get out of the place fast enoughThere were no towels in our room we had to ask for them twice  The Room was dark and gloomy as it had no windows and the wardrobe doors were jammed closed so we could not use it I was very tempted to move after we arrived but as it was late in the evening and were leaving the next day I ided to put up with it but I was sorry to spend my last night in India is such a miserable hotel The worst was when late that night after being out for dinner and returning to go to bed I pulled back the bed covers to find there was no top sheet on the bed we just had a thick blanketwhich I really couldnt be sure is washed in between visitorsas it was late and we were tired we did not bother to request a top sheet so I ended up sleeping in my clothesFinally we had the worst nights sleep because of the noise seemed to be a combination of road works and internal noise in the hotelWe gave breakfast a miss as it was in the basement again no windows and it looked rather average or be our overall experience suppressed our appetiteThe most basic accommodation we stayed at had at least fresh sheets and towels this place is massively overpriced and I would not recommend 
N => overpriced We stayed at Hotel Royal Holidays during a recent trip to India  The hotel was clean enough but the room was very expensive for what it was  We were paying around Rs for a very basic room without a window which was often smelly  The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful on the whole however ignore any help they offer in hiring a taxirickshaw as youll find one much cheaper yourself by simply walking down the road  The main problem we had with this hotel was the incessant noise all through the night  It felt like we were were sleeping in the middle of a building site which we probably were and even if the workers stopped the staff or noisy elevator with music would soon wake us  If you have to stay here make sure you have your earplugs Its hard to find a good value hotel in Delhi so you  as well choose a budget option  It  not be the nicest place but it beats paying way over the odds for something thats not much betterOne more thing if you havent paid for your booking through the internet its worth asking them to lower the price of the room  We threatened to leave after a night and they lowered their price considerably  
N => very average Stayed here at the start and end of our trip    rooms are ok but as with everything in Delhi well overpriced for what you get  Breakfast is terrible but there is toast    Rooms are ok with showers that produce a dribble    Biggest let down for us was the unhelpful nature of the staff  Every question i asked resulted in them trying to make money off us    How do we get to Conht Place    Dont worry ill get you a taxi    How much    About  Rs    isnt that a bit expensive Well we can get you a rickshaw    How much About Rs    Only because we met some fellow travellers did they tell us about the metro  minutes away and only Rs to Conht PlaceStay here if you have to but if i ever return to Delhi i wouldnt go back 
N => Looked OK but they lodged us in another hotel We booked one night in this hotel but when we arrived they said that another guest had missed their flight and they would have to put us up in another hotel  They drove us there and were vey polite about it and the other hotel was fine but we were still a little disappointed  Still the area was fine handy for anywhere you might want and near the metro if you dont want to risk your skin in an auto  
N => Try to find better place Like others I chose this hotel only because of its good reviews  Reality was hard to accept  I wasnt expecting much with the price I paid but    It is more like hostel than hotel  Room was quite ok but bathroom was horrible  Cockroaches in my bed were disgusting  To sum up it is close to metro station and also very nice ket so if you are looking for chaep accomodation with hostel standards you can try this one  Always keep their business card with you because taxi drivers dont know this place at all  
N => fair but some irritations booked this hotel through expedia after reading favorable reviews here had to stay a night in delhi on my way to nepal  called the hotel day before to confirm reservation and give them my flight information for free airport pickup which was promised  they said no problem well be there  showed up at the airport with no one waiting for me  when i called the hotel they denied having my flight info and also then refused to pick me up from the domestic airport and they only do international citing hotel policy  they advised i take a cab  i arrived in karol bagh via prepaid taxi rs and they had a hard time finding the hotel the driver had to call to get directions  after my arrival staff was friendly and put me up in the room i reserved however the or was very odd a king bed with gold sheets made for a campy s feel  shower had this strange radio which freaked me out when it turned on suddenly good hot water if you turn on the heater  good pressure  breakfast was standard with a few indian dishes bread and eggs  nothing to get excited over  overall the stay would have been okay if they hadnt confirmed picking me up and then refusing later  hotel was in a ent location within walking distance of the metro but just too hard to find  looks nothing like the photo because they photoshopped all the other hotels out of the picture and put in sky instead  
N => I like delhi Hotel Royal holidays is a good place to stay in delhi  But the problem is tour operator connecting with the hotel trying to waste time of the tourist by showing expensive tour plans  room is good but they have to clean room daily  Hot water is also a big problem in the hotel  
N => ent place to stay in central Delhi This is a ent hotel in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi  There are like a million hotels in a few blocks radius that all look similar to Hotel Royal Holidays  The location is the best thing about this hotel  Karol Bagh is central to just about anything youd want to do in Delhi   and Karol Bagh is a nice area with a great open air ket and places to eat just a few steps from the hotel  The metro is also just a couple of blocks away The room itself was dirty by my standards so I didnt take my shoes off while in my room but I got the impression that most hotels in the area are probably like this  And for some reason they dont put a top sheet on your bed   I couldnt figure this out because there was no way I was going to cover up with the gross bedspread next to my skin We had to ask for an extra sheet a few times  The service was pretty good when we ordered coffee or asked for something  The biggest warning I would give you is that they have an quotassociatedquot travel agency run by a man named Abid Zargar who will hard sell you on a trip to Agra or wherever you mention you want to go  Travel services are fine and Abid is trustworthy but we practically felt like we were being controlled by the Mafia while we were there  So beware when you check into Hotel Royal Holidays and stick to your guns  Dont let them make you feel bad for not complying with what they want you to do   its YOUR trip after all We felt like we spent part of our trip arguing with Abid which is frustrating when we were only staying in India for a couple of weeks   certainly not how I wanted to spend my time I just wanted a hotel to stay at 
N => Love this Hotel It was our first time in India and we were so scared as we been heard many things about the touts at the airport but we were greeted at the airport with a hotel taxi driver who drove very safely in the night and droped us off at the hotel We found the Hotel reception welcoming always during our stay We went to a tourist Information office down the street which was recomended by the hotel staffthey helped us to organise our transportation and train tickets from place to place on basic prices One nagative point which I should say about the restaurant which was under construction during our  days stay but room service was great and pretty fast I will definetly stay in this hotel again and will recomend this hotel to the budget class travelers    
N => The hotel provides good service Room was also good   if you like with window better ask for it   but might be better without window  We booked via Expedia  There was a guy at the reception named Sajad who gave us a free taxi ride TO the airport  Thanks 
N => Nice and clean hotel very good staff This is my second time in India in last year I have booked hotel Suncity from Expedia I was not so happy because room size was very small there was no restaurant unfortunately we have to take breakfast in our room  this time I went tripadviser website and I have seen review of Hotel Royal Holidays first I was thinking this all review is fake but when I booked through expedia one night and I have call Mr  Sajad Manager of Hotel  he promise me he will pickup us from the international Airport on our arrival driver was waiting for us  when we reached hotel it was really nice hotel and very clean size of the rooms very spacious very clean bathroom free Wi Fi complimentary breakfast   I have stayed there  nights it was wonderful experience I really highly recommend this hotel 
N => Stay Was Very Comfort Dear TrevelersMy stay was very comfort amp peace even though located in the central ket Karol Bagh  There Staff was very helpfull or personalized Room was excellent clean amp furnished also enjoyed the restroom area with cosmetic mirror  enjoyed our food at the hotel For a reasonably priced hotel this really felt like a luxury experience  This hotel is very closed to India Gate and other major tourist places  on my arrival hotel representative had pick us and drop at hotel in late night which i have got complementary transfer when I booked this hotel  I reccomand this hotel to every travelers who is looking cheap and best if they really want to make their stay comfort  I am also coming on  ember  with my entire family and send the request in advance when I finalize my trip to India again  James 
N => Backup hotel close to the airport   OK only if you have no other choice Compared to many other Hotel in New Delhi this hotel is better than average  But I would not consider it any better than a backup not to far away from the airport  The value for money is really bad  The hotel is located in a very noisy area   My room was very dirty floor walls bathroom   After looking at the bed sheet I ided to take a nd shower after sleeping   The breakfast was a mix between British and Indian styles but the worse of both The service was a mix when I checked in evenso I arrived after pm the service was very friendly quick and efficient  The next day the reception was quite unfriendly and agressive  I still do not know why  
N => Delhi Airport Hotel Nice clean rooms  Tad expensive but I booked thru IRCTC website and got an allinclusive rate Though IRCTC did not mention free BF they gave it 
N => poor service Meet and greet from staff is very poor  Do not understand English  Reception staff stopped serving me snatched the guest book and started to serve an American Guest  I did get very offended by this and told him on the face  Staff do not know how to smile and welcome guests  In the end gave us the key for a room that was not even ready Getting an extra bed proved an hour long argumentHotel owner needs to know what their staff behave like and how they could be losing valued customers  Hotel needs to have more site seeing leaflets on display  
N => OK for stay over from Airport OK and clean  Has restaruant ok We got a deluxe suite where we stayed with our two young dhters Better take a room not facing the highway noise Close to airport  We paid around  rupies for transport to airport  
N => Expensive Hotel seems to have been recently refurbished  Rooms are small but clean  Price on their website was Rs we were charged Rs  Poor value for money  Reasonably close to airport  
N => It was a very safe and clean hotel  We were three women that shared a good size room for three nights  The hotel was safe and very clean and that was the most important thing to us  Friendly staff  Food was good  And it was not as expenssive as  or  star hotels that were poorly reviewed  The hotel was near the airport and a little far from the city  But we rented a taxi with a driver all day for a  rubies  The same taxi took us to Agra and back for  Rubies  Great deal  
N => Dont bother I would highly recommend NOT staying at this hotel when youre in Delhi  It was our very first stop after flying in and probably the least welcoming hotel Ive ever stayed in  The staff were rude and always yelled at each other with the noise echoing right up the stairwell  Our room was tiny and dark with no window and an overflowing toilet  We asked for the toilet to be fixed and someone came in and did something to it then demanded a tip even though the toilet was clearly not fixed  The staff also tried to overcharge us for food and drinks that we had claiming that the menu listed an incorrect price  We had no hot water and no room to move and couldnt wait to get out of there  Karol Bagh though quite interesting is not a good area to stay in as its hard to get around and takes awhile to get anywhere  There are also lots of hotels in the area and no auto rickshaw driver ever knew where we wanted to go so of course they tried to just drop us off elsewhere  On our way back through Delhi we stayed at the Eleven guesthouse which cost a bit more but not that much and it managed to completely restore our faith in Delhi being a good place to visit  Steer clear of the Singh Sahib  
N => Small room and no opening window Location of the hotel is pretty near the sky train station  The room is quite small  There is no chair inside the room  The window does not open  Air ventilation is bad  Luckily the ceiling fan was working ok  We had to wait about  mins  to get the hot shower  At the time we stayed there was no restaurant in the hotel  The mangement said it was being reated  We were served american breakfast at our room for  rp  But the breakfast was rather bad  The toast was hard  Coffe was only warm  
N => Very nice new hotel in Karol Bagh Our stay ember We walked out on the lousy Hotel Metro Heights  We packed our stuff and walked right next door to the Singh Sahib hotel  I think my Indian friend was learning by now as he said that the Singh Sahib was a little more money and all they had left was a suite but that was OK as it was more important that we were comfortable where we stayed In the Singh Sahib we were placed in a suite on the st floor right behind check in  It appeared that the hotel looked new and they were still reating a little  The restaurant was still not complete  However the room was large and clean and new and had a working AC  It also did not reek of cigarettes  Unfortunately I m not sure how long it will stay that way as the hotel apparently appeals to smokers  I chastised a Chinese guest stepping off the elevator with a lit cigarette and his response was that there was no sign  I was sure that not smoking in an elevator was a universal courtesyAs I said the room was new cleanly bled and freshly painted  As nice as it was there still were some quirky problems  First although everything appeared clean the workers neglected to clean the walls around the toilet just a small oversight  Also they had a cheap temporary curtain that went across the bathroom covering the shower and tub  This we found was prone to come down easily  There was hot water but it took a while to show up  There were frequent electricity outages but only for a minute or two The soaps were the best quality we found during our travels in India  They brought extra towels on request  There was no mini bar in the room  Breakfast was included but because the restaurant was closed we had to order by room service  There was a small glitch in getting the food but it finally came  We had to then ask for silverware and napkins  We were surprised to find French toast on the menu but it came plain and they offered no syrup  We went to compliment the front desk and apparent owners on the quality of the hotel and rooms  We were told that they must have the cheap curtains in the bathrooms as the Indian guests bathe with the bucket and cup splashing the water over their bodies to rinse and in the process drench the room  They really were not interested in talking to me  When I asked to take a couple of pictures of another room to post on TA they refused and handed me a pamphlet saying I could see the pictures there The one thing that really upset me about this hotel was the scam the owners appeared to be playing on their guests  I m not sure if it actually hurt the guests but it was probably more to shield their income from the government  I watched as they appeared to overcharge one of the Chinese guests checking out  She was tough and those guys were not going to get one over on her  When she asked for a receipt they tried to talk around the subject and finally went to write a receipt on a piece of note paper  The girl insisted on an official invoice and they finally succumb  It was funny when she asked why they had to play all of these games for which they replied with a sly meekish smile  Unfortunately I still think they were up to something as they gave her the original and kept the copy receipt  I did not realize they did the same thing to my travel agent friend who paid the bill for me  When I was later telling him about the Chinese girl we looked at our receipt and found they had done the same thing to him  We went back later to reclaim our bags being held for us after check out and made them give us a proper invoice Again this place is right next door to the Hotel Metro Heights  Both have front desk people that are plenty rough around the edges but the Singh Sahib is ten times better  The Singh Sahib be a bit more expensive and the rooms  be a bit smaller but for the few extra dollars Id stay here and not ruin my vacation at the Metro Heights  Just make sure to ask for an official receipt when you leave  
N => Basic small rooms       Clean and Tidy Not bad but the rooms are very small   not enough space to manouvre between the bed and the TV  The air conditioning only worked in the rooms and was incredibly noisy and smelly  Not enough towels problem in most hotels in India  Cable TV yummy room service but the porters hang around until they get a tip 
N => Average tourist hotel with rotten breakfast Stayed here with smallish tour party of   The room itself was fine comfortable and spacious although dark  A notice on the door said hot water had to be requested in advance but we ignored this and had no problems  Dont know if this was just luck  Room had fridge which was useful No restaurant at this hotel but we had breakfast  days running once straight off the overnight train  Both times but especially the first service at breakfast was terrible  It seemed as if one serving of a fairly poor selection was set out and when that ran out it was tough  The fruit juice tasted as if it was coloured water Overall an average and adequate budget tour hotel in a fairly quiet area but the breakfast experience made it unpleasant  
N => average to below average Stayed here in   and was overall a pretty average experience Room was reasonably clean with hot water in shower but it was freezing coldabout cwith no heating in the room at all We repeatedly asked for a heater to be brought up but they brought a broken one up and plugged it in then left lolBreakfest is pretty average also Overall not the best value for money  
N => To be avoided  Stayed there at the start of a tour of northern India  Hotel had been organised by tour company so we had no choice  The rooms were dull and dark   as was most of the hotel  We arrived after a long flight in the middle of day and tried to get a bit of rest but there is a building site right beside the hotel and they work  hours  The constant drilling and hammering was unbearable  We asked to be moved to another room but it was exactly the same  The staff start working at approx am and continously shout up the corridors at each other   they have absolutely no regard for the people staying there  Hot water has to be ordered in advance and the sheets and towels are dirty   they are dried on the street outside the hotel and smell of petrol fumes  We were booked in to stay there on our last night but refused to stay there and found a much nicer hotel in New Delhi for a much better rate  I would not recommend this hotel and would advise travellers to avoid it at all costs  
N => Good Clean Hotel I am a travel agent and therefore sell hotels all over the world for my clients so to experience myself is always a bonus to give an honest opinion This hotel was good   not amazing not bad either  The rooms were clean bathrooms adequate breakfast edible and hotel staff were helpful  Room service was fast and efficient  For a  star hotel in Delhi I feel it is good value for money My main recommendation would be a bigger pillow on the bed as they were a little on the biscuit thin side but this is my personal preference  
N => claustrophobic  worst stay of our trip Our Group stayed at The Hotel Singh Sons in Delhi  The rooms are small claustrophobic and without windows  The length of the beds are shorter than normal and if you are over ft  your feet will hang over the end  Two of the rooms smelled of smoke and two of the showers did not work  Reception is unfriendly and slow to respond  Hotel porters watch while you struggle with your bags and wait to be asked to help  We did get some individual good service for which we tipped well  We arrived at am after a delayed flight and were asked to pay extra for breakfast if we wanted it after am  We all received an unasked for early morning call for breakfast  All other hotels we stayed at for the other days breakfast was served till  am  We asked our agent to move us but apparantly all hotels were booked out in Delhi  We had to stay  nights  We do not reccommend this hotel  In its favour it is quite well located in Karol bagh but thats its only good point  We noticed several other hotels in Karol Bagh great for shopping so try another hotel  
N => good air conditioners new place in crowded area of delhi good air conditioners when entered in such heat of india especially in summers lobby was chilled amp cooled  offered us cold drinks amp as booked we got our room  we had a pleasing time at the hotel amp comfortable room was provided   Very centrally located in this busy streets of karol bagh delhi  most accessible to ket just opposite the hotel  helpful staff amp definitely a good experience in this new hotel     tidy amp clean  
N => A ent place but beware of typical scams A ent place to stay in a very congested part of Delhi  I stay in hotels throughout India regularly for work so this is a comparison to a number of different similar hotels One caveat   upon checking out the guys behind the counter told me that the quotcredit card machine isnt working quot After offering to get me a taxi to go to an ATM I insisted on using my credit card which of course worked perfectly fine  Dont fall for this scam Also   for the squeamish   the bathrooms while clean are very tight and do not inspire    
N => Beware We made an email booking for this hotel one month before our arrival in Delhi  We exchanged with Mr  Tajinder Singh at least  four emails because we wanted to be sure of the booking  They assured us the booking was ok and they had the availability of rooms  Of course when we arrived at the hotel no booking was made on the hotel books and no room was available  No Tajinder Singh to speak with only one guy at the reception that moved us in a very bad hotel in the same road we payed   and more Rs for one bad room instead of the two rooms that we booked one month earlierIf you dont want surprises like this at your arrival in Delhi avoid email booking for this hotel and be avoid this hotel at all  
N => Not bad given price Stayed there as part of an Intrepid quotcomfortquot tour to Agra  The hotel was reasonably clean and quiet  Its conveniently located in the Channa ket section of Karol Bagh about  mile from the subway  Seemed safe to walk around  This is not a quotfirst classquot hotel but we felt comfortable there pagoff 
N => Very Clean budget Hotel months old Deinitely value for money Booked directly with hotel on    good if you are shopping in Karol Bagh Very clean     middle rooms have no windows  Built  months ago   just be careful not to book any tours with tourist operators laundering around the hotel Has the usual hr room service etc food is good   hotel also arranges airport pickup around Rs Good family run hotel  
N => Un h tel pour une nuit sans plus  
N => Value for Money We booked this hotel at the last minute as our initial plans on lodging got messed up and I was not able to access Trip Advisor to read the reviews about the hotels in New Delhi  I was very skeptical while booking this hotel as I was accompanied with my whole family from Chennai to New Delhi and I want to ensure nothing more messes up with our plan The Hotel from it s outside gave us a not so good impression as it is fully surrounded by Shops and the Hotel is located in the Commercial area however after walking inside the room we felt that we have booked a ent and economical room in New Delhi  We were a family of  and the Hotel Staff was kind enough to accommodate all  of us in a Deluxe Ac Room for Rs    per night  The Hotel is located right near the Karol Bagh ket which is an added advantage for all bargainers in Shopping  They have a Andhra restaurant and the food was very good  Overall we felt that this Hotel was value for money  
N => Cheap   both in terms of rate and service I stayed with my wife and her parents for  nights at Southern Hotel  The rooms and the service were woefully bad  In the  nights we stayed my in laws had to chang rooms thrice  The first night we were offered rooms in an extended block in a street nearby the second night they were offered a room where the wc flushes did not work properly and where there was no proper exhaust fans finally on the last night of their departure they were offered a good room  The rooms offered to us were also not of high standard  The rooms might have the latest television sets but the condition of the rooms and the bathrooms including the finish were substandard  Their travel desk though manned by a couple of courteous staff do have the odd disrespectable staff who managed to cause some aggravation  Their staff need more training on customer service  The private delhi city tour we had was also not upto the k as the driver who also happened to be the guide did not know all the details about the places he was taking us to  In short we had the most unpleasant stay at the hotel though I do have to add that at the end we were offered complimentary drops at the airport for the bad experience we had gone through a ent gesture but surely not enough to compensate for the experienceThis is a cheap hotel that will be reflected in the or and service  If cost is paramount to you and if you dont mind the state of the rooms or the service then fine  Otherwise please steer well clear of this place  
N => Collected  It was difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in New Delhi that had some sort of track record  We finally took a chance and chose the Southern  Ok its not the Oberoi Cecil but for the money and a very short stay it was fine  We were collected from the airport as agreed and taken to the railway station at  am  They arranged a city tour car and driver for  hrs Rs   All in all I think good value for money at    a night for a double room  Not the place to stay for more one or two nights  
N => Delux Hotel offering great facility  offering the ultimate hospitality courtsey great food homely atmosphere comfort elegant furnishings  My stay was really worth  
N => It was pleasant stay in Delhi  The hotel was centrally located and is ideal for tourists who proceed to pilgrimage circuits such as Char Dham etc  But please check out regarding the clause of free drop to Railway station as it is given in quotes quotsubject to availabilityquot and can put you in trouble if you depended on them as we faced trouble in the last moment  We had to hire a taxi from outside when the hotel did not provide us with the quotfree dropquot and got away with this clause  
N => DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY BUSINESS TRAVELLER We booked the hotel through the website      The pictures and the description is totally misleading  The hotel is spread over two buildings  We were given rooms in the adjoining building which was a commercial building with shops on both sides  Only the top two floors of this building had hotel rooms  The restaurant reception etc was all in the main building  We asked to be put in the main building but were told that there were no deluxe rooms in the main building  Imagine having pass through the shops selling household items and travel agents to get to the breakfast table in the morning  As you can imagine even a bottle of mineral water took  mins to arrive in the room  We were to call the reception and it took a lot of time for the service people just to get to our room  Also as soon as you get out of the lift you see bystandershawkers  We had a feeling that even our luggage was not safe The food and the service in the restaurant was not at all good  The average wait time for the food to arrive after placing order is  mins to  hour  Also no other good restaurants in the vicinity The location is Karol Bagh but there is a shortage of Cabs rickshaws in the vicinity of the hotel I would not recooment the hotel to any traveller  
N => Dont just go by the website I was less then happy when I turned up at about am to be taken to my rooms I asked to see the rooms before I would take my cases to the rooms When I saw the rooms which was a deluxe room I was not very happy bunny so I went down and made it clear that if I am not given a better room at the same price then I would be going else where I was then offerd two super deluxe rooms for the same rate as the deluxe but they wouldnt be available til the following night so we had to make do with the deluxe room for the first night after the first night service was much better and my family and i enjoyed our stay 
N => Absolutely no You can find something better for a bit more   so do  Internet pictures are from another era so dont be fooled by those  Once you get to your room they are OK but getting there is through a scary neighborhood   you leave the reception area to go down an unsecured alley  We arrived late and they had switched our booking to a hotel down the street that was even more scary but it was  in the morning   so no place to complain  Staff is not very helpful   particularly the middle aged guy at the front desk  No nearby restaurants or shopping  Pay a little more and enjoy Delhi  Trip advisor has other recommended hotels   read the reviews and pay a bit more   how often are you in Delhi 
N => Only if you have to    The rooms were clean enough  However having to go out to the street from the Check in area to the rooms is scary in the middle of the night especially given the run down appearance of the neighborhood The hotel offers complimentary pick up for their more expensive rooms  I was pleasantly surprised that they sent a person to receive us  However this turned to dis as he called for the car after seeing us and it took about an hour and a half of waiting to get in a car  Sure enough this delay meant that the hotels restaurant was closed for the night   significant problem when traveling with a small child Overall I would not recommend this for families with kids if you are coming from the U S  Probably more suitable for adults and adventure travelers  
N => A great Web site eption They were supposed to wait at airport and they didnt  I tried to call hotel few times nobody answers  After two hours I picked a local cab to hotel  Local India taxi driver start lhing at me what kind of hotel I picked up  Area where hotel is is quite grabby even according New Delhi standards  Rooms are simply disgusting  Outside hotel it is a mess  I left hotel after  minutes and paid charges for one night  It was not possible to brave this hotel  
N => A little out of the way Not a bad hotel in a bit of an odd location in Karol Bagh but only a   min walk to the metro station which makes getting round quite easy  Definately spend the extra money for an executive suite good sized room and nice bathroom though zero view and relatively noisy outside  Saw the standard rooms and they were cozy  The complimentary airport pickup is a bonus specially if its your first time in India and they did show up   eventually Food was quite good complimentary breakfast not so good from room service nice curries though the sag paneer was the most radioactive looking one I have ever seenStaff friendly enough and willing to help over all not a bad choice for a budget ish hotel in the relatively pricey Delhi 
N => Oh how eiving pictures can be When I first pulled up outside this hotel in the taxi I had to triple check the address and ask the receptionist before being convinced that it was indeed the one Id seen online  Put simply the hotel in reality is absolutely nothing like what its website portrays  Ok so many of the streets in the Karol Bargh area are very grubby albeiet quite a convenient central location however the difference between what was promised online and what I got more than warrants me writing this review  The hotel lobby looks impressive enough   especiallly considering the outside is a complete mess  The receptions was helpful enough  First problem   Im told check out time is am  I was told this previously on an email from them when I booked   when I told them I would choose a different hotel because of it they changed it to midday   when I arrived they knew nothing about this and said they would need to charge me Guy takes me out into the street and up the most filthy alleyway which leads to an outside building that leads in turn to where my room is  I had booked the executive suite   on first view the room looked ok   but once the door was shut I had time to see how bad it was  The room was completely infested with cockroaches  Everywhere   running around the bed the bathroom    I was simply too tired to consider changing hotels so I ided to brave it out  I told reception to come and spray the room they did but this changed nothing All in all something to be very aware of   yes their website makes the place look very attractive   but it is very very misleading  Caveat Emptor 
N => be good in India standard but does not meet international standards Stayed in a super deluxe AC room  which was brand new so that was good  They have dish TV in the room which is also good  The size of the room was small Was initially showed a standard room and was disgustedThe service at the resturant breakfast was rather laid back The breakfast menu was limiting Kaamat resturant is okay The desk service and butlers etc are quite good The New Delhi city tour that we with Southern did was wonderfulOverall it  good if you are a local Indian Foreingers and NRIs you will be dissapointed it does not meet international standards its better to pay a little more and stay at a better hotel   
N => Overall average be good for New Delhi This review should be read with the understanding that while doing research for hotels in India I was struck by the lack of agreement about the quality of different hotels  It seems there was no consistency in the reviews  I hate to add to the confusion but I cant rave about Hotel Southern like the other reviewers  This was our first trip to India and I imagine that among the other hotels in India Hotel Southern is probably above average but I was not blown away  The positives of the hotel  The rooms we had two different rooms on two different nights were clean  Not immaculate but NOT gross   The hotel did have air conditioning and heat we did use the heat in uary  Initially the heat was broke but the staff fixed it in about  minutes  The hotel was a reasonable value  I was not very impressed by the value of the Hotel Southern but it did provide a clean okay location most tourists stay near Conant Place for a reasonable price    The hotel is near five minute walking from the New Delhi metro system this was an excellent way to avoid the pollution traffic and inflated taxi prices tourists pay  The hotel had a complimentary breakfast but I had to ask about it before the staff gave me vouchers they were not given to me with my key at check in as most other hotels do   The hotel offers a complimentary pick up from railway stations and sometimes airports although we tried to arrange this twice but neither time did any hotel staff pick us up  This was a big disappointment  The negatives of the hotel  The only negative that was that I felt the staff often did not go out of their way to help us  Failure to arrange transportation for us twice was a big let down  We asked the staff to call the airport to see if our flight was delayed  The staff member sent me to their travel desk where I was given the number but no one ever called for us  A Hotel with good service just make the call  Finally I had to ask about the complimentary breakfast and I demanded that for their failure to pick us up twice they should give us a complimentary ride to the airport  Good hotel offers these to their guests the guests do not have to ask  
N => Cockroaches and unreliable service I stayed at this hotel for  nights ober  When I made my booking the staff offered to pick me up from the airport and didn t show  When I called them to ask about arranging a transfer they simply said they had no more cars and hung up in my ear  When we did arrive the room had cockroaches  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone  
N => Great Facility of pickup  Hii am srinivasan from Tamil Nadu We had reservation at hotel southern and informed them through email about our visit to New Delhi This is my first visit  They made every arrangements to pickup us from railway station that we havent had any problem   
N => economical rooms  The property was very convenient and my stay was smooth  Room was clean and service was perfect  I didnt take any meal but morning breakfast was hygienic and tasteful  Thought i took the dinner amp it was great   Location was also ent one  I will definitely visit this hotel whenever I planned to come back here again  
N => HotelNanakRocks The property was very convenient and my stay was smooth  Room was clean and service was perfect  I didnt take any meal but morning breakfast was hygienic and tasteful  Location was also ent one  I will definitely visit this hotel whenever I planned to come back here again  
N => TheGamePlay The hotel room was very good with modern outfit  Though room was spacious its more than made up with modern amenities and good lighting  The front office was also very cordial and well staffed  The restaurant was not very good  The food was upto standard  The bath room was good   House keeping made sure small things are refilled everyday  
N => Cheap but not really clean The hotel is cheap located in an area with a lot of garages and car trading activities  We were upgraded for free   but the room we were upgraded to did not even have a window Sheets and towels were partly dirty   so this was not a cosy place to stay The personell is very friendly tough we were instantly given another room when asking  All in all it is not really a recommendable hotel but we had expected something like that  
N => Worst place to stay I was forced to stay in this hotel as i was coming from Manali with a small  year old child at   am I checked into this hotel The room rents are far too high for the amenities The bed is placed on a carpet which has not been cleaned in the last one year The hotel staff must rank as the most unfriendly and rude that I have encountered They insisted i pay in cash or pay   more if I payed by card They insisted that I pay more as i was checking in at   am in the morning Hioweevr if you fight they would reluctently agree to not charge you anything extra If you wanted an extra tea bag  I had to fight for it  
N => Average Average hotel in the busy Carol Bagh area Not much to describe about except that you cant find another  star hotel in Delhi city for this value The restaurant is not that great and the food too was just OK Overall only advisable if you dont have any other option except stay in Carol Bagh    Which ofcourse is a street shoppers paradise  
N => very nice stay The hotel is perfect for a stay in Delhi We received a warm welcome from the hotel management  We were given a nice room  The room was spacious and well furnished  In fact we are thankful to the hotel management because they upgraded our room without any extra cost  The bathrooms were very clean   There was bath tub and also arate shower panels which we enjoyed the most  We were also given complimentary soft beverages and free laundry service  The restaurants served delicious food  I would certainly recommend this hotel to all travelers in Delhi   
N => Better stay away Sri Nanak Continental is situated in a rather shabby neighbourhood in New Delhi We stayed in four different hotels on our trip and Sri Nanak was by far the worst We had booked a quotluxury roomquot   The room did not feature a safe which was said to be included   The AC was old and very noisy and it was not possible to leave it on when removing the room key to go out making the room as hot as outside  c The staff tried to scam us when we asked for a hotel taxi to the local ket  It was just a couple of blocks away and they wanted Rs     When we lined the offer and left they hurried back to us and offered a four hour sightseeing for rp  which still is pretty expensive We went to see some other parts of India and left the hotel for five days  We asked to check out and get refund for the this period  The staff lined the refund but wanted us badly to check out  We did not check out as we needed the room for storage  So in the meantime while checked in the staff removed our belongings from the hotel room and unplugged the refridgerator  When we got back we had to ask the staff to get our stuff back  They had most likely rented our room out when we were gone  Very unprofessionalPositive reks  The hotel gave us free airport pick up   They gave us three hour free internet access   Liqour shop situated next to the hotel   The food in the restaurant other than the continental breakfast was OK NoteThe internet at the hotel must be authenticated through a web frontend  This page does not work with Opera Mini or the standard Nokia web browser SumyUnprofessional and dubious staff  Stay away from this hotel  
N => Pretty poor might be ok value for money  Me and some friends stayed at this hotel when visiting India recently and here are my impressionsRooms Size is somewhat small but in my opinion not really that bad  The main room seemed clean enough but the bathroom was a disaster  A very dirty floor somewhat smelly and stains in the toilet not excrements but the kind you get if you never clean it  Towels and bedsheets were clean Hygene supplies like soap shampoo shaver shower scrub and tooth brushpaste were all included but the emptyused ones wasnt always replaced unless we asked for it Air Condition machines were noisy but worked ok Staff Rather unfriendly and not too service minded  They also seemed very helpless when it came to things that are not in their daily routine  For example when cheking out they insisted my card was being lined  When I looked at the display on the card reader it said quotcheck phone noquot  I told them that it was probably not a card problem but a connection problem yet they insisted it was my card that didnt work and demanded I go get some cash  After some nagging I got them to wiggle a bit on the phone connector and hey presto it worked As usual when checking out you have to fight the staff to roll your own suitcase yourself the three meters from your room to the lift  If they get to you theyll also cram themselves together with you and your luggage in the already small elevator not matter how much you tell them you can do it yourself  Totally unnecessary in my opinion  No tipWhen we asked the hotel taxi for a  km ride they wanted  rupees  We just turned our back to leave and suddenly we got a better not good but better deal  Four hours free driving for  rs Dissapointing that they first tried to hustle us like that The two friends I traveled with had prepaid their room and when we went for a unplanned trip we told the staff we would leave for a few days  As my friends could not get a refund the staff didnt even want to try they just repeated quotnot refundable as in the agreementquot my friends didnt check out for the small trip  When we came back their belongings were removed from their room  Though they got them back it seems the room was rented out in the meantime Food The best thing about the hotel  The restaurant has some great Indian dishes  But stay away from the continental breakfastInternet Provided by wifi but unfortunately user authorized by a somewhat dodgy web solution that doesnt work in all browsers so you might not be able to use your st phone  
N => Poor organization I went to India with my wife for sightseen this country has many things to see and Taj Mahal is defenitively the best of the seven wonders  We were hosted in Hotel Sri Nanak Continental and from my point of view this hotel has a weak organization We had the next problems due poor organization   I requested pick up service in the airport we were waiting for  minutes and taxi never arrives finally we ided to go by ourself to hotel    Even though there is a questionaire to feed back about problems with infrastructure and service it seem they didnt read it air conditioner is very noisy almost impossible to sleep but with a temperature in summer of  C obviously is necessary   Room cleaning can be drastically improved    We bought a  days tour to Agra and Jaipur in travel desk of same hotel I explained them due we were not using the room during  nights I must not pay this but responsible explained me this is a hotel policy and that I had to pay this  nights and additional hotel in Agra and Jaipur     The street is very noisy and rooms are not designed to have a quiet enviroment I recommend to look for different option there are better hotels in Delhi at same price  
N => Horrible horrible place will not stay here ever again My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night  My husband booked this place because it was shown as a top value hotel on Trip advisor the location is not that great  but that was not our main problem  when we arrived at the hotel after a long flight the staff were very rude and extremely lazy   hey took about half hour to check us in and the service was really really bad  finally we were taken to the room  It is extremely small  Although they had provided a big collection of supplies for bathroom etc  I was impressed with the LCD TV bcos overally the hotel looked quite horrible The bathroom was the worst  It smelt of cigarettes and I was not sure if they had actually cleaned the bathrooms before we arrived  Five minutes after we checked into the hotel we were asked to come down to the reception with our passports  As we were planning to go and watch a movie my husband and I went downstairs  We were met by two police officers in civil clothes  They started asking us many questions as to where we work etc  We were questioned for a good ten minutes  They became very nice to us after they found out where my husband and I were working and apologised to us  When we asked why they wanted to question us they told us that it was arountine checking as the indian independance day was coming soon that we were the only guests in our rooms and because we were originally from a south asian country I was quite angry even thought the police officers were eventually very nice to us  we had no idea why they wanted to check us and we were quite suspicious because both the police officers who had come to check us spoke our mother tongue which is not that often used in north india   what made us even more angrier was that the front office staff did not even apologise to us or even explain why were being questioned   My husband and I have stayed in many places as we go on holidays once a month and this hotel was the worst that I had stayed in   My husband and I actually had an argguement because I was complaining the whole evening about this hotel    I have no idea why this hotel is shown as a top value hotel in trip advisor as there are many many more nicer hotels  I will not stay here again and I will not recommend it to anyone 
N => Nice experience     The hotel amp services were very much helpfull to me as I was the first time visitor to Delhi  I felt very easy to move to see various places in and around Delhi  They had a very good trip assistance loyal drivers with cab took me to Haridwar Rishikesh Tajmahal Rooms amp Services were satisfactory  
N => AVOID  DONT STAY AT THIS HOTEL The room was very small and unpleasent  Very DIRTY  Unable to sleep due to a loud noise from the street till  am  No hot water at bathroom  On arrival we were told that breakfast is included but on checkout we charged  rhp for breakfast  The breakfast was very poor and the service poor as well  The train station is about  minutes walk in an unpleasant area  The hotel location is faraway from the tourists attraction and the area dont look safe at evening time  The AC was very noisy and hardly worked so the room was hot It was the worst hotel we had in India  I would not stay there again  I do NOT recommend this hotel  It was a very bad experience  I can not understand the other review  
N => Overall stay was unpleasant though some staff were nice  I only stayed for one night and left quickly the next morning to tour a bit of Delhi and catch a train to Agra in the afternoon  The rooms were ok but not very clean  My towels were dirty and phone didnt work so I had to move rooms right away  I cant say much about the location as I didnt explore much but it is on a very busy narrow street filled with mopeds fruit stands and liveliness  Wouldnt recommend walking around solo after dusk but if you are  or more youd probably be ok  FYI  Breakfast was not included since I booked online  I would not stay there again or recommend this hotel Additionally   When I arrived I coordinated a car for the next day which was a bit of an ordeal but worked out fine  Just beware of the  kilometer limit which I exceeded easily they charge  rupees each additional kilometer   which I actually dont think is terrible just that you will like go over the limit  Also the driver tried to tack on an extra  more for not dropping me off back at the hotel or something even though I had arranged to end the day at the train station  That was annoying and obviously not well communicated  
N => Unlikely to go back For me getting a good nights sleep and having good washing facilities are the most important reasons for staying in a hotel  Sadly this hotel failed on both counts  The room was tiny with old style A C  unit which allowed all the outside noise to come through making it impossible to sleep  The shower had a very poor water flow not enough have a ent wash  And if you arrive early like we did they will charge you for an extra night  If you want to stay up all night and go without a wash be their guest  Definitely not for us again  
N => Much More than Expected We being an old couple wanted a neat room amp a secure place to stay  After spending numerous hours searching for the hotel on the internet we ided to stay at Sri Nanak  There are endless options in the internet but you realize the difference only when you arrive at the hotel  We had booked the hotel directly to get a good deal and the reply was prompt   We stayed in a executive room which was a newly reated rooms amp later upgraded us to a suite room since they had empty rooms which was a nice gesture  It had nice LCD TV and very clean white linen which is uncommon for hotels in delhi in this price bracket  Rooms had all things which you can expect from a    hotel  We were satisfied with the staff who helped us at all times  Also the hotel has a travel desk in which we went for a same day agra tour   delhi local tour which all went perfect  Overall i would like to recommend this hotel to all travelers as I like sharing my opinion so that others can benefit Also the hotel Wi Fi Service was very fast amp the best part it was free  They also have a desktop machines in case you do not have a laptop   quotquot 
N => Family Traveller This was my first visit to New Delhi I always book my hotel through Travel Agent but this time I book my hotel through internet  As I have seen many reviews in trip advisor about this hotel so we ide to stay in this hotel amp book a room through the hotel website  I requested the hotel to give me the discount but they refuse to give me the discount and they offer me Free Airport pickup with complimentary breakfast  So we finally ide to book this hotel  The hotel arranged nice luxury car to pickup my family as I was coming from Singapore late night  The hotel was located in crowded area Karol Bagh so we feel safe there to stay  Hotel Sri Nanak was nice clean amp comfortable as my dhter is very particular about the cleanliness of the bathroom but she was happy as there was shower panel in the bathroom with  nozzles as never expected in such kind of hotels  The hotel room was small but they have all facilities which we can never think in small luxury hotel as I have stayed in many hotels in India  I will recommend other family travelers to stay in this hotel as the atmosphere of the hotel looks like home  
N => Very Noisy Overpriced Stayed for a night  The room was very noisy for  reasons  AC was rumbling like it was about the explode  Had to switch it off eventually because I got really worried    There was some night long celebration where there was chantingsinging in the street outside not the Hotels fault but still makes it difficult to sleep Free wireless internet was good  They also give free newspapers which I did not expect from a budget hotel  Hotel staff were also reasonably helpful  While no complaints apart from the noise the overall hotel service is not spectacular either to merit the price they are charging for  
N => Mediocre but Manageable Our room was incredibly small and a bit dingy  Staff was nice though and the breakfasts were good  The quotaloo parataquot was the best we had in India  
N => Exellent experience quot We stayed for  nights in this hotel   I must say they are really hard woking people   The staff were really helpful at all times   the manager was flexible with the late checkout time  we were ready to pay the charge   But he denied   also the food  rooms service all was very good   The hotel wa its travel desk for which they offer good price   The Local Sightseeing with them was also a good one covering all parts ot delhi   I would reccoamnde this hotel quot 
N => Great stay We had very nice time at this hotelRooms staff  internet  clealiness all was very good we very much enjoyed our stay  
N => not a good place The worst hotel we stayed in India  The staff was not friendly at all When we asked to pay in euros they tried to cheat us in calculating the chage rates   The room was dirty and we had to keep close the bathroom door due to the smell   The resturant is fine even if the service was very slow  
N => Great budget place but beware of the tourist operators attahced to the hotel If you are looking for a good budget hotel then Nanak is a great choice in Delhi  Its location is not the best especially since it is tucked into a narrow street which was not really car friendly  Service at the hotel was excellent  The staff were very friendly and accommodating  Rooms were clean but the bathroom shower curtains could be better  The food at the restaurant was good and we had no complaints  My only complaint during the duration of our stay was the travel agency attached to the hotel  They were ridiculously overpriced and the drivers who took us back to New Delhi railway station were outright impolite and did not care about the fact that it was raining and that we did not want to wade in a pool of water to get to the entrance of the station  All they were worried about was that we had to pay Rs   more for the AC  On the second day of our stay we took a tour of Delhi and the driver was reluctant to take us to many places saying that it was too crowded  It looked like we were traveling with his comfort in mind PLEASE BEWARE ABOUT THESE TOURIST OPERATORS  You would be better off if you can arrange your Delhi tours with another travel agency  I called Mr  Karan Khandelwal of the hotel and he promised to look into this matter and was very apologetic but I never got a call back or an email regarding this  Overall the hotel was a pleasant experience with the only blot being the tourist operators  I would recommend the place otherwise  
N => Would recommend it   Enroute home I had some dead time in Delhi on ust   As I was travelling with two young kids some ent lodging to have a nap and shower was imperative  I booked this hotel by directly contacting the property through email  They offered me a room for INR  for  hours everything included except transfer  I thought INR  was not a bad deal and thus consented to the offer  The room was clean and worth its price  Bathroom was of good standard to be a budget hotel in India toiletries of acceptable quality  Wifi was ok  As far as location is considered it all depends upon what you are looking for  If you are out to enjoy the true hustle bustle of India it is a perfect choice   congested mainstream India with all its salient features  But if you are allergic of crowd hullaballoo and wanted to have something silent and calm avoid this hotel   rather avoid the locality Karol Bagh altogether  The hotel asks for INR  for a taxi to the airport which is quite unreasonable  Air conditioned radio taxi would cost at the most INR   Of course there are much better alternatives  However in short I would recommend this hotel if you are looking something in this price class  A general tip Try as far as practically possible have your deals in writing explicitly mentioning what it includes and what it doesn t  Otherwise you will be bitterly surprised at the end  
N => Excellent Stay I stayed with Hotel Sri Nanak in ch   The hotel was great the services was just too great  The Owner sandeep was great too he had a dinner with us and that was complimentary  The Manager were very helpful in providing information about the city which was quite handy  We had our Laptops  we could browse High Speed Wi Fi which was quite useful   Also if you are not carrying the notebook then the hotel provides free access to desktops  The Food at the restaurant was great serving excellent chicken tikka masala I like spicy food  The food was just too good to resist The rooms have been nicely orated amp very clean  The bathroom was equipped with latest amenities and the rooms were just amazing  There is a nicely orated lobby in the basement where you can shop too  I bought a lovely pair of elephants  Over all my stay at the hotel was great amp its a good deal to be here If you are in Delhi grab a room here Happy traveling to all 
N => Mixed feelings This was our first trip to India and our first stay in this hotel  To me it bore no resemblance to the lavish reviews Ive read on this site but it was clean and things worked  I was charged  rupees for a quotcomplimentaryquot pickup from the airport but I must blame myself as I had forgotten that the pickup was supposed to be free  The location is awful but perhaps the rest of Delhi is like that we only went from the airport to the hotel and back  There was also some problem with the online reservation payment gateway and if I hadnt checked the total would have paid about twice what I was supposed to  I dont know quite how to rate this hotel as I havent seen others in Delhi but I certainly dont think the hotel deserves the praise some reviewers have cast on it  
N => Good for occasional nights stay We spent  nights in  stays during ch in different rooms  The rooms are small with little storage space but clean the bed firm but adequate  The air con worked but was noisy the fridge didnt work  The bathroom is a wet room so take your thongsflip flops but there was hot water  The staff were friendly amp helpful  Unless they already know where it is taxis wont be able to find it   its buried in the motor cycle repair section of the bazaar  But they will be able to find the gurdwara the hotel is very close   if the gurdwara is on your LHS turn R for  block amp vise versa  Alternatively arrange for the hotel to send a car to meet you at the station or airport  The dining room on the top floor is not very attractive although an Indian family had a birthday party there   good sign  Be careful of the food   my wife had a dose of salmonella  days after we left amp is convinced it was from a re heated veg biryani she had there  In sumy its OK for an occasional nights stay if youre prepared to live out of your suitcase amp its inexpensive  For some reason they wouldnt take a CR card for payment but insisted on cash  
N => Hard to find a good hotel in New Delhi We booked three rooms and stayed six nights while we were attending a conference in uary   Prior to leaving I asked five of the hotels I had previously stayed at Ashok Taj Mahal Oberoi Meriden and Claridges to quote a price for four rooms for six nights including all taxes I do not know if it was the time of year but all came back with quotes in excess of  and one was not sure they could fit us in If you are looking at the Hotel Sri Nanak Continental you are probably having the same problem finding a good clean hotel in New Delhi  I use Google Earth and the Hotel Sri Nanak was shown as located in New Delhi close to our meeting at the Dr  Kothari conference center  I sent an email to the hotel to book the rooms and stated that it was selected based on its location  I am a regular visitor to India and know my way around New Delhi although I had not been there in over  years  The Hotel Sri Nanak Continental is not in New Delhi but in Old Delhi and its ranking of  of  hotels in New Delhi is more a reflection of the sever lack of good hotels  As one of our first time visitors to India put it  a one star hotel on the fringe of the ghetto  he had never seen an Indian ghetto so he is probably overly harsh The location  mistake  was not a mistake but I am glad to report that it has now been corrected  India is known for its entrepreneurship and rather than take offense on what appears to be borderline dishonesty it is better to take in your stride and get the problem fixed  The hotel did pick us up at the airport in a good car the hotel is in a dirty part of town but I believe it to be safe  The trip they arranged for Agra went well and the hotel taxi driver was made to cough up what he overcharged due to lack of change Finally the grey towels were eventually replaced by clean white towels  One of our party had money stolen from stored luggage despite the  security  but it is not a good idea to leave money in luggage anywhere in the world All in all probably somewhat overpriced for the location and condition of the rooms but you  want to consider negotiating and on the up side despite its basic appearance the restaurant is great My advice to the owners Keep your laundry clean and fix up the roof area so guests have somewhere to sit  My advice to guests   welcome to India keep your cash safe and go with the flow  
N => Great place to begin and end your journey to India We traveled to India as a family of six with four under the age of eighteen  We flew into Delhi and Sri Nanak Hotel was waiting for us   even though our flight was delayed more than two hours in the middle of the night  What service The hotel staff was friendly supportive and helped us acclimate from the USA to India  Mr  Sandeep and Mr  Karan were particularly helpful  They made sure all of our needs were addressed  They arranged for transportation to the Taj to our friends house in Delhi and to the airports as we traveled  We came back to this hotel after more than two weeks in country  We stayed in several hotels and this had the best service good food clean accomodations and excellent management and staff  When we come to India in the future this will be our first and last stop  I give Sri Nanak my highest recommendation   a value for the money and a welcome respite from the busyness of Delhi  Hats off to Mr  Sandeep and Mr  Karan 
N => Terrible stay away Ever wonder why this seems to be one of the few places that seems to have plenty of rooms on short notice Its because they will take your reservation and then move you on to a different hotel of their choice even if you personally emailed with them to confirm a reservation made via a website I arrived here after a long haul flight quite late in the evening only to discover they had moved me to a different hotel  The room there was fine even though the bathroom was dirty and there was no hot water  Moreover it was located in the middle of the motorcycle repair district of a ket  I probably do not need to elaborate on the amount of noise large numbers of bikes make in the morning   I very much recommend AGAINST booking a room at this hotel  You wont end up there anyway and will just have to go through a lot of hasle to get your original booking fee refunded  evidently I ended up paying the other hotel 
N => Noisy busy surroundings Hotel kindly arranged a pick up from the Airport got in at approx  am  The hotel is located in a very busy ket place and I wouldnt recommend this to anyone wanting a gentle introduction to Delhi following a long plane journey  Hotel was clean but the location spoilt the experience  Its the only place where I had to get out of my Tuk Tuk and walk back to the hotel due to gridlocked traffic  Anyone who doesnt like barking dogs or call to prayer early morning should avoid Staff were indifferent the only place where no one wanted to discuss the India Pakistan cricket game underway Best avoided unless you cant get anywhere else or are particularly interested in import export from the surrounding commerce    
N => Good enough It took me a long time to ide upon Hotel Sri Nanak Continental as my destination upon arrival in New Delhi  As some other reviewers have noted there seems to be a dearth of true mid range lodging in Delhi  In many cases it is necessary to spend a small fortune to get what might be considered a moderate hotel in other places  I made my reservation at the Sri Nanak Continental and upgraded paid not complimentary to a suite  My first experience was with the airport pickup  I walked through the arrivals area and saw many drivers with signs but I didnt see my name on any of them  Since my flight had arrived about  minutes early  I ided to wait a few minutes before getting worried  I waited a little over an hour before calling the hotel  It turned out that the driver was waiting for me outside instead of inside the arrivals hall  It was fine that he was there but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that he would be outside and not inside  Once we met up though all went well getting to the hotel  Check in went quite smoothly  I was able to grab a quick bite to eat in the restaurant  That was the only meal I had there   it was adequate    not great not bad  The restaurant itself is a little on the dismal side    no windows and rather dark  My room was nice enough   it was certainly clean  It seemed to take a long time for the water to get hot  The bed was comfortable and there was a good selection of stations on the flatscreen TV  I didnt see what a standard room looked like but the suite had a small sitting area adjacent to the bed  It was like a standard room in a US chain such as a Comfort Inn   not a arate sitting room  The staff was courteous enough with the exception of a bellman who attempted to become a little too familiar with me a solo woman and then made some insulting reks  The neighborhood is very congested and noisy but the metro is at a convenient distance   be  minutes walking  
N => Overcharging Delhi Hotel We have just returned from a  day stay in India  Unfortunately had to stay at the Sri nanak Continental in Delhi Firstly the free Airport pick up came late with  car for  pasengers plus luggage  Had to wait almost an hour while they sorted out a Taxi I had booked the most expensive  rooms they had  A large room was shown to us  which was not clean or tidy  they then showed us other rooms and we chose a much smaller room which was just about bearable Didnt realise that the bed was so hard as if there was no mattress The pillows stank the bedsheet was dirty so had to have the sheets and pillow covers changed and the room cleaned  The dirty dusty windows of the room did not shut properly so spent  sleepless noisy nights Do not ask them to get a Taxi as theirs is about  times as expensive there is a taxi rank around the corner about  minutes walk with cheap taxis I saw  people check out first one complaining about overcharging second one about extra charges for Mini Bar  When I checked out they charged me for the large room although I stayed at the cheapest room after complaing the manager cancelled a   food bill but not the   extra for the room  Then charged me for  nights as a mistake but refunded the rd night The staff were helpful at all times The restaurant is actually a cafe and the food was good  There is also free internet at all times and location is good for shopping I would not stay again or recommend this hotel 
N => Clean Enough Erratic Service Noisy Neighborhood We searched a great deal online to find this hotel in Delhi  Dised by the high prices and very negative reviews of many low middle range hotels we were attracted by this hotels excellent web site fairly reasonable prices and offers of amenities  We also liked that they offered a courtesy pick up from the airport especially given the location of the airport  Unfortunately although we had sent emails and called the hotel to book a reservation pre paying online as they require clearly requesting airport pick up and listing flight number and exact times no one was waiting to pick us up when we arrived at the Delhi airport  We called only to find out that they had forgotten to send someone even though we were reportedly on the pick up schedule  They didnt admit this at first though  saying that the driver was quoton the wayquot and quotstuck in trafficquot and would be there in twenty minutes or so  They suggested we wait by the cafe stall outside the airport and we were only to happy to do so  We had a coffee and tasty snack    Twenty minutes passed    thirty minutes passed    My husband kept calling to see what had happened to the driver only to be told repeatedly how close they were  We didn t want to make a nuisance of ourselves but were concerned that we might be in the wrong place or the driver might have overlooked us somehow especially when we were initially told it would be much less time  We waited an hour and had just about given up when finally our quotpersonquot arrived with a name placard  He apologized profusely and was very polite cheerful and communicative which we appreciated  After a long drive due to the heavy Delhi traffic we finally arrived at the rather sketchy area where the Hotel Sri Nanak is located  and were greeted with apologies  In this situation I think a concrete gesture such as a complimentary fruit plate or room upgrade if they wanted to be extravagant to make amends would have been a nice gesture but no conciliatory gestures were made  Hotel elevator is claustrophobic with screen gate  I preferred the stairs  Nice attention paid to orating the hallway with a pleasant statue possibly Ganesh and flowers  Our room   I think was adequately clean and although the furnishings and d cor was a bit dated it was fairly represented on the web site  The  headstand  of the bed looks more dreary in person than it does in photos  There was a nice flat screen tv with the usual lineup of Indian channels news and two movie channels  We were on the third floor overlooking a dismal alley and there was a fair amount of noise that came in the air vents  Traffic noise was heavy and the alley also was busy with the activity of people centered on a street bonfire as well as packs of wild dogs that woke us up howling in the middle of the night  Ear plugs are a must  Not the hotel s fault but something to keep in mind if you are a light sleeper  The bathroom is quite cramped and the water takes a while to heat up but it does heat up eventually  Another thing I found strange was although there was toilet paper the toilet paper bin was kept in the main bedroom  making it almost impossible to do anything but flush your paper  The soap provided by the hotel was quite harsh  The bedding was clean and the floor was clean enough for bare feet which was nice  By the time we got to our room we only had  minutes before the room service menu closed so we made a quick order of veg  indian dishes  The food was ok if not spectacular  We never had the opportunity to try the breakfast as our flights left too early in the morning  Unfortunate because a small snack and coffee would have really helped us get through our travels  The next morning as we were checking out we told the management we d had specific items from the room bar water chips  They tried to charge us for a coffee we hadn t had the bar was stocked with  not  coffees when we checked in but we didn t know it was normally stocked with  coffee until our visit a night later and finally backed down when we insisted we had not had it  an inconsequential matter but made us feel rather unpleasant  We stayed at the same hotel after our trip to Agra and this time were put in a more dreary room without a mini bar  we didn t especially care about the mini bar issue but the room smelled like garbage rm   so we requested to be transferred to our previous room and were accommodated  As we got settled in we were interrupted by the staff several times  returning passports presenting us with a wet bar inventory which we confirmed and initialed a good idea but felt somewhat insulting  as if they still thought we d stolen a can of coffee among other things  We visited the upstairs  restaurant  and found it to be a dark windowless room ently orated with what seemed to be a computer with internet access being used by two other guests  We might have stayed and eaten there but the restaurant host was so cool to us that we didn t feel comfortable and went back to our room to order the same food via  room service  We had also been unclear that while airport pickup service is complimentary in theory if you don t mind waiting for them airport return service is not and in fact costs an additional  rs  to the domestic terminal and a whopping  rs  to the international airport  Our early morning driver to the airport did not speak to us  not a huge deal but again not something that left us with warm feelings about our overall experience  Also note you will be expected to pay the tax for your bill and cab fare to the hotel lobby in cash which meant we ended up at the Delhi airport with  rs  to our name  The one ATM at domestic was out of order and no food stations in the airport accept credit cards so we went without breakfast  I think that the hotel situation in Delhi is generally quite dismal unless you can afford to pay for a very high end hotel there seems to be a huge jump between low middle to very very high end with prices to match and this room wasn t bad  but be because we were checking in fairly late at night and checking out early in the morning  our experience with staff and the hotel left us feeling rather down  A few staff members were unusually cheerful  notably the guy who accompanied the driver to pick us up and someone in charge of finances who solved a charging problem before we even asked him to  but otherwise our experience was tiring and we did not feel terribly welcomed  A ent deal if you are looking for a true mid range hotel and don t care about being picked up from the airport in time  It is also possible that our experience was unusual so you might check other reviews to see if they were met at the airport in a timely fashion  I am sure you could do far worse in Delhi  Our issues were not with the building or facilities as much as issues with logisticsatmosphere and that is easily overlooked especially if you re not overtired from travel  You might consider if you are spending one day in Agra to stay somewhere relatively inexpensive in Delhi a night then go to a quite nice hotel in Agra and then stay one more night in Delhi at your bargain hotel  the nicer hotel we stayed in at Agra Hilton was money very well spent  Note the only guests I saw happened to be other foreign guests which  influence the atmospheremood of the place  
N => Liked it so much we went back This is a friendly clean modern well run place  Off the beaten track in a relatively quiet corner this is India of Karol Bagh its within walking distance of the metro and the Ajmil Kahn Road bazzar  The rooms arent huge but they are clean and well equiped AC fan TV fridge hot water etc  Free Wi fi thoughout the hotel would have been useful if we had a laptop But there is free internet in the restaurant  The food was fine if a little over priced compared to other places we stayed in India  You can certainly stay in cheaper places R   incl  taxes but the overall experience had us revisit the two subsequent times we were passing through Delhi  The pick up from the airport or railway station is recommended as even if you make it to Karol Bagh few rickshaw drivers will know where it is  Just remember to take the phone number for the hotel in case the driver is running late wed left it behind when we first arrived in Delhi and ended up having to stay somewhere else as there was no internet at the international airport  That said they were great the two other times we were picked up  
N => Lovely Stay After reading the positive reviews about it we finally ided to go for this hotel   Sri Nanak turned out to be a amazing hotel  Its a very nicely designed hotel We got more than we expected   The staff was polite  helpful   Its is a highly maintained hotel which is worth the price you pay for  The best part was the free Wi Fi service they provide   The modern TFT T V  were also good  Besides that the food served at the roof top restaurant was very delicious and of high quality   I would recommend travelers not to go in for cheap options available around as you wont feel safe in other hotels   I felt totally safe staying in hotel nanak   We also went to agra by the hotel cab and our journey was perfect   They organized a perfect travel package for us   Altogether i had a perfect stay in delhi   My next holiday i will surely stay with hotel nanak only  
N => Put us in a room without a window We booked the most expensive room at the Sri Nanak and it had no windows and creaky air conditioning  We got another room which was reasonably clean but had a slightly derelict toilet  On checkout they tried to charge for the expensive room  
N => HIghly rate Hotel Sri Nanak This was my first visit to India and I was coming there to first attend a professional conference for my University and then after that to do some sightseeing  So for the first part of my visit I was staying in a  star hotel in Delhi but I wanted to move to less expensive safe clean hotel for the sightseeing portion of my visit  My goal in doing this was to see and experience more of the quotreal Indiaquot I used this web site to locate the Sri Nanak hotel  Everyone spoke glowingly about how the staff was so friendly    and although many compained about the neighborhood a few others said in essence quotwhat are you complaining about    its just India quot Well that as my guidance I booked a room  I am delighted to report that for me it was the perfect ision  I have traveled quite a bit internationally and my main goal was to find a place that was safe and clean    yet would give me access to roam around the less touristed parts of Delhi and get a taste of everyday life  Thats exactly what I found  Yes the streets are noisy     for me thats part of the charm and interest  The people were incredibly friendly in the neighborhood  I needed to have my glasses fixed from an accident a couple of days earlier  The desk staff in the hotel gave me directions and sure enough the opticians at Pujabi Optical not only fixed my glasses but had me stay for tea    and then wouldnt even accept any payment for their services  I was able to visit some intersting shops and a small streetside Hindu shrine    and in each location I experienced great hospitality  The hotel itself is clean and the rooms certainly provide all the amenities I needed  Yes the beds are on the hard side but I like them that way so for me that was not a problem  The free wireless in the rooms was much appreciated and the tv phone and plumbing all worked fine  One more thing about the complimentary airport service  I had arranged to stay at the Sri Nanak for one day then travel via airline to another part of India for a few days and then return to Delhi for another day before returning to the US  So I had arranged for the Sri Nanak to have someone pick me up at the airport  Through a mistake in their scheduling procedure the cab driver was told that I would arrive at  pm when that was actually the time that I was leaving another city in India  When I arrived at  pm that night the driver was still at the airport waiting for me  I was blown away by that level of conscientiousness  Needless to say I was happy to give the driver a large tip My goals and desires  not match those of other travelers but for me the hotel Sri Nanak was the perfect location  If I am ever back in Delhi which I hope to be I definitely plan to make the Sri Nanak my home base  
N => Dirty loud hotel   completely overrated This hotel left everything to be desired  The noise inside and out made it impossible to sleep   as did the hair from the previous guest left on the sheets  The staff was unfriendly and not helpful  I would strongly advise against staying in this hotel  
N => moved after  night very isolated   long walk to train station  taxirickshaws tell you they know where it is but dont  filthy street even by delhis standards  grim breakfast  redeeming feature   flashy showers   if they worked properly 
N => barely expensive It is not a bad hotel if you compare it to other Karol Bagh hotels but unfortunatelly it costs  times what another similar kind of hotel will cost you in new Delhi  
N => Expensive for what you get I booked this hotel based on online reviews  I knew that it was basic and several reviews indicated good service  On arrival it was clear that the rooms were very basic but clean  Staff were pleasant  Internet use was good and free  Rooftop restaurant was extremely average  The location was on a very nosiy busy street in a very run down area of Delhi  Most guests are locals  My airport pickup was OK and free but airport drop off has to be paid for  The cost for a basic room was US and a suite a glorified basic room was US  The term quotsuitequot should be interpreted with caution  All in all basic accomodation with no frills should really be cheaper  
N => Nice by India standard Nice enough place  Nothing great on the outside but rooms were more western then most  I would reccomend it over many other hotels  
N => Think twice before staying here We ided to stay at the Sri Nanak last month after reading all the positive reviews however we were quite disappointed The rooms themselves were ok reasonably clean however the bathroom was well below standard and the door was rotten  No hot water in the afternoons either The front desk appeared helpful but on a number of occasions tried to over charge us for taxis cars etc  They also misled us regarding the excursions to places like Agra I can see how some visitors have found the staff to be overly helpful but a more seasoned traveller will be more savvy and realise when theyre trying to take you for a rideThe most negative thing was that when we left the hotel and arrived in Mumbai we realised that some clothing had been stolen from our suitcase  So if you stay at the Sri Nanak make sure you always leave your suitcases locked even if theres nothing valuable insideWe travelled around India for some time and the Sri Nanak is far below the   stars it claims in comparison to the other hotels we stayed at Finally if you do choose to stay here which I wouldnt do again then book directly with the hotel as the rate is MUCH lower than offered by third party booking websites  
N => Give it a miss We planned to stay at this hotel for three nights however checked out after the first night  The hotel was very noisy the bed sheets reeked of some petroleum products the phone did not work the shower did not have a curtain and the flow projected straight over the toilet and the roof top breakfast area had filthy tablecloths  When we said we were not staying they advised us that we had to pay for  nights as we had not given  hours notice of cancellation of our other  nights  We replied that this was not possible as we did not know that the hotel would be so bad  We were extremely lucky in that as we were discussing this a colleague of my husbands happended to walk into reception a total coincidence as we did not even know they were in Delhi and they had just checked out for the same reasons which gave credibility to our complaints  We left paying for the night we stayed  I do not recommend this hotel  
N => Avoid This Hotel   Its over rated Having read the good reviews on tripadvisor and some other websites i ided to book this hotel  I was dissapointed when i got there  First of all they gave us a room that was not in good condition at all and faced the main road which was noisy  When i complained they then gave us an alternative  If i had not complained they would have left us there   The rooms are not in good condition the duvets and blankets are not clean  The hotel had promised us a welcoming fruit basket which we did not receive  The location of the hotel is not good  The roads are dirty  busy  noisy and polluted  Having travelled around in delhi there are other nicer and claner places to stay  On one day our room was not cleaned we were told that as we had taken the key they did not clean it even though all hotels have master keys  The dining area is located on the rooftop which was nice in the mornings  When we booked taxis from the hotel we later discovered that the hotel was charging a commision for the service  Also  the hotel gave us a poor exchange rate commision when we exchanged currencies  Ignore the good reviews you see for this hotel as non of them are true  I am suspicious as to the source of these  Avoid at any cost  You are better paying a bit more and getting something alot better  I will not be staying here again and nor will i recommend this to anyone  
N => Think carefully before going here This hotel was not what I expected from the reviews  Our family of four had two rooms booked for the nights of    uary  We were met at the airport and transported by two cars we had been promised one large car  Karol Bagh is not the best area to stay in but the hotel staff were courteous  However the rooms did not live up to expectation  Our girls room had the most terrible smell in the room and on all the bed linen and they had to lay some of their clothes on the pillow so as not to breathe in the fumes  We did ask for a change but the alternative was no better  Our room had no fridge the jug didnt work and the shower water just fell all over the floor of the bathroom  No beds had been swept under for some time ided there and then to telephone somewhere else except the phone didnt work not then nor in the morning  Neither did it in the girls room nor the room of some friends we ran into unexpectedly in reception the following morning who were also checking out because of the smell in their room  They had also read the trip advisor reviews and were pretty disillusioned   My husband also didnt sleep because of the noise  We moved to the Jukaso Inn downtown near Connht Place which was around the same price and much more satisfactory  
N => Clean book direct Clean in general  The hot water seemed to be by request and then you needed to wait  minutes  This seemed to be the case in some places across India in mid range hotels but we thought they could do a bit more  The breakfast is very basic and not very tasty  We didnt like the area either as you arent near to anything really  We had to request cleaner towels and toilet paper  It seems hard to find a ent hotel in Delhi  This wasnt bad but book directly as we booked through expedia and paid over the odds  Staff were friendly enough  
N => can only confirm all comments I can only confirm all comments  Good choice for people used to stay in similar hotels  Honest experience Luc Paris 
N => Great place to stay excellent fresh food  
N => Room OK but noisy and location not great  
N => OK but      
N => good hotel  not a great area  
N => V llig in Ordnung  
N => A very good hotel in center of Delhi Me and my husband book this hotel through a website hotels com for  days pick up was free from airport  Hotel people pick up us with kind of grand welcome with flower garland  We were surprised because we have read many bad comments about hotel but we got a very good service they provide us good room and morning we order breakfast it was realy very tasty  I am in Italy now but the taste we cant forget  Till now we have that taste in our mouth  We reccommend this hotel to all the italian who go to India Thanks and reagrds to Hotel Sunrise and staff specialy for kichen staff  
N => No Ventilation in My Room It was a horrifying experience sleeping in a room with no ventilationand no natural light very humid rooms are in this hotel  I could notbreathe properly  I wish that I could have stayed in a hotel with someventilation  I found much better hotel in my onward journey  
N => Good location We stayed at this hotel for a few nights in    The room was very small the airconditioner was much too noisy we had to turn it off  The staff were OK as long as you kept tipping them  They only clean room if asked to  Breakfast was terriable  There is no resturant but the do have room service agian the food was awful    
N => Foul Smell in the Room Why do they have to use the detergent which give a foul smell in therooms  I change my room  times but the rooms were dark and smelly But had to manage the night because it was  o  clock at night and Ishifted to a nearly hotel which was much better  
N => Never Never This Hotel A bunch of touts who are only interested to make extra money  We werecharged heavily for going to Taj Mahal by taxi as they because afterour life at night when we came to the hotel  We could have done thesame thing from another travel agent at one third of the price  
N => This hotel is scamming I had booked two days and went there to cancel the first day of my booking and add two additional days  So I paid but after that they said quotwe dont have any empty rooms but we will do our bestquot  What that was supposed to mean I had to find out later   The first day of my stay they recognized me on the street asking me quotwhat are you doing here we didnt expect youquot  Refering to our agreement and payment they just said quotIn business trust doesnt matter  But of course we have a room for you today but youd need to pay for thatquot pay again what the heck  In the middle of the dispute they asked for my receipt saying quotwe need thatquot  Thinking they just needed it temporary to give me a refund or make a copy or something I handed it to them  But they wouldnt return it to me And that was it still standing on the street and for them the story was over To sum it all up I paid them for THREE days I stayed there ZERO days and left with NO receipts or bills to prove anything or file case against them 
N => Good location good price and great stay We have read some good and bad comments on Trip Advisor about Hotel Sunrise  We booked this hotel for  day to check there services and thought if they provide us good service then we can extend our stay  They pick up us from airport early morning because our flight Finn Air was arrive at Delhi airport very early morning  We had check in  They provide us very good room with window with Balcony  So we ide to stay other  days  Hotel front Manager Ms  Leena was very friendly and always smile and ask us Madam are you satisfied with our services  and we smile too and reply he Lenna we are very happy  Hotel Sunrise is located in good location good price and we have a great stay at Hotel Sunrise  We recommend Hotel Sunrise Thanks Lynda Christine 
N => worst hotel i have ever seen heading the reality of this hotel during my stay in india i booked this hotel hotel owner did not seem to run a hotel business he was rather intersted in booking my agra jaipur trip  i was given a non ventilated shabby room and on complainin he promised to upgrade me only if i book trip with him when i refused for the trip a black tall man with red eyes took me to his travel agency on the corner of the road  i was so scared that owner also started following me  upon reaching there they pressurised and as i was a sole travelller in this alien place i had no option but to accept the tour and pay them the next morning a small little car in bad condition arrived i reluctantly sat in it as i was told that no other option is available as expected the car broke halfway  JESUS i immediately left that place and had to walk around  miles to get another taxi i rushed back to delhi and checked out of this hotel they didnot refund any of my money I felt cheated and i felt as if they are not hoteliers they are a bunch of touts  
N => Dreadful Experince at Sunrise Its a worst ever Hotel I have stayed with  Staff with no professionalism amp every time taxi drivers are sitting at reception in dirty clothes looking for there customers  I was badly scared to check in into this Hotel but had no option in the mid night  whole night staff shuts amp screams  Rats amp lizards are just like room partners staying over there in all rooms When I was not comfortable with the atmosphere I requested to refund my money I paid for but they refused to return my money amp misbehaved with me amp said that I can leave from the Hotel  The owner himself doesnt know the meaning of courtesy I do prefer t sleep on streets rather than staying Over sunrise where Sun can never rise 
N => Ok Hotel  Dont do the tour The hotel was ok for the price  However the tour guide service associated with the hotel was pretty bad  The driver in Delhi was ok  But then when we traveled to Agra from Delhi the driver was horrible  He yelled at us and made the trip horrible  When we got to Agra we called the tour guide head office and asked to get another driver  The new driver couldnt make it until the next day so we had to pay for a new tour in Agra  When we ask the head tour guy for money back he said that he would plan something special for us in Jaipur  Did anything happen No  If I had to do it over again I would have found a different tour group  Otherwise the hotel is ok for the price  
N => Great Stay at Hotel Sunrise We found this hotel on the internet it was new so we thought we would try it  The hotel was well worth the money the rooms are well presented extremely CLEAN and well fitted out with TV bar fridge AC and attached bathrooms  The staff were so friendly and accomodating in our first room the internet signal was a little low so they actually moved us to a room with better signal straight away We couldnt of asked for anymore we will be staying here again when we return to Delhi Thanks Hotel Sunrise 
N => comment on the excellent service of hotel sunrise I Mrs  Naidoo traveled with my Sister to New Delhi booked the hotel sunrise from South Africa  As per our booking everything went as planned  we were picked up from the airport driven start to the hotel on arrival it was the most unexpected welcoming where we was offered drinks and we were garland then we were escorted to our suit  Our room was very beautiful we felt at home room service was excellent  The food was divine  View was good  The most exciting part of our trip was that the management helped us arrange or tour in and around Delhi our car was booked itinerary was set and were ready for our tour   Oh my god it was a tour out of this world  at the end of it all we were driven back to the airport  To conclude I would recommend this hotel to each and every traveler I know who is looking for an unforgettable holiday adventurous tour amp a luxurious stay P S    Many thanks to management and all staff of the hotel sunrise You re sincerelyMRS  Naidoo 
N => Hotel people will beat you up careful I came for business to Delhi  However I am a frequent traveller and saw a good review of this quotso called new hotelquot  So ided to catch up this hotel  But oh God it should not be termed as a hotel  It had RATS in the room  The bed sheets were torn  The Aircondition was not working and there was no water when I went to take a shower  The bathroom had so much of foul smell that I had to pack up my bag and just leave  When I wanted to leave they charged me extra money which was not agreed at the time of check in  They forced me to pay  It was a nighte and I thought the musclemen will come and beat me up if I dont pay I was horrified  
N => AVOID THIS HOTEL I booked  nights at this hotel through expedia the price included pick up from the airport which was important to me as a single female traveller  i received an e mail from the hotel before I left for India confirming pick up however upon arrival at the airport there was no one waiting for me  I contacted the hotel by telephone and was told to get a pre paid taxi and they would pay for it  I did this however taxi driver was unable to find the hotel  It was  oclock in the morning by this time and the area was deserted  We eventually found a travel agent who amazingly was still open  The agent did not know where the hotel was but let me use his phone to contact the hotel  I rang and asked if they could give the taxi driver directions however was informed that the hotel was full and they did not have a room for me  I explained I had booked and paid for my room and that I had spoken with someone earlier and explained the situation about the taxi and that I was a single female traveller  The person just kept saying they were full and then put the phone down on me  The taxi driver was going mad and said he wanted paying  I had no ruppees as I had expected the hotel to pay  The travel agent came to my rescue and I am not sure what I would have done without him   he paid the taxi driver who just got my case out of the car and left me  The agent then contacted the hotel and found out where it was and went to the hotel and sorted a room for me  According to the agent it is common in India for hotels to say they have no rooms to people who have booked as a scam to get more money  I eventually got to the hotel where they showed me  rooms to choose from a plus side is that the room was big  I had to argue with them the next day to get the money back for the taxi  The whole experience was distressing I do not know what would have happened to me if it were not for the kindness of the agent Rauf PS his company is Le Nagooes Tour and Travel Company Karol Bagh email      I think any hotel that would leave anyone in the position I was in should be avoided  
N => New hotel offering excellent value and service in bustling Karol Bagh  Hotel Sunrise opened four months ago and as such seems to be an undiscovered budget gem in the heart of bustling Karol Bagh  I give  stars to service only because some local staff are still learning subtle aspects of room service however lobby management is very professional and was quite receptive to suggestions I offered concerning room service  In addition to running a spotlessly clean hotel the hotel owners offer a wide range of other services in Delhi and around the country these include custom travel packages to suit the wishes and desires of most customers  My wife and I come yearly to India and we will undoubtedly avail ourselves of the services offered at Hotel Sunrise Conference center and a roof top restaurant are under construction as we speak  
N => clean comfortable room hotel manager helpful we stayed here for  nights at a price of INR per room per night inclusive of breakfast and all taxes we later found out that the local travel agencies could have got us a a better deal at INR per room per night inc of taxes and breakfast the room was clean air con was very noisy int the room  seemed secure enough near shops and kets hotel manager was very helpful and looked after me and my friend as it was diwali they advised us not to go out alone as we were likely to hit by fire crackers food was good and prices were cheap in comparison to other places however on check out they tried to charge us an extra INR  saying that charges were not included and even tried to charge us extra for breakfast it wasnt until we called the the hotel manager and said that he had been eitful that they reduced it back to INR  inclusive of all taxes and breakfast would recommend a stay here but please ensure that you have it written down by the hotel exactly what the tariff includes or better still get it a lot cheaper via a local travel agency 
N => damp room loud and not so clean We found Delhi to be a very filthy polluted and loud city and really would have enjoyed an oasis from the chaos but this was not it  like most of india this hotel was dirty the room looked like it needed a good cleaning  we had a large fan in our bathroom that was very loud with scary exposed wiring and the entire room had a moisture problem  the bedding felt damp  the room service menu was crusted with food  the room was very loud with staff banging things outside the door at all hours of the night  again the typical male staff no female employees  the breakfast room was a dark dreary place and again felt very dirty  my first suggestion would be to skip delhi as it is a horrible city we were also warned but did not listen but if you must go book a  star  you are gonna need it  we had lunch at the imperial hotel and it was very nice  
N => Rude reception manager just wants money Regarding the room they were fine i stayed there twice  differents times booked by travel agent  Rooms are clean no windows  However mini bar dont drink the water in there not sealed they just refilled from tap water  on breakfast i saw some insects close to breakfast table not hygenic at all  Regarding the reception they dont speak english main person manager speak english but quite rude try to sell u tour around dehli or ask to exchange currency but bad price  If you can find a other hotel it is better  
N => Extreme Caution Needed We recently returned from India after the riage of our son in Amritsar  On our way to Amritsar we had to stay one noght in Delhi to catch next days flight to Amritsar Our agent had advised us that he had booked this hotel for one night for us  Our flight from Kuala Lampur reached Delhi about  pm and we reached the hotel about   pm to be told that the hotel was full  A quick call to the agent got them all excited and they offerred us a room but we had to sleep on a mattress on the floor We refused then they walked us to a neighbouring quotbranchquot of the hotel  it was dilapidated old building not worthy of being called a hotel  Then they walked us to Sunstar Crown again a few hundred metres away  By then our Agent came in and we asked to be taken to another hotel We had a long flight from New Zealand  would never recommend anyone to book this place  it is NOT a hotel  pictures on the website are misleading  
N => Failed to honor booking Having booked and prepaid for the Sunstar Grand with an online booking service we confirmed the booking and arranged airport pickup with the hotel directly  On arrival in India our first dissapointment was no airport pickup  On arrival at the hotel at  AM we suffered our next dissapontment when the staff indicated the hotel was full already with was no place for us we found a substitute hotel with the help of our cab driver   Subsequent attempts to resolve the issue for refund of money were met with attempts to blame the incident on us for leaving the hotel when requested but not being able to be contacted when they found their mistake  
N => be careful we found this hotel from a tourist stand in the airport  it looked okay from the pictures and after a not so great stay in amritsar we ided to pay for a ent hotel hotel itself is good rooms okay if a little small but hot water and a ent bathroom made up for it  restaurant was good and on the rooftop so was nice to sit up there away from all the hustle and bustle however we were told how much the room would be when we checked in but on checking out the price had gone up as they hadnt told us the tax we wanted to arrange a trip to agra and the receptionist called a man who said he could help us  we were promptly whisked away to a shop where we given some prices and basically told if we didnt book now that either the train or the drivers might not be available  the bloke also told us that he was approved by the tourist board   NOT the case  we were totally ripped off but as we were only there days we wanted to make sure we got transport to agra and as it was night time that we were sorting this out didnt have chance to compare any other prices   the following day we found out that it wasnt an approved tourist shop so be very careful if you stay at this hotel also check before you use the internet at this hotel as there are no signs to warn you of any charge so you could be asked for any amount of money when you logoffhotel accomodation overall was okay it was a shame the staff werent as helpful as they couldve been  
N => Okay for a few days We stayed at the Sunstar Grand in early ch of  while sightseeing in Delhi  We are non resident Indians so we are aware of the realities of hotels in India  It was in a quiet part of the city and generally was safe  The staff was a little sluggish and seemed very eager to earn some tips but one has to expect this when dealing with a non luxury hotel in India especially in a major city  Overall the room was clean but the bed linens were a bit worn  We had a room with a bathtub note note all bathrooms do but water leaked onto the floor if you used it  Also it was very dark in the rooms because there were not really proper windows and there were exhaust vents and a single air conditioner unit attached to the quotwindowquot  There was also a noisy pigeon hanging out on our AC  But I have to say it wasnt bad  we paid about  a night and in a city like Delhi you have to be realistic  It was sufficient enough for us as we were out most of the day sightseeing  Lets face it we dont go to Delhi to stay in a hotelresort all day  we go to see the amazing sights  note Agra on the other hand had a GREAT hotel  Hotel Howard Plaza  
N => ok at a pinch but not out of choice small roomsOurs on ground floor had no windowsour friends on rd floor smelled of disinfectant  but they were adequate Breakfast was the worst we had in india  boiled egges moldy toast non descript jam Sunny delight as juice that it  ah yes weak instant coffee  It would be better if the hotel went RO Restaurant staff were worthless   or  staff couldnt get a table cleared for us at breakffast and the hotel wasnt full  this also happened to our friends on the second morning so we ended clearing tables ourselves Front desk staff were slightly pushy and appeared often whenever a tip seemed extractable  Otherwise they kept away of all hotels we used in india   this time this was d worst It will do if you need spend a night but better look elsewhere  
N =>  No lo elijas  
N => Watch out for the extra costs This hotel has lovely clean sheets and a lift and a fridge in the room  However everything else was a bit of a let down   Watch out for the extra costs  The room charge was for bed and breakfast  but when checking out the manager was going to charge for breakfast  When using email I was asked to write my name amp sign the form nothing was written on the form and I used the email for about half an hour when finished the charge was for  hours because my start time had been written wrongly on the form  Watch the menu prices as the charge is not always what the menu says some of our meals were charged at twice the amount than was written on the menu check check check everything  The restaraunt was awful as was the food  I wouldnt recommend this hotel because we had to keep checking all the costs and continued to find prices were always wrong  
N => Very disappointing Were not too fussy but turning up at the Sunstar Heritage after a longhaul flight at am to find no sheets on the bed  smoky smelly towel opened bottles of water and no hot water and the loudest air conditioning in the world that only did  temperature which was a polar blast   is not my idea of a hotel  We asked the manager for fresh towels the next day that never turned up and the following night we did have sheets but we were better off in our own sleep sheets  Would not recommend this hotel unless they make some changes  
N => Dont stay here Dont stay here  eerie place  Originally I was supposed to stay at the owners other property Incredible Home Stay which gets pretty good reviews but was placed here instead  The service is abysmal as in I cant believe these people are actually in the hospitality business although the rooms were pretty clean  Sheets were cleanly pressed but lightly stained if you scrutinize and as Im a bit of a germiphobe I look closely  Bathrooms were okay I stayed in rooms  and   What was most frustrating is that their designated taxi drivers totally rip you off  FAR better to just catch an auto rickshaw on the street outside but if youre traveling alone as I was female this can be a very very intimidating prospect at  am when you need to catch a  am train to Agra  Also be sure to negotiate with them on price  They charged me  rupees no tax for one night but then tried to charge me luxury tax on the second night    Do NOT eat at the restaurant  awful food and filthy kitchen  and be aware that there was a bombing in the Karol Bagh ket nearby just a few weeks ago    
N => Not a pleasant experience   Not very professional  Unless good bargain is done you will lose  No direct booking facility  Even if you try to contact hotel directly the hotel youll end up in contacting a travel agent who works as a contact point on many nearby hotels   Try to avoid these broker middleman to save money 
N => ok if you just need a place to sleep rooms were clean not a great area of town far from the center rooms are clean and beds are ok breakfast is a disgrace and service rivals that acceptable if you just need a clean place to sleep  
N => Not too bad  Good location for Metro Stayed here as it was a better location than some of the others  I have to agree it was noisy but this was due to other guests and not traffic  We had a room at the back on the th floor   Its perfectly acceptable but we did find our room unlocked on return so make sure you lock away your valuables or use the lockers in the managers office  If you leave the hotel and turn left at the front walk up the slight hill to the main road turn left and then right in  to  mins your at the Metro station Rajendra Place  The hotel business card has a small map on the back so its easy to find  Its a normal hassled walk but getting to connht place is easy until late  The last train times are posted on the ticket booths  If you fancy coming back via tuk tuk use the pre pay booth in connht place Overall due to its locality to the Metro and the ease of getting to and from the city Im recommending this hotel  The rooms were OK and clean  The shower was good and the bathroom was acceptable  AC worked  What more could i ask for  Price was  rup around   for  nights  Sorry but no photos i forgot  
N => Clean rooms horrible staff no windows noisy The hotel seemed really ok at first glance the room was clean but    The receptionist holds me back saying quotmy travel agentquot would be here in  minutes and wanted to see me about my stay in the hotel  Well I had no travel agent I booked the hotel through Internet So the guy who shows up tells me that he would be the final agent in the chain of companies through which my booking went  And of course tries to propose me excursions additionnal services etc    SCAM After a few minutes he felt my mood about his presence and excused himself I ask for a taxi at the reception not sure if it was safe to hail one in the street at night  Of course no problem  Well it was only three times the normal price which I would not care so much as it was a proper comfortable car but it was not a taxi at all just any private car be the hotels car that they rent out  Guess doing taxi services without taxi license is also in India not exacly legal    Back in my room I realise that the window is actually not a window but a window into a kind of ventilation shaft  The fan that would blow the air into that shaft so no fresh air nto the room    was so horribly loud that there was no way to leave it on at night As an advantage from the airshaft you hear your neighbours as if they were in your roomWhy some furniture had to be moved between midnight and  in the morning was a question the reception seemed unable to answer  
N => Stay If You Want To Be Ripped Off I stayed at this hotel in ch   I was quoted a price for an executive suite as they said this was all they had available  It was downstairs  At first I thought it was ok as seemed clean but the noise was awful as it was on the ground floor  The only thing was the noise was from the staff playing loud music and shouting to each other all night even when I asked them to be quiet  We asked if we could move rooms and they said we could move to a room upstairs but it would be more money   which I could not understand as they were smaller rooms  When we asked if we could move later to a cheaper room they said they were fully booked  I called the hotel later that day by phone and asked if they had rooms and how much they were   they quoted me  rupees less than the price I paid and said they were available  When I went back to the hotel they tried to charge me more and on checking out were shouting abuse and all sorts  I would never stay at this hotel ever again and advise anyone NOT TO STAY HERE  We are Non resident Indians and they were looking to rip us off so I can only imagine what they do to tourists 
N => ent stay booked the hotel online via expedia after reading tripadvisor reviews process was quite simple and painless  was able to confirm via email which was nice since i was in nepal right before and their website was quite comprehensive  taxi driver tried to drop me off at swati deluxe and wouldnt go anywhere when i told him i was at the wrong hotel until the kind doorman at the deluxe was able to inform him otherwise  when i finally arrived they quickly greeted me with a smile and shuttled me to my room  the room itself was quite small but with ent or  requested a king bed but instead got two tiny twins  aircon was right over both of the beds like  feet next to one which made it impossible to actually use while in either bed  room was right next to elevator and apparently the kitchen as all i heard all night was the ruckus of the elevator and the kitchen staff washing dishes and chatting all night which was extremely irritating  staff was fairly friendly  bathroom was small water pressure was okay and water was warm not hot  overall a fairly standard nothing spectacular  i did not get my room made up between my first and second night  an okay place to stay if your taxi driver can find it  
N => you get what you pay for Having just come back from there  days ago i felt i had to offer some comments Its cheap and you get what you pay for the rate we paid got us a room with beds and clean sheets  Beds were uncomfortable because the matress was on a wooden base  Not clearly advertised as such  The shower for the room rate we were paying was not a shower rather fill a bucket up and sponge bath yourself but the water is hot so i guess that compensates Its in an amazing location and when my travel companion was sick the hotel was quick to point us to a good hospital so points to them for that HoweverWe hired a driver from the hotel to take us to the taj mahal he picked up a guide who was pushy and then proceeded to do a very subtle tourist trap routine i e take us to shops where then guide and the driver get there cut  Very slick operation and very subtle  The comment when i complained on getting back to delhi was quotThe hotel does not use a guidequot hmm sorry but the fact that we booked the tour through the hotel means that they do  Also be aware that the price for the tour is higher than if you booked through a non hotel tourist place  You will not be able to put the tour on your hotel bill you must pay cash  Obviously everyone gets there commission My other strong criticism is we booked to go to the national museum paying for a driver etc but the driver had to stop twice to ask where the museum was and then when we asked to go to a Pizza Hut for lunch he had to stop and ask where that was as well driving past one before finally stopping at one  If I am paying for a driver i think its fair to give people drivers who have some knowledge of their own city  That was quite dissapointing The custom of everyone expecting tips at the hotel was also dissapointing  Whilst i understand its part of the culture be aware that some of the hotel staff will not leave your room until you give them a tip ie its mandatory  I was always under the impression that tipping is for good pleasant serviceIn sumy a cheap clean hotel that with a few simple changes could be so much better I think  Its great if you are only there for one or two nights but when staying for a week as I and my companion were it will start to grate on you I love what i found in India and will be back one day but not to the hotel swati  
N => Serviceable hotel in Karol Bagh This review is a year old but I have a few tips that might be useful for Hotel Swati patrons First    there are two Hotel Swatis  Keep this in mind when the cab driver asks where you want to go  There is quotHotel Swatiquot where we stayed and the subject of this review which has the following addressHotel Swati A   W E A  Karol BaghOpp  Roopak Stores Ajmal Khan RoadNew Delhi     India website httpwww hotelswati comswati htmNote the term quotOpp  Roopak Storesquot means the hotel is kitty corner diagonally opposite from a store called Roopak  This is part of the address because the street the hotel is on has no name  The hotel does NOT face Ajmal Khan road Then there is the quotHotel Swati DeluxequotHotel Swati Deluxe   A   Gurudwara Road  W E A  Karol Bagh  New Delhi    India website httpwww hotelswati comswatideluxe htmBoth are owned and run by the same company so be sure you know which one youre going to  Our cab driver took us to the wrong one first Anyway   our stay here was adequate  I did not choose the hotel and now that Ive read about other New Delhi hotels on TripAdvisor I wish I could have chosen something else  We had no major problems just a few fustrations here and there When we first arrived the man at the front desk was a little strange  We asked him if he spoke English  quotNoquot he said  So my husband began speaking to him in Hindi  Suddenly the guy remembered his English  It was odd  He asked to make copies of our passports  This creeped us out but we complied  I dont know if this is standard procedure  If anyone else has had the same experience Id like to know about it Our room faced the street and it was very very noisy  I guess this is to be exected in a busy city like New Delhi and  be true of nearly all hotels there  Do bring some earplugs  The horn honking begins at  or  in the morning  After a while you can ignore it  Our beds were narrow twin beds with thin mattresses  The bathroom had a western style toilet that took toilet paper  Note If you are a toilet paper user    go easy on it while in India  That said you  want to bring some extra for yourself  If you run out of the small roll provided by the hotel youll have to wait a whole day before its replenished There is a very good restaurant attached to the hotel but it is actually next door   not within the hotel itself  It doesnt open for dinner until pm  On our first night we got there just as they opened and were a little worried about how empty it was    until  minutes later when it was full to the rafters  Seems like a very popular place with savy tourists  The meals are all thali style with no sharing  But delicious We also had breakfast there each morning and it was fine  It was a buffet and not bad at all there is even a toaster  The staff can be indifferent if you have a special request the manager was more interested in playing solitare on his laptop than answering a question I had but just let it go On our second day we took a hired car to Agra to see the Taj Mahal which was arranged through the hotel  The driver was supposed to be English speaking   but wasnt  Oh well  Still got us to the Taj and back in one piece  Be aware that it is a  hour drive and you will be picked up at am  Its a loooong day When we got back from Agra all we wanted to do was order room service and crash in our beds but when we entered the room the lights wouldnt work  Our room had no electricity even though the rest of the hotel did  What the heck Turns out you have to place the metal key ring in a special holder just inside your room door before the electricity will work  Clever  But it would have been nice if they had told us this when we arrived The neighborhood is crowded but interesting  We didnt feel unsafe once we walked around a bit  I have a video I took of the street that Ill try to upload or link to here if I can What else    Oh there is a great metro in Delhi There is a station within walking distance of the hotel  Ask at the front desk re the Metro  That was something they were quite helpful about Thats all I can remember  Hope this was helpful 
N => What a relief Having come from Mumbai via Goa we had already had great difficulty finding ent accomadation for a reasonable price  However we were so relieved to arrive at the Hotel Swati and find it was a clean comfortable hotel with good facilities Our room was the standard room for rps a night  It was spacious with cable tv fridge aircon in room safe and comfy beds and pillows  We also discovered that there was free wi fi internet to all the rooms which really helped us plan the next part of our trip  The restaurant serves excellent veg  Thalis and breakfast is included in the price  There is also hr room service We found the staff to be friendly and helpful but not overbearing like in some places  Like everyone in India they appreciated a tip but did not hound you to hand over money Karol Bagh is a busy noisy area but we quite enjoyed the amazing ket street stalls and shops  The hotel was a little noisy but there doesnt seem to be a Delhi hotel that isnt and when I rang reception to complain about the noise from the next room they took action immediately and the noise stopped All in all I would definately reccomend this hotel for its security and comfort at an excellent price  
N => Great Hotel This is a great hotel tucked away in Karol Bagh  Shops Pizza Hut Macdonalds etc are a few minutes walk away from hotel Room good size we had the suite which was larger than mostHot water on tap rare for IndiaGood roomlaundry serviceExecllent restuarant with regional vegetarian thalis we loved the unlimited Gujarti thali   Rs NB if you dont order a thali but a snack item eg french fries   these are unlimited as wellBreakfast   Good buffet choice the freshly made theplas are a mustReliable airport pick updrop off available   just phone in advance   we know and it works Recommended 
N => Very ent Hotel and Helpfull Staff I had a good stay here  Of course I got upgraded to a suite and hence could not experience the regular rooms but the place was quite ent As I remember my bill also came about  lesser than my last stay in Delhi  I will stay in this place for my future travel as long as they extend the same facilities   discounts etc ThanksHemanthemail subramanya ma tycoelectronics com 
N => Good location but poor service The hotel was well located near restaurants and shopping  When we checked into the hotel at  someone was in the room that they gave us  They then cleaned the room while we waited but they didnt even change the sheets  The room was quite dirty with hairs all in the rumpled sheets and trash still in the trash can  Also we felt like the staff were not very helpful when we raised our concerns that the room not being clean and waited around waiting on bakeesh even after just cleaning the room  
N =>  not well maintained  It s a new hotel but not was built amp maintained  Furniture is good rooms are small sized bathroom tiles are dirty and WC back is also dirty  Ok hotel but needs thorough cleaning and funigation  
N =>  DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH  The path leading up to Hotel Tara Palace looked shady I was totally doubting this place but since it was late at night I thought its better to have a room to stay in as opposed to looking for one in the dead of night  This st ision proved to be one of many during my trip  Another st ision was consulting the in house travel agent   Rameez who tailor made a tour for me  One of the places he sent me to was the controversial un safe for tourists  KASHMIR   It turned out to be a st ision  Kashmir reminded me of the valleys I had seen during my travel through Europe  Its fresh mountain air green open spaces and abundance of water was a great find  Overall this trip was full of st isions 
N => Fantastic stay at the Tara Palace Our experience of this hotel started at the airport  The driver was there to welcome us he was friendly and informative  The front desk staff were outstanding they were friendly helpful and nothing was too much trouble  All our special requests had been arranged prior to arrival  The rooms were very clean and well appointed and security was very high on their list of priorities  The  hr restaurant and room service was a definite plus point for this property the waiting staff were efficient and friendly  All in all a well run hotel k Walker   Goa 
N => Great Hotel to Begin an Indian Journey This hotel was our first stop in India on a month backpacking trip sure there are cheaper hostels but it was nice to have the pick up from the airport and the security of knowing someone was waiting for us when our flight arrived at night and we were late out of the airport because they lost our luggage Everyone in the hotel was helpful and we could literally order great food at any hour of the day and the food was delicious the men at the front desk were very helpful  gave us internet for free gave us directions places on our second day there we met a man named Rameez that if I can remember works for adventure travel company his office is attached to the hotel Rameez sat down with us and we figured out exactly where we wanted to go for the month and together we ided what kind of class of hotels we were willing to stay in we booked ALL our train tickets which he had available for us the next day He then organized a cab to drive us for the next  days of our journey to Agra then on to the Rajasthan province He was very helpful funny and excellent with English he will listen to what you wish to do and honestly gives you a ent rate throughout our whole trip if there were any issues with our booked hostels or tickets including flights we could contact him at any time he really helped us two girl travelers out ALOT Sooo many positives only negative  make sure you get the hotels you want ie  if you want to stay in the shopping area or if you want to stay away from other tourists or if you want to go where all the other backpackers are BE CLEAR Also if there is an area you want to tour and do on your own and pick your own hostel for the night be sure to let Rameez know and he will plan around any schedule you give him Overall like I said a great place to start the trip and with helpful workers and their travel office to arrange your trip you should have no problems We didnt and have deeply appreciated the help this company has given us 
N => Good value for money Hotel Tara Palace website www tarapalacedelhi comMe and my wife stayed three nights at Tara Palace on two erate occasions in y  as part of a sightseeing trip golden triangle Following is a list of pros and cons as well as general notes on the hotel and its serviceThe Pros  If you want to be in Old Delhi or near the Red Fort the location is good  Cheapest hotel in its class that I could find  Very neat and tidy rooms with good airconditioning  Away from busy streets See notes below though  Check in  out fairly easy  No hidden costs credit cards accepted   As per their website no extra taxes were added later on   Free airport pick up  Complimentary breakfast Not great but acceptable  Room service menu at very cheap prices   minutes complimentary internet usage downstairs  Elevator to all floorsThe Cons  If youve never been to India or a third world country the location might not be suitable for you  No leeway with pick up  drop off see notes  Travel agent slightly pushy but probably just doing his jobNotes Please note that most budget hotels in Delhi will have some or all of these issues  Hot water only available one of the three days it was  deg C outside thoughwater pressure in shower acceptable though   Try not to stay on the third floor  The kitchen and restaurant are here and there is a lot of noise echoing through the corridors till the early hours of the morning   NIght staff can be quite unfriendly compared to the day staff  They are willing to do a free pickup from the airport km away but not from New Delhi Train Station km away  They refused to change the complimentary pick up that we did not get into a complimentary drop off at the airport Rs extra   Late check out will cost half the daily room rate Check out is They will kepp your bags though if you want to collect them later   The photos of the rooms on their website are quite accurate   Very little soapshampoo are provided bring your own  Toilet paper is limited but they will bring more if you askTravel agentAll hotels in Delhi has their own travel desk   they will all try to sell you the world BEWARE  The travel agent tried his best to get us to cancel our prepaid train tickets to Agra and Jaipur and suggested we hire a car with a driver from him  He said the train to Agra takes more than three hours  It actually takes exactly  hours as advertised  He said a car will only take  hours actually its closer to  hours sometimes more  He tried to get us to cancel hotel reservations and use his reccomendations JUST SAY NO THANKYOU  We paid Rs for an AC car and driver for a full day of sightseeing  It is difficult to organise this by yourself and the agent knows this   however this price can be negociated  Also insist that if you hire a driver an airportstation drop off is included You will still have to tip the driver as he doesnt see any of the money you pay to the agent SumyPleasant stay in general with minor annoyances  If you can get past the location of this hotel or even if you want to stay in Old Delhi it is great value for the money General Tips for this area  There is a Metro train station m from the hotel  It can be tricky to find yourself ask the locals otherwise min by auto rickshaw appr  Rs  you have to haggle  No matter what they tell you the Red Fort is only m on foot  Jama Masjid is m away  Get a map from the travel desk  Pre paid auto rickshaw from NDLS to hotel is Rs  From hotel to NDLS you will have to haggle VERY hard for this price  The hotel will not go lower than Rs to call a taxi for you   There are very little taxisauto rickshaws right outside the hotel youll find most on Chandni Chook   It is expected that you tip everyone Doorman security guard tip them when you check out the two people that cary your one suitcase to AND from your room waiters etc  Always carry Rs notes with you they are handy for tipping   For Google Earth users here is the location of the hotel   quotN   quotE 
N => Hidden Gem  My wife amp I booked a flight to Delhi from Kolkata with a  day stopover on the way to Mumbai with the express intent to see the Taj Mahal in Agra  At first a contact in Delhi recommended us another moderately priced hotel near the airport where we stayed for  nights  Being from America and not used to the water we succumbed to diarrhea at that hotel so we were anxious to move to a cleaner hotel for the rest of our  night stay even if it meant paying more  Unfortunately when we read reviews of even hotels priced  to  times higher but we found inconsistencies in reader satisfaction versus the star ratings and the hotels price  So we ided to focus on reader reviews for cleanliness as one of the prime criterion for our hotel selection in addition to price  We found that Hotel Tara Palace had high ks from most readers on this score  and  it was reasonably priced The con that most of these readers had to say was that it was hard to find as it was down a narrow alley way in the old part of town  We therefore ensured that we had the hotel manager talk to the taxi driver on our mobile phone we got a pre paid Airtel phone as soon as we could in India and have his person meet the taxi at the entrance to the lane where the hotel was  Aside from this and the fact that the hotel is about an hour or more depending on traffic away from the airport we were thoroughly pleased with the hotel including its cleanliness its food and amenities etc  It must be said that we picked the most expensive room Rs   per night double occupancy on the top rd floor of the hotel with a window view of the old city by passing the lower priced ones entirely as we needed to rest and recover from our quottummy problemquot and the overpowering heat at this time of the year  The monsoons were delayed this year  The desk staff booked us an airconditioned private taxi to take us to Agra and back a full day trip to see the Taj Mahal and definitely worth it  The train or AC bus would have been cheaper but you are at the mercy of their schedule and availability of reservations which at a moments notice can be hard else we were open to that option but couldnt avail of that mode of transport  We found the room to be spacious the bedsheets and towels and the bathroom to be clean and bright with enough lights and of course a remote controlled AC we had to put in a new set of batteries and a ceiling fan  There was no bathtub but the bathroom was clean with a hot shower hot water upon request  Although the normal cold water was comfortable enough for a shower as the outside day temp  was up to  deg  C  The floors were of inlaid ble and the entrance door to the rooms were of inlaid quetry wood  Really gorgeousRoom food service was   The food was good  We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would recommend it to most foreigners traveling on a budget A  B  
N => Incredible India I managed to find Tara Palace after a lot of wrong turns But it was totally worth it The alley leading up to the hotel is totally sketchy but once you walk it a few times its fine My room was pretty basic and the overall service was ent  One thing i need to commend was the brilliant advice and help i received in planning and working out the details of the rest of my time in India Tara Palace had whetted my appetite and laid the bar for the facilities i wanted to stay in the service i expected and the price i wanted to pay  At the in house travel desk a guy named Rameez Badyari greatly helped me out  He helped me to efficiently plan the rest of my trip in India by presenting me with many options that suited me and my needs I am satisfied and will be coming back to Tara Palace 
N => The best place to feel being in real India with the necessary comfort I warmly recommend the place to people who want to be in Old Delhi with security and comfort  It isnt luxurious but very comfortable good beds hot water internet good services guardrobe with your own key     You feel at home all the staff is very friendly and the manager keeps to his word  We were supposed to stay  days and felt so much at ease that we remained till the end of our stay in Delhi  
N => All Around Good Experience   A rarity in India This was my first trip to India and was feeling a tad overwhelmed by the population by the heat by the traffic by my feelings of being so utterly different from everyone  I booked by hotel reservation well in advance but was told by my taxi driver that he quotdidnt know where Hotel Tara Palace wasquot despite my having a good address  Finally after asking several people for directions I found it   It turned out to be this very peaceful oasis of friendly faces that went out of their way to be helpful and reassuring  In particular I want to say a HUGE thanks to Rameez Badyari a polite and knowledgeable young man who manned their travel desk  I had several places I especially wanted to visit and he helped me to logically organize my trip so that I could manage to see everyplace in a relatively short time  He booked my train tickets and hotels and suggested some off the beaten track places he thought I would enjoy seeing  I heartily recommend staying at Tara Palace and by all means talk to Rameez  
N => Hotel Tara Palace Review This hotel was out of the way in Old Delhi  I will admit to being a little bit sceptical at first when the taxi driver drove to this place and pointed down a dark alley to the entrance  Even though the location wasnt fantastic the service was quite good  A couple of the guys spoke ent english and communication wasnt too much of a problem  Being an Aussie I asked for a couple of beers at  pm when I arrived and they supplied them no problem  The continental breakfast was adequate but the resteraunt serves vegetarian only The first morning talked to a young bloke called Rameez who organized tours around the city and to Agra   hour drive awayOverall a ent economical hotel  Dont expect much nightlife around  But it is good as a base to see the cities landks 
N => You could do worse The Hotel Tara Palace was a ent cheap hotel right in the heart of old Delhi and very close to the Red Fort and Jama Masjid  This was the first place we stayed in India and the surrounding area was a great crash course in Indian mess and chaos The airport transfer we booked through the hotel was slow it took about  hours before we even left the airport we have no idea what the guy was doing and overpriced  Next time wed definitely skip it and taxiauto rickshaw  Once we arrived at the hotel the driver even had the nerve to ask for a tipThe room itself was clean and quite nice although quite light and noisy at night The staff at the desk were friendly enough but very pushy and reminded us of used car salesmen  Every time we talked to them we felt as though we were being hustled in some way Breakfast was average  
N => Okay Hotel The staff at the hotel were very nice and willing to help us plan our trip and get us taxis  The room was clean and quiet and the room service was ent  The air condtioner didnt work and the glass in our bathroom window was shattered as well as some missing glass shards missing which made us nervous about mosquitos  As far as location goes it is walking distance to the red fort and transportation is easy in Delhi  I would not stay here if I was not traveling with a man based on its location in old delhi  We were told the area near coughnant place was a bit safer  Make sure you email and call your flight info to the hotel if you want to get the shuttle service  Looking back on our trip it would have been worth it to pay more and get a nicer hotel to escape to after seeing Delhi  The place was pretty cheap so I guess we got what we paid for  
N => A little better than average My weeklong stay at the Tara Palace was just alright  It also could be that I just didnt like Delhi in general and that jaded me toward the Tara Palace but there were several things I didnt like about the hotel  But let me start with what I did like Airport pickup was great  No problems here  A little more expensive than a prepaid but you cant really complain about that  Hotel was clean  Rooms were made every day and soapshampoo was replaced most days  A good location  Near the Red Fort and Chawni Chowk metro  Some dont like the location in the middle of the dirty old city but I didnt really mind  Free breakfast Its a nice breakfast too What I didnt like They seriously dont know how to make a bed  Someone needs to teach them  The sheet only covered my midsection and the blanket covered my feet  It was weird  I always got the feeling they were trying to sell me things  Packages and such  Every I was asked where I was going  You could chalk this up to friendliness but it seemed to have ulterior motives  The guy who works the desk at night is a jerk  Not helpful at all and almost misleading  The first night I was there he told me I owed  rupees for using the computer for one hour  No where in Delhi charges more than  rupees an hour for the internet and he was clearly going to pocket the money I gave him  I didnt give him anything and told him to bill it to my room  I talked to other travelers in the hotel and they had similar negative experiences with him also All in all the stay was just ok  I liked a lot of things about the hotel but didnt like some other things  I think that puts it about neutral right 
N => good hotel but location so so Clean hotel good service depending with who youre talking but in a sketchy location  If its your first stay in Delhi youll be surprised  Not too safe during the night if you wanna go out  
N => Warm and friendly Tara Tara Palace was our first hotel in India and it was with some trepidation that we got off our coach in Old Delhi  The facade was not impressive   far from it but the warmth began as soon as we walked in the door The accommodation was clean and the staff could not have been more helpful  The small but friendly eating area was always open and it was a treat to wander in for our tea and toast early in the morning  Hot water was a bit dodgy at times but staff were always willing to help us when we got into trouble Drinks on the roof was also a treat  All in all a really good quality three star hotel  
N => Dont go here on first night in India This hotel was clean however the experience of this hotel due to its location and the hotel staff was awful  This area of old delhi is massively crowded with men who stared with contemptuous disdain or who agressively hassled us for customtours you name it  If this is your first night in India after a long flight Id recommend you stay in Connht place or central Delhi  Certainly wouldnt recommend this hotel or area to a lone female   the amount of hassle and contempt you receive is not worth it and the area could well be dangerous at night  The hotel staff directed all comments to my male companion even when I asked questions the lobby was continually filled with around  men who sat about and gawked at my chest  Been to India several times before with no problems was dressed conservatively never had this sort of intimidation in a hotel  The hotel manager woke us up with a phone call at am on our first and last morning there demanding to know our plans for the day then when we went out followed us down the street agressively hawking various toursdeals  Later he told me he had to photograph me and got out a computer camera   when I asked why he became very agressive and threatening and only backed down when my partner intervened  No other hotel during our stay in India requsted a photo of either of us  When we ordered room service there were four visits to our room   one to deliver the food one to take the plates away one to get the money and another for the change and to get a tip  Annoying This hotel would probably be bearable after a few weeks acclimatising and developing a thick skin but if youre going for a couple of weeks holiday Id advise you to pick somewhere out of old delhi and certainly not tara palace  
N => Live upto the expectations I stayed there in  for a about  days after my riage and before my Honeymoon in Goa  The stay was very comfortable and most amazing part was where Hotel allowed my uncle to dress entire room with flowers something which management was little reluctant earlier Room was clean and room service prompt  The size of room was quite good and bathroom was very clean and spacious too  
N => NOTHING TO SHOUT ABOUT over priced   US twin room with an extra bed   US  for a twin room staff are friendly  breakfast is not bad  ent food both western and local hotel is old  wifi is okay costly INR  per hour overall i owuld be happier if i paid US  for the room the tray charge came as a surprise  
N => Felt myself like a Princess  Hello I traveled to India with my fianc  in il   To say I liked it is to say nothing  be the part of my excitement was the fact that I finally made it to the country of my dreams  The Vikram Hotel is in  min drive to the Lotus Temple  What I really liked is that there was a Travel Agent working at the hotel who helped us to arrange our trip to Agra and all the sightseeing tours just Hotel taxi driver no English speaking guide around Delhi  He also booked our airline tickets to Kochi Kerala  Just for your information know that there are two airports in Delhi   for Domestic flights and for international flights  These two are located in  min drive apart from each other  Hotel personnel was polite and friendly rooms were surprisingly clean  Was impressed with Restaurant food and service  Kingfisher beer is the best  Of course there are many other hotels in Delhi you can choose from  But for me Vikram was the best place during our stay in Delhi  No doubt I will choose it again if we will ever travel to Delhi again  
N => Average property   The staff was quick with check in but the floor lobbies amp rooms had old carpet which smelled stale and bad  Plenty of hot running water which leaked through the standup shower door onto the entire bathroom floor but bed mattresses were old amp lumpy  The bathroom vent was woefully covered with plastic from the outside  The restaurant was orated well which made it pleasing to the eye  The food on the a la carte menu was one of the hotel s stronger points  Wouldnt recommend or stay here again 
N => Expensive We stayed in a superior room between  ch and  ch   The room was spacious and stylishly furnished  Room service food was good and was also reasonably priced  The only problem though was that the front desk staff was very unfriendly and very unhelpful  In addition the location is not ideal  It is about a min drive by tuk tuk to Connht Place and the main shopping and tourist areas  Overall the hotel was ok but we felt that it was not value for money and would probably not stay at this hotel in the future  
N => Value for Money I had a comfortable stay at the Vikram Delhi  Hotel is situated in Lajpat Nagar just off the Ring Road which is the main arterial road of Delhi making it easier to travel around  Although the immediate surroundings doesnt have much to offer The lobby is bit on the smaller side but adequate seating is available for its size  Check in was fast but not very friendly Room was adequate in size for a hotel in this class  Bed was comfortable and TV had most of the cable channels  Bathroom was good  The window didnt offer much of a view Breakfast was good and plentiful  Breakfast area was pretty neat and it also had a large Plasma display  Service was okay Overall a good experience though the hotel is more of  star class rather than  star as it claims to be  
N => So so hotel My wife and I stayed at the Vikram hotel twice during il   It is described as a  star hotel but is no better than a very average  star hotel  The rooms were O K  television air conditioning etc but hot water was temperamental and twice I had to take a cold shower  Buffet breakfast was rather bland and the options limited  Hotel bar was small and pokey but the drinks and snacks were well priced  Check in was efficient but not very friendly  On the plus side the hotel was clean and safe and was conveniently located close to the Locus Temple Qutb Minar and the South Extension kets  Overall not a bad place to stay as long as you are not paying  star rates 
N => OK Room was clean and comfortable enough but bathroom window had no screen and was covered by some sort of tarp from the outside Neighborhood is not nice not a place to be walking around  Service was adequate  Even though proximity to major tourist sites is good on the map it took a long time to get to anything  
N => Go somewhere else  Although rated as  star in India this was definitely not a  star hotel  The staff was quick with check in but the floor lobbies amp rooms had old carpet which smelled stale and bad  Plenty of hot running water which leaked through the standup shower door onto the entire bathroom floor but bed mattresses were old amp lumpy  Wouldnt recommend or stay here again  
N => Nettes Hotel sehr guter Service im Restaurant     
N => The WRONG hotel welcome palace My buddy and I were working in Indonesia and ided to take a weekend trip to see the Taj  He began researching places to stay and came upon one online that looked great hotelwelcomepalace net  When he booked it he accidentally went to hotelwelcomepalace com and we ended up here When we arrived weary from our flight and ordeal with customs around  am  We knew to expect to bargue for everything but nothing would prepare us for this place  This place was very quotits ok   quot about everything  For instance we asked for a couple sealed bottles of water and we got refilled bottles  quotIts OK   quot yeah no can we please get some SEALED bottles    quotgrumble    quotBeing from the west we were suspicious of them wanting to hold our passports and I think they ided to get back at us for that  So they showed us to our room  Dirty walls floors bathroom was ok but we were just like well its India we will survive just staying one night then off to Agra    We had to bargue to get ourselves an extra matress for the floor my bud had asked for a room w two beds we got a single queen haha  Finally after we were situated and had just fallen asleep they come banging on the door to move us to a different room   or  floors up  In the middle of the night TO AN EVEN DIRTIER NASTIER SMALLER ROOM My friend and I looked at each other as soon as they left the room and ided to not even try with this place  We just walked downstairs told them to call us a cab and checked out of this worthless place We ended up just splurging and staying at the Intercontinental Much more expensive but after this ordeal the cleanliness and courtesy and amenities were worth the high price Please whatever you do doublecheck your web address before you book 
N => A distaster This hotel is really very bad  I strongly reccomend to avoid it  
N => Liked it Was there in late evening  Our Id was asked at the hotel and then transfered to room after check in which was express and took min only By the time welcome drink was served  After check in  bottles of mineral water was served with fruit basket to our room  We were hungry when we checked in the hotel so ordered the dinner which was served in min amp we really enjoyed the food  Next day on asking hotel for sightseeing hotel arranged it for  days  Delhi Sight Seeing Agra same day tour amp shimla  days  We hired the cab from hotel at  Rs  km which was new santro  Hotel had free internet for there all guests staying Hotel have just opened there Resturant which was upto  mindnite amp room service  hrs Hotel had electric back up too  Staff was very very friendly amp obiedient  Over all liked it very much  
N => Avoid at all costs Please please PLEASE do not stay at this hotel If you already made reservations cancel themI stayed here for two nights but looking back I cannot believe I stayed there that long The first room we were in was very dirty had holes in the wall and no windows After inspecting the room further we found rat droppings on the nightstand and on the floor  We figured whatever we are in india you just deal with it but later on when the rat actually appeared from the wall we couldnt handle it anymore  We asked to be switched to a different room after management made us feel stupid for asking such a ridiculous request  Our next room was nicer but the bathroom had only a trickle of running water and the window overlooked a very noisy and highly used alleyway  The first night we were there a musical performance went on all night outside of our window  We would have moved the next night to a different hotel but seeing as we got  hours of sleep the night before and had spent ALL day traveling to and from the Taj we really just wanted to get to bed I never took my socks off the whole time because the floors were so gross    in fact i threw them out before coming home  The management also changed our rates upon checking out  We had a pre booked rate from the manager of the hotel but when we checked out they added a bunch of taxes that we were never told of even though our pre booked rate supposedly included all taxes Please do not stay here  There are plenty of other hotels in the area and make sure to ask to see the room before you stay there 
N => Avoid this place I join the opinion of the others   it was a horrible experience  The rooms were horrible  Staff was sooo rude They also had organised airport transportation for us even though we didnt even talk abt that with them and then afterwards tried to charge us for that The rooms were horrible soo dirty and disgusting  only cold water etc  I also agree one who wrote that I dont think the rooms had ever been cleaned   After one night in the morning one of the staff members is knocking our door and says that we need to change our room that its booked to some other people  Excuse me Then this guy tells that the room that we had booked wasnt available when we arrived so we had a got better one  Yeah right A better one can this get any worse even   In the end we just left from the hotel and moved to another one  I do think that the best area to stay is Paharganj   there you can find much selection  It might be a messy area but its located also perfectly  Easy access to metro  
N => Not satisfied with management At first the person at the desk appeared to be gentle  That was the first impression I personally had  Indeed the hotel was not bad but not very good neither There is one pc connected to the internet which is an advantage  But unfortunately it was not working one day  so couldnt really send some important emails The rooms were ok for  persons  However having a hot shower is a problem  It was pure luck to sometimes have hot water and sometimes not The advantage of the hotel is that it is really near the metro stationand a street where we made a lot of shopping Restaurants are very near too  But it can get really noisy at night However the service at reception was not really good and had a bad experience with them  No promised wakeup call no cab in the morning and no cab at the train station  However we were charged heavily for those  which unfortunately did somehow exceeded our budget  
N => Disliked the crooked attitude of the management We stayed in Hotel Welcome palace on the th th ober  and then from th ober till st ember  We asked the owner to give us a wake up call at  on the th and arrange for a cab    We had an early flight to catch  We also asked for a cab to pick us up from the train station on the th  TheHotel manager noted our requests  I asked him about the price for thecab and it was Rs   The next morning no wake up call no cab waiting for us  There was a different person at the frontdesk and he said that the cab would cost Rs   When I protested he said that ishould discuss with the other guy when am back  On the th there was no cab waiting for us at the train station  We take a cab on our own since none of the requests we had made earlier were not satisfied  When we arrive at the hotel the manager says the driver is waiting for us at station When I asked him for fare for a sight seeing trip there was the basic Rs   additional fares for driver which was not defined On checking out the bills were NOT what we had agreed on   the firstcab was  instead of the  he had promised  He claims that he gave us a big cab  He was charging for the cab that was never there plus he was charging Rs  for dropping us to the airport compared to the  he had said earlier On top of that there was NO hot water for taking shower when askedfront desk would say it would be activated in  mins   but alas only vain promises  The bed sheets were not clean   looked like someone had been sleeping in those before  We were  in a room but they consistently provided only one towel daily You  stay at the hotel but get all expected costs in writing fromthe beginning  Do NOT go by the managers words as he will findsome good excuse to charge you more   unless you have a lot of money to spare and do not really care about being cheated upon  
N => OK room but sneaky Management Recently we stayed at Hotel Welcome Palace at Gurudwara road  Few observations that others  find useful  Hotel is located near Karol Bagh shopping area  Some good food joints are near by  Considerable traffic outside so it can get noisy in the room   Stayed at the Family suite their most expensive offering  Its a nice large room with two double beds sitting area TV with many channels fridge and attached bathroom  Room or was good  Both AC units worked well    Even though the room has a refrigerator it works only when you deposit your room key in a key holder  Once you remove the key from its holder to leave the room electricity is automatically cut off  A warning in case you plan to keep perishables in the refrigerator   Bathroom is not well maintained  Some fixtures are missing  Towels are old and worn out  Hot water is available but you have to call    Hotel breakfast is terrible  We ordered the very basic eggs toast butter jam etc  They dont have a cafeteria so they brought the food to our room  Presentation was poor  You are better off eating in nearby restaurants   I could not make local phone calls from the room  I called the front desk couple of times but they couldnt fix it  For some reason the outgoing calls are disabled at the front desk   Instead of providing honest and transparent service the management seems keen to wring every rupee from their customers  I found this so irritating that next time I will take my business elsewhere  Some examples     We agreed for an amount so the hotel could arrange a vehicle to pick us up from the International airport  I knew the amount was excessive but I agreed since we were reaching at night  The vehicle was in poor condition busted wind shield seat covers  interior in poor condition non existent shock absorbers  When checking out I discovered that they had added parking fee airport entry fee night duty fee etc to the charge  These additional charges were removed when I protested       The hotel website advertises complimentary breakfast  We ordered it on the first day  Found it terrible  In any case the waiter asked me to sign off on a bill  As I suspected it showed up in my hotel bill on the final day  I had to talk to their Director to get the charges removed  He claimed ignorance when I asked why they charge for the complimentary breakfast  My guess is that they will charge and hope the customer pays  They will roll it back if you complain      On our first day I had asked the hotel to arrange a AC car to take us around Delhi  Even though they charge a pretty good amount they arrange lousy cars  On a hot  humid day the AC barely worked  Car broke down several times during the day  It leaked coolant  When I asked the car driver to take us to the Huun tomb his response was that there wasnt much to see  My guess is that this hotel tries to arrange low quality cars so they can pay out less and make as much profit as possible  When I complained about quality of their cars Director apologized and tried to make amends by reducing the rental charge  Overall our room was ok but the management is sneaky  They seem unaware that in the age of Internet they can gain  lose customers with a few mouse clicks  You are probably better off taking your business somewhere else  
N => Best Stay we had I stayed at Welcome Palace for three nights in  with my Wife and eighteen year old dhter  The staff was very friendlierpolite amp attentive  We were on the First floor say the Executive Floor of the Hotel  Unlike some hotels there was not a hint of stuffiness or formality there  My dhter was very happy to be there amp felt as valued as my wife and I  Food was of our high standard service without fault  The rooms are extremely comfortable with great views  Best Part was it was near to all Shopping Areas amp Metro  Added to all the above a good location then I cannot think of a better place to stay in New Delhi  
N => Just Fine I stayed at the hotel at the beginning and end of my trip to India  After booking the hotel I inquired as to whether or not they could arrange a full itinerary which they did  I got all hotels I specified an air conditioned car and driver for  days airport transfers and breakfasts for about  which was quite a bargain  They did a good job in setting it all up The hotel is basic and as a one time Peace Corps volunteer I found it met all my needs  The plumbing worked as did the ac  The bed was comfortable and there was cable tv  The staff was helpful and friendly and while there was no restaurant there was room service and breakfast was delivered to the room included The main drawback was the location which was not familiar to many rickshaw or taxi drivers but I discovered that this lack of knowledge was true for all but the most famous places  The area was chaotic and noisy but the room was fairly quiet  One can walk to Conht Place in about half an hour and the rail station is very near  At a daily rate of about  it was a good choice 
N => Comfortable stay if u wanna live in delhi close to the airport and closer to gurgaon then it is a good place to stay     comfortable rooms  
N => bad worst hiThis hotel is quite close to airport but hotel is really bad customer service is bad and they have no proper manner not up to the standard not a  star hotel  hotel rooms are very bad  ho heater no proper AC  bathroom is really bad very very small and dirty  they didnt bother to clean it  couldnot even open the window as the passer by can see inside  it ruined our honeymoon trip as we didnt expect delhi  star hotel to be like this not worth even star  food was bad  people in the hotel were bad and not friendly  did not fulfill our requirments even after asking them n number of times  this was the only hotel horrible in our honeymoon as rest of the hotel we booked turned out to be excellent  
N => Try to find another hotel We stayed at this hotel for  nights waiting for transfer to Cochin and by our travelagents mistake  nights more on the way back to Sweden  It was very run down dirty bathrooms and with a sad looking staff working there  The descrition on the hotels website is far away from the true experience be prepaired to be unable to sleep the nights you stay here  The hotel are built like a echo chamber every little noise from the rooms or the reception phones staff make dishescleaning middle of the nigth go straight into your room  There was bad smell in our rooms no windows and very dark inside  Actually we felt ill from staying here and felt better as soon as we had a possibilty to leave the hotel  As we staid during monsoon season we where worried that the roof should fall down as huge amounts of water was pouring straight through the roof covering the eco chamber outside the rooms  So our advice try to find another hotel in Delhi the only favourible thing to say is that the hotel are very close to the airport wich make it possible to make sure to be able to cach your departure even if the monsoon have hit Delhi badly as it had upon our leaving  
N => Stay Away Very bad experience  Stay away  Hotel employees kept asking for tips and wouldnt leave the room until ive paid them  More specifically I called the hotel desk to arrange a taxi to the airport because i thought a hotel arranged taxi would be more trustworthy  When i got to the airport the Taxi driver asked for  Rs  I knew it should cost less than Rs to the domestic airport because i came from there the night before  I gave him  Rs  The next thing i heard is that the hotel charged an additional  Rs on my roommate s bill when he checked out for this taxi service  
N => Nighte Missed a flight out of Delhi airport and scrambled for a place to stay  Airport staff pronounced this quotWestinquot    imagine my surprise A true nighte  I had to lh that they called the room I got a quotsuper deluxe suite quot The shower was made of three glass walls that joined with about an inch gap between them AND NO CAULK  A shower flooded the place entirely  Internet did not work  Guests were hoodlums  Food at the restaurant was abysmal  Im pretty sure there were fleas in the bed  Took them h to send a car to the airport to get me and every time I called they said it would be there in  minutes  Stay away 
N => Worst Service Worst rooms Avoid at all costs We stayed here because a travel agent booked us in saying it is a  star   Check in was pathetic they always give a bad room first  They will change to better room after you complain   They will say no payment was made by travel agent but that was not always the case amp makes your checkout longer There seem to be preferential treatment to foreigners for some odd reason  
N => Clean and worth considering we booked up at the White House through Colourful Indian holidays as part of a round trip in Northern India  They chose the hotel and we looked it up and it seemed fine  It was very respectable inside  Bedrooms were air conditioned and spacious and bathrooms well equipped  Our room at the front was a wee bit noisy especially as fireworks were going off for Diwali and the stray dogs were barking but very little traffic  the area is not all that selubrious but the restaurant on the roof had quite a good selection so you did not need to venture out in the evening  One hic up we arranged to stay the night on our return and they denied knowlewdge of our booking   left us waiting wondering what was going on then asid it was   DEARER THAN QUOTED All seemed a little strange So good value but I would be cautious if you book in advance   their knowledge of english is not great 
N => Clean  I would rate this hotel as average good in terms of cleanliness amp food Location is ok and was good for access to Karol BaghConnht Place during the day but as a lone travelling female did not feel overly safe in the evening though think this would apply to other hotels in the capital anyway I too booked a pre arranged taxi from the airport which did not turn up amp had to haggle on my own at  am so would not rely on this selling point On my first am going down to reception for a stroll of the local area I was told a taxi had been arranged for me to arrange a tour of the city  Altough annoyed at first that theyd arramegd my own time I went along with it amp would actually reccommend this if you have free time as I negotiated a reasonable price for   day tour of all the main tourist points in Dehli old amp new town in an ac car and although stopped off at a cple of shops over the  days found this not to be an uncommon situation when getting transport in India I would also be awaretake all booking details with you as I was charged slightly more than I booked for However Overall I would reccommend this hotel as long as you are wary on pricesbooking arrangements  
N => Problematic I used this hotel to overnight between international and national flights Website said they had Hotel pickup  I had to call to confirm and then they tried to charge me for it The trip to national airport was double the usual cost They said they would exchange money at rsdollar  the then current rate  in the morning   I was in a time crunch and believed them  When it came time to exchange money the rate was rsdollar The rooms had peeling walls and some mold  They were clearly dishonest in their advertising and behavior  I am sure there are worse hotels in New Delhi but for the price and the conduct of these people I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere  I paid  US 
N => Be careful Stayed here for a week although went on a tour for  days I had arranged an airport pick up direct with the hotel via email but no one was there to meet me on arrival at the airportso had to haggle a price with a taxi to get me to the hotel at   in the morning On arrival at the hotel was told that there was a fault with the electricity in my room and would have to stay at another hotel round the cornerwhich was a hovel the fridge constantly buzzed and when I thought of pulling the plug to shut it up on seeing the wireswithout plugfed directly into the socketI thought better not to The next morning when I finally checked in to my roommy initial impressions were that it was cleaner and generally in better state of repair than the one the previous night but it left a lot to be desired Rooms are noisy and hot water is limited Breakfast is basic but ok Dont change money in the hotel Youll get a very poor rate and it is not official ie no encashment certificate and straight out of the receptionists pocket Karol Bagh area looks dodgy but is quite safe as long as you take basic precautions Only really used hotel as a base to sleep as theres not much else to do Not far to connht place by taxirickshaw For the money you could find somewhere much better  
N => Okay Stay But Ripped Off We had  stays in this hotel in       nights when we first arrived in Delhi and one night on our return from touring Northern India It was booked for us through a tour group we used to organise a tour of India  Location wise it is not bad  Its not far from the shopping district of Karol Bagh  There is an internet cafephone booth just down the road  There is a small shop next door to the hotel from where you can buy bottled water and snacks Our first stay was okay  We found the rooms to be moderately clean  The rooms didnt have any windows and the air conditioner didnt work thus the room got stuffy  The bathroom was alright if a bit on the shabby side Through the night we heard the incessant beeping that is synonymous with Indias roads  There was also endless barking of stray dogs  Ask for a room on the side not facing the road   it will be much quieter  Also ask for one of the end rooms   they have small windows which will help with the stuffiness issue The food in the quotrooftopquot restaurant is nothing to write home about  I was a little hesitant eating here as it didnt look very clean  There isnt much lighting there during the night   possible to hide the stains on the tablecloths For our return stay we had booked  rooms for  nights we were  couples travelling together  But when we arrived we were told that one of the rooms had been quotcancelledquot by us  We ended up sleeping  people to a room  The next day we got our tour group to organise another hotel for us which was closer to Connht Place An okay place to stay if its a short stay and you are on a budget  
N => Rip off artists We booked directly with the hotel in tember  for a one night stay in ober and a three night stay in ember  As we were staying four nights we were offered two free pick ups from the airport  We provided our credit card details as security When we arrived at the hotel in ober we were asked to pay for the pickup  The bills was different to the agreed rate   the receptionist tried to charge us more   fortunately we had copies of our correspondence with us  We asked for two club rooms and were given standard rooms and charged club prices  We were given very noisy rooms overlooking the street Despite this we confirmed our bookings before we left for ember as we did not at that date want to go to the trouble of finding another hotel The day we were due to check in we called the hotel to confirm our pickup form the airport  We were told that our reservations had been cancelled as we had not provided confirmation   I dont see how this can be as we confirmed in person and wathced the receptionist write down our requirements in their reservations book  We were left in a lurch as there were virtually no hotel rooms left that night in Delhi due to a medical conference  Do not book with the White House   the reservation policy cannot be relied upon at all and they do not appear to honour their own pricing policy for their rooms  
N => Business Hotel We travelled to this hotel with Cox and Kings as part of a package this was the first hotel we stayed in the hotel is what I would call a business class hotel it offers a high level of service but at a price The room was nothing special it did smell a bit musty large television and ent channels we ate in the Aangan resturant each night and the service and food was excellent although very costly  As an indication when we did visit the bar Polo Lounge ml of Stella cost  rps  Overall we liked the hotel but compared to others on the trip it was extremely expensive  
N => Quality hotel with very friendly staff This hotel looks a bit gloomy from the outside but I found both my room and the facilities to be top notch  The Hyatt website allows you to book all kinds of things through it ranging from airport transportation spa treatments to a restaurant table  I found this a very handy feature I had booked a King Executive room which included airport transportation  It was efficient enough but in my experience the pickup by other hotels is a bit friendlier offering you cold water and even a cold towel  Check in at executive level very efficient and friendly and generally the staff couldnt do enough to accommodate you  I had an early flight the next day but they arranged breakfast to be set out for me in the Club even though breakfast would open not for another hour  Restaurants I can really recommend the China Kitchen its an experience with friendly staff and in a lovely setting  
N => Absolutely unacceptable Was on a  week trip to India and wanted to finish my vacation in a nice hotel  Therefore stayed here for  nights in late ust   I found this hotel to be absolutely unacceptable for this price  It looked as if it is not Hyatt Regency  The carpets in the corridors and the furniture in the rooms were completely outworn  The check in process was not good  We were a group of  people  One of us got a room with  twin beds and two of us   a room with one king bed contrary to what was booked  In one of the rooms water was flowing from the walls  So trust me   do not stay at Hyatt in Delhi because its truly not a Hyatt  Better chose Leela Kempinski at which I also stayed and which although not ideal offers much more for the same price  Hyatt in Delhi is some sort of Soviet type of hotel  
N => I was stayed on th of li  was stayed on th of li amp it was a great experience to be there  
N => Was disappointed   might try the Meridien in Delhi next time After a wonderful stay at the Le Meridien in Mumbai   I was expecting the same or more at the Hyatt in Delhi    it wasnt to be     I was shown to my room to check in   but upon arrival I smelt a quotfunny smellquot   which I relayed to the check in lady   she said shed send house keeping to freshen up the room  The actual room itself was spacious and newly orated    however after checking in   I noticed an ash tray   which explained the smell   I called receiption striaght away   as Im a non smoker   I asked to change rooms   as the smell would not just disappear As I had to rush out to dinner   they moved my bags and room for me   so upon my return   I was in a new room   with a view of the pool     but the room was older   and as not as plush as the first one   was very disappointed   but couldnt be bothered to move againThe breakfast in the morning was not as good as the Meridien   I struggled to find anything I wanted to eat and settled for pancakes instead The lobby area isnt very comfortable   and nobody attends to you   I didnt really enjoy this hotel as it wasnt as quotcozyquot as the meridien and as a solo traveller   this was what I needed The business room was ridiculous   it was more like an quotinterviewquot room   and they wanted  rupees for an hour   to sit at what looked like somebodys deskI wont be coming back   Id rather try another Meridien 
N => Excellent Service I had booked a standard room for a day when I travelled to Delhi for a meeting pros Room was kept ready and the check in time didnt take more than  minutes  Room was very clean and upto  star stds  Quite a selection of cuisines to offer both through room service as well as restaurants  The included breakfast was excellent cons Nothing much The room temperature was too warm requested for correction about it and didnt bother to follow up as was tired after a long flight  Cost  No airport pick and drop service was provided 
N => Not a good  Star hotel When compared to the other Hyatt Regency in India this ranks the worst  The room is smaller than the otherRegencies   This is my second stay in  days  My club room has a toilet that flushes badly  I pity the cleaner when he goes around doing his work later today  I am going to stay in Le Meridien next week  
N => Outstanding wish more hotels were like this one We took our children to India so that they know their heritage  Booked three rooms at Hyatt and from the time we arrived in lobby we were treated well beyond expectation  Rooms though smaller but beautiful and luxurious  THe restaurants service was excellent and food was made to order for kids and for us   I will go there again when I get a chance  Front office  checkin and regency clun staff is wonderful  
N => GReat Room It was a very pleasant stay at Hyatt during my cousins wedding in uary   Hotel treated us very cordially  
N => beautiful hotel My husband and I stayed at this beautiful hotel our first night in India It was a lovely hotel and was closer to the airport than the downtown hotels  Would highly recommend it  
N => Lousy Service It started out well with my airport pickup  Then when reached hotel took over  mins to check in as my room was not yet ready granted it was booked a month ahead Wifi service goes on and off while you are being charged  Had to change over to broadband with the help of the staff Room service   I ordered food at pm I was told it will be served in  mins its now  am and still no food I was booked here for two more days well ive just cancelled my stay here and moving myself to another hotel in delhi  I would definitely not recommend this joint to anyone  
N => Shocking experience I called an hour before reaching the hotel  The central reservation desk was friendly and informed us of the various rooms and told us they had avalibility  Since a lot of rooms were avaliable we ided to book once we got to the hotel  We asked for a room at the front desk and were shocked to hear that rooms were not avaliable  We informed the front desk about the conversation we just had with the central booking office an hour ago  She asked us to call them since she had no rooms  We easily got a room by talking to the cental booking office  The lady who made our booking sounded shocked the the front desk had refused she even asked us for the persons name  When we narrated the details to the lady at the front desk she just smiled  She said she did that for security reasonsWe were unable to sleep for  days due to ongoing CONSTRUCTION  We heard furniture being dragged all night on the upper floor In the morning we talked to the floor manager and housekeeping They ASSURED US THAT SUCH A THING WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN  We were naive same thing next night  We called the reception and finally at am an offer to switch rooms  Really  am they expect me to pack and drag my bags At checkout we narrated the story to someone introduced to us as the manager  He apologised but had no explanation  Things are out of control   He only offered to compensate for our suffering by arranging a cab to drop us to the airport for free  We paid  dollars each night were lied to treated in most unprofessional manner  Our compensation free ride to the airport  I am at loss of words and truely shocked at the service and overall experience  I am from INDIA  living in the U S  and have been a fan of this hotel for years  We frequented the coffe shops and various resteraunts  Great personal attachment to the hotel till I stayed there  Its sad 
N => Good Hotel   but watch out they rip u off Well its a good hotel was quite clean service was good  It is very close to the airport and was one of the main reasons for me to book it  Has a good japanese steak house and a great coffee house  But for those singles this place does not have a nit club  The room was clean with hardwood floors and a nice view  I liked everything about the hotel cant complain   now the bad stuff  I got the room for around  dollarsnit for the week of indepence day which was reasonably good except after the trip when i returned back to america i was charged nit   on my credit card even though the online bill says  i called hyatt office in usa and they asked me to contact the hotel in delhi  I thought it was not worth it i rather not stay there anymore  Secont billing issue i had was for the car i rented during my stay  they provided me with a camry aparently the lady in the front dest quoted me  rs hours  I ided to clear my bill the nit b i check out and while i was paying my bill i realized i was billed  rs hrs    I tried talking to the manager she was quite rude basically saying she cant help it  as she didnt quote the price to me  I paid it in full  next day while i was checking out  i saw the girl who had quoted me the price   i asked for the manager    i explained everything that happened   a new manager had come in    she talked to the staff and refunded me the money     I beleive they should have waived the taxi charge for    they had caused all that drama    and it was their fault  But ofcourse they didnt   and when i finally reach america   they charged me extra for my room     awesome hotel    i m never going there again  
N => nice service nice place to be 
N => Good experience overall Our companys team of  stayed here for a week and overall we had a good experience  We stayed on the club level which was very helpful  We made good use of the lounge and there was a conference room we reserved for one day of our stay  Most of the staff was friendly and helpful and when I asked for a room change to move further away from the public area they were very accommodating Our rooms were clean and comfortable  We found the food at the club lounge very good and a nice mix of indian and continental  The italian restaurant was really good and highly recommended when you need a break My major complaint is the check in and check out process  When our group arrived they took our passports and appeared efficient  They are not  It took almost two hours they got hopelessly confused and we didnt get to our rooms until after midnight  We also get a complimentary ride back to the airport and even though I tried to confirm it was clear that they did not have it recorded anywhere when we got to the concierge to leave  To be fair they pulled it together but when flying international this is something I want to work like clockwork  Lastly the internet connection is flaky and our connections would often get dropped which was pretty frustrating at times Overall for business it was a good not perfect experience and I wouldnt worry about staying here  
N => Awful Experience Recently stayed in Hyatt Delhi ober   After paying Bomb I had very bad experience with your so called quot star hotelquot     Following were the issues  Reservation was done online on Hyatts site but did not have room as per our requirement reserved  Reception allots me room which already had guest staying  It was very embarrassing to walk into room with guest sleeping  Next Room allotted was not as per our requirement we took it as we were very tired  Whole process took  minutes  ROOMS HAD COCKROACHES  Room Service staff could not take order properly I had to call three time to get correct and complete order  Once I received order it was cold and barely edible I would never recommend stay in Hyatt for kind of Service they offer after charging bomb  
N => Ups and Downs We stayed  nights at the Hyatt Regency in New Delhi  Overall the experience was OK but there were several issues which meant I couldnt give this property a higher rating Upon arriving the receptionist had some difficulty in finding our reservation despite the fact that we had called in a day earlier to confirm  This lead to some delays and was not the best start to our visit We had been assigned to a standard room overlooking the pool  It was clean but very outdated old fashioned bathroom with shower over the tub old style TV  Our friend who was staying at the same hotel had gone for a Club level room and when we saw his room we ided to bite the bullet and upgrade  It took some time and a few phone calls to the Front Desk but eventually we were moved  What a difference The Regency Club level rooms are all recently reated with all the mod cons  They are still the same size as the normal rooms i e  not that big  Ive uploaded some photos of both rooms so you can see the difference  Also included in the Regency Club rate was access to the Club Lounge free drinks all day alcoholic drinks and snacks from    pm everyday free Internet access the broadband was fast and free limo transfers to and from the airport We tried the room service for dinner and breakfast   both were very good although a bit slow to arrive  We also ate at TKs Grill which had ent Teppanyaki although the meat was a bit tough Had the chance to try the pool very nice although a bit small and strangely enough with a swimming lane right through the center effectively cutting it in half  Plenty of sun loungers around although it was a bit of a struggle to get any service had to walk over to the pool bar area to get drinks  We also tried the bar very relaxing with live music and a nice atmosphere Unfortunately there were reations going on during our stay which meant that some parts of the hotel were closed off and there was some intermittent noises coming from the construction areas  Our room cards stopped working on the nd day and it took two trips to the front desk to sort them out Also be warned that one wing of the club level has been fitted out with a new system which allows use of a wireless keyboard to access the internet through the TV and do various other things  The other wing lacks this system and is still waiting to be updated  If you are travelling without a laptop make sure you specify you want one of these equipped rooms so that you can jump online without the hassle of having to go to the business center My main problem with the hotel was the lack of value it represents  For the USD   night room rate we were paying I honestly expected a bigger room and flawless service  Unfortunately this was not the case  
N => Loved this Hotel We loved this hotel   Was not inexpensive but loved everything about it  Staff was very pleasant amp helpful  Breakfast was good  
N => Not worth the big bucks Spent  nights one at top USD the second using Hyatt Gold Passport points  We were advised by friends to stay in  Star Deluxe Hotels while in India good input    your hotel will be your sanctuary  So in Delhi we selected the Hyatt Regency its expensive  Excellent bar excellent buffet breakfast the top USD room was small and clean  The Gold Passport room was smaller unclean dirty and lacked furnishings  So food and drinks are good but room is average not worth the USD  E Taylor NC USA 
N => Average experience This was not the best welcome to India  The service was pretty disorganized and the location was out of the action of the city   this might suit some people but it meant having to negotiate public transport and taxis not easy in this place Rooms were okay but nothing special  Not the cleanest bathroom either  Id choose some where else next time  
N => Excellent hotel to stay I had been to New Delhi for one night on a trip to get my US VISA from the American Consulate  I was booked at this hotel and the experience was really great Mine was a club room up on the  th floor and it was very good The hotel and its food is worth the price one pays to stay here Strongly recommend  
N => Expensive      The Hotel is set between the city centre and the International Airport  On first arrival I thought the outside was nothing special  But the welcoming lobby was first class  The restaurants are excellent and whilst I was there the Hotel was adding a new Chinese Restaurant  The pool is not particularly large but adequate and the grounds are well kept  I was staying on the Executive  floor and this gave me access to a small buffet service The room was clean but nothing special  My room was located on the side providing me a restricted view of a side alley  nothing great there  The TV was old style model not a modern Flat plasma version  The programmes were basic offering no pay per view  The room had Internet access but on this trip as I didn t have my laptop  I used the internet room on the th floor another is in the lobby  I was surprised and very disappointed to find a charge for this having paid a lot more to stay on the Executive floor I would of expected this to be complimentary  I thought this was very petty The Hotel staff are excellent and very professional very polite and helpful  Overall I would say the price to stay at the Hyatt was very expensive and although I was staying on business and therefore not paying I would not stay there again  
N => Avoid at all Costs The service at the Hyatt is great but not worth the night price  Our room had a door to an adjoining room through which everything could be heard  So during our last nights stay the person in the other room ided to watch TV at am and we were woken up  If you are paying night you should get a quiet nights sleep  Also when we arrived back home I was sent a letter and bill for food taken out of the mini bar which we never took   This hotel is a total rip off  
N => A great experience I recently stayed at the Hyatt in New Delhi  My room was quite large with plenty of room around my king bed  It was slightly cold and when I called the front desk to complain they sent up a space heater that worked fine  The most impressive aspect was the concierge  I had several packages delivered to me and someone from the concierge not only brought them up but helped me pack them which involved making a makeshift bag and weighing my baggage for me  Given my extra baggage I was concerned that I might not be able to check in everything  When I departed the hotel I was told that the Hyatt representative at the airport had been notified that I was coming and would help me  The Hyatt representative met me at the airport and walked me through the check in process and helped me manage my baggage  I would never have been able to check in if it was not for him I would definitely stay at the Hyatt again  
N => My stay was fine I enjoyed my stay here I found my room a bit small but comfortable and I slept well Reception is large modern and light and the staff met my requests just fine I asked someone to get me some deodorant as I forgot to pack any and it was bought and brought to me in a meeting where I wanted it  GreatRestaurant lots of buffet choice western or Indian good quality We had a business meeting in the downstairs conference facility which was excellent Pool I had a swim and ordered a beer at the pool and that was all fine  All in all I would stay here again  
N => Shockingly Bad Hotel I always stay at Hyatts as the name usually guarantees some kind of standard   not in this case The rooms are very very old  They have not updated in the basic components such as electrical plugs and the ac let alone the furnishing  The ac control does not even allow you to change the temperature All this would be ok except that they are charging   Not worth this at all 
N => Some of the staff do try to make a difference I wrote a review a few hours before checking out  It wasnt favorable We were on a late midnight flight and after checking out and settling the extras bill for a couple of meals and some drinks around us used the spa to freshen up before dinner  I was not allowed a  R disposable razor as I had already checked outThat was the final straw  I couldnt wait to leave this place On leaving through the lobby I met the hotel manager and told him what was going on in his hotel  Hotels in India in my experience are never that good  be its a cultural thing  The manager took the comments I made very seriously and appeared pretty surprised on investigation to find out what his staff were obviously hiding from himHe and his team took immediate action to ensure that the remainder of our evening in Delhi was as enkoyable as possible and that we would try the hotel again next time we visited Ill try this place again next time Im in Delhi  The manager genuinely seems to want to sort it out I recommend if you have justified problems here and that arent being dealt with that you inform the manager  If hes not available contact Hyatt regional manager  I suspect that when the reception says hes not available its because theyd prefer their boss didnt find out what its like being a guest here There are some great helpful people working here who understand the hospitality business they just need more of them 
N => We loved this hotel     I think I must have stayed at a different hotel than the other reviewers  After  weeks on the road in India we were lucky enough to use points to reserve a room on the club level  Highly recommend upgrading if you can  The room was lovely  It could have been a bit larger but the or cleanliness and bathroom were are great  Apparently we had the opposite experience with the service  Check in was done promptly on the th floor they let us check out at  in the evening when we left with no additional charge the wait staff on the floor were wonderful and we found the breakfast and evening drinks to quite nice  Also having unlimited email access in the business center was very helpful We enjoyed the bar and resaurant we went to in the hotel though they are VERY expensive by Indian standards but the best part was the spa  For about  bucks I got the best massage I have ever had  This hotel was a wonderful break in our travels and I would recommend it without a doubt  And again suggest upgrading to the club level for the best experience 
N => Hyatt A disgrace Hyatt a  star hotel    having a lh The service is worse than what you get in a  star hotel  Not worth the money Staff in Delhi Hyatt are inefficient and extremely rude They do not know how to treat their customers  Not only that they need to be fully trained to work at the front desk Cant get a simple thing rightThe restaurant in the Hotel is over priced  The food is ok  Although you have to order  hours in advance Because their service is so damn slow Rooms are also very small and bathroom is very basic I would certainely not recommend this hotel to anyoneDelhi Hyatt definately gives a bad name to the Hyatt group of Hotels  
N => Give Hyatt a bad name  Absolutely appalling   
N => Star looks    Star service  
N => Worst Hotel Bad name to India  
N => Terrible Service  
N => OK Hotel but terrible service  
N => Not great not horrible just ok   
N => Good value  
N => Not as great as the pictures     the staff were good expect the driver night failed to turn up to pick up from the airport  So do have the full address as the cab driver from the airport could not find the place for ages  Rooms are spacious but dated  The Hi Fi internet did not work  i changed hotels because of that plus the lift was not working  In addition to that u dont get much choice for breakfast and had to stay mainly in the room  The hotel has a day driver   quick and street st  that helped  Near the tube metro  Draby place with no frills but reflects the price you should not pay more than  to  rupees including all taxes as abt  more takes u into a different class in the same vicinity Suggest you book for a day and than extend your stay if you like the place  
N => Top quality hotel I was really impressed with this hotel  Its top notch really friendly counter and restaurant staff  They seem gebuiely keen to help and not just after a tip  The hotel is very expensive to stay and to buy food but its quality shines through  The Indian restaurant provided the best food during our stay in India  
N => Good Business Hotel Good business hotel located clsoe to the airport in the diplomatic enclave  Service was OK what you would expect from a good Asian bsuiness hotel  Bathrooms are small need to be updated  
N => Great food When I was at taj it was great like any other  star The restaurant called masala art was great From music to food to performance Great hospitality Due to economic slowdown all hotels have dropped their rateso it should be cheap now to stay  
N => great service though minor flaws grand lobby  fantastic restaurant  great service  average room amenities  hotel staff are very attentive at all time  when they make a mistake they would proceed with the service recovery promptly  some minor flaws do happen from time to time but i can see the management is committed to provide each guest with maximum comfort  
N => Not quite  star Stayed here for one night only and that was enough  Strong and overpowering smell of fragrant oil everywhere  Exterior gaudy facade design and old paintwork make it look tired and unappealing  Entrance lobby is good but elevators leading to rooms gaudy carpets in corridors and tackily painted walls and doors require a major upgrading job and more emphasis on detail  Rooms are no more than   to  star level  Room entrance door and cabinet work is gloomy and need replacement  Colour coordination of furniture floor carpet curtains is not to my taste  Breakfast is okay but not lavish in a bright red floored dining area as if designed by team from Changing Rooms TV programme Acceptable place to stay if price was say   a night  
N =>  star service  star price You get exactly what you would expect from a hotel like this  Top service impeccable room high prices  Must be one of the better hotels in the city The level of service is in fact a bit over the top someone to turn on the tap for you in the public washroom to wash your hands and hand you a fresh towel staff do not give directions here they take you all the way where you want to go at receptions you will be offered something to eat or drink about every thirty seconds making it almost impossible to hold a conversation with anyone everybody greets you even the workers painting the halls etc  After a few days I could barely take it anymore  But I can hardly complain I guess Bed sheets were wonderful the room impeccably clean  The main Indian restaurant had great food highly recommended  The European restaurant is where breakfast is served  Always some Indian food available for breakfast which was great  The rest of the breakfast was fine but not extraordinary Location is not that great  Hard to walk anywhere interesting  Taxis are cheap and readily available at any time so that makes it easier to go somewhere No surprise on the price either it is expensive My meetings where at the hotel for four days so I did not have much choice  Not sure I would come back though if I were on my own though  I thought everything was a bit too much for my own taste  Something a little more casual might just feel a bit more real  
N => Overpriced Will not stay here again  It was for a conference that we chose this hotel because special rates were available However we were told those rooms were full so a more expensive room was proposed although the conference organizers insisted the rooms were still available We were promised we would be downgraded if possibleIt took  phone calls  hours before arrival to reconfirm my reservation The  numbers I called didnt know about my reservation even though I had a confirmation number The emails got returned as undeliverable I was told to call direct to the hotel with a paid phone  It wasted   minutes the night before our departure from Paris Pickup at the airport was quick The staff is nice and friendly Room smelled of tobaccolooked very old with an old TV No wired internetwireless internet you have to pay for It worked okay the first day but then there was no signal Someone came to my room and tried to check my laptop settingshe couldnt really tell why the signal was unavailable or low but thought it was due to outside interference Toilets are too high otherwise okay Food is very expensive and the hotel is far from any alternative food outlets Staff presence they hover around you at every step though you dont have to tip Its just not very comfortable Overall the hotel might have been a five star in the past but needs some changes now You have to pay for using the business center as well Fitness center very ordinary I have traveled a lot and stayed at better hotels which were less expensive usually in the US or Western Europe Overall overpriced  Need upgrades in amenitiesdowngrading in  star status 
N => Nice hotel service too attentive We stayed on the club floor of the Taj Palace hotel  The rooms were nice and clean  We booked a hotel car from the airport and that went very smoothly  The driver was waiting for us as soon as we came out of customs  Check in was quite smooth  However the service was too attentive  Every time I turned around someone was hovering  I was also called multiple times even after do not disturb light was on to review the hotel 
N => one night stop over We stayed one night at the Taj palace at the start of a weeks tour  The hotel doesnt look that great from the outside   a dit dated but the lobby is quite spectacular  When we arrived the hotel was fully booked with a conference and very busy which meant the service wasnt really that great  We needed lunch and the only place we could find to sit was by the pool we waited a very long time to get served and the order was wrong which they quickly rectified  The room was ok we had twin beds unfortunately  not particularly spacious and the or non descript but it was clean one couple on the tour stayed in a club room and that sounded much better We ate at the indian restaurant which was excellent the service was very good and the waiters very helpful and keen to tell us about what we were eating we asked to share a starter and they gave us two huge portions for the price of one and a free desert when we werent going to have one  The bhuna ghost was lovely All in all we were a little disappointed we had thought this was supposed to be one of the best hotels in Delhi but i wouldnt say it was  star it could do with a bit of updating and the pool area wasnt that great  We were supposed to go back there at the end of the tour but instead flew to Goa from Jaipur and were quite glad we didnt have to go back  
N => A great disappointment A hotel that charges a premium in a low cost country but fails to deliver  Yes the rooms and the public areas are what you would expect from a  star hotel but the attitude of the staff seemed to be how best can we arate our guests from their cash  There seemed to be no ability by staff to make isions   everything was done by the rule book   and generally with no flexibility  Hospitality and graciousness were lacking  You left feeling quotused and abusedquot Very questionable price value  
N => Worst Hotel Stay for the price Having stayed in more hotels then I can count I have to say that for the price paid to stay at the Taj in Delhi it was horribleService was horrid from arrival all the way till check out  The room was older then myself and not updated since  Food was average and nothing more  After traveling to the Taj Mahal with friends and kids in tow we stayed at the Trident Hilton in Agra which was a wonderful hotel in all aspects  Great for kids the service was wonderful what you would expect  The Taj in Delhi on the other hand for all of us was a  star for the price of a  star      
N => perfect service rooms need updating the rooms are nothing to write home about I didnt even bother to take photos as other reviewers photos are representative of the state of the rooms comfortable but worn out i e  carpet stains dated bathroombut all of that aside the hotel s service was the best of the  hotels I stayed at on this trip Oberoi Agra amp Samode Haveli in Jaipur being the other two the travel desk a lovely girl called Amrita took care of my whole trip from train tickets to car pick up airport agra to Jaipur with sights along the way incl fatehpur sikri plane tickets from Jaipur to Delhi amp etc everything was seamless and response was quick she even gave me her direct line as she saw me off in the morning for my local taxi to the delhi to agra train in case anything went wrongthe check in process was also painless was greeted the moment the car arrived in the driveway amp ushered to the room for a quick in room check in  welcome tea  snackslike I said the rooms were a bit on the old side but the hotel lobby itself was fine reminded me of the Mandarin in Bangkokwould I come back again yes if not for the hotel then at least for the efficient help from the travel desk 
N => Yes its fine please stop asking for feedback all the time Spent a weekend here in ust   The hotel is absolutely fine and Id stay here again  If you look in the dictionary under anonymous international five star hotel youll find something like this Two things to be aware of though  The first is that the hotel is being refurbished   at the moment they are on the sixth floor and construction is a thirteen hour a day seven days a week job  They did mention this to me when I checked in and with hindsight I should have moved rooms when they offered because I was just downstairs from the drilling  Though if they knew this why was I put there in the first place So Id just check on how the refurbishment is going before you book and make sure you get a room away from the work Also try to avoid the rooms overlooking the hotel entrance  Buses park there with engines and ACs running waiting for tour groups  Indian ACs arent the quietest and they certainly disturbed my sleep which was a shame as the hotel is in an otherwise very quiet location Secondly it felt like wherever I went in the hotel I was constantly asked what I thought of it  It gets difficult after a while to think of nice things to say when you really want to say youd much rather be left alone  They even sent me a detailed questionnaire by email afterwards to ask for even more feedback When I got home to Mumbai one of my friends who works in the non Taj hotel where I used to live told me the Taj he used to work in had a competition with the Palace to see who could collect the most feedback  Not surprisingly he prefers his new hotel as he doesnt have to constantly pester his guests Finally though I would recommend the Masala Art restaurant   by far the best Indian meal Ive had since moving to India  And no feedback requested either They probably already know theyre good  
N => They Call This Place a Palace The Taj Palace  have been a luxury resort    in the s This hotel is so outdated and the orations are so antiquated that I felt I had been taken transported back to the s  Whoever defines this place as luxurious has not been to a five star hotel in the past ten years  This hotel is certainly not a five star hotel especially by todays standards  Its no better than an average Hilton or riot in any other city  I was very disapointed by my stay at the Taj Palace because I had heard so many good things about the place but after having stayed at several Oberoi Resorts and other hotels in Delhi it doesnt hold a finger in comparison  The service is not outstanding  In fact during my stay they notified me that they would be doing construction on the floor above us that would begin at  am  We asked if we could be switched to another room but was told that they were full doubtful  The noise from the construction was atrocious  Ive been at front row rock n roll concerts and have been able to hear more clearly than I did at  am in my hotel room at the Taj Palace  The woman behind the desk apologized but that did very little  The hotel should be embarassed that they would subject any guests to such conditions  This is no hotel for those in search of a luxury or even a quotnicequot hotel  However for families and people traveling on a budget I think the hotel would certainly suffice  The bottom line was that I was highly embarassed to have suggested this hotel to the group of people I was staying with especially after I had picked so many spectacular hotels like the Oberoi in Agra  It was a mistake and I would not return  
N => FANTASTIC Service and Hotel    A great last night in India My family of  stayed here for our last night in India  We had just come from a week trip on the Palace on Wheels and arrived at  a m  in the morning  They were able to get us into a room at  a m    hours earlier than normal check in  We had  rooms and they placed us all on the same floor next to each other  We had a staff person come up for each room and show us the amenities of the room  We were extremely impressed  They even sent up complimentary cappucino and juice as a welcome gesture  The rooms were nice not huge like the Ambassador but were comfortable  The service definitely made up for it We wanted to have dinner at  since we had to leave at  am to catch our flight  They normally id not open that early for dinner but made the arrangement for us to eat early  We ate at the tea house and would highly recommend it  The or of the restauraunt is fantastice very chinese  The food was delicious and they even brought our a complimentary cake when they found my parents were celebrating their th anniversary and this was our last night  They took our picture with a polaroid and even put it in a frame  The service was outstandingAs for the front desk and reception area you could always find help  When we wanted to go shopping one of the attendants Rita recommended we rent a taxi for the day which I highly recommend  For  hours she negotiated a rate for us which was  ruppees about   She gave us pointers and was very attentive My husband used the facilities    pool sauna steam room massage  It was a great experience for him  The massage was not too expensive but well worth it  The locker area is arated for both men and women and there is a nice jacuzzi and steam room Even when we left at  a m  there seemed to be a full staff on duty  Overall we LOVED this hotel and would highly recommend it  It was a bit pricey but we thought it was well worth it  
N => Very pleasant Stayed for one night on  th   Based on comments in Frommers which did not place this hotel into their recommended list of  star hotels in Delhi was prepared for a so so experience  Instead was pleasantly surprised to find the level of service and the facilities at the hotel to be truly first class  Given the choice would probably still rather stay at the Oberoi but this hotel is not far behind  
N => Over priced Went to stay at the hotel but was sadly let down by the price and state of the room as it was tired smelly and dirty the staff were quite helpfull but unable to offer better accomodation at the time and would not reduce the USD price which in my opinion was excesssive considering the state of the room 
N => Luxurious but noisy  
N => Not up to expectations  
N => Not to be missed  
N => good alternate in south Delhi  
N => A warm and welcoming refuge from the city   and a beautifully appointed hotel The amber was an absolutely beautiful place for us to stay upon our arrival in Delhi  The hotel was exceptionally clean and well appointed  The beds were firm and the bedding was very tasteful as was the furniture in the room  Note The showers are fantastic Great water pressure  Mukesh the general manager and his staff could not have been more welcoming  They made us feel right at home   even when we arrived at midnight I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Delhi  The only negative was that we couldnt stay longer 
N => Experience beyond expectations Amber is located in the east side of Delhi in a quiet neighborhood that depicts the normal day to day life of India through its large window in each room  This is a medium rate boutique hotel where the rooms were at a standard of any high end European or American hotel  The room was clean and the interior was tastefully done where each furniture item was selected with thought and a theme in mind  The bathroom was exceptionally good  Rooms carried all state of the art equipments  I must comment specifically on the food from the Amber kitchen  It was better than all the locations we were recommended to eat during our one week stay in Delhi  We did try all locations and always ended up coming back to Amber to taste items from their menu  The staff was very friendly and helpful  We felt at home at Amber   a special home with room service   I would recommend this to anyone and I would definitely return  
N => Nice hotel but the location     Clean well modernised hotel helpful staff but alas miles from anywhere in fairly unsalubrious surroundings  
N => Great Room standard Absolutely fantastic It was so clean and beautiful  Client service especially two people we spoke with were extremely professional and helpful one lady at the reception and there was a man   i think he was the owner or manager   quite young dressed really nice  The rest was just OK but those two We were really impressed But if Im to complain    there were only two things that were a bit annoying but its nothing especially that were talking about India First of all the room you can see with red blanket stunning but we I had a look through the window    there is an eating area behind And it would be ok because they are serving breakfasts only but in the morning it was a disaster  It was so noisy  The hotel staff was preparing this room for a breakfast from am  Talking lhing and all the noises from the kitchen  We were really pissed off when we woke up at am and couldnt fall asleep especially that we arrived to the hotel in the middle of the night after a few interesting experiences at the airport  Yes we were exhausted and planned to get up at am  Luckily there was no problem to change the room so the rest of our stay was great   Another thing tipping  It was driving us bananas especially when ordered the food and a couple of beers  The guys was puffing pretending how tired he is because he had to get the food and especially beer from far away  Yeah right He didnt do this himself and than said he has no change so you dont have to tip him when you order your food  We already did  Oh and dont order any beer   it is too expensive and cant cool it down in the fridge anyway So the above was the worst we experienced  Not too bad hey  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone  
N => Overrated Normally I swear by TripAdvisor and so booked this hotel based on all the excellent reviews  This was the last stop on our holiday to India and we were looking forward to staying in a hotel that appeared flawless All other hotels we had stayed in on our trip had been super   and most of these recommended on this website  So it was something of an anti climax to arrive at the Amber at midnight after a  hour train journey to be met by a surly receptionist and what can only be ribed as a very average  night stay  To be fair there had been some early warning signs  I had tried to arrange a pick up from the rail station a couple of weeks before we left for India but their email address was consistently out of order bizarre given this was the holiday period  I then phoned them to arrange a pick up but they had ran out of cars and were not able to assist in arranging a taxi  We managed to sort this out ourselves at the station without much bother  The room was certainly clean and very modern and with a great flat screen TV  We had a Premium room which was quite small and the bathroom   albeit clean with lots of new fittings and hot water   was quite poky with nowhere to hang towels or put toiletries  It is certainly in a very quiet area a good  mins from the center but I think our room was above the water pump which clanked loudly all night  Above all we found the service quite impersonal and the breakfast was poor   there was no buffet and we ordered off the menu   the food was mediocre with instant coffee inspite of a state of the art coffee maker that was used to froth the milk This would have all been fine but the whole atmosphere was quite bizarre and a bit like eating in a hospital waiting room  When we came down to breakfast at am I thought we were in the wrong place as all the lights were off They were quite helpful in ordering us taxis for day trips but very inflexible at the end of our stay when we asked to keep the room an extra few hours after check out time to wait for our flight and we were asked to pay a full days rate with only   discount  We lined and ended up in a rather nice bar in town   given there is really nowhere to hang out in the hotel  All in all the hotel was perfectly fine but I think it would take more than a flat screen TV and some chrome and ble fittings for me to give it such a high rating  We stayed in Delhi at Shanti Home earlier in our trip   and thats certainly where I would go back to again  
N => Nice Place to Stay in a Quieter part of Delhi The Amber was a pleasant surprise in a seemingly safe area of Delhi  Not much in the immediate vicinity of the hotel but to be honest the food in the hotel was great so we didnt need to venture out too far The room I had a Premium Room which was extremely spacious was worth the small amount extra  The bathroom was massive and water was always hot which is not common in Delhi Breakfast was basic but to be honest substantial enough in the heat and before facing another day in Delhi The only one thing that I thought could have been improved on was the quality of the drivers that the hotel called on as a taxi service  Many of them were quite rude and when we went sightseeing they took us to where they thought we wanted to go rather than where we asked to go which was quite frustrating as we only had very limied time being there on business  I know this is not the hotels fault but it would be great if they used drivers that were friendly and more obliging All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would stay there again  
N => Out of town this is an oasis Near the house where Ghandi was shot but you have to turn the gauntlet of beggarstuktuk drivers and performing kids just to get thereIt is a  min taxi ride to Red Fort and other attractions Service very good and rooms fine  
N => class From the moment we arrived to the moment we left ab fab Could not fault hotel If to make a minus it would be the price of food in the restraunt Other than that perfect 
N => Golden triangle tour India The Claridges hotel in New Delhi was superb the food in each of the Restaurants was wonderful the rooms have been refurbished recently and are extremely comfortable and well furnished  There are so many little touches that made it a fantastic stay everything you need has been thought of and readily available I did find it unusual that the Spa was single sex at different times of the day but this did not  our stay  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New Delhi  
N => Potentially good   but management dealings with us unacceptable  We had a two night stay and the first night went to plan  Room was as anticipated in a superior category  Good meal in the Chinese restaurant  Great position for hotel  Waiters very polite and friendly although food service very slow  Then all went downhill   returned at pm after a day in Delhi to be accosted by the duty manager because a problem with the plumbing near our room had removed water from half of the rooms  He had been trying to contact us for many hours because engineers needed to gain access to our room for the repair work and we needed to change rooms to allow this to happen  Replacement room much smaller and much less well equipped   bathroom actually quite basic less fruit and no sweet meats but otherwise adequate  As we were checking out during the night we accepted the down grade room rather than make a fuss Curiously the only person who was aware of the quotplumbing problemquot appeared to be the one duty manager despite the devastating effect the quotproblemquot had been having for some hours  We also discovered subsequently that all rooms in Claridges were booked that night and the room we had been asked to vacate was re occupied Our new room unlike the first room overlooked an area of the hotel where parties were held there was a party that night we had not been informed of this and sleep was impossible because of the resulting Bacchanalian like noise  On checkout I spoke to the night duty manager who apologised for the extreme noise  He too was also unaware of the quotplumbing problemquot until we told him  He confirmed also that the room vacated by us was re occupied  The hotel was completely full The speed of the resolution of the quotplumbing problemquot the rapid re allocation of that room to someone else and not back to us and the seeming lack of knowledge of the quotplumbing problemquot by anyone other than the one duty manager amongst many despite its apparent widespread effect for so many hours and the absence of any urgency in resolving the problem the management did not know we would be returning in the late afternoon   we could have planned to stay out until very late all suggest to us that there  have been another reason we were asked to move  Whether there was we cannot be certain but it is difficult to identify any other credible explanation on the information provided by this manager on the th ober  In the end the room downgrade for whatever reason was not acceptable  We feel that we were treated entirely inappropriately by the management of this hotel  It has left a very unpleasant quottastequot  
N => Perfect hotel Friendly smiley service with a buzzing atmosphere  Beautiful room  Afternoon drinks on the lawn  Lovely chinese restaurant  Did not want to leave  We loved this hotel   new favourite in Delhi usually stay at Imperial 
N => Made India tolerable The hotel was beautiful and made my stay in India tolerable  However I mistakenly took  sip of water from the faucet and my stomach was not right for  week  Beware of Indias tap water 
N => Little value for big money This hotel is ideally located in the centre of Delhi but is way too expensive for what it is  The rooms are spacious but bathrooms could do some work  The hotel was under reations when we visited  Internet was extremely expensive  Beware Tthe restaurants at this hotel are also over priced  Also book in advance and be pay online  This will save you from having to bargain at the reception  The first  star hotel that i had to bargain the price  The guy in the in front desk started at  euro We ended up paying about half that amount but left feeling that we were over charged  They asked for an advance charge of  euro per room which was returned on my card but which was charged on my friends card  Paying online would have saved us all this hassle  Not a bad place to stay if you dont mind paying through the nose  On my next trip to Delhi I would look for better deal value wise  
N => TIMELY ROOM SERVICECOURTEOUS STAFF AND A GOOD LOUNGE We had checked in after a hectic business day after doing   rounds of meeting in the ncr region we were immediately ushered into the lounge and provided with our rooms though our stay at the hotel was for a minimal time days  we never had to confront any inconvenience in getting service They have a wonderful Conference Room The Senate for business meetings i would highly recommend this place for business meetings  The staff was very helpful in showing me the entire facilities here They also have a beautiful garden and a lounge bar Ideal amp affordable place if you want to stay in delhi  specially in these days   
N => Great with the basics bad with the extras My friends and I stayed here two nights in a row  The first night we were in a deluxe room we had booked online the deluxe and claridges room were listed at the same rate and the second night we had planned to switch to the Ginger to save money but didnt feel safe we were a group of   something women so returned to the Claridges in a Claridges room Both rooms were great though obviously the deluxe room was bigger and had tile instead of carpeted flooring The service seemed great  We always were warmly welcomed and the front desk staff was very friendly  When we grabbed breakfast the second morning the hostess even remembered our original room number However there were a couple service issues  The first night we discovered the outlets werent working  We called for the electrician and were told he would be coming   minutes later no electrician  My friend called again and they say hed be there right away   minutes later he still hasnt come  My friend called yet again to complain and finally he came  minutes after that a full hour after we originally called Luckily our friends took an hour longer than anticipated to pick us up to go out for the night   otherwise we would have hit the clubs with wet hair The second issue was very frustrating  We had plans to leave at am to drive to Agra  It was important to leave early to beat Delhi rush hour and make it in time to see the Taj and drive to Jaipur before dark  We called for a wake up call at   The receptionist asked if wed like a confirmation call at  and we said yes We received no call and woke up at  when our driver called to see where we were  My friend called to complain and they said that they didnt have us down for a wakeup call  At checkout we complained and then the woman in charge of the wake up call told the manager that she did call and we didnt pick up  We responded that it was            and finally got  rupees taken off our final bill Point of story  stay at the Claridges and enjoy the beautiful garden and amazing mediterranean restaurant  Just dont count on anything outside the pre choreographed dance when it comes to service  Bring your own alarm  
N => Unusual but excellent experience So I understand that other people who have stayed here have had bad experiences and Im not going to dispute those as our experience was probably fairly exceptional  We stayed here for our st wedding anniversary booking into a Claridges Room for one night only as far our budget could stretch  On our internet booking form we mentioned it was our anniversary and so when we arrived they automatically upgraded us to a Club Room which we thought was very nice of them  Upon being in the room for about half an hour we noticed that the room was actually really cold and that the air con wouldnt turn down  We rang through to report this but non one came to fix it  After another while I went out to the lobby to find the duty manager who immediately sent a squadron of people into the room to try and fix it which they couldnt do  We were instead immediately upgraded again this time to the Luxury Suite so by now wed been given the equivalent of  upgrades which was simply stunning  They then delivered  red roses for my wife The service and staff all along were friendly and attentive and the food in the restaurant Dhaba was divine with again excellent service  We only stayed one night so be if wed stayed longer things would have started to go downhill judging from other peoples reviews but I cant really attest to this but essentially we got a  room for  so we werent complaining 
N => Agree   turnaround now I too was part of the trip where a watch was stolen and a couple of strong men tried to get us to sign a letter saying that it was lost in Khan ket  Then the check out clerk asked if we had a good experience quotapart from the theft quot Sorry but this is not okay even by Indian standards  
N => Needs a turnaround   now Facilities are good but the service is terrible  Here is a listing of some of my experiences as well as those of my classmates from Columbia Business School staying at The Claridges this uary My roommate and I had to request a total of about  times to get a phone replaced from our room The hotel ran out of double bed rooms  Many of my classmates had to stay in a room with a king size bed and a cot  Not the most comfortable situation   and they were not offering concessions at the time  Lets see if they change their mind  A classmate had a K watch disappear from her room  She requested to file a police report  The hotel urged her not to file  When finally they realized she had to file they changed the report so that it stated that my classmate knowingly dropped the watch outside of The Claridges premises  This report was rejected three times before a proper report was filed  I was overcharged for Internet usage   the man at the counter had a difficult time using a calculator when I was demonstrating how much I had been overcharged  I asked for a weight scale   the first request was ignored  I called  minutes later to ask about my weight scale  The response   quotOh I am sending someone just now quot  minutes later a guy shows up with a ruler   Though we had booked a conference room in advance we were given their bar as a conference room because they overbooked other rooms  Learned that the best strategy to get food in the restaurants is to order it from three different people   that way one of them might actually bring it to you  Once I arrived at the hotel a gentlemen helped bring my bags to my room  I tipped the guy  rupees and asked him if he would also take my shoes for a shine a shoe shine is complimentary at this place  The guy refused to take my shoes would not even touch my shoes since he was not the shoe guy  He actually called someone to take the shoes since holding shoes would be beneath him  Room internet was not working so I asked IT support to help me out  No one showed up for  minutes  I called to inquire about why  The response was that there was a quotDo not disturbquot sign on the door  I went outside to take a look as the quotDo not disturb signquot was inside my room  It was a quotClean My Roomquot sign  The IT guy showed up  minutes later and tried to prove to me that the internet was working   minutes later he agreed that the internet was not working  No apologies from The Claridges  A classmate ordered a samosa for room service  She specifically asked the guy whether or not the samosa would have nuts as she is allergic to all nuts  The guy assured her that there are no nuts in the samosas  My classmate bit into the samosa to find a cashew  She called down to complain in a panic  The management did not believe her so they sent someone to inspect the samosa  They then asked the room service representative why he did not tell my classmate there would be cashews inside  The guy refused to admit fault and said that my friend was only asking about peanuts Have many more stories but I think you get the point    
N => Comfortable but needs to be updated We stayed in a nd floor non smoking room for  nights in     The room was clean and the beds were super comfortable but the hotel roomsbath had obviously not been updated in a long time whereas the lobby area and bathrooms in the lobby have recenlty had a facelift  Breakfast at the Pickwicks restaurant was outstanding as was the hotel staffservice  We had dinner at Dhaba  in the hotel the first night   excellent Indian food with just the right amount of spice  We ate at the hotels outside restaurant Sevilla mediterranean the next night which was fine but nothing special   also a bit pricey for what it offered  Probably would not stay here again  
N => Awful  Tried as an alternative to the Imperial which is getting a litle bit above itself   wish I had not  Had a second floor club room the lift reations included drilling until pm   Room ok but the cream carpet was filthy in one area and the huge tv was great except the picture was poor  The staff are arrogant service slow and the quotfamousquot bakery shut  I would have expected an explanation apology in the room  Trying to be something its sadly not  
N => Mixed feelings Stayed here three times during ober   Some refurbishment being undertaken which was obtrusive to people in rooms around the pool area on the ground floor  One lift out of use causing huge queues when groups checked in  The oration was good and I have no complaints about my rooms  The check in process was long and even at pm with a booking going back months my room was not ready  The cashier needs to be watched he tried to double charge me twice out of the three visits for my room bill  The rest of the staff were attentive without being obtrusive the food was good plentiful and varied  I would recommend this hotel as it is well located but with the caveats of being prepared to wait for your room and keeping a close eye on what you are charged  
N => A game of two halves My experience was mixed with this hotel having stayed for two nights erated by a week  Overall I would consider it a fine hotel with one or two issues  The entrance and public rooms are appealling but I would advise anyone to avoid a ground floor room if possible like other reviewers we had a dog of a room on the first night clean but smelly with the sheets on the bed feeling idely damp and unpleasant like sleeping in a puddle  The food in the Indian restaurant was in my opinion good and worth the cost and the informal breakfast room was also very acceptable with a varied range of food staff in both were efficient and intent on providing a pleasant experience  Our second room was much better airy bright with good facilities and a small balcony  One gripe I asked a member of staff to change some money before we had been allocated a room and it was as if I had asked him to solve the meaning of life Overall though I would reccomend this hotel as a stop in Delhi good garden to sit and have coffee good location friendly staff in general but just avoid a ground floor room and change some cash after you have booked in 
N => Definitely not worth the price I was part of a group that attended a meeting at the hotel last month  The airconditioning in the rooms was hopeless and switched on and off automatically with the result that the room temperature was either cold or hot   not ideal if one wishes to have a good nights sleep  The hotel was also very noisy with workers working through the night and making so much noise that it seems that they were determined that no one else should sleep  During the meeting the power went off several times and the back up power supply did not seem to work  But this was not the worst experience  After a couple of days of long and tiring field trips outside Delhi we came back to the hotel for our last night to find that the rooms were not ready and several of us were asked to wait until the guests had checked out for their after midnight flights  We could understand this happening when one arrives in the morning but at pm this was never heard of considering that each one of us had booked weeks ahead  As this affected several of us it was clear that this was not a mistake but a deliberate management ploy to make money by renting each room twice in a single night  So any body thinking of staying at the Claridges be warned 
N => underwhelming experience this was a disappointing experience     on arriving we had to change the room as the first option stank of smoke    the new room had a leaky bathroom and noisy aircon although was otherwise ent    the breakfast was good although there is no excuse for clearing it away at   when they are meant to be serving till     the staff were generally pleasant and aspired to be helpful though were often clueless about delhi    the amenities were poorly staffed and substandard dirty pool unstaffed business centre not very good massage    while this wasnt a disaster I thought for the price they were charging it should have been a lot more slick    
N => Claridges Delhi This hotel was nothing more than average   but quite expensive The food was good but average too   but very expensive  We ate out after the first night at a  of the rate The rooms were clean but the AC was quite noisy They should offer free wifi at the room rates they charge The gym is small but well equiped the sauna average the whirlpool doesnt work  
N => Best part of two weeks in India We were given the Claridge through our package tour  The lodging was a highlight of the trip thanks to the hospitality and facilities  We loved the food at the Senate Club and made friends with the staff there  Everybody at the reception was first class  We loved our room and do not hesitate to recommend the Claridge  
N => excellent hotel for first night in india This was an ideal first night for the triangle tour we spent  days here and could not fault the rooms service or food Room service was very efficient and the staff were all very pleasant  We spent our last night of the tour here in the club delux rooms fantastic breakfast served in private dining room very quiet and relaxing other hotels would do well to copy this idea  The only disappointment was the lack of an indoor pool and games room but well done Claridges good value   
N => Not bad but not the best We two couples stayed here for our last night of a two week tour basically the quotgolden trianglequot  The hotel is in a peaceful  green and low density part of New Delhi   but fairly central  The check in was pleasant and efficient and our room much larger than expected and well equipped TV mini bar bathroom but surprisingly empty of furniture bed two chairs I think and that was about it  And yes we too had the quotcats urinequot smell to contend with in the room probably an ammonia based cleaning product  I have experienced this before in Puerto Rico and the smell went after a few hours but it wasnt great  We sat around the pool in the enclosed courtyard and were rather disappointed both by the time it took for tea to be ordered and arrive and by the somewhat surly refusal to serve beer quotoutdoorsquot neither pool side nor on the front lawn  This was in stark contrast to The Park hotel a mile or so away where we stayed at the start of our holiday  There the pool side service was very rapid very pleasant and without restriction  It seems that Claridges is subject to a local bye law   but if The Park isnt bothered why are they On the plus side the highlight of this hotel for us was Dharba a mock up of a truck drivers road side restaurant with excellent food very friendly and humorous staff and very reasonable prices  It was packed out the first night and almost as full the next   so book The comparison with the appalling Bukhara restaurant at the Sheraton which we foolishly went to two weeks previously was extraordinary  At Dharba we paid something like   of the Bukharas outrageous bill for better food much more efficient and friendly service and even got a knife and fork each fingers are the rule at Bukhara We had to linger at the hotel after check out   until  pm   because our flight home was in the early hours  The hotel kindly allowed us to stay in the rooms till   pm without charge we then went sight seeing again  They also arranged two good modern cars to take us to the airport without charging excessively  So all in all this was not quite as good as The Park but not a bad experience   and the Dharba takes some beating 
N => Beats Le Meridien hands down We were meant to be starting and ending our honeymoon in India at Le Meridien New Delhi but had to stay in The Claridges for the first couple of nights instead  We loved it straight away and didnt realise how spoilt we would be until we ended up in Le Meridien ten days later The service in The Claridges was simply sensational as was the food  The staff were not surly as in Le Meridien but very friendly and professional  When looking for the beauty parlour my wife was taken by a restaurant manager of the Jade Garden which I found to be excellent in spite of my not liking Chinese food all the way to the other side of the hotel   this being in the middle of dinner service  We also had the best cocktails ever in the bar where we were entertained by a thoroughly nice and very friendly barman  My wife said that their own quotSip and Swingquot cocktail was the best she had ever had and I must admit I thought it was up there too  He even went to the trouble to arrange a table for us in one of their busy restaurants as we had forgotten to do this beforehand The food in the hotel was far superior to anything in Le Meridien   Dhaba was brilliant especially when compared to the Pakwan restaurant in the latter but also because not only were the staff so very nice on a busy night the food was out of this world  I can also recommend the Dal Makhani in the Pickwicks restaurant All in all we wish we could have stayed here longer and definitely not in Le Meridien  The service there was disgusting and give me the s style elegance and far superior service of The Claridges over the really trendy but ultimately nothingness of Le Meridien anytime 
N => great stay We spent our first two nights here of a  day India trip  We had booked a superior room but were upgraded to a suite although I am pretty sure the hotel was not fully booked  This is great service that we much appreciated  
N => Mismanaged and needs rehab I stayed one night in y   and four nights in ust    Both times they gave me spacious rooms  and  American second floor and first floor  The first time i went in late  The room was very much OK  but next morning after showering the bath room was large though overflowed with water from the shower handheld spray and tub  It was awful  The same problem persisted in   I drew this to the attention of the management  They did some minor fixing like two bath curtains loosened some diverter etc  But the problem persisted and the last day i took a meager wash  Room  is next to a parking lot and i could not open my drapes throughout to protect privacy  There were two half inch size flying insects one night   had a fruit basket but  had none  The hotel has a tendency to bill you high  The taxi from the hotel was four times more expensive than the local taxi  Forget the laundry the price was higher than prices in USA   Special restaurants like Sevilla were not attractive but pricey for no reason  The only one i ate was in their coffee shop Pickwick the canaloni was not consistent between white sauce and red sauce but not bad  If you go to the Claridge ask for Sankar rooms  and  or similar rooms  At least they are spacious and some are not next to parking lots and hopefully no overflowing bathrooms   The hotel is intended for Americans who do not know there are forty rupees to the dollar  Siva Sankar fifty four year US citizen from US gold coast Nassau county NY 
N => A very pleasant hotel  of us traveled to India in uary  Our first hotel was the Claridges  Our room was very pleasant and the location worked well for us  The highlight was the hotel restaurant Dhaba  And the bakery was quite good as well  
N => Oh dear Not going back  Having had a wonderful and spoiling holiday all round India it was very sad to end up here for two nights  We arrived late and one room was OK but the other one smelt too terrible and was not the suite we had been promised  After a long time they offered to change it   like a similar reviewer it was another ground floor room near the booming DJ down the ble passage  None of the Indian charm or service that we had been given elsewhere was visible  Not a good place to start or end a holiday  
N => Food poisoning plus other problems  Buyer beware To begin with   a number of problems that other reviewers have already noted  the swimming pool and sorrounding area does not seem to have been updated since the s or thereabouts  I was initially given a room that looked on to a wall a few feet away despite prior assurances via email that an internet booking did not mean getting the leftover rooms no one else wanted   the room rate was very high relative to quality of amenities and inferior to what other similarly priced hotels can offer in Asia e g Four Seasons  And to make matters worse tax was charged on the rack rate not the actual room rate I was paying this was explained as government policy which it  be Now the more important stuff   The main problem was the food  On day three evening I was struck down by acute nausea vomiting diarrhoea stomach cramps profuse sweating followed by cold shivers  Please note that I had not eaten anywhere outside the hotel since I had arrived from UK so it could only be the hotel food  I should say that this was worst food poisoning I have ever had I could not lift my head up from my knees for half an hour after the worst phase of diarrhoea  I have travelled extensively in Africa and Asia so my stomach has plenty of other experiences to compare this to  With some effort I was able to call a friend and the hotel dor  calls were needed before he arrived and get some medicine to treat the problem  Although the worst was over by around midnight the cramps continued through most of the night until whatever it was worked its way through my system  Two days later when checking out I only ate yogurt and bananas the rest of the time while I was there I had to press the hotel management very forcefully but politely and publicly in the lobby to persuade them that they should reduce their charges in compensation for this painful experience  And I asked them to email me to let me know what steps they have since taken to make sure no other hotel visitors will go through the same experience in the future  They said they were already investigating the causes and promised they would email when they had resolved the cause of the problem  But so far three weeks later I have yet to hear a word from them  I will be writing to them to remind them of their promise 
N => Did not like this hotel Did not enjoy our stay in this hotel It started while we were checking in Internet booking clearly stated in writing that the rate of the room per day was   USD per day but they tried to charge   USD per day The pool was not as attractive as it could have been art o type of rooms might be fashionable in Delhi but it is not the style we are looking for while staying in a hotel  All together not impossible place to stay but definitely not a place where I would stay again 
N => best to avoid this hotel   go to Oberoi instead My husband and I would not recommend the Claridges hotel  We stayed there for  nights because we got a good deal but it was not worth it  The front desk staff will try and scam you into upgrading your room and paying more in the luxury tax     They overcharged us when we checked out by lying and saying the rack rate had changed for the whole hotel on our last night  It was extremely unprofessional and frustrating Other negatives the breakfast is not that good the pool is dirty and not chlorinated we were really disappointed about not being able to swim the gym is small  We needed to call a particular cab company and the hotel kept trying to make us take one of the taxis that is based at their hotel Some positives our room was very large and clean the Jade restaurant was just lovely If you ide to stay at The Claridges please be prepared to put up a fight and expect to be taken advantage of  We spent our last two nights in Delhi at the Oberoi Hotel on golf course and even though it cost a bit more it is in a totally superior class  Everything was up front and absolutely perfect  We highly recommend booking here instead 
N => Not up to scratch for its rating We did not expect Claridges to be up to the standard of the Imperial and we were not wrong  The hotel was still undergoing some reation work and we found ourselves awake most of the night listening to furniture and equipment being dragged around the room above ours despite repeated calls to reception and a am visit from an in effectual duty manager who at first denied any work was going on until we were all nearly overcome with paint fumesThe themed hotel restaurant was suposed to resemble a roadhouse  The food was bland and the atmosphere phoney  Our bedroom was ok but the curtain was hanging off and the bathroom was too small  One to avoid 
N => Poor just poor The reception manager was really rude too I have re read the reviews of this hotel   just in case I was misjudging this hotel unfairly  But no  My view shared by many it seems is that this hotel is hardly a  star  The main reception has been stly redeveloped but the rooms which afterall are important when all you really want is a comfortable clean and secure facility for sleeping supported by helpful staff and ent food too But the reality of the Claridges is poor quality furniture   no hot water ever Cramped small rooms which are overpriced and a restaurant that is bleak and lacking in any charm However what really differentiates this hotel is the really appalling response from the management when you had a serious problem   as regrettably we did  When we returned from a lovely dinner at the Imperial not as expensive as some people would have you believe   and fab foodsetting too   we were shocked to find that some medicaton had been removed from our bedroom at the Claridges  I called the front desk and asked whether someone could possibly have accidentally removed them in error  The front desk  duty manager was disinterested and suggested that we might have lost the tablets ourselves  We rechecked and rechecked and could tell that our medicines had been removed stolen to be more precise  This is a very serious accusation to make and not one that I make lightly I asked to speak to the manager   this was now nearly two hours later and the hotel still had not done anything to try to address the problem  They refused to get the manager  The duty manager was hostile and aggressive I asked for the police phone number as I now wished to report this to the police  He again refused  I asked several times and eventually managed to get the phone number myself and proceeded to report the theft personally The police arrived and were very helpful  I was told there had been similar problems at this hotel although could not confirm this myself  It was only through the insistence of the Police Chief that the hotel agreed to conduct an invesitgation and arrange for the tablets to be replaced Three hours later now the middle of the night the hotel phoned me in my room and woke me up to tell me I could come to the front desk and collect replacement tablets  Unbelieveable Still unbelieveable was that I went to the front desk   only to find that they had got the wrong medication I ended my stay at this hotel several days early   and checked out of this hotel the next morning   in part because of the theft   but mainly because of the attitude of the Duty Manager I should like to thank the police who were friendly helpful and reassuring at all times  The hotel management should however be viewed with great suspicion  I would not recommend this hotel  
N => Okay for weary travellors Although I was underwhelmed by the s facade and dreary designer imitation lobby the room was spacious and the bed an absolutely comfortable highlight  Our room didnt have a pool or garden view  We looked onto a parking lot  But to make up for it we had  super size plasma televisions  I guess that cheered us up a bit  There was a bad smell in the room  My boyfriend thought it was from the teak floors   be the polish or something It was pretty nasty The bathroom was ble  Okay except that it didnt have a bath and the hot water never ran hot or even very warm despite many demands  The restaurant Corbetts was kind of fun and delicious  I did enjoy that  But the breakfast restaurant was just adequate  Overall Delhis not the greatest place anyway  If youve just gotten off a  hour flight from North America and you want somewhere to get over your jetlag for two nights this is an okay choice  
N => here right now and not impressed mmm Claridges   delusions of grandeuridentitiy crisis  NOthing special compared to many other top Indian hotels  Looking tatty in some areas  If they are doing some reations fine but theres no signage to indicate this  Over jealous staff lining up but thats normal I thinkHad to move rooms as despite their promotional material stating that all guest rooms have a garden or pool view this is not the case  The solution they clean the ble floor with stinks pretty bad and has a nasty lingering latrine smell  I can also hear taps running and toilets flushing through the air con system be Ive been spoilt in other hotels   
N => Nice Delhi Hotel Without Going  star  
N => Nice hotel to stay if you plan to visit the US Consulate  
N => Pas le meilleur de sa categorie mais bien situ  et service efficace  
N => Best not to stay Tiny rooms arrogant staff and an average breakfast  Rooms have no character everything is just moderate  
N => Average clean hotel We had a suite were wecomed with cookies and a fruit basket and enjoyed the spaciousness  We had numerous breakfasts lunches and a memorable dinner with traditional Indian music  At the end we had a problem because our checkout time was noon and we didnt get picked up for the airport until  p m  We tried to arrange for more time but a seedly little man with bottle bottom glasses told us that we would have to pay  for the extra time and when we didnt like that he tried to negotiate and asked quotWhat would you be willing to payquot At that point we ided it was time to get out  
N => An average place An average hotel  Everything is lukewarm about the hotel  From the welcome at the reception to the rooms to the restaurant there is nothing to rave about  First at the check in they try to be as classy as possible but one can easily see that its missing  You know they are making an effort but you know its not coming naturally  Then the rooms   the room which I stayed at provided a view of the hockey stadium besides it  It was green but not exactly the green I was looking for  the good part was that there was no disturbance in the view due to the stadium  The size of the room seemed a bit small than other hotel rooms and seemed like as if the bed was touching all the four walls  The bedsheets and towels were clean and the bed was well laid out  Atleast that was one area I could not complain  Room service was good  Though the food served was average  I had visited the restaurant downstairs but again the fare was average  The breakfast served in the morning was continental and the spread was good  So one had some choice  All in all its much cheaper than a five star and situated in a nice place in delhi as well as it is centrally located  Connht place is also a nice place to take a stroll in the evening  
N => Very pleasant stay We were in room no    we had very comfortable staybreakfast was lavishstaff very cooperative enjoyed shopping in connht place as we could reach by foot  
N => Dont stay at the Connht if you can avoid it Room modern clean and ok Desk staff not very helpful Very expensive although we didnt pay directlyFoyer furniture very dirty  
N => The Connht was a pleasant surprise The Connht Hotel far exceeded our expectations as we had read too many negative reports on this site  Our airline and agent both recommended this hotel and we are so glad we took their advice  Due to last minute changes of our ETA a hotel driver was still there to greet us at Delhi airport when we landed at   am  Reception staff warmly greeted us that morning and ever after as we stayed  nights  Twice the excellent Bowhani ction restaurant was opened for us for breakfast at   am to meet early pickups  Each morning and evening saw us dining from an excellent menu with delightful table service and live Indian music was performed  nights per week  The room was clean adequate and fresh fruit and cookies were replaced each day to accompany the tea making facilities  Fresh flowers orated our room and glorious gladioli displays in the bright clean lobby area were changed almost daily  The central position in New Delhi makes the hotel easily accessible  Even more so when the new Metro station next door opens for the Commonwealth Games   We will definitely return to the Connht to stay next time  
N => Disgraceful This hotel was the last place we stayed during an  day trip in India and Nepal and was booked through Max Holidays India a customized trip for me and my wife The entire trip up until our stay here was wonderful but this hotel was a disgrace  There was mold in the bathroom the bedding was moist from mildew and the place smelled and was filthy the room restaurant hall carpets etc  My wife and I have traveled extensively all over the world the last  years and this was by far the worst experience  If I could rate it worst than terrible I would  Dont even consider staying here  To quotadd insult to injuryquot they apparently charged  for the nights stay disgraceful Tom LinkousScottsdaleArizonaUSA 
N => Rats We have just returned home from what was a fantastic tour of AmritsarDaramshala and Shimla   only to have the whole experience spoiled by our Connht experience  When we went to bed we could hear a scrabbling noise coming from behind the fridge in our room  Maintenance were called and they had a look and said there were two rats there and they would put a quotgum boardquot down and that would get rid of them An hour later we called again and another man arrived and repeated the quotgum boardquot treatment   it did work after another hour of us laying listening to the gnawing sound of these rats At  a m  it stopped and we could sleep   uneasily   before our long day and flight back to UK   never again will we stay there and this was on the th floor We complained to the manager the next day and he offered to extend our stay in the room so we could catch up on some sleep 
N => Avoid    I dont know how some people can rate this property as reasonable   I wonder how many hotels they have experienced    This hotel is lousy  I stayed here in tember last year and I still have vivid memories of how bad this was  The rooms are tiny dark dingy smelly and way overpriced  There was nothing positive about this hotel   except the location  Suprisingly though there was a worse hotel to come during our trip Mohan International in Amritsar   As I was on a business trip with collegues we had to return to this hotel for a night after a visit to Agra amp Jaipur and this time we received a refurbished room which was only ginally better   For anyone contemplating this hotel   avoid  I am sure there are far better standard class hotels in Delhi than this    
N => Fine for a short stay My husband and I stayed at the Connht for  nights in ch   We were a little hesitant after reading some of the Trip Advisor reviews but we thought the hotel was fine especially as it was our first  days in India and we expected much worseThe room was clean spacious and nicely furnished  The bathroom smelled a little musty but this didnt bother us too much  What did bother us was a phone outside our room which rang early in the morning every  minutes or so  I think reception use this to get staff to look over the rooms when guests check out  I appreciate this is necessary but we did find it annoying  We ate in the coffee shop on one of the nights  I stuck to vegetarian food which was tasty but my husbands chicken tasted a little off and he was ill later that night  I didnt feel that the hotel amenities were advertised well enough for instance we didnt realise there was a bar and restaurant on site  We wouldntve gone to the coffee shop had we knownThe hotel was fine for those wanting a short stay on a budget  
N => Perfectly adequate city hotel We stayed here for two nights in ruary  Our room was not that large but perfectly comfortable  Laundry was done in a day and returned without problem  Hotel is a typical city hotel in a good central position  We ate in the restaurant the first night and it was fine  The second night we treated ourselves to dinner at The Imperial   an amazing luxury hotel a taxi ride away  Breakfast was fine although the restaurant was very busy  We had a two nightone day stop in Delhi and this hotel was fine  Nothing spectacular but we were satisfied with the room and service  
N => Better than expected Some of the reviews by previous visitors worried me but our room was fine and more than adequate  The breakfast was fine included and the dinner we had there was very good    They even had a small Indian musical group at dinner  Id stay there again  orations and cleanliness were very good  It being the weddding season     added to the festive atmosphere at the hotel  At least two receptions were held there  This hotel was selected by our tour company Holidays to Treasure which provided us a very good private tour of Rajastan and the Golden Triangle  
N => Not Recommeded Dull dingy and rude can best describe our  nights at The Connht  The carpet in our room was very dirty the towels and bed linens were old and dingy and the staff was rude  Even though we charged  minutes of internet use to our room and signed a slip for it we were called repeatedly by the front desk and told we had a bill at the desk that had to be paid immediately  Others in our group were awakened at  p m  at night to sign a slip for something they charged to their room  Pigeons started gathering on our window sill every morning at  a m    leaving behind lots of their dirty work so we never opened the drapes  We would not recommend this hotel  
N => Dissapointing We recently stayed here during the cold wave  The Hotel was freezing no heating  Our room was really cold especially the ble floor  The room was also very small averagely clean but the double glazed window was very murky blocking out the view Breakfast was the high point  The dining room was warm and the food was good Service was good also  
N => disappointing We were disappointed with this hotel  Our room was musty the carpet was dirty the linen was a shade of grey and not white  The air conditioning was noisy and we felt like prisoners in our dark room as the only outside window was covered due I think to site works going on outside  I would rather have had the light and looked at the site worksAfter a word with our travel agent we did manage to get an upgrade which was more satisfactory The restaurant was dark and dreary and the staff were not up to the standard we had experienced in other hotels we had stayed in  Our son was very ill after eating there on our last night in Delhi so be the restaurant needs to look at its hygiene practices  We had only eaten there that day   breakfast and dinner Front desk was fine and processed our booking efficiently  The door greeters were most pleasant and helpful However I would be reluctant to recommend this hotel to friends although the location is its saving grace  Really handy to good shops  
N => This Hotel is OK I feel I must post a review as the reviews I have read about this hotel paint it as awful I did not want to stay here amp had a running battle with our Indian travel agent who insisted We stayed here for  nights at the beginning of our   week tour of North India amp were delighted when we finally opened the door to our room after our long plane trip to find a recently refurbished clean room with flat screen TV amp new airconditioning  Breakfast was great the staff friendly amp overall a very good place to begin our tour  We arrived during Dewali festival amp our only complaint was the air quality  
N => Great cookies at the Connht We were very apprehensive about this hotel after reading the reviews on this site  Although the rooms are quite small the ensuite bathroom was clean and worked well   The fruit bowl and welcoming cookies were most appreciated as we arrived quite late and had not had a lot to eat plus the bottled water and the kettle for early morning tea or coffee  Our room overlooked the stadium and we found the activities interesting to watch  Our stay fell on a Sunday and it was easy and safe to walk the streets around the hotel The breakfast buffet was excellent and the fresh omelette bar was quite funky but also produced a type of indian pancake too  We did try to stick to Indian food throughout our stay to minimise tummy troubles    and were for the most part successful  
N => Good Central Hotel We stayed here for  nights  Our rooms had been updated and a good standard  They were rooms facing the road not hockey pitch  The location right next to Connht Square was great  We were able to go out to local shops to get some good bargains Looking at other reviews we were concerned at having to stay but overall thought it was a good hotel very close to what was going on  We would stay there again 
N => I liked this hotel We stayed at the Connht at the end of our tour of Rajasthan  I dont quite understand the other negative comments here as the hotel was perfectly pleasantOur room wasnt big but Ive stayed in much smaller and it was clean modern and very comfortable  We had to phone reception to find out how to turn off the aircon but then it was fine  The bathroom was a bit dated but perfectly clean and pleasant  The bed was comfy  My only real negative would be that it wasnt very Indian it could have been any city across the world  But I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to a friend looking for a ent midrange hotel in Delhi  
N => Not recommendable I stayed at the Connht for  nights on a business trip  Small room with amazingly filthy carpet which forced me to sleep with my socks on  Bathroom was just acceptably clean I was unable to look out of my window due to a sort of curtain hiding it from the outside probably related to ongoing maintainance work and felt like in a prison cell  Checkout procedure totally inefficient Should be rated and priced     stars  
N => Pretty Good I notice some mixed reviews here but our experience was pretty good i have to admit  We had no check in problems and our room was very neat and clean with not complaints be a touch on the small side  I actually couldnt find anything to fault this place  Comparitively its probably a little pricey and ive noticed some massive fluctuations in room tarrif  Knowing India if youve managed a cheaper tarrif they would almost certainly keep this in mind and give you a dodgeyer room and probably sneer here and there  I strugged to find them on the web and went through an agent  Their email is       in which is their owner body email address or phone        I liked this place and would recommend it based on our experience  Its right in the middle of colaba which is the place to be but about   mins from the airport  When we asked someone to arrange a transfer for us it cost of about Rs but we got a prepaid cab from the traffic police booth for Rs  You have to fight your way past all the scouts and cheats who will charge you about Rs but ask inside the terminal where the prepaid taxi stand is if you cant find it  mail me on scorpioscorpion hotmail com if you want to know anything else   have fun 
N => A ent  star hotel A good  star hotel We had a room at the th floor  The view outside had a hockey ground Rooms were clean and neat  But they were quiet small However the restuarant is very slow to serve anything  It was rather frustrating as we had a train to catch  
N => One to be avoided This hotel is not a good welcome to Delhi or India  Our room was on the th floor and was small and dirty  I hate to think what was living in the carpet and the valance was stained  It is very dated and in desparate need of refurbishment and a good clean  We were due to return to this hotel at the end of our tour but asked our travel company to check us in to a different hotel  It is supposed to be a  star but in our view it definitely isnt  
N => Dumpsville I ended up there for  night on business so not my choice or money  The company paid usd night which has to be the worst value for money in the whole of Asia  To be fair Delhi is expensive for hotels and getting more so think  for   in the busy season but even so I chatted to an Aussie couple who had paid  but even at that price I wouldnt stay there again  be  if i was paying out of my own pocket but thats about it The place had a rundown feel to it very scruffy in general and shabby rooms  The bar had the ambience of a Mcdonalds and they hadnt even bothered to clean the tables  Only plus point is the central location but the immediate area is a dump  The staff were pretty good too  
N => We have buffet breakfast This was our first Indian Experience  After the rush and smell smoky of our drive at night from Delhi Airport we were greeted warmly at this hotel  On the way up to our room the porter very proudly announced that they had a quotbuffet breakfastquot  Our hotel had been downgraded at my husbands request to reflect a more Indian Hotel  This we found out later was where Indian businessmen and families stayed  Less touristy although of course there were still plenty of tourists  It was pleasant enough and the breakfast was good although a little crowded when everyone tries to have breakfast at the same time  Central location easy walking distance to path  The staff were fine although they did hover a little for tips  This was to be expected as they probably were paid less than in some other hotels  
N => Clean but basic   
N => A Room Lottery  
N => An overpriced dump   star or less   
N => Bad Area Not that great location amp hotel just hyped room without window and noisy as on the street  
N => Exceeded our expectations We booked our stay after reading the reviews in tripadvisor com The Hotel has a wonderful website which enabled us to book online on their online booking system and we got cheaper rates we wanted to make sure that we get a confirmed reservation to avoid last minute surprises  Communicated by email regarding the Airport pickup before my arrival and all emails were replied to and the best part was I got the Hotel booking confirmation within  minutes of my booking with the online system  Driver met me at the airport as promised This being our first trip to India  We were rather apprehensive about staying in a non  hotel  min outside the centre of Delhi  However we took the risk and we were glad of doing so  Florence Inn was great excellent value for money  The rooms were clean the beds very comfortable the service was courteous and friendly  The food at the lobby level restaurant was superb in fact it rates amongst the best meals we had on the whole trip  Florence Inn is close to the Metro which is safe and easy to use  We did do a bit of local shopping Staff were super friendly spoke good English and roombathroom were spacious and clean  Wi Fi internet was available on each floor  Over all the FLORENCE INN was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel to families as well as to single travelers or couples  
N => Satisfactory place I recently styaed at the Florence Inn for a total of  nights  On the whole I do not have any serious complaints or concerns about the place  By mistake id booked into Florence Hotel rather than Florence Inn  Judging by other reviews on this sight Florence Hotel does not appear to have as many favourable reviews as Florence Inn  However after a few emails they quickly changed the reservation at no expense or fuss The hotel itself is conveniently located on a side street with the metro stop only a couple minutes walk away  There a a couple of ent restaurants just off the main drag Punjab Corner and Suruchi which serves  types of regional thalis   Gujurati Punjabi or Rajasthani  It felt safe around the areas We were upgraded to a Premium Room at no extra cost for no apparent reason and the room was more than adequate in terms of size and cleanliness  The buffet breakfast was a choice of either spicy Indian or bland western fare which was nothing to write home about but served its purpose My only gripe about the place is the extorinate prices they charge for their taxi service  For example for the taxi ride to the station they charged us rs  The journey back from the station we used the pre paid taxi which cost us rs  Luckily we used the pre paid service from the airport which came to rs as opposed to the rs or so they were charging Overall all though the experience was pleasant enough and would probably recommend this place  Rooms are clean and a ent size but the atmosphere somewhat sterile  
N => loved the castle We have just returned from a week at the florence inn  The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before  It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel  It was so hot and busy there  All the staffs were friendly and helpfull  initially I Tried to book with the hotel directly but I found reservation manager was beat harsh and was not willing to give us a good rate  later on I booked through one of my family friend  As soon as we reached hotel I saw a lovely person standing with smiling facesudenhdu  He made my stay very happy by giving me a nice room  I found some thing very bad i e Mr  Ashish loby manager was not at all good enough  He called us so many times in our room extn  asking about further trips to india  he was trying to organise our trips to india where as I never asked him about  I met another manager Avtar in the front desk who was very sweet and nice person I will definetely recomend this hotel for guest coming to Dellhi  
N => Clean Hotel Busy Surroundings Since this was our first visit to India we were really were not prepared for the culture shock  We were glad to be picked up by the hotel however at a ridiculously high price of Rs which they later charged us  However we did manage to escape all the sharks scary looking taxi amp autodrivers tour operators waiting outside the airport ready to pounce on us  When we got to the hotel we were greeted by two men at the reception both not all that pleasant  We checked in and the room was actually quite nice  Had a nice ambience yet felt a bit detached  The bathroom was nice everything worked  Best thing was the SONY flat screen TV We didnt want to go out of the room since we were still nauseous by the Delhi traffic and the poverty we saw outside but then ided to get changed and went down to eat at the Hotel restaurant  The restaurant was an extremely tight  m x  m closed space  We were two women alone in the restaurant with four men waiters and I have never felt so uncomfortable and insecure in my life  We were constantly stared at  We got the food to be takeaway and locked ourselves in our rooms and stayed there the whole night  The next morning we were relieved to see another tourist in the restaurant and more so thereafter Overall the stay here was quite pleasant  The surrounding area was busy a bit dirty but the staff was pretty helpful  Theres only one computer for Internet access which is at the reception  For downloading pics from our cameras we went to the office and were pleasantly surprised to see the owner Mr  Jaydeep Bhat there  He was most helpful and kind  Even got us tea while we transferred photos and patiently sat there with us and talked for almost an hourI would recommend this hotel for Delhi if youre looking for clean rooms at a good price Due to complete lack of female staff it can be a bit intimidating being surrounded by staring men  One tip Always carry a business card of the hotel  It has a map of where the hotel is located  Most autowallahs dont know where it is and you will need to direct them here  You can obtain the card from the reception desk  
N => Nice hotel We stayed here twice during our trip around the Golden Traingle  The hotel was organised as part of our tour  Our first time we got a very standard room but the second time it was a much nicer room  The hotel is clean and the staff are attentive  The minute you step out of your room when checking out there is someone to help you with your bags  A little hectic in the morning with everyone checking out at the same time  Breakfeast was not as good as the other hotels I stayed in India  The metro is close by but we did not use it  
N => Average hotel The hotel accommodation was ok    ent enough for  people    but were got worried about the noise cause the rooms are not so noise proofed    we can hear people from the other room showering and their baby crying    my girlfriend jess was not able to sleep at all    breakfast was ok though    and we love the location    its in the affordable shopping district    
N => Not a great hotel We arrived in Delhi at around am and after an arduous journey trying to find the hotel the taxi driver didnt know it at all we arrived at the Hotel Florence  We were not allowed to check in but were despatched immediately to the sister hotel the Florence Inn being told there was no room left at this hotel  Language barrier prevented us from complaining so we went along to the Florence Inn The rooms arent unclean but just wasnt very comfortable  We had a single sheet and a single blanket on a double bed and the towels felt old  The staff were not very friendly or accommodating but did help us when asked  The breakfast was limited we had toast and the tablecloths were dirty  I didnt feel I could trust anything else to eat I suppose all in for a budget hotel in this part of town it was okay but I would make sure next time that I was somewhere more central and a bit higher class   you have to remember that   in many parts of India are not the same as   in the UK  
N => Clean and Comfortable The Florence inn was a transit hotel for us  We missed our flight and didnt anticipate spending  nights there  It was clean and comfortable  The water was always hot  We stayed in twin rooms the service was prompt even when we locked ourselves out at am  Rooms are probably a little small but worth the money and there is free internet in the lobby  The view isnt too exciting but its not very central to Dehli  There were kets close to the hotel and lots of good eateries  The small restaurant did both indian and western breakfast and was really convenient for quick snacks in the day but also had full lunch and dinner available  A good clean and comfortable stay  Probably a  star experience  
N => Good clean but v little natural light There are two sister hotels Florence inn and Hotel florence both in Karol Bagh and apparently more or less the same  We stayed in Hotel Florence which was very clean and a good hotel for our first few nights in Delhi  Room service and the restaurant were good and reasonably priced  Staff were friendly enough and we got a complimentary breakfast for booking through Desiya com Karol Bagh was an OK area lots of sari shops and clothes nearby but little else  Also very little in the way of restaurants  Its closish to the metro though which is definately the quickest cheapest and most pleasant way of getting into the centre of town Rs  each way plus a Rs rickshaw ride to from hotel to station The only issue I had with the room was that the window faced into a shaft through which we got very little natural light which made getting up difficult Price was about Rs  per night or a little over that  Would reccommend for garunteed cleanliness  
N => ent  close to the subway Not being able to afford the five stars Delhi seemed a really hard place to find good value accommodation  After reading a couple of good reviews we went with the Florence Inn and all in all were satisfied with that Still one would think that a  deluxe room  would come with at least one window which it didn t and the neighbourhood Karol Bagh is not especially trendy  However we felt entirely safe in the surroundings and the nearby shopping street is good for clothes and lots more One main advantage with Florence Inn is its proximity to a station of the newly built and well functioning Delhi metro   it s clean cheap rather comfortable and very practical although not covering south Delhi One complaint upon departure we booked and paid quite a lot for an airport taxi ride  That taxi showed up more than  minutes late and turned out to be some ky private car with the managers buddy behind the wheel He got us to the airport all right but such a pathetic mini rip off meant we left Florence Inn with a bit of a bad aftertaste  
N => Not a great start to India I booked this hotel as it seemed to have good reviews on Tripadviser  Although it wasnt too bad the rooms were comfortable and clean we just didnt like the feel of the hotel Everyone just seemed to hover around you musty smells everywhere Bad aircon breakfast was interesting and in a room no larger than a standard bathroom  Location was safe just typical India really  Very interesting area to walk around but probably not at nightDelhi isnt cheap but I would reccomend spending more for your hotels here  
N => Stay away I booked a room through a travel agent for  nights for three of us  I was told we would either receive one double bed and one twin bed or  twin beds  What we got was  twin beds and a mattress on the floor wedged in between the other  beds and dresser  The room was very run down and tiny  We had to climbed over each others beds to get to the bathroom  The air conditioning unit dripped all night long on one of the beds and it was musty and dirty  Ive stayed in many low budget rooms in India before and this was the worst  The pictures I saw on the hotel website were not what our room looked like at all  And not that it mattered to us but our room was on the th floor and the elevator only goes to the rd floor so if walking upstairs is difficult keep that in mind  
N => Good Value in Delhi  
N => well worth the money  
N => location crowded not scary  
N => No fiable  
N => No good food for vegetarians I was  months pregnant hence i was given the best available hotels for the business trip to ensure that my trip is comfortable  But it turned out to be a bit pathetic as i was a vegetarian and there was hardly any good food for vegetarians  Additionally the food cost was also very high  The ambiance was good rest all the amenities were good but my only worry was about the food which was not upto my satisfaction  Im not sure if non veggies would be happy to stay there  I stayed there for almost  days more than myself i was worried about my baby who was yet to see the world  Thanks to GOD this stay didnt affect my health and i had a delivered a healthy baby girl on th y   Thats it from my end  
N => Not worth the money If you try to find a hotel in Delhi that is somewhere between a   a night  star and a   flea pit you will be disappointed  There seems to be very little in the way of nice reasonably priced hotels in Delhi  We thought that we had done the exception with The Grand Inn   but we were sadly mistaken We arranged for a pick up from the airport but there was no sign of anyone when we arrived so we phoned the hotel who gave us the drivers mobile  It turned out that the driver was waiting outside because he wanted to keep the    that you have to pay to enter the airport  Ok we thought these things happen no problem at all  So we followed the driver to the crappiest car you could imagine  We were surprised it even moved when it had to go downhill  And his driving style made me wish that the seatbelts had been left in the car rather than be cut out  Still no problem  This is India these things happen We had booked a suite   and we got the one that is on their leafletwebsite  Like many hotels in India the bed consists of an undersheet and a blanket   there is no top sheet  We took a look at the blanket and sheet and ided to sleep on our sleeping bag  But no problem this is India Both the room and the bathroom had seen better days many of them in fact  But since we only slept in the room we did not mind too much after all this is India  We stayed in many places on our trip to India and this place was the worst  It would have been acceptable at be   a night   but you have to be the type of person who does not mind staying grotty noisy run down places in order to save a few quid  We had agreed a rate before we went and were expecting some tax to be added   but we ended up getting over   quottaxquot added to our bill and paying about   a night  This place was definitely not worth it The hotel itself is a bit out from the main sights in Delhi but it is easy to get a auto rickshaw in and out about  rupees and it takes about  mins to Connht Place  It is on a busy enough road and as the other reviewers commented there is nothing to seedo around the hotel  If I were to go back I think that I would take my chances with one of the places around Connht Place that gets the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor  At least if it is as run down a this place you have things to do on your door stepit is worth noting that at the time we went there were only  reviews of this place and they were reasonably enough  The once written since then have been more truthful 
N => Nice   Some faults Hotel was booked by my company My first visit to Delhi after  years so many changes Not the area of choice  There are things close by but you need to take a taxi Its a good alternative to staying at an airport hotel Reception  Souless  Reminded me of an airport terminal Room   Excellent  Comfortable bed excellent bathroom with a wet shower and a huge tub Flat screen tv with enough channels to satisfy most Room size was good The hotel was less than   full  I found the staff very polite but pretty useless At breakfast   keeping in mind that the hotel was only   full youd ask for coffee and wait an eternity for it  Ask for toast and it would arrive after you finished eating your eggs The internet was down for  hours  When I checked at reception I was told it would not be back for the rest of the day  I plugged in my LAN cable an hour later it was working but no one thought to call me back and let me know I enquired over internet charges and no one thought to ifnorm me the first hour was complimentary so I rushed to cover my work in  hour thinking I did not want to be charged for  Probably the worst food I have ever had in India We have excellent Indian food in the UK and was far better than the Grand I have no idea where they source their meat but their lamb  mutton  was disgusting If you can afford it and have time take yourself to Bukhara at the Maurya or elsewhere Any special facilities extended to you   get it in writing  Anything given to me complimentary or as part of an  arrangement  was met with denial There are  restaurants  One is the western style   where breakfast is served  The other is Indian  A bar   empty for the  nights I was there  
N => Good  I was stayed with my boss amp it was nice stay  It has good pub but calm  Gym amp swimming has some construction work going on  
N => A strange place to stay This new hotel is isolated so be sure your taxi driver knows how to get there before departing from the airport  Getting a taxi to go someplace from the hotel will also be difficult  More important the hotel is not fully functional or operational  When I stayed there was no restaurant    lunches and dinners must be ordered from room service  There was no business center or internet access  A note of cautions    the ble floors in the showers are dangerously slippery when wet  
N => not a great experience first impressions are a eiving on arrival the hotel looked very impressive however our stay did not live up to our first impression   of the guests in our party had problems with check in and were given temporary rooms as there was over booking  Both were told they were being upgraded for one night and would have to move  When moved the room they were moved to was exactly the same one person refused to move as reception twice asked them to come back  My room had very noisy aircon which was eventually sorted out  The safe did not work  The whole corridor had a very unpleasant smell which did not go away for the  nights we were there  Service was inconsistent  Would not stay at this hotel again 
N => Nice hotel but no room     We got in late or early at  am with a confirmed reservation for two rooms just to hear they were overbooked and despite the confirmation unable to give us room before  minutes or so  Finally at  am we got to the rooms  Everything else was fine but this was our first and last visit to the Grand  
N => Bad customer service Our travel agent booked us the Grand for our last day in India as we had a am flight back to Canada  The room was to be for day use only  After check in the bellman took our bags to the room  He informed us that this room was quotwarmquot  Actually it was about C in the room The AC in this room was broken  This fact was known to the bellman so I can only assume it was known to the front desk My wife called down to the front desk to request a room change  They informed her they would send a repair man to fix the AC  She reminded the front desk we only had the room for a few hours and wished to dressshower prior to the flight  When she again asked for a new room the clerk simply hung the phone up  My wife stormed to the front desk past a workman in the room trying to fix the AC  For some reason they did not want to move us  Finally after  minutes they agreed  While the new room was cool it had to be the smallest single room in the hotel about  the size of the previous room  We were now one hour into our stay and simply stayed in this room  Very poor customer service  
N => Dont stay here This hotel has one of the best designs and ors that I have ever seen  Space and light are used very well and the design of the bathroom was excellent  Design and or on their own dont make for a great  star hotel  What really counts is the quality and experience of the staff and the training they have received  It was clear to me that the Grand has a long way to go in terms of its staff being able to provide the type of service that customers who are paying high rates expect  The problems started at reception   when we arrived the receptionist had no idea of our booking despite the fact that our airline who we booked through had given written confirmation and a booking reference number  We were told to wait while they checked and then three different sets of managers finally agreed that they did have a booking for us  This process took an hour while we waited in reception  We had booked on a full board basis but when we finally managed to check in we were told that no meals were included  This is despite the fact that my booking voucher showed that meals were included  We were told to wait again while they checked  After another hour they couldnt resolve this so I just called up the Airline who we had booked with in London to sort it out  Within  minutes after the call from London the Hotel manager eventually agreed that our meals were included  If he had just read the booking form we wouldnt have had to go through the pain  But the experience was unpleasant and made us feel as though we were freeloaders when in fact everything was paid for  We ate at the main restaurant which looked fantastic but at the buffet I noticed that once a dish ran out it was not replaced  If you asked for that dish you were told that they hadnt got it anymore hardly a  star response  This happened at lunch dinner and breakfast the result being that there was a limited choice of food  To make matters worse one of the waiters managed to spill milk on me because he was trying to carry too many things at the same time and couldnt manage  Checking out was very stressful   Clearly the previous manager had not told the reception staff that we had already paid in advance  So we were presented with a bill for accommodation and food  I then had to repeat the whole process of explanations to another set of staff which was not only annoying but time consuming as well  The location of the Grand is very poor  The hotel is  mins from the Airport but there are no tourist facilities around it  For the same price you could stay at a more customer friendly hotel located in central Delhi such as Oberoi or Taj  My advice to the Grand is if you charge  star prices make sure your staff are able to deliver the service  Would I stay here again   Never  
N => The Grand New Delhi dishonest pricing If you want to be ripped off and cheated stay here We stayed in this hotel on two occasion  On the first stay we were charge   a night  tax locals get charge   of this rate only as i found out at check out you are asked for your passort before any rates are given not only in this hotel but in any hotel in india if you are a indian national you pay around   of what foreigners pay one the nd occasion were were charge   a night for the same room  reason they gave was that they had ided to rename the rooms from deuxle rooms to Club rooms and this was the reason for the increase after a long conversation with the unprofessionals duty manager   we realised that all the rooms the the hotel are the same and you get charge a different amount depending which floor you are onwe asked for a room on the ground floor but they said they were fully booked which was a totally lie as the hotel was empty and rooms were being orated as I realised when i walked around  Also on the nd occasion inculded in this quotclub pricequot was collection from the airport however no one turned up and we had to make our own why there and pay for a taxis and when we asked for our money back they refused only in india this would happen  The hotel is of   star quality nice gardens and food when the ovens are working however the lack of accountability and the lack of honestly on room prices means i would never stay here again we had no choice as we were going home the next day and could not find anywere else at sush short notice  Never stay here  unless you like to be ripped off  
N => Nice hotel   but could do better  
N => Nice Hotel but Middle of Nowhere  
N => Taxi PA makes it impossible to sleep  
N => not a    
N => Not for long stays This hotel looks okay on first appearances   modern clean lobby but then you have to take a lift to the th floor to get to the first level of roomsRoom was a little small and noisy at night as it was next to the lift elevator shaft Also the adjoining door to the next room must have been wafer thin as I could hear absolutely every word from next door 
N => Good  Over all expereince was Good  Staff hospitality was great  Location is very good  Rooms were well maintained amp spacious  Good choice for the official business travellers like us  Food was average  But overall Good value for money  Would like to stay agai amp recommand to others too  
N => Just a good business hotel We spent  nights at Hans Plaza Hotel and Ive to say we werent impressed by the experience there  Key points   Location is good min walking distance from Connht Place and min close to Delhi Metro which does not connect the modern centre of New Delhi    Rooms are OK theyre exactly what you expect from a      business hotel  Theyre modern clean and functional no frills no atmosphere  Beds are hard and rigid not relaxing at all  As usual we didnt even consider to purchase items from the room minibar overpriced as everywhere in India  Two ml bottles of purified water are complimentary in the room but we managed to get extra free bottles at the concierges just asking them if we could quotpurchasequot water from the lobby bar  They kindly handed over the bottles for free    Staff is overall friendly and professional nothing special    Prices are high approx  rupees for a std double room considered quotexecutivequot because it was at the th floor with good distance from the noisy roads around the hotel     Our breakfast was included in the room price and we enjoyed it at the fullest good food with the notable exception of tea which was of extremely poor quality we had to suffer it  mornings    We happened to have lunch in the hotel restaurant good food but again overpriced   sadly not other restaurants in the min radius    Business centre is just ridiculous with just  computer available for guests we had to queue prices are  rupees for min Overall a ent stay but clearly next time well go somewhere else  
N => Exorbitant and Rip Off The room is moderate  But there is no plug points to charge laptop and cell phones  I had to remove the plug of a lamp to charge my laptop  Do not buy food or drinks from this hotel  Though its not even a two star hotel the price for a normal mineral water is Rs   the actual price is Rs   only   boiled eggs can cost you Rs   plus taxes A total rip off Dont get traumatized by the bills  
N => Flawless We spent one and a half days in the Imperial after a  week trip around Rajasthan  Our short stay here was the icing on the cake of what was one of our best trips ever Our room was beautiful and I guess particularly appealling after an  hour rail trip from Jaisalmer We loved the pool and spent a large proportion of time in or around it  The food in the restuarant was good but very pricey All the staff members we came across were utterly charming  helpful and spoke excellent English as indeed they were in all of our other hotels in India All in all a wonderful hotel which we would lover to re visit one day  
N => The Imperial I have been fortunate enough to stay here many time what a stunning hotel 
N => Experience at Imperial Stayed there    check in ok room excellent floor staff can not fault with attention to detail  Front house staff not very friendly and it seems they need some training for this type of Hotel Air Conditioning unable to turn down even engineer had problem with it Word of warning for travellers paying with creditdebit card  Hotel  charge double on your creditdebit card and very difficult to recover the charge  
N => A real let down Hotel Imperial has always been a synonym for luxury comfort and old grandeur  Sadly enough we experienced very little of that during our stay last month  To begin with the hotel was undergoing some maintenance work and the room they gave us was just above where the work was going on We were truly in for a rude shock  We could just not sleep or rest in the afternoon as the workers were moving the ladders buckets etc and talking too loudly  You certainly do not expect this in a five star hotel  The hotel did not provide hair conditioner as part of the bathroom amenities and when we called up the housekeeping we were told that the shampoo provided by the hotel was a  two in one  be its recession time and one should get used to such tricks but we have never faced such a silly issue in other hotels including far off Taj properties in South India  On the first night the waiter forgot to get half of our room service dinner order as a result of which we had to wait and the food got cold  The waiter never bothered to offer to warm it again  So much for Imperial comfort  Similarly we did not get the room cleaned in the evening service as a result of which the mineral water was not replenished  However when we asked the housekeeping later in the night to send us the complimentary water they said that it will be charged  Again I find it a trivial issue  Why bother about INR   when the customer is paying INR  per night  Besides we were asking only what was a part of the evening service  In all it left a bitter taste  Considering that we were return customers we surely did not expect this kind of service from the hotel  I will not return and not recommend this hotel to my friends and family  
N => Classic and Elegant We had the privelege of ending our India tour at the Colonial Hotel  We were pleased to be upgraded to a suite  The suite was classic in furnshings and had a wonderful bathroom  There was no view but I believe that is true of all the rooms due to its location The pool was a nice place to relax however noxious fumes from the gas station next door was often in the air The Italian restaurant was first rate whereas the Silk Road restaurant served mediocre cuisine  All the bars are very interesting and unique in their own style  
N => disgrace to the word luxury Please avoid this hotel it is indeed a disgrace to the world luxury  Its very expensive in terms of internet meal and room facilities  its got bad water from drying river Yamuna not been filtered and part of feces were seen in the sink water  STD calls are way more expensive than what another hotel would charge  Staff is polite but they are helpless  The walls are plastered with photos etc  claiming to be historical ones however they are artificially produced and are misleading in character and its veracity  The meals are very very poor quality  Ordered Indian food it was very poorly made and was tasteless as the flour they used was not of good quality  Please avoid this place 
N => Solid hotel if you get upgraded rooms  Stayed at The Imperial twice in  days  The first stay got upgraded to a Heritage Room which was spacious and well equipped    ent size bathroom  The second stay got an art o room which was half of the size of Heritage Room    thats when all the problems started  First call was to fix the lukewarm water from the shower  Second call was for someone to get rid of the mosquitos flying around the room  They came in and sprayed insecticide into room which made the room smelled  So overall the experience at The Imperial was very uneven  
N => Poorly managed property with wasted potential This property has beautiful artwork a great breakfast buffet a good swimming pool friendly people to welcome you at the front door and thats about it  It fancies itself as a world class hotel but it cheaps it out at every corner  From excessive internet charges when the wireless doesnt even work with Dell computers   huh to maintenance work in the main hallway in the middle of the day The Imperial does not know how to make a guest feel at home  My wife and I arrived to find that the booking we thought wed made online incl  wireless airport transfers and breakfast was actually something    room only  Not only that we were stuck in a tiny corner room overlooking a construction sitetent village where workers were looking up into our room  There was also a hanging lamp that was about to fall out from a rotted hole in the ceiling  When we asked to be moved we were told that we could not even though another employee had told us the hotel was only half full  The location of the hotel is also hardly serene  On the first night I wanted to take out cash from an ATM which the hotel did not have  I was told by the front desk to walk a couple hundred yards to the nearest one  When I walked out the front gate I was immediately stepping over dozens of people lying on the sidewalks  Meanwhile the numerous hotel security guards at the gates just looked at me dumbfoundedly without thinking to point me in the right direction or warn me that it might not be a great idea  There are plenty of other luxury hotels to choose from in New Delhi so stay away from the Imperial  It is hard to feel resentful at a place as beautiful as The Imperial but somehow management has figured out how to make that happen  
N => terrible service My husband and i stayed at this hotel a few months ago and were quite disappointed with the level of service both at check in and breakfast  The hotels common areas are beautiful and unique but somehow this does not make up for the aloof attitude of the staff  The waiters at breakfast were very slow and took more than  minutes to even hand out the menus and sometimes they did not even do so and we had to ask for the menus several times  We saw other guests complaining on this also  We regularly stay in five star hotels in India and around the world Oberoi   where service is excellent Taj Park Hyatt Ritz Plaza Athenee etc and for us this level of service is simply unacceptable   The rooms are ok except for the bathrooms which are not up to five star standard  The Spice restaurant was of a ent standard but was not up to expectations  
N => oasis of calm but not while we were there luxury hotel in centre of delhi  Excellent service and wonderful art  Indian restaurant was superb buffet breakfast OK  Our real problem was the development work outside our window  we had to change rooms in the middle of the night because of it  However the hotel management acted quickly and efficiently to put things right 
N => Great hotel but heres some advice Im not going to bore you with details of how good this hotel as everyone else have already done this for me  Instead heres a little bit of advice   Dont bother to book a hotel car through hotel reception  All the drivers will ferry you around privately in luxury hotel cars for half the price if asked  quid an hour  If you travel to the Taj Mahal in a hotel car dont bother to pay for a packed lunch  While the food is fantastic quality they dont put it on ice in the boot of the car  By lunch time its red hot  And hot smoked salmon isnt a good idea  Daniels Tavern is a great curry house do dont be put off by the name   The hotel bar does a great White Russian   Every hotel driver we used whether they be in a Mercedes or a green yellow and black Hindustan work for commission  If you buy something in a shop that they take you to they get a cut  Thats fine in principal but the problem is that the places they take you to charge twice as much as everywhere else    If you give money to a beggar through your car window the car will suddenly get swamped with more beggars  Very disturbing 
N => Truly excellent My room rate included transfers from the airport to hotel  When we arrived at the hotel we were met at the entrance and escorted to Reception where the receptionist already had the check in paperwork waiting  This initial experience was typical of the first rate service that we received throughout our stay  Staff tried to anticipate our needs as well as complying quickly with any request we made  The same desire to anticipate every need was evident in the room which was immaculate  The public areas are also beautifully maintained  The food is also wonderful particularly in  one of the restaurants  There is a small internal courtyard in front of the Spice Route and Daniells restaurants where drinks are served and which is a wonderful place to relax  I went to New Delhi on business but will definitely return to the Imperial for a holiday  
N => Disappointing accommodation  Disgusting breakfast beverages  Disappointing room Darksmelly and overlooking a construction site Yes on arriving from London at am we were shown to our twin bedded room on the st floor which really stank of stale tobacco smoke  We immediately asked for a transfer to another room which was across the corridor this seemed smaller than the first one but it did not stink  In the morning in the light of day we pulled back the curtains to see that or room overlooked a construction site with huts earth moving machinery and rubble  Of course we asked to be moved again but were told despite insisting several times that there were no other rooms available  This I do not believe  Only two nights later just before the day we were due to leave were we told there was another room available  For the record all the windows in The Imperial appear to be small  Perhaps it was built as a fort in the th century but the effect is to let in very little daylight and the bedroom was dark and dingy  All very disappointing for my wife as it was her first trip to India and I had told her about my previous  stays at the Imperial with its lovely old fashioned neo colonial atmosphere and historic th century ambiance  Unfortunately since my last stay in  the hotel has undergone a complete refurbishment and although they have retained most of the features as they were before somehow much ofthe old somewhat faded atmosphere appears to have been lost  Before The Imperial was truly unique now it is more like any other luxury hotel and something of the former charm has been lost in the process  One final thing  If you look forward to a nice cup of coffee or tea with your breakfast forget it Both my wife and I agreed that the coffee and breakfast tea was the most disgusting we had tasted anywhere ever  So bring your own instant and tea bagsif you want a half ent cuppa  David S Baber London ch th  
N => disappointing Grand comfortable public areas  Room  ble on bedroom floor with dark furniture and small windows  Overlooked ancillary area meant curtains had to be drawn for privacy and loud noise early a m  Toilet did not work properly had to get a plumber to sort Bar very masculine lack of relaxed seating  Not great for single traveller Italian restaurant fab but extortionate   pleasant for meals Breakfast very good but service poor second morning Had a Swedish massage in salon  Specifically requested not almond oil  Guess what not only did i have almond oil but the masseur slathered so much on me you could have fried fish and chips for a  with it Better than the Shangri La  Prefer Trident Gurgaon or Oberoi 
N => A Great Way to Begin Our Whirlwind Tour of India After a trek in Northern India we returned to Delhi to begin a whirlwind sightseeing tour of  cities in  days  From our initial greeting by the doorman and throughout our stay the service was prompt and professional our room spacious and well appointed and the meals we had at  I could have eaten the dhal Imperial for every meal and The Spice Route were the best of our trip  All our days were spent sightseeing so we did not have a chance to explore the pool or outdoor areas of the hotel  On our way back to the U S  through Delhi we booked a day room at the Imperial they stored all of our trekking gear for a week which definitely exceeded our expectations   it was on the lower floor and although small had all of the amenities we needed  
N => Disappointing Experience This was our second trip to India and the Imperial and unfortunately disappointing  Service standards have slipped a disappointing dinner at the hotel restaurant San Gimignano cold room service breakfast and no hot water in the morning for our shower  Given the high room rate I would suggest trying elsewhere in Delhi  
N => Awesome Experience at the Imperial Delhi We stayed at the Imperial in ember  right after Christmas  We checked in late after our international flight and the staff was as friendly as could be  They even gave a wrapped present to our children  There was a fruit basket waiting and a welcome note  The room was huge and the bathroom was gorgeous We really enjoyed the hotel  we enjoyed room service and the Spice route  as well as dinner at the Coffee Shop  it was a very pleasant experience  we will be back 
N => Truly deserving of its world class reputation We have just returned from a  day trip to India which involved a  night stay at this hotel  It is truly one of the most exceptional hotels I have ever stayed in  The drive from the airport to the centre of Delhi can be a bit of a culture shock if youre not used to India  if you call the hotel they will have a driver pick you up from the airport  I would recommend this    You arrive at the oasis of calm that is The Imperial  We were shown to our room and told that we had been upgraded as it was our anniversary  the door opened into the most amazing suite all ble cream sofas fresh flowers a corridor leading to the bedroom and beautiful bathroom  Then there was a knock on the door and they produced a bottle of champagne and a cake with a note wishing us Happy Anniversary  There are  restaurants and the  we ate at were both great  We had a hotel driver take us out for the afternoon to give us a quick tour  he was knowledgeable interesting and in total it only cost about    Service from start to finish was  star and I was truly sorry to leave  Cannot recommend more highly  
N => Wonderful This is a sumptuous hotel which is extremely well managed  The attentive polite and pleasant staff are in no way intrusive  They laid on a stunning welcome for us when they realised that it was our th Wedding Anniversary  On our two visits this year we had a heritage suite and a heritage room both of which were exceptional  The swimming pool is like something out of a Busby Berkeley movie  I had it to myself one morningWe have eaten at the  Terrace restaurant and found it excellent but we found the much vaunted Spice Route restaurant a let down  Perhaps it was just an off night  I have to say though that the hotel management have actually written to us at home in England to apologise for our visit to the Spice Route after we mentioned our disappointment casually to our driver as he took us to the station  Now that is customer service  
N => A grand hotel We have just returned from a three week trip to India and this was the first hotel we stayed in  It set a very high standard for the seven other   hotels we then stayed in  Unlike other reviewers we found it hard to fault with old fashioned high standards  It was indeed a real oasis in the middle of polluted Delhi  The pool was awesome  If you like a warm pool this is for you  The steam was rising when we went in in the early evening   absolutely delicious after a long flight  We found the restaurant to be excellent with superb friendly service  The whole hotel was stylish and not at all flash or vulgar  Theyve been doing this for a long time and it shows  
N => Bizarre We had a somewhat odd experience here  We had booked online and the room discription was of a room with a garden view and either a kingsize bed or twins   In the event the room we were put into had no view and an ordinary sized bed  We complained to the deputy manger at which point things took a turn to the surreal  We showed him our booking form clearing outlining view bed size etc  At which point he began to argue vehemently that this was not an issue of misinformation but of style     quot But quot we protested quot it clearly says here that we bought a room with a kingsize bed and a garden view quot quot What is the problem quot he said  quot the bed or the view quot  quot Both quot we replied  but he didnt seem to get it at all  He continued to witter on about themes and styles  Eventually he moved us to another room which  had a kingsize bed and a view of the garden  I thanked him and told him that we do not usually make a habit of complaining  quot You are not complaining now quot he said firmly quot Well actually I am quot I said  quot No you are not quot  he replied  I gave up at this point and ided to do something formal about it on our return All this was a pity because the second room was very pleasant we had an excellent meal good service  and slept like logs The business with the deputy manager left an unpleasant taste though  
N => More Fur Coat than Knickers A great Delhi location a pretty good s builiding and loads of money spent on jazzing it up is still spoilt by energetic but forgetful and unskilled service  In India charm and a real not unforced concern for guests welfare comes free  To mess it up by not ensuring that the admittedly characterful staff remember to bring tea clear dirty plates take orders bring correct orders bring bills all of which they failed to do repeatedly is a careless waste of good raw service material and a fine building  When we spoke to the Terrace Manager the main offending facility though the curiously named Daniells Tavern was prone to it too his comment was that he would discipline the staff  Our comment was that he should give people with a real aptitude for the work some proper training Ho hum If you want to see how well trained staff add to an experience stay at the Oberoi in Delhi much better value frankly  If you like glitz the Imperials for you  If you like real quality less conveniently located though try the Oberoi  
N => Lovely Hotel Service Problems Stayed at Imperial for one week on a business trip  Stayed in  arate rooms due to taking a side trip to Agra  First room was lovely bright amp airy situated close to front of hotel  Second room was very small very noisy and had no natural light  Service in the hotel restaurant was good  Service in the bar was pretty poor the staff seem to have an attitude problem and are very aggressive in their approach  What ruined the stay for me was the front desk staff  I had to cut my stay short by one day to return home amp despite having given them  days notice they point blank refused to not charge me the extra night  I have never encountered this before  Not only did they insist on charging me but they were rude aggressive and spent  mins arguing with me about the issue  I would not stay in this hotel the next time I visit Delhi I would go for the Shangri La instead where the service is impeccable  
N => Nice to see but beware staying       We had a very mediocre stay at the Imperial  The building is undoubtedly gorgeous and is definitely worth a thorough walk through  However I would not recommend staying here  As mentioned in previous reviews the service was lackluster   polite but very stiff  Our room was also very claustrophobic   only small windows that look out onto an interior courtyard with echoing noise from the ground level  And BEWARE THE TAXES The room rate was  rupees but they assessed a    tax based on an arbitrary undisclosed quotrackquot rate of  rupees  That amounted to a tax in excess of   of our room charge  Outrageous  
N => IMO not   I had always wanted to stay here  The Imperial is a beautiful hotel but seems to have some serious problems  Most serious is noise  The rooms are not particularly quiet especially in the older section of the hotel  During my stay I had to change rooms  times  Desk clerks seemed pleasant but clueless about construction going on below my room which lasted until  p m The business center could be better run as a loud talkitive guest disrupted my computer time until I said something to him  The female staff is simply too timid to ask anyone to keep the level of noise down so that others can work  Id warn any guest to check their bill carefully as mine was full of erroneous minibar charges  It took a long time to get them removed  Judging from experiences on other trips to Delhi I would have to say that I prefer the Oberoi or Taj Mahal hotels  
N => Beautiful and comfortable hotel with some drawbacks This hotel is well worth a visit for its architectural beauty and for the hundreds of paintings it houses  Its large swimming pool is just as impressive and the pool side service is top quality  Overall the staff are friendly and helpful in this hotel and they work hard to keep it immaculate and clean  The rooms and public areas have fantastic ble floors and the rooms are very comfortable  Our room was allocated on arrival and was of a relatively high standard including a dressing room We had room service once which was a delicious breakfast that was promptly brought to our room  The coffee was particularly good  We found that one breakfast was enough for two people to share  The food in the rest of the hotel was a bit of a let down but perhaps more because we were attempting to eat on a budget   all of the restaurants here are fairly pricey  The Indian food was definitely better value than western meals  Cocktails cost the equivalent of   so there is no avoiding Western prices  A useful tip for water complimentary water is provided in the room twice a day as well as by the pool  It was helpful to know we could stock up at the pool if we had run out  The most unfortunate aspect of our stay was that we ended up moving rooms twice  On our first night there was incredibly loud music coming from a building across the road although it was loud even in our room  The hotel assured us it would stop after  which it did not  After a few phone calls downstairs they offered to let us sleep in another room it was  by this time and too late to move all our stuff and then we returned to our original room the next morning  They then moved us to another room for our last night we were only there two nights  So I have seen quite a few of the hotels rooms and they are all excellent but this incident was unfortunate  The staff did do their best to help us though  While it was not the hotels fault we found here and during the rest of our trip in Delhi that wedding season was having a negative impact on our holiday mainly in terms of noise  A spa is currently being built at the Imperial and we had to listen to the construction noise from our first room  This is a necessary inconvenience though for the hotel to improve its services but beware  Overall this hotel is worth a visit for its aesthetic appeal and good service  
N => Smiles of honesty or pure greed The location of the Imperial is excellent if your interest lies in exploring Delhi which was one of my main reasons for staying here As I like hotels that stand out from the norm the Imperial did not disappoint as it is like walking inside a museum  Everything is spotless and the staff does their utmost to keep the place in shape With the exception of eating at  which was so so I only had the breakfast buffet in the hotel  Compared to other hotels I have staid at in India the breakfast was great however in comparison with breakfasts in standard hotels in many European countries such as Sweden it was nothing special  As someone who eats sandwiches for breakfast the choice was not too good eg  regarding different kinds of cheese When it comes to the service everyone is indeed smiling and very kind in some extent at least for me though it is rather difficult to be addressed as quotSirquot all the time especially as I hardly feel like one Some issues regarding serviceIn the  bar I ordered quota pintquot of beer which turns out to be a small bottle of  liter  My question whether quota pintquot is not a measurement of volume was brushed aside as the staff claimed that an Indian pint is indeed a small bottle of  liter  Later on on my bill however the cost of a bottle of beer and a pint differed even though I have had the same sort of beer  As the costs seemed to differ on all my visits I could not make out what I really should have ordered for getting what I call a pint However what irritated me most I staid at Imperial on two different occassions was the dishonesty upon check out regarding what currency my creditcard was to be debited  I was very clear with that I wanted my bill settled in Indian Rupees as any other transaction currency would lead to higher costs for me  The staff claimed that it was purely a service to present the bill in USD and that the transaction would in reality be in Rupees  Later on obviously I checked my bank account and the staffs claim of a simple service turned out to be a lie as the transaction was conducted in USD  Upon my second stay I was told the same thing in the Imperial shop  Consequently it appears as if the staff either is unaware of the disservice they are doing as I find it hard to believe it is intentional  Upon a stay of a couple of days the difference in transaction currencies can turn out to be worth   Rupees or equivalent in your own currency  I find this annoying and unworthy behaviour of a five star hotel Overall the Imperial is definetely worth a stay though my visits there made me wonder whether there was greed rather than honesty behind some of the staffs smile  
N => A bit over the top The huge Sikh doorman with an impressive moustache cream uniform and red turban made an instant impression on us travel stained tourists as did the smiling ladies in their identical red uniform saris who welcomed us as we walked into the lobby  Our senses were assaulted by the abundance of glass chrome gilt lights multi coloured ble deep red roses white carnations portraits landscapes and perfume that is regularly sprayed into the air from discreet white containers as we were guided to our Heritage room no   from which we had a glimpse of the swimming pool and gardens  The bathroom was huge with gorgeous Fragonard toiletries  It was pleasant to have a dressing room but disappointing to have been given twin beds  We sleep together at home   why should we want to sleep apart when on holiday especially one on which we were celebrating our Silver Wedding We hadn t been offered a choice and were too tired to try to change rooms  That evening after a mind blowing afternoon organised by our tour company the excellent Audley Travel we ate in the hotel s Spice Trade restaurant  It was delightful to sit in the restaurant s intimate subtly lit courtyard beside the rectangular candle lit central pool and dine under the stars though the Thai food didn t quite live up to its reputation  The next morning we had a lonely breakfast on the terrace at  am enjoying a wide selection of prepared fruit fresh watermelon juice and perfectly cooked scrambled egg amp toast  A few days later we returned for another night and ate in the hotel s Italian Restaurant since I was  all curried out  by then  The food made a pleasant change but was very ordinary and over priced  This Heritage Room no   on the ground floor was smaller than the previous one but the breakfast we d ordered in our room for  am arrived right on time and was every bit as good as before  Apart from our welcome I couldn t describe the staff as  friendly  but perhaps we didn t stay long enough to give them a chance  The whole experience was rather  over the top  but very memorable and was a good introduction to the many contrasts we would meet in India  
N => Mixed feelings Architecturally this is a stunning hotel with a fabulous art collection  The location was perfect for us as it is one of the few luxury hotels within walking distance of Connht Place  However our room alhough beautifully orated and immaculately clean with a fabulously comfortable bed and a great bathroom was a bit on the small side compared to other rooms on the same corridor  I presume this is because we booked a quotspecial ratequot which by the time taxes etc were added on came to around   per night anyway  Whilst the breakfast was fabulous I wouldnt bother eating in the hotel restaurants  We tried the  bistro   the food was so so the service was shoddy and it was overpriced albeit in a very nice setting  We also ate in the Spice Route restaurant which is supposedly one of the best restaurants in Asia although I fail to see how  I had to send my duck back as it was overcooked  It was also the blandest food I ate on my two week trip in India The hotel keting plays on the fact that it is the only garden hotel in Delhi but I didnt find the garden to be anything special  If you spend anytime poolside the pool is fine but not of the standard I would have expected of a luxury hotel expect great service from the pool staff if you are a lone female as I was on one occasion  However the next accompanied by Mr BB we were completely ignored  This brings me on to my major criticism of the hotel   we just did not find the service up to scratch  
N => Still nice but has lost some of its luster      Based on our experience last year at the Imperial we ided to stay here on our second trip to India  I will have to say the experience lost a bit of its luster from last year  The hotel is still beautiful but the service seemed to have slipped a bit  I was also expecting the same level or nicer of room since it was our second stay but the room was smaller and a bit worn  The service in the restaurants was very slow especially at breakfast  if you want to sit outside for breakfast be sure to arrive early At one point I walked over to the waiters station to pour my own tea after waiting  minutes for a refill  We had the same level of service at dinner in the Spice Route  Don t get me wrong this is still a great hotel but next year if we return we will try another alternative  
N => Prices go up quality of service plummets I went in prepared to be happy my t  review serves as evidence  I will not be going back  With a jaw dropping average room rate above  per night service should be impeccable  Instead it was shabby all around  I checked in to my full price room at AM to be greeted with a twin bed and frigid air  After five hours with the heater on full the room was still cold  A complaint elicited an offer of a heater to be delivered it never came  Numerous small failings added up to an almost wholly negative experience  Waiting for a breakfast table and being ignored by two hostesses standing a few feet away Asking for coffee three times before receiving it    on two different days Getting the bait and switch at the bar by ordering well gin and then being billed for the good stuff because they quotran outquot of the other At a  star stop this kind of laxity might be bearable but at quotone of Asias finest hotelsquot its flatly unacceptable  To top it off my credit card was mysteriously billed many thousands of rupees in additional    and completely illegitimate    charges  This after Id had several illicit charges removed at check out  I had similar problems last stay so read your bill carefully Two weeks later the cashier has yet to even respond to my inquiry about the added charges  There are other top notch hotels in New Delhi that will provide excellent service while not breaking your bank  I strongly urge you to consider looking elsewhere  
N => Shabby treatment over and over I stayed here several times since it was redone very nicely  In the beginning they were very courteous  Then little by little  the service lined  Last year I had booked through American Express Platinum  They gave me a room with no shower then a room with no windows covered by some sign  Also twice I had to change a reservation and because of the time change with the United States they would not give a refund because I was one hour late Very rude and inflexible  I will never stay there again  I am going back to the Oberoi where they know how to treat repeat guests  
N => Reservations not honored We had booked and paid for  rooms at the Imperial Hotel in ember   The reservations were made months in advance  As we were travelling back from Agra on the train our guide learned that they would not be honoring the reservation as they had a government delegation that overstayed  We were sent to the TAj Mahal Hotel instead   excellent hotel but not in the area we wanted to be   and definitely not the same price  After much screaming I did get them to give the  of us a dinner and a car to transport us one evening but the requested refund of the room rate   or at least the diifference in the rates for the two hotels has not been forthcoming  
N => Not that great any longer A great property where I had last stayed in   Unfortunately the service quality is mixed  There were real highlights but also a few disappointments in particulat to the quotquot restaurants  The quotSan Giminignanoquot Italian restaurant was excellent  Nothing really dramatic but I would be tempted to try something different next time  
N => Great hotel but bad upgrade tax charges  We stayed at The Imperial during ust   It was recommended to us by a couple of our friends and families  We were offered free upgrade to a better room upon check in  The lobby outside our room had some strange smell but over all it was nice  However we were shocked at the bill when we checked out  The tax they charged us is to the upgrade room price which is double the price  We then had to pay more for the room  Thank god we were not on a tight budget  We haven t been to a hotel anywhere that charges you more on a  free  upgraded room  It s a five star hotel act like one  Let your customer know before you give them a  free  upgrade  be they won t choose to have the upgrade  It just left a bad taste in your mouth since everyone wants to cheat you in India including a reputable hotel  
N => Indian Nighte In uary  my wife and I scheduled a trip to India especially to be able to stay at the Imperial Hotel a venue I had haunted with some frequency viz  especially the bar on my prior visits to New Delhi  Our initial five day stay went off without incident and the service was commensurate with the five star European prices we were obliged to pay  Upon our return for a layover in New Delhi en route from Udaipur to Shimla the situation was less pleasant  Depsite confirmed reservations the hotel informed us using an airport driver whose English was extremely ginal that we were being assigned to another hotel the location and quality were never made clear because the hotel was oversold  I insisted upon our return to the Imperial since we had left luggage there from our previous stay  The airport driver then falsely in the manner so characteristics of Indians when faced with any unpleasantness assured us that everything was o k  Upon our arrival it quickly became clear that the hotel had no intention of honoring our reservation and were anxious to remove us from the property  It was late we were tired and we had a very early train the next morning  Not only did the hotel never clarify where they were going to send us the airport driver had made an imcomplete reference to a lower quality hotel by the airport but they never offered to pay for the substitute room  We summoned a hotel keting agent who had sat down with us at dinner the previous Tuesday  At the time she had fawned over us telling us how lovely it was that we were staying in the hotel and had offered us discounts and amenities we had no need for  The keting agent was helpless and hopeless all her promises from the preceding week had been hollow keting blather  And so we stood our ground in the crowded lobby  I began to expound in my best Ciceronian diction on the several thousand dollars we had spent during our visit less than a week earlier how we had confirmed reservations and how we would most assuredly report back to our friends and colleagues on this most inhospitable treatment  Faced with a raving travel weary American excoriating the hotel in the center of their lobby management acted quickly and isively to confirm our reservation and give us the room we had reserved  The keting agent looked on in impotent silence The Imperial  be a lovely hotel but I have never before encountered a situation where the hotel staff was so pro actively anxious to tell me how much they appreciated my business and how anxious they were to make my stay more enjoyable and simultaneously so utterly impotent in addressing a real and dire problem of the hotels own making  Suffice it to say all who would venture there are now forewarned 
N => One of the best reasons to visit Delhi This is a superb hotel   and if you are going to Delhi and want to treat yourself   this is the place to do it  The dining is wonderful with several options   some of the best Indian food I have ever eaten has been here  The rooms are wonderful   spacious and clean  The ambiance in the hotel is just very restful and elegant  At night centerpieces with candles are in the main hall intersections during the day the candles are replaced with flowers  There are areas to meet to enjoy a drink with a friend   all with fine service  Forget check in at the desk a clerk escourts you to your room and fills out the paperwork after pointing out the amenities and seeing if you are comfortable  Where else is there a quotPillow Menuquot no kidding   choose your favorite type of pillow  This same type of treatment is given thoughout There are a few areas for improvement  Reservations in particular could use some help  I booked on Orbitz and even though I tried to communicate to the hotel several times they could not find the record  Finally they did and I was informed by email that everything was OK   when I arrived the airport pick up was not arranged   there was a staff member from the hotel stationed at the airport   who was very kind and arranged for a quottaxiquot but it was not the hotel car and not the same price either so it was all ok     he was very kind to two weary travelers   but it should not have been a problem in the first place  A similar confusion was met at the front desk before they quotfound mequot even after the phone call from the airport from their own staff member and then I was wisked upstairs as described   all was good  Then on checkout   a similar problem   they did not show me as pre paid and it took a while to striaghten it out  Again very professionally handled but it should not have been necessary in the first place I rebooked for our return on the hotels web site  Be careful   they require  hour notice for cancellation  I unfortunately had to cancel due to flight changes and I again had a confusing back and forth email interchange where they told me to cancel through the booking agent used   but the agent was THEIR web site that did not allow me to cancel due to the several days of back and forth that occurred  Email interactions with the hotel take  hours   agan too slow for a Hotel of this caliber  They did straignten it out   eventually   but these types of things should not be a problem and s an exceptional hotel visit  But lets put things into perspective  Even with this confusion   this is just a great hotel   and worth every penny     Luxury tax or not  
N => First time love but second date blues We booked to stay at the Imperial twice  On our arrival in Dehli we couldnt have been more pleased with our choice  The style and ambience of the hotel gave it a great deal of charm and character  The room service and breakfast was everything you would expect from a high class establishment  The location is great for walking to Connht Place but if you want to travel further I suggest you walk a few minutes away from the main gate to get an auto rickshaw as the opening price drops considerably before hangling begins  Things however were not so pleasant on our return  We were due to stay here again on our last night before flying home arriving around midnight on the train from Agra  On arrival we were told despite having made the reservation at the same time as our earlier visit that the hotel was full government delegation and that we would need to transfer to another hotel The Park  Given the lateness of the hour we reluctantly agreed only to find that this hotel was not a patch on the Imperial despite our being upgraded to a suite  In the morning therefore we returned to the Imperial to complain about our treatment  To their credit they did try to make amend by giving us the use of a room for the afternoon our flight was in the evening a complimentary meal in the Spice Routes restaurant and a transfer to the airport  However double booking is not something I expect from five star establishmentsOverall if you get to stay at the Imperial you will love it but be aware that they  not honour your booking  
N => Beware   Hotel Tax SCAM At checkout   all guests find out that there has been a    luxury tax applied to their bill which is standard in India  The SCAM is that The Imperial applies the    tax to the RACK RATE not the room rate that we were charged  Our nightly rate was  but the luxury tax applied was based on a  room rate  For two nights this was more than   This tax situation is never mentioned when you book your room or when you check in you find out when you check out  We also stayed at The Park Hotel in Delhi   and they are doing the same SCAM to their customers but in their case we were charged    of a  rack rate about  for two nites when our room rate was   This proves that the RACK RATES are randomly assigned and have no basis in reality  The hotel staffs say that everyone who checks out has the same bad reaction  Who wouldnt This is unacceptable from any hotel especially on this level Since The Imperial is a Preferred Hotel we will be reporting this situatiuon to them  In addition The Imperial is often selected as one of the best hotels in the world by Conde Nast Traveler and Travel amp Leisure magazines we plan to inform them as well  
N => Love it but with this reservation    Since moving to India we have stayed there a handful of times but our last stay virtually mirrored our first stay nearly two years ago      We arrived for a three night period and were met at the airport by driver AND greeter who escorted us to the hotel where greeter swiftly disappeared after a few quick words with the front desk     As we tried to check in we were asked to take a seat in the lobby for a few minutes after which time a member of staff asked us to join him in a very quiet area of the restaurant  What had we done Were our visas not right Had the corporate rate increased None of the above  We were advised that a government delegation had overstayed its welcome and would we mind being shifted to the Shangri La not shabby two minutes down the road just for one night  We negotiated a room upgrade and a complementary dinner plus we were staying another two nights so all was not lost  Fast forward to y th this year     we arrived at the hotel at pm with a booking at  pm in their fabulously lauded and expensive Spice Route restaurant  As the receptionist pulled up our booking which was made on the hotels website a few months prior the words BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE flashed across her screen  When I asked what it meant she quickly closed the screen and called the duty manager who arrived with the familiar request to take a seat in the lobby    This time we were ready No was our answer lets sort it here    then came the old government delegation chestnut  We refused to budge  It was the y th holiday and we were eating in a half hour  No way Well they asked could we check out at am No way We were leaving on an international flight at pm  At which time the duty manager scuttled away there is no finer way of putting this without a word of an apology leaving the receptionist to hand us our keys and show us to our room  Not a pleasant start to our short stay and one which I have to say has left me thinking of moving hotels next time we are in Delhi  We did file a complaint with the hotel and posed questions on their criteria for bouncing guests to which we received a very hasty letter of apology in the mail   but no comped night or dinner 
N => First night in India I had so been looking forward to the first night of our holiday at this grand hotel  Check in was efficient and the jasmine perfume wafting through the air con was impressive  However by the next morning after breakfast I could well do without its cloying aroma Our Heritage room was large and well furnished with a good dressing area and bathroom  Our first disappointment was when we tried to book a table at the Italian Restaurant and were told there was nothing until  pm  No alternative was offered to us  After venturing out we returned to find the Brasserie where our meal was OK but the service was not exactly vellous  More time should be spent on customer service than on perpetuating the days of the Raj and colonialism Breakfast service was generally slow and apart from the freshly cooked eggs   virtually stone cold  We did enjoy the art work in the corridors and the luxurious feel of the hotel but The Imperial seems to be living on a past reputation  
N => Not so great We finished a seven week trip to India at the Imperial having stayed at a wide range of accommodations from small family run places to opulent hotels like the Imperial and the Lake Palace in Udaipur  We had heard good things about the Imperial from friends and from TripAdvisor so we ided to finish off our time in india with a splurge I did book on the hotels website and I believe strongly in full information so on that website agreed to pay  for one night and  for another  A quick tip if you do a search on the website and are flexible in your dates look at the rate from day to day because it changes considerably  As I said we stayed in a few other very nice places in India including the Lake Palace Devi Garh both in Udaipur and Ananda in the Himalayas  Each of these in my opinion were more worth the money than the Imperial  While the Imperial rooms and common spaces are fantastically beautiful it wasnt an quotexperiencequot as much as a beautiful place to stay The concierge as opposed to other reviews was helpful to me in sending a box of mine to the USA  I havent seen the contents of the box so Im just assuming all my things got there OK  Although he had promised to get me a tracking number and I had to go back to him to get it  We ate one lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurants   lunch was quite expensive but ent dinner at the Spice Route was ent too but nothing spectacular  The service was OK but not as attentive as you might expect Basically when you book this hotel youre bound to have really high expectations given the amount youre paying and generally its a fancy hotel but it doesnt blow you away  We stayed at the Taj in Delhi for two nights too at a different point in our stay   it doesnt have the same feel but is plenty luxurious and costs a lot less   about  a night with a much better gym and pool too My opinion Save your money for the once in a lifetime places and have a meal or drink tea at the Imperial to see it  
N => Nice facilities spotty service beware internet booking Stayed at this hotel last autumn while on a business trip to the Indian capital  Should note that during that trip I stayed at four other hotels in New Delhi   I am a travel ky and wanted to comparethe slew of new properties which have opened or been reated duringthe travel boom of the past few years Positively the Imperials facilities are top notch   comparable to what you would find in New York London or Hong Kong with real albeit forced colonial raj style  This comes at a price  Mumbai andDelhi hotels command London rather than Asia pricing given the bizarre land tenure regulations in India which results in a chronic shortage of rooms in major business centers  A comparable hotel in Shanghai Singapore Sydney or Bangkok would be half the price Negatively booked through the quothotelsquot website  A glitch caused two identical rooms to be booked for the same night  I tried to rectify by a telephone call and e mail not wanting to rely on the web site  When I arrived I found I had two rooms booked but was assured that something would be done  The hotel was well attended but not full  I checked out the next day but when coming back the next week I found I had been charged for the empty room   basically US out of my pocket not reimbursable  I protested but was told nothing could be done with the hotel blaming the quotLeading Hotels of the Worldquot which quotrunsquot its website  Thirty years of travelling through the best hotels in the world and never been treated so poorly and disingenuously by a front desk With pretensions to quotworld classquot this hotel will need to clean up its act at the edges  Flat screen TVs and faux raj trimmings will only go so far if it is to maintain its inflexible pricing and reservation policies  
N => unhelpful staff  Although this was a fabulous hotel my boyfriend and I were surprisedto find that we were shockingly overcharged by the hotel  We were quoted rates in U S  dollars for both nights at  amp  respectively  We were never given a rate in rupees nor were we ever told that the price in U S  dollars would in fact be much higher if we actually paid in U S  dollars and not in rupees  In addition we were never told that we were getting the rooms at a quotdiscounted ratequotand that we would actually be taxed at a  rate per night  We havelodged complaints with the hotel and they have ignored our request for an explanation of why we were quoted a price in U S  dollars  plus tax     and in fact charged   Our experience at this wonderful hotel has been soured by this quotunwesternquot way of doing business   quoting one price and charging another without any explanation  
N => Total s opulence This was our first port of call on our Golden Triangle quottourquot  The hotel cannot be faulted and they have created a s feel which I would imagine is very difficult to recreate  Better than anything Hollywood could doI recommend you have dinner in the Spice Route as it looked wonderful but we could not get in as we were only staying two nights and it was fully booked  If you know you are going to this hotel phone a couple of weeks ahead or e mail them Our room was a Heritage Suite and beautifully appointed The staff were attentive and polite The grounds outside were very colonial in feel  Lovely If you want a stay in Delhi in the best hotel    look no further  Stay hereOne tip    You MUST go to the Bukara Restaurant in the Sheraton  Best Lamb I have ever had and a unique dining experience  In many ways we were glad we could not get into the Spice Route as the Bukara I think thats how it is spelt was just wonderful  Go about pm and you should get in  They had a weird booking set up which I could not get to the bottom of but if you are going to go then go early  You will love it 
N => Old World Glamour Great Chef but spotty service Of all the high end hotels I stayed in New Delhi I felt this was the most beautiful  It had history and maintained its old world glamour  The restaurant Brasserie  was first class the service extremely attentive and the Chef who came out to check on the meal and discuss his background was wonderful  However at breakfast the staff was less than friendly and seemed annoyed to have to work  Its not like it wasnt their job there were no glasses or plates set up at the front to help yourself either  We had to ask for tea at least three times from three arate people  When I returned they had packed up all of my luggage I had specifically left clothing out to change into when I returned and taken it away with no notice whatsoever so I thought I had been robbed  I had not NOT requested that anyone take my luggage at all but they knew I would be checking out that day  Compared to the Taj Mahal and the Taj Palace the service here was the weakest but overall it wasnt bad  
N => Stay here to reminisce on past colonial glory only I had high expectations on booking this hotel based on past reviews and previous travellers to Delhi who saw the hotel from the outside The trouble started even before we got there  Their pickup charge from Nizamuddin train station was INR  So we took a normal taxi from the train station instead cost INR and we overpaid When we got to the driveway we were prevented from stopping in front of the lobby  Instead our taxi was directed away from the sheltered porch like some kind of pariah  Despite a  year old son in my arms I had to call attention to my luggage This was to happen  other times when we took an auto rickshaw back to the premises of this rarefied quothigh classquot hotel even though by then it was obvious that we were guests  When I brought up this issue to the hotel manager he was unapologetic and said things about how there are many beggars and such in India and that auto rickshaws which run on LPG by the way were a source of pollution I think he really meant that quotproperquot guests at his wonderful hotel should not use Tuk Tuks  Our interaction with the staff was characterised by this quotbetter than thouquot attitude  And this to paying guests mind you  They obviously treated caucasian guests better Im Singaporean so if you like that kind of thing you will be right at home Even though we stayed in a suite we had no view and the bathroom was lousy shower spurted at all the wrong places bathtub stopper did not work  
N => Only stay at the Imperial if you are French Horrible experience  Rude staff downgraded overpriced hotel  They assumed that we didnt understand French although my wife does We were supposed to get a room upgrade if available but were told that there were none  Next to us was a French couple speaking with the managers standing next to them  The manager told the French couple in French that they would be upgraded and he would tell the desk clerk once we left the area We will never stay her again and go back to the Oberoi who really have the best hotels in India  
N => Excellent hotel although a little over priced This hotel is an oasis of calm and sophistication and just about lived up to our expectations We had booked into a Heritage Room which was beautifully furnished and very large  The bathroom was however a little small for a room of this price  per night  Our room was on the ground floor and despite the hugest and most comfortable beds we hardly slept due to noise from outside our window  We requested to be moved for our second night and we re positioned in an identical room on the rd floor much better The hotel is furnished with loads of antiques pictures and other objects that make it a very interesting place to walk round  The inner court yard is a lovely place to have coffee or cocktail and the outdoor terrace restaurant  seems to be the place in Delhi to have lunch  We found the food in the  Terrace to be lovely but the service to be some of the worst we had in India  Having said that when we had breakfast the next day which was amazing   a fantastic range of food we were served very well We ate in the Spice Route restaurant which has very exotic oration  The menu is from all over Asia and both the food and service were very good  We found the laundry service to be excellent  We phoned at pm for  garments to have express  hour service  On handing over a blouse I pointed out a small tear trying to show that I knew about the tear so I would not be blaming them for it  The garments were returned  minutes later pristinely pressed and the tear was mendedOverall we felt that the rooms were slightly overpriced but we would definitely stay there again if in Delhi  
N => Imperial Blast  One problem after another Yes it was overwhelmingly terrible  Ill be the one to push the envelope a bit with honesty and I dont care to be popular  Was in Delhi working for an extended period over the summer  Tried Spice Route a few weeks prior our stay at the Imperial and shouldve taken hint that it was indeed not as hyped up as we thought  horrible service maitre dhotel made us wait with menus out in the foyer for   minutes after the time of our dinner reservation Our stay for two nights booked the heritage room and requested a top floor instead we were relegated to the ground floor  they claimed all the other suites were booked  Fine  The room was OK unpolished scratched up wood parquet flooring  wouldve preferred the ble floors on the upper floors  Area rugs were not vacuumed everyday even when requested  Our bath water was yellow called the operator and they sent a plumber who just ran the water to clear the rust from the pipes had to wait approx  minutes after he left for the water to clear  Shower water didnt drain fast enough from the stall I dont particularly like soaking my feet in shower water  Dry cleaning service was abominable  asked to remove a stain from a newly tailored sari and said item was returned in the same condition  When we approached the laundry guy he said he could take it back and douse it with kerosene to remove the stain needless to say we lined  Dining experience at the other hotel restaurant  was hugely disappointing  Chinese dim sum dumplings stuck onto banana leaf and broke apart at the touch of a fork hamburger was raw and lobster bisque smelled of plastic  Manager Bilbao came over and tried to smooth things over  that was the nicest part of our stay but was not enough to undo the damage of an upsetting hotel and dining experience  He owes us dinner should we ever force to bring ourselves to the Imperial  Check out was a disaster mistakenly charged for water from the fridge  which in fact was the bottled water we bought from outside since there was none when we first arrived  Buffet breakfast is good though the waitstaff seemed to be in a frenzy and manager tried to show us the farthest table from the buffet in the sunroom and hesitated when we requested to be seated at one of the nearer tables in the main room  Other guests are not so nice and considerate  One family left their room door open to have their matters echo into the hallway  Oh one last thing ia Shriver store me down at the breakfast buffet  How rude 
N => Old world charm Old world colonial charm except that me amp my wife preffered the ultra efficient service amp the great sleep we had at the nearby Shangri La  Back fromJaipur ITC Maurya was another let down  
N => fantastic fantastic Worth every penny           a must for a couple of days of luxury     the best in Delhi     we paid about   per night     after travelling for  weeks wed had enough of basic hotels and this was bliss 
N => Expensive and unimpressive rooms Checked into our heritage room on th ember which was dark dingy with dirty rug  We asked to be moved and were told hotel was full  Asked again later and was shown a room on the outside of hotel which was better but very noisy with traffic noise outside Main hotel restaurant and breakfast the service was slow and miserableSpice route restaurant fantastic or but food extremely expensive and have had better Drink prices were way overpriced  
N => Elegant The wide well lit corridors of this hotel have interesting high quality paintings of India on the walls  Rooms are spacious  WiFi okay but not great  Service excellent  Probably the best place to stay in a depressing city  The Delhi airport is frequently fog bound in  and   Huge delays in a sub standard airport  
N => Loved this hotel We were lucky to have two stays at this hotel at the begining amp end of our holiday I loved this hotel a tranquil oasis set back from the hustle amp bustle of Delhi we could easily stayed here for a month We were booked into Heritage rooms on both our stays wonderfully clean fresh amp spacious Believe you me the Imperial serves the best breakfast in India  Wonderful fresh squeezed fruit juices good selection cereals fresh fruit with yoghurt amp home made pastries to finish off We were unfortunate not to be able to eat in the spice route restaurant as it was booked up with conferences  We tried the italian San Gimignano amp the  both of these restaurants passed our expectations  The good thing about the Imperial hotel is that they do not add chilie powder to every meal unlike others in India My wife amp I have stayed at Raffles hotel amp for me The Imperial comes a close second  Thank you Imperial I will recommend you to anyone visiting Delhi  
N => Disappointed at first I had booked a Deluxe suite in advance but on arrival was checked into a o suite  As I had an idea what the rooms should look like I knew something wasnt right  I mentioned that I had booked a deluxe suite and the woman checking me in said that it was indeed a o suite and it was just as good as the one I had booked  I started to make a fuss so she called the assistant room manager who explained to me that all the deluxe suites were being refurbished I doubted this as on the website it states that all work has taken place and how come I was able to book it in the first place  but there was some building work going on so this  have been true  As I didnt like the o suite I settled for a Heritage suite but had to haggle the price down as they wanted me to pay the same as I would have for a deluxe suite  It is a Very nice hotel but like a few places Ive stayed at in India they need to sort out their reservations system  It is a fantastic place to stay and I would say one of the best hotels I have been to  
N => Disappointed As per the previous reviewer we had problems with the Imperial  We had a confirmed booking made over  months before arrival  They met us at the train station and took us to the hotel without any real problems  Firstimpressions were great  However on checking in they advised that the room was not quite ready and would we wait  About  minutes later the duty manager came to advise that a large government delegation had not left they couldnt be found and Im sorry but we have no rooms  After asking for the general manager he finally came and gave us the same story  He did however offer to provide us with a car and driver and to dine in the hotel at their expense  A nice gesture but as we had wanted to stay in the hotel not quite the result we wanted  We ended up calling the concierge at the Oberoi we had just finished a  day trip in their magnificent hotels across India and he found us a room at the Oberoi  Check out my report on this hotel The Imperial still supposedly couldnt find us a room the next day but again sent a car for our use and again offered diner at their quottop tenquot restaurant the Spice ket  Dont know why its so special  The food was OK but not so greatl as to get a top   The Spice ket in the Bangkok Regent now the  Seasons is much better  None the less the hotel is an architectural masterpiece  Very old world and in the British Raj style  Recently reated superbly  Gardens not what I expected tho  Designed by the great British architect Edward Luytens famous for his garden seat  Worth visiting if in Delhi  But as Jerry Seinfeld puts it quotyou know how to take a reservation just not how to keep itquot The Oberoi on the other hand knows how to really look after you  
N => Truly  Star  
N => Great hotel but a tip  
N => Fabulous hotel    look no farther in Delhi  
N => El mejor aterrizaje en la India  
N => D cor enchanteur et service hors pair  
N => Very comfortable I stayed in Lalit during my brief weekend trip to Delhi  I was positively surprised  Rooms were spacious and orated with good taste service was discreet and not too much  Suited well a Scandinavian traveller  
N => We had a great stay here    Not a bad stay  Location is ok not exactly in the middle of things but its fine  We had a room on the nd floor overlooking the city which was nice  Our only complaint is that the reservation wasnt ready when we got there and we had to wait for them to input in the computer again Otherwise the rooms were clean the food service was excellent and we had a great view  The breakfast was good and had no real complaints  
N => Terrible experience I dont know where to startit was a bad experience beginning with reservation till check out I made reservation for two rooms and when I called they told me suite is  per night I said I would call later to confirm Called  hours later and now they quote rate of  for same room Asked that person to talk to manager and they agreed to give rate of  per night I gave them my credit card number and reservation was made Then called them later to book another room they could not find my reservation adn had to rebook the room This is terrible standard for  star reservations Then food taste over there is terrible We had a function and had  things on menu  Out of  prespeciifed things there were only  of them and all of them tasted terrible Then come to check out processthe staff has such an attitude   even the person who comes and get your luggage We conveyed all these things to hotel manager at the end He made some concessions for our bad experiences But overall it was terrible staythere are many  star hotels in same area with much better service  
N => Excellent Hotel Good location Value for money  We enjoyed our stay in the Hotel Centre of DelhiCannt place was walking distance from Hotel My dhter enjoyed the pool The room was big with all modern amenities The breakfast was lavish All the staff we interacted with were very courteous Overall an exceiient Hotel  
N => SNOTTY RECEPTION STAFF The attitude displayed by the reception staff towards me was appalling  I had been looking forward to experiencing this hotel but because I choose not to have a credit card on my person I have a debit card instead the reception staff forced me to leave all my cash Rs with them as a deposit I felt quite insulted   In the rest of my travels in throughout India staying at other  star hotels I never once experienced this problem again  The room was modern but the bathroom lighting didnt work  The food was adequate  
N => The Lalit  star  Service was excellent arrived at   am and my credit card was refused but they still let me go to the room The room was modern with really good fittings superb bathroom Reasonably well located a short taxi or tuk tuk ride to Connht Place and many other attractions  The restraunt for breakfast was great the outside eating area was clen and welcoming if a bit noisy from road traffic All in all a good quality  star hotel with attentive and helpful staff  
N => Make sure you request a new room I arrived with a colleague and we checked in together  Her room was amazing modern and clearly worth the  star rating  Mine was old fashioned had a bathroom with old fittings and rust stains and smelled of stale smoke room   When I asked to change room due to the smell they told me the hotel was fully booked and they would move me in the morning but in the meantime would arrange for my room to be aired  Nothing happens quickly in this hotel but  min later a man finally turned up to help  Eventually we agreed there was nothing that could make the room smell better so I was moved to a room which miraculously became available Overall the hotel fixtures and fittings were nice but while staff were keen to meet every need it could take hours and several reminders for them to actually do anything  The breakfast and other food was ok but nothing special and on one day we sat for half an hour at a table where wed had to clear dirty dishes to one end there were no clean ones available and did not manage to see a single waiter to ask for a coffee  
N => Good  star hotel with a classy touch Hotel must have been reated recently  They kept some of the quotoldquot features but at the same time put it up to international  star standards  Well done  
N => would not stay again    We only had one night in the Lalit and chose it because it was closer to the railway as we were travelling by train to Agra the next day  Our flight from Varanasi was delayed  so we did not arrive at the hotel until   pm  Our booked room was not ready   and we had to wait The girl typed and typed and typed into her computer  no apologies no reason and so annoying When we finally made it to the room  the room was clean and fresh  There was a sign to request fresh fruit if required  As our next morning was to be really early  I thought   good idea  Tried to ring in house dining  Phone didnt work  Went down stairs and requested at the front desk  You guessed it   never arrived  We had a drink in the downstairs bar and ate in the restaurant  All fine not exceptional and definitely zero warm and fuzzy customer service and quite expensive  To be fair in one way the Lalit were finalising what looked like a massive renoavation BUT their prices definitely do not reflect any leeway for that   so they need to be judged against the full price tarriff  Would not stay again  Would head back to the Taj 
N => The worst hotel that I have exeperienced in my  travelling years As expatriates for years we have travelled to many countries and lived in various hotels for business or leisure purposes  Here is a sumy of our  days stayed at this hotel  Upon our arrival we discovered that our confirmed reservation was not listed in the hotel  We understand sometimes things are not in pleasant way and thus be patience for the front office staff to check  Sadly the staff took ages to check our booking and promised to come back to us after his investigation  To our utterly dis and shock the staff didnt check with the booking agent and thus created another havoc during our check out  We believe an unprofessional behaviour indeed does not reflect positively on a  star rating hotel  Space is limited and we cant continue with more words  You are more than welcome to contact us for more details  
N => A more intimate  star business hotel Usually stay in The Park or the Imperial but booked into this place for a change  Good gym small but perfectly formed with new machines  Bar not too uber trendy or pretentious  Good standardchoice of food on the buffeta la carte  What I really liked was the feeling that this hotel was not just another huge anonymous  star hotel that you can rattle around in although it did have approx  rooms  Will definitely use again  
N => Need to train their support staff The stay was comfortable and few support functions were good  I was in Delhi on a business trip and hence did not spend much time in the room though  Had to check in and out more than a couple of times due to my work schedule  Got different rooms each time and therefore was able to experience variety  At the reception not always is the best room allotted even if requested for  Some support staff are terrible and need severe training  One of the managers at the reception was very helpful even when the credit card system was not operational  Overall a good experience but need to put their act together given their positioning  
N => Lalit well situated but     My friend and I stayed here for  days in late ember  The Lalit was formerly the Intercontinental it was taken over by Indian hotel magnate Lalit Suri  We had booked our reservation at the Intercon so were surprised to see the Lalit sign and flags in front   we thought the cab driver dropped us at the wrong hotel It just so happened that we arrived on the day the new name was unveiled The entrance to the hotel is almost right off the street so no grounds to speak of  The hotel lobby is beautifully orated with modern flair and some enormous paintings of the Suri family  Check in was smooth although the staff were not especially pleasant  The hotel has several elevators but it always seems to be a long wait to catch one Rooms are modern and well appointed  We stayed in a standard room with  double beds   it was a little cramped but comfortable and clean  The hotel has a very cosmopolitan feel with travelers from many different countries  We met people from Africa China Europe and Australia and the US  It is situated about a  min walk to Connht Place and within short driving distance to many historical and modern attractions  There are some great restaurants and bars serving international fare in Connht Place   ask the concierge at the hotel to make reservations for you Our biggest complaint was dining at the Lalit  There is a buffet restaurant to the right of the main lobby but there wasnt much variety nor was the food very good  We had to wait a long time for a server to take our drink orders and dishes were not cleared away in a timely manner so ended up crowding our table  There is also a pastry shop that at that time did not sell coffee or small pastries that you could grab on the run  The  Bar only served foodsnacks while the buffet restaurant was open and it was the same stuff as served in the buffet We also tried to eat at Woks because we had heard some good things about it but after waiting  hours were still not seated  It got so late we just got take out and took it back to our room  After all that the food was disappointing   greasy and tasteless  Needless to say after that we just ate off site Overall   nice well kept hotel well situated  Service was passable  Just find other places to eat  
N => Great service I was at The Lalit during a period of nights  I visited Delhi for business purpose and ided to be put up at The Lalit  My ision was wise as the service rendered was very pleasing The staff was extremely courteous  The food was authentic and delicious  I was extremely happy with their service amp I shall always recommend The Lalit to everybody  
N => Looks good but too many niggles     ruary  saw my first stay at the reated Lalit after several stays there in the old days  On arrival the hotel looks very impressive but it didnt really live up to expectations due to a number of small problems  Check in was very slow and complicated which was very frustrating as we arrived at pm  I was travelling with an Indian colleague and we both had to endure a lengthy and unnecessary form filling exercise which apparently is part of their procedures  Although the hotel has been reated the old lifts remain which are rather slow and one of my pet hates  The rooms have been very well orated with comfortable beds and a huge flat screen television  However as other reviewers have mentioned the proximity to the railway station can make for a rather noisy night  Although very busy I have to say that breakfast is superb with an enormous array of food to cater for all tastes and dietary requirements  Another problem came on check out where I was significantly UNDERCHARGED on my bill and had to wait until it was corrected  Overall you will be comfortable and well looked after at the Lalit they just need to work a bit harder on some of the smaller things particularly at reception  
N => Grand       I thought the hotel was stunning      i can see on the site that people had poor service well that was not experience     there was a missing bathrobe in my room one day which I needed to go the swimming I had one in less than mn upon request I used all the services the gym  the spa the swimming pool the traditional Indian restaurant everything was a delight     Considering it was C when I visited the hotel was a peaceful and refreshing haven from the bustle and heat from the city 
N => Not really a good hotel to stay I found their services to be very poor and staff reluctant to entertain the guests  The locker in the room was not working and at reception I asked them to keep my passport  They retorted by telling me that I should keep the passport in locker in the room  When I told them locker is not working they said sorry but they cant keep  They didnt either change the room or got the locker repaired This hotel is near by a railway station and it was difficult to sleep with trains hooting away whole night  
N => Hate the place This was a crazy stay  Was booked for two nights with my family but it was possibly the worst stay ever Checkin etc was smooth but the first evening the air conditioner for the entire hotel went off  There was some scheduled maintenance going on and was supposed to go on for a couple of hours initially but it went on till the next afternoon In Delhis heat this five star hotel gave us a torrid time  The staff ran out of fans and we could not even open our window The staff did not help much  I ended up arguing with them regarding the fare they were charging me  They had the gall to present me with a full bill on check out  It made me furious Terrible terrible terrible One positive thing about the hotel is its good location  If you are willing to walk a few steps CP is almost next door  
N => Great Experience In totality it was a great experience  Food stay was really satisfying and to add to that slept really well after a really long work schedules  Service at the restaurant was good  The Hotel was very secure too  
N => Good could do with some improvements I stayed at this Hotel for one night on a Business Trip to Delhi  Hotel is quite centrally located thats a major plus point Crowded Lobby Check in was chaotic took some time to get my room allocated  Staff seemed confused and unable to handle large crowds at the same time Room was nice and spacious excellent view of the city large comfortable bed clean and large bathroom  Room Amneties were excellent  They even had cellphone chargers for most models in the room  Tried out room service for dinner  Order arrived on time Food was good not excellent Breakfast spread the next morning was basic not something to write home about  The Lunch buffet was however excellent though expensive There are two things that I did not like about the Hotel   The staff tend to linger around waiting for tips it happened to me thrice during my stay  This irritated me quite a lot   Though Recession has brought down Hotel Tariffs the rates for the all the other services and facilities remain the same  It seems stupid to pay over inflated prices for almost everything when the same thing is available outside for th the price  So even though I was travelling on company expense it pinched overall an average experience  recommended for Business travel only  
N => Loved this hotel I loved this hotel Ive travelled a lot and this would have to be one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in  The room was fabulous the staff were very attentive and helpful  The buffet was amazing   breakfast lunch and dinner and room service was spot on  The room was quiet it had an ironing board   the only hotel I came across in India that had one Attention to detail was excellent in the room   variety of newspapers chocolates   all I can say was it was fantastic  Only downside was the pool was still closed for reation and the restaurant was a little expensive but overall   Id highly recommend it  
N => a treat When we first arrived in New Delhi we stayed at the Shangri La but found it to be rather cold amp standoffish  When we returned to new Delhi we went to check in at Shangri La again but found theys increased the nightly rate over   or  USD in less than  weeks  We looked around and found La Lit to be the most reasonable luxury hotel that were willing to negotiate a fair price  The newly reated rooms were stunning amp almost identical to rooms at the Shangri La  We found the hotel atmosphere a lot friendlier and more welcoming and always bustling with locals and travellers  The breakfat buffet was outstanding If given the choice would definately stay at La Lit Would highly recommend this hotel  a real treat  
N => awefull This is a rip off joint  I have stayed in hotels ranging  star to  stars but this is the only one which wouldnt give any star ever  They charge like they are the best hotel in new delhi but other than that they have nothing  Id have been better off in a BampB for Rs  Thats how much I think they should charge No customer service aweful food construction and wierd check in process on  th floor  The lady was good looking though Thanks 
N => Totally Horrible Service Stayed there from     It was horrible experience  The staff was unfriendly  I arrived in the hotel at midnight  When I lined up for check in at rd floor the staff gave a head signal to the bellboy and asked him to take me to international club at th flr for check in  That was really rude  She didnt even bother to say anything to me  The hotel is going through reations  I could hear the noisebang sound when I woke up in the morning  I still could hear the bang when I came back to the hotel before dinner time  The TV and telephone in my room didnt work at all  I used my international mobile to call receptionist and informed her that telephone in my room didnt work  All TV channels except one had no signals  It took forever for them to fix this Unless the hotel upgrades their quality of service and improves its staff etiquette and professionalism this hotel does not deserve to be called class hotel I really hate this hotel and will never recommend it to my friends and networks 
N => Avoid at all costs Stayed on th  fortunately for only one night  As foyer is being rebuilt we were sent to a waiting area on first floor to check in  This backed on to the works and we were erated by only a short wallfrom the building going on  It was extremeley dusty and noisy  One worker was arc welding a few feet from where we were sitting The man who came to check us in was oblivious to the problem  We were in the unmodernised rooms  These are disgraceful  The carpets were badly stained and sticky  The bath was badly rusted around the waste and looked dirty  The new rooms  be nice but the old ones would do shame to a one star hotel  We went into the restaurant to see if we could have a meal  We were told that only meal available was Sunday Brunch  Thiis was a buffet costing  rupees each about     We had no alternative but to go for this as there are no nearby restaurants   minutes after going in we were told that the buffet was closing in  minutes  Sure enough in  minutes they started to clear away the food  No one had bothered to tell us that the buffet was about to close when we went in  We were still charged the   rupees Do not go near this hotel 
N => Good Hotel for India Stayed  nights and  night on erate visits to hotel in both new and old rooms  I thought the standard of both types of rooms were fairly good particularly nice beds  The older rooms arent as nice as the very modern new ones but the older room I got was much larger  Reation noise was noticable but I sleep pretty soundly probably not a good idea to stay in this hotel if youre a light sleeper till they finish  Service is good if you are persistent like everything in India things take time and patience  I got some ent food through room service  Breakfast is particularly good  Overall Id say its a good hotel but Im not too sure Id pay the full retail price for it which I didnt  
N => Musty rooms and not very clean This was not the most expensive place in Delhi and it showed  Our room was very musty and not very clean  Construction was in progress in some of the hotel  We found a much better place for much less money on the south side of Delhi at the end of our trip  
N => Floors that should have been closed in this hotel We recently stayed in this hotel between th and th il  We were given rooms on th and st floors  occasions  Reation was ongoing with considerable noise through the day starting at  am to around  pm Because of the summer heat in Delhi we had to return to the hotel in the afternoons and there was no peace bacause of the noise  This was pointed out to the Customer Relations saffed by a very young inexperienced girl who had to refer to the Manager on duty  The Managers response was that of quottake it or leave itquot that is your choice  I can understand his attitude as the rooms were booked through a local travel agent who had been pre paid The most polite personnel in the hotel were the lift and baggage attendants  
N => Do not recommend as far from  Value For Money  I frequently come to Delhi for business purpose and I wanted to experience this hotel With my wife we stayed  nights in the first half of il   Room attributed to us thank to my Priority Club Member card was quite comfortable and well located  In fact we were lucky not to be disturbed by the noise resulting from the rehabilitation work currently in progress  We heard around us many complaints about this  Unfortunately we cannot say the same about the rest of the services Quality of food available in Self Service Restaurant is relatively poor and choice limited  Certainly overpriced compared to the hotels within the same range Expresso coffee at  USD  of very mediocre quality is more expensive than the express in some Palaces in Europe Internet available in the Standard Room at  USD hour is absolutely scandalous  In some Guest House in DelhiGurgaon  Bamp B at USD     WIFI internet is available and freeStaff at reception is nice but relatively slow This Hotel is not reflecting the reputation of ICH group and needs serious improvements We do not recommend this hotel for the moment  
N => Fine for me  but I was lucky Having read the reviews I dreaded my stay The room was clean enough  quiet enough no problems   BUT  it seems I was lucky as other members of the party had had a noisy and miserable night  
N => Avoid bad experience I was on a  week business trip to India and was looking forward to my stay here as all the other hotels I have stayed in here have been excellent  However this place has some major problems  All sorts of issues that add up to an irritating and unsatisfactory experience  First I booked a non smoking room  When I went to check in there were no non smoking rooms available and they told me that I could have a smoking room and change tomorrow  When I book something normally its booked   right I didnt expect to book something and find it was not really booked  I got the impression there was a big conference that had block booked some rooms and my one person stay was not too important to them  The room they put me in is above an intersection of  streets and as anyone knows who has been to India on the streets they honk their car horns constantly  This would not have been a problem if the windows closed properly in the room but they seem to be screwed in place with some of the screws coming loose with the effect that some of the windows dont open or close properly and the effect is that the car horn noise comes into the room constantly  The room is OK but pretty shabby  The front control panel is missing from the television  The bathroom does not look particularly clean  Wireless internet is advertised but the wireless does not connect  I was under the impression that having put me in a smoking room I didnt want when I arrived that someone was going to call me the day after I arrived to let me know when I was switching rooms   nothing happened  It is the service here that is really lacking  I was knocked out by the service standards of the first hotel I stayed in the ITC Sheraton amp Towers in Chennai but the service here is poor by the normally high Indian standards  They have this system where you dial quotquot for any requests this links you their quotInstant Help Centerquot  This is a good idea in principle but the people who answer the phone have such a very poor grasp of English that it can be an irritating experience  I called quotquot to ask they why I had not been contacted about changing rooms  They answered the phone with the words quotcan I help you sirquot I explained the situation long pause on the other end of the line the person then said quotcan I help you sirquot I explained again long pause at the other end of the line the person then said quotcan I help you sirquot  You get the picture you might as well talk to the cat  Instant but not exactly help  I finally said quotyou cant understand anything Im saying   can youquot they then said quotone moment sirquot pause for  minutes of quothold musicquot  The receptionist was then out on the phone and gave me the impression that they had no intentions of contacting me about my room change it was kind of up to me to remind them  Not impressive  I also asked them why it was pm and my room had not been cleaned  They said there must have been a quotDNDquot notice on the room when the cleaner was there  Why do people in a customer care role use meaningless jargon when dealing with the public I finally figured out that DND meant quotdo not disturbquot  True   there was a quotDo not disturbquot notice on my room at am but Id kinda hoped that between am and pm a cleaner might have returned  The concierge service was a similarly disappointing experience  I went down there this morning and got some information about a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal  The guy gave me some information and I said Id think about it and come back later  About  hours later I went back to the concierge desk and it was unmanned  I waited and waited and waited  Around  minutes went by with receptionist staff at my side sometimes not even serving customers simply ignoring me  I finally got hold of one of the receptionists to try to see where the concierge was and they got hold of somebody  I thought this guy was also a concierge but it turned out it was just someone they got hold of he didnt have much of a clue how to help me but said the concierge would call me by four  Four came and went and I called the ever useful quotquot number and asked to be put through to the concierge long pause again the receptionist answered and stated that the concierge still was not around but he would call me in  minutes  Thirty minutes later I gave upon getting a phone call and went down to the concierge desk and found him myself  The electricity here also seems to drop out for around  seconds I was sitting in the bath last night and the lights went out  Each time the lights have gone out they have come back on again but I fear they  not one time  Also a note for all us Americans and Western Europeans who are used to smoking being banned in enclosed public spaces  Word of warning   it is not here and worse there is little or no sign posting to indicate where you can smoke and where you cant  I was having a coffee and a pastry in the coffee area just off reception where the service was very unresponsive and slow when I was engulfed in tobacco fumes  This is a pretty horrible experience when you are not used to it  I would not recommend this place they seem complacent and dont seem to care about their customers  The ITC Sheratons I have stayed in here have much cleaner rooms and their service standard are excellent  
N => Good hotel My  nite hotel stay was good  The staff was very helpful  Food was average  Room was average but still clean and quiet  It was quite pricey so I cant say the service or facilities were of equal value  Internet access was over US for  hours  
N => Better than expected     We were concerned about this hotel as a result of TripAdviser reviews but were given reassurances by our booking agent  It was pleasing to find that the hotel in our view provided acceptable but not wonderful accommodation in an excellent location for a few days in Delhi  Reated minimalist and upgraded room was fine with only occasional minor day time intrusions from the hotel reation programme  We found the entire reception staff to be most helpful with only one misunderstanding about billing  Room service especially dealing with minor problems could have been faster and more reliable  Be wary of the inhouse travel service whose drivers like to take you on unexpected shopping expeditions Excellent breakfast and a Chinese  restaurant to remember  Overall an enjoyable experience in an only slightly faded venue  
N => delayed checkout i was in this hotel last week and can truly say this was a terrible experiencehowever if you have time on your handsand dont mind waiting  minutes to check outmy collegue waited   to checkout this is the place to stay there are much better hotels than this  
N => Disappointing service from a global brand The Hotel Intercontinental The Grand in New Delhi in no way lived up to the expectations that we had of either the Intercontinental chain nor any hotel where the rooms cost more than US  per night I was part of a large group staying at the above hotel and also spending considerable amounts on the use of the hotels conference facilities  We were extremely disappointed with the quality of the accommodation and the level of service received when we raised our concerns Several members of our group had to request to change rooms because the rooms we were allocated were unsatisfactory they were dirty smelled bad or were in generally poor or shabby condition  My own room smelled dreadful and the window did not fit in the frame meaning a drht came through the gap and I could hear all the traffic noise  We had been offered newly reated roomsa t the time fo booking but we had to fight to get them In general the response from staff was indifferent and not attentive to our concerns the first time they were expressed  I had to call three times to ask to change rooms and was passed to several members of staff and was cut off twice  Even then I had to wait more than an hour for a resolution which only came when I went to reception myself to complain  A colleague was offered the opportunity to finally change rooms   at midnightI appreciate that we are priviledged to be able to stay in such an expensive hotel in a country where there is such abject poverty but I do not feel that the service justified the price nor that the service relfected that which I would expect of the Intercontinental brand  
N => Not recommended at all The room was nicely orated but the bathroom was extremely dusty and there was leftover grime in the sink that looked like it hadnt been wiped in ages  The shower drain and sink drain both clogged up creating a mini flood in the bathroom  The worst part of our stay however was the awful front desk service They could barely speak English and as a result could not answer many of our basic questions  For example they were supposed to call us with more information about our tour bus pick up time and place but never called  When I called down to ask for this information they kept insisting quotNo problem maam we have the contact list so we will take care of it  quot I tried asking the same question  different ways but gave up after a while  As a result of their incompetence several people were missing on our bus and our departure was delayed by quite a bit  We also placed a   call to the US that the hotel operator assured us would be free of charge but the hotel charged us  for the call anyway  We tried speaking to management about this but they refused to drop the charge  
N => Very Average I was pretty disappointed with this hotel for the money  When you pay over USD per night you expect better than dirty noisy dated rooms and bad food  The breakfast restaurant was terrible  The staff were fairly unhelpful although the airport pick up was good and USD per  minutes for internet access was not acceptable  It is nowhere near a  star hotel I would have thought the Intercontinental group would have better standards than this  I was disappointed  
N => Get another hotel The hotel is under rebuilding and you will know it at your cost  Hammering drilling solvents painting etc  dont contribute to an enjoyable stay I requested to change room because of noise the next room I was glad that improved except that next day they started to paint that floor so it was not very quotinspiringquot The same problem one year ago For the price we can have better options in Delhi Never again     
N => Nothing Special  reallly really not worth the money  rooms are uglyold and not clean  dont stay here  dont be fooled by the nice lobby  
N => great hotel overall We stayed here for  nights in mid ember   our first stop on a  week trip to India  I had stayed here twice before as a young single female traveler and felt very safecomfortable  This time I was with my husband and it was an equally good experience  Our room was in excellent condition and since we were recovering from jet lag we spent quite a lot of time there Room service food was quite good as was the breakfast buffet  We had arranged to have our train tickets sent to the hotel prior to our arrival in India and the hotel staff gave them to us as soon as we checked in  I do think that the Intercontinental like most    hotels in Delhi is somewhat overpriced but its worth it for a couple of nights particularly if you are just entering or about to exit the country  
N => Great place to stay We stayed at this hotel in il for  night  We had a club room on the rd floor  We checked in on the nd floor which also has a large lounge where afternoon tea is served to guests as part of the room price  Dainty sandwiches and cakes with a selection of teas are available  Breakfast is sometimes served there as well Our room was clean and well appointed with a king size bed wing chairs and large corner windows overlooking the city Although not newly furnished it certainly was not old and tired  Believe me I have stayed a appalling hotels in England at much higher prices than this one with snotty indifferent staff  I found the staff well mannered attentive and ready to help in any way they could  On our last day there we stayed in our room till pm  Our plane did not leave till  am in the morning  The staff at the desk on the main floor had a whole list of suggestions on how we could spend our time until it was time for the Intercontinental limosine which was included in the room price took us to the airport I read some of the reviews and I cannot relate them to our experience at this hotel  We had a great time there and would certainly stay there again when we go back to India  
N => The not so Grand Despite it not being our first choice but due to late booking we stayed at the intercontinetal thinking that the Intercontinetal name would provide reliability We had a club suite the room was old and tired it needed a refirb about  years ago  Service at the hotel was very average nothing excpetional  The food also was also nothing to write home about  
N => The worst experience ever We were to stay in the hotel for  nights but cut our stay to just one night becauseThere was no heat in the rooms when it was F outside The bathrooms had rust on the fixtures  The breakfast buffet had some stale and undercooked The lobby was dark and lighting was horrible kinda depressing acutallypeople were out to trick you at the business center especially overcharing for the internet service  
N => Not what you would expect from an Intercontinental Stayed here for  nights in    The five stars must be because of the impressive lobby cause it sure aint the rooms  After a grueling  hour journey in coach from California checking in at  a m  and only semiconscious and wanting nothing more than to put head to pillow the clerk was extremely aggressive trying to get me to join the Intercontinental hotel club or something like that at some exorbitant membership price  Could have lived without that  As others have stated the rooms were tired and in need of an overhaul  Windows dirty bathroom mirror hazed over like you normally see in some  year old historic house  I like my hotel rooms on the cold side especially when it is the hottest time of the year in Delhi  degrees  Even though I cranked up the temperature as high as it would go never got more than a cool breeze  It wasnt hot but not nearly as cool as I would have like it  When checking out the last morning of my stay I requested to leave  medium sized bag and my computer with storage until I was due to fly out that night  They said they wouldnt store the computer due to previous guests complaints about damage  I asked them if they really expected me to haul my computer bag around all day while walking through Old Delhi  After a lengthy discussion we finaly agreed on a compromise that I would lock my computer in my luggage but this took  minutes of needless hassle  On the plus size the guy who cleaned my room was very nice and provided extra bottles of water as requested free and the food and staff in the Woks restaurant was outstanding  Not sure why the place was empty both times I ate there when everything was so good and reasonably priced  The hotel is convenient to Connht Place and both Old and New Delhi I reserved way in advance on the Holiday Inn website and got a great rate a bit more than USD per night  For that rate it was serviceable but for a rate of   you should be able to do much better  
N => Not  star      
N => Grand but not great  
N => Not up to luxury hotel standards  
N => A  star masquerading as a  star  
N => not worth the price  
N => Unbeatable personalised service exquisite food reasonable rates Everything about our stay at this small boutique hotel exceeded our expectations  The service we received was the best we have ever experienced and it didnt cost the earth  All of the staff were warm friendly and took a keen interest in ensuring our stay was as enjoyable as possible  Likewise the food was superb although not cheap  There was a welcome air of tranquility to counter the hustle and bustle of the city and Id definitely go there again on my next visit to New Delhi  
N => Great restaurant in a hidden gem of a hotel Was visiting friends in Delhi and ided to stay at The Manor as had heard very good things about it  We spent  nights there and the experience was truly awesome  We felt we were transported to a private secluded world away from everything  Though the property is not too large with only  odd rooms but the comforts can match those in  star hotels  The service was perfect not too intrusive  A special mention of the food in their new restaurant Indian Accent   I have never had such amazing food in India before it was world class fare and the chef was willing to go out of his way to accommodate my request for light meals on certain days as well Coming back to the hotel each evening after the hustle bustle of Delhi city was like coming home     definitely recommended  
N => Could not wait to get out of there Booked a final night of a wonderful trip to Rajasthan in the Manor Hotel   based on positive reviews on T A  Big mistake Whilst the service was OK the rooms were unclean and and made you feel dirty as soon as you walked in  We changed the first room immediately think stains all over the ripped carpet and furniture bad smells and dirty bathroom the second was only ginally better  These were two of their best superior rooms We had dinner which was OK nothing memorable Overall I would definitely avoid  
N => Overall disappointed with manor I wonder when i read other reviews if i stayed in the same hotelthe hotel is in a quiet safe locationon arrival we were offered coffeethis failed to appearoffered complimentary head and foot massageby the time the masseuse arrived it was too late We had rooms  and room  had a damp smellhair dryer didn t workalthough reported was never changed room  was darkand we had lights on at all timesthis room was tiredcurtains needed a cleanterrace needed a sweepfittings in the bathroom need updatingno tea or coffee facilities in rooms We had to use spray in room as mosquitoes kept appearing Tried to book for dinnerbut it was the night of introducing new menu to local press etc we could sit outside on terracebutyes were told mosquitoes were a problemthey did pay for a taxi to take us to another restaurant At breakfast we were the only guestsscrambled egg on soggy bread was left There seemed to be staff training going on everywherebe they should have closed for a few days Dinner the next evening was excellentand i believe their new menu will be a great success the staff are excellentespecially the restaurant manager An early start the next day with the promise of a packed meal did not appearHopefully the hotel will get a make over along with the new menuwould i stay againprobably not  
N => Manor Motivates to Visit New Delhi again We dealt priily with Manish and must congratulate the Manor on having such a cheerful informed efficient and calm staff member  He was an absolute pleasure and deserves praise My fianc e became sick and the hotel immediately delivered medicine to our room  My airline tickets were in a disarray which affected my room reservation but the hotel was prompt in corresponding with me and subsequently we were upgraded which makes continued patronage   definite  I was recognized by staff and in turn recognized that they used to be at the IHC India Habitat Centre the literatti centrehotel of New Delhi  Everyone was polite well trained and always had a smile  The food was wonderful  The front desk was also able to confirm my airline ticket and did so in an efficient manor  The response times to emails were excellent and a wonderful way to keep business  The things I might work on I sent to the hotel and within two days not only had they replied but with detailed answers to my queries  This was at a time when Bombay was in a Volatile situation   but the Manor seemed calm and confident All in all we would definately recommend this hotel to our friends  It is already enjoying respect and a nice buzz in Delhi and I enjoyed reading about it in Tatler  We hope to stay there soon Best wishesAnjhula Singh BaisMedia Personality 
N => An oasis amidst chaos We visited Rajasthan in   arriving in New Delhi  Our travel agency used SITA as the organisers for our trip  They were a disaster however we insisted on staying at The Manor and it was a winner  This is a boutique hotel located about  mins from Connht Place  It is certainly worth the drive  The room was spacious the ble bathroom was spotless and there was a good supply of free bottled water  There is a small library with a selection of els and photographic books of the region adjacent to a roof k  They provide free internet access  Downstairs a cozy bar and lovely dining room  You have the option of dining al fresco  The food was superb we ate in the hotel every night  They have both an Indian and Continental menu to choose from  I love to cook Indian food and I thought the chef was superb  My dream would be to spend a month at The Manor taking cooking lessons from the chef Add to this the wonderful attentive service and you are in paradise  The hotel arranged a car and delightful driver for us  After we ditched the tour that we had arranged through SITA the staff at the Manor tailored a tour of New Delhi taking in places of interest to locals which was exactly what we wanted I could not recommend this hotel highly enough  
N => Quiet and refined It isnt easy to find a quiet place in smoky Delhi  This is a special place  You might consider it a boutique hotel or a luxury guest house  Just a few rooms  or  in a villa built and furnished in pure s style surrounded by a beautiful lawn and garden  Rooms are modern but cosy and clean flat screen tv  Service is very good sometimes a bit impersonal  The Restaurant serves excellent Indian food we didnt try Continental but you can expect it to be as good  Our driver had a few problems in finding it so the location can be a drawback about  minutes from Connht Place  But if you dont want to stay in one of those depressing five star towers which look alike all over the world   well go to the Manor Masimo amp ina 
N => Good Choice for One Night Another Delhi hotel where our pre arranged and re confirmed transfer didnt show up at the airport although the hotel claimed that someone was there waiting for us  We took a pre paid taxi again easy and inexpensive to arrange but again the taxi driver could not find the location  He was able to locate Friends Colony West be sure to say West but not the actual street  We had to call on the kindness of strangers and then to call the hotel itself before we could actually find the location  This is an attractive property with a nice bar and restaurant reasonable and plentiful food free computer access lending library and some green open space to walk around outside  The rooms were on the smallish side but we had just booked a basic room nothing more  Large and well equipped bathrooms with hairdryers and some toiletries  Flat screen TV with DVD player which we were unable to get to work  Lots of instructions which we followed to the letter but without success  We were unable to use the free wi fi access in our room either  So I would have to say that compared with the Hotel Palace Heights this was a bit overpriced about  per night  Still a fine reasonable choice in Delhi and with the ability to walk outside on the hotel property perhaps a better choice if one is spending multiple nights  Did not partake of the included breakfast due to an early departure but there was a complimentary fruit plate chocolates and bottled water in our room  
N => Great Value for Money I have been travelling to India quite often during the last couple of years and have stayed in most of the major hotels  However hotel rates in Delhi seem to have gone through the roof so I ided to search for an alternative  Having read the reviews about the Manor I ided to give it a shot  Although it was pricey it was great value compared to what I wasbeing offered at other major hotels  I very much enjoyed every bit of my stay at the Manor  From the airport transfer which is included in the room rate to the delicious lunch I ate in the beautiful garden I was very impressed with the personalized service  The staff was very helpful in giving me several valuable suggestions on tourist attractions places to shop etc  They went out of their way to help me get what I wanted   for instance I wanted to buy pashmina shawls but was short on time so theyarranged for someone to bring his collection to the hotel  I most enjoyed the quiet intimacy of the hotel which is unique to the Manor and definitely worth a premium given the hectic hustle bustle in delhi  The rooms have a modern d cor come with LCD TVs and really good shampoo and conditioner inthe bathrooms  Am definitely coming back Loved it  
N => Very beautiful Nice Hotel but a bit Pricey This is a really nice hotel in a quiet exclusive neighborhood  I liked everything about it but its overpriced compared to some of the other places we stayed that had amazing buffet breakfasts etc yet cheaper price  But if you want to spend a bit extra to stay in a very Zen like boutique hotel then go for it    
N => Ok hotel could be better My wife and I stayed at the Manor for a total of three nights in ember   The pickup from the international airport upon arrival was excellent even though it was quite late in the night  The checkin in the hotel was smooth  The front desk staff was helpful all throughout our stay  The hotel was generally nice but we did not like the lighting as it was quite dark all through the hotel   The windows in the rooms also did not offer any ent view or privacy the drapes had to be kept shut and faced an adjacent wall or the courtyard  Also the furniture and the finish in the room looked tired and requires some reation  The toilet in the bathroom had visible ks of being worn out definitely not to the expected quality for the amount that you are paying  The hotel breakfast was complementary and quite nice  However we found the service to be inconsistent  One day we were served very attentively  Another day the coffee not only took a long time but was terrible and we were given the bread assortment only when we asked for it later  The dinner was actually delicious and we recommend it highly  However on one occasion we did find ants on the table cloth and had to move tables  
N => Overpriced   its not worthing The hotel is located in a st place of Delhi  The garden of the property is nice but thats as far as it goes  My room was confortable but  lights were out of service when I arrived Nice shower in ble but bottles in glass in the shower containing body products  Restaurant correct but full of mosquitos by night Breakfast average Staff underskilled compared with he other hotels of Delhi Avoid the travel desk of hotel which takes high commissions   of the railways ticket price   for  nights in a standard room  Go to another  star hotel  Definitively  
N => Over priced noisy and to be avoided at all costs We booked a three night stay at The Manor after reading other positive reviews on Trip Advisor but were bitterly disappointed with the reality of the hotel Whilst the staff were very helpful our room number  was extremely small and dated had views out onto a brick wall suffered from non stop noise of inefficient and non working air conditioning and constant loud reverberation in the water pipes which penetrated throughout the room  In addition our room appeared to back on to a major railway line and we were therefore woken up througout the night by the horns of frequent freight trains We asked to change rooms but were told that the hotel was full  However there was no evidence of this at all as no more than  other tables were ever occupied in the dinning room at breakfast or dinner  
N => Lovely albeit brief stay at the Manor I checked into a suite at the Manor for about   hours after a flight from Jaipur while awaiting an overseas flight to Canada  The hotel is substantially farther from the airport than other properties my travel agent recommended i e   minutes drive absent any traffic but I was willing to forego an extra hours sleep in order to view the property I was greeted warmly on check in by the owner who made sure I checked in quickly some tea and had a bite to eat before catching some sleep  The manager was able to deliver a meal to my bedroom in under  minutes from the time I ordered and was true to his word that I would be awakened in time for my flight  The suite was reasonably sized with high ceilings and a compact but comfortable ble bathroom with arate tub and shower  The water pressure was good Bed was comfortable with high thread count sheets and soft pillows  There was a large desk and a small dated cathode ray tube type television a small chair and loveseat and a huge window I was exhausted on arrival but the area and the hotel itself was quiet and I had no problems at all with noise  I did not try the restaurant but the room service was prompt and the manager was very keen to please When I travel I prefer to stay in smaller owner run properties as opposed to large chain hotels  If you are merely seeking a bed between flights in Delhi there are plenty of options closer to the airport  However if you are looking for a respite from the noise of Delhi and more personal service I would highly recomment the Manor   I will stay there again when I next pass through Delhi  
N => Not quite right but great restaurant  This hotel is located in a nice part of the city but a long way from anywhere so dont expect to go out without a taxi  The room was nice but not huge  Strangely there was nowhere to put any suitcases and only one bedside table because of the space  As a result we had to find space on the floor for the two cases which was no that easy  A railway track runs close by  We were on the other side but it was noticeable even there  The best thing by far was the restaurant  Easily the best food we had in our Indian stay it was superb  They offer a European or Indian menu we had Indian both nights  It was beautifully presented and excellent quality  The chef was trying some new dishes the second night and personally came to make sure it was OK for us  The staff were attentive and the property itself is clean and set in a nice garden  Its just a shame about the room and the remote location  
N => Home from Home Worthy holder of the Trip Advisor No  Rated Hotel in DelhiOn arrival we were told to make the hotel our home during our stay The hotel certainly didThey were even gracious enough to let us camp out at the hotel during an overlay midway thru our trip including train and airport collection and drop off  Well be back J 
N => Hated the Manor Horrendous experience  Booked the hotel after reading rave reviews from other travelers who stayed there  Started off with the room being not ready for check in inspite of our delayed arrival  Crew was still vaccuming the room when we got there  Once inside the room the air conditioning was not cooling at all inspite of the thermostat being set to the lowest level  Mosquitoes behind the curtains and baby spiders everywhere from closets to the bathroom  Called the front desk to see whats going on  Nobody responded to the call  So walked out there and finally someone came to our room an hour later  AC still not functioning in  degree heat The bathrooms were a sorry state from years of useread abuse  Strange smell came from the room and the lobby at all times  Asked them to put a room freshner which was finally put on the day we were checking out All in all a horrendous experience At their price  per night one can easily stay in a  star hotel in delhi if you book in good time  Will not recommend this hotel at all and will surely never go back there again 
N => Booking problems After having read the good reviews of The Manor I tried to book a room for ruary  I sent a booking request by their website  After a few days I didnt get any reaction at all  I sent them an e mail as a reminder but no answer again  After having sent another e mail without response I ided to call them by telephone  They told me that they didnt get the e mails and asked me if I could send a new one  I asked them if I could fax them instead because I didnt believe they would receive it now  By the way they told me that there was vacancy for all room categories Finally I got a fax back with the answer that all standard rooms had been booked out          After all of this I ided to book another hotel  
N => Peace in India This was the one ent place we stayed in in India and it made a world of difference  Very cool place peaceful and stylish  Good service and not that expensive though not sure how much we paid  Its not the best value for money we have had but worth spending up for  Good food in the restaurant and v helpful staff all round  Location is not great but worth the extra  mins journey  Overall top quality  
N => Feeling Cosseted We stayed at The Manor for two nights at the beginning of our honeymoon trip to India at the end of ch  It was a very welcome oasis of excellent customer service beautifuly designed surroundings and great foodThe bed was exceptionaly comfortable and everything we needed was carried out promptlyfaultlessly and without cutting corners Not at all something which can be said for most hotels we have stayed in in this price rangeOur ision to stay here was based on reading other traveller reviews so now we will certainly consult this site before planning other holidays We liked The Manor so much that we asked our driversuperbly organised along with hotel bookings etc for the duration of our trip by Rajputana Holiday Makers in Jaipurato make a detour on our way from Agra to the airport just so we could eat there before our flight We definitely recommend this hotel  
N => A calm place but at a price A great hotel away from the fun madness that is Delhi  Rooms are lovely and the restaurant is very good  However all this comes at a price   its expensive even by London standards  But if you have just arrived in India and want somewhere quiet to stay its hard to beat  P S If you intend to arrange transport through them prepare to haggle alot as the prices they quote are very high  
N => A Modern jewel In Delhi  
N => More than pleased  
N => Dining good hotel dull   
N => Wonderfully relaxing place to stay  
N => Service de r servation par internet  
N => if you like food dont stay in MetroPolitian Hotel I m staying in this hotel for  nights  from   to  th   The food here is okay and because of my surgery I cannot leave the hotel so I eat here just about every day  Only twice i have ordered food from outside the hotel delivery  Both times I had a call from downstairs about my food I confirm that the delivery is for me  But no one helped me to bring it upstairs  the management would not allowed delivery boy to come upstairs nor he or any of the staff helped me for at least  min  when I call front disk they had no idea  and refer me to a manager when I call the bell person  they asked me to call the front disk  th in the evening orders between  pm  Both times the food finial got to my room Cold  And not eatable  Now i understand the policy of Hotel to try to make money by having there guest eat at their restaurants  At the same time  i do really feel that this is going too far by not allowing your guest to enjoy food from outside the hotel  I personally cannot eat the same food every day and I have been to all your restaurants and order room service all the time  but when a guest would like to order from outside  it should be allowed  The managers name was Ansha    he had no idea of what s going on or didn t care  I talk with him times during this period I asked him to please have somebody bring my food from outside and I cannot leave my room   with my condition  But he was not hearing me right  He kept repeating to me I m sorry would would like some free food from hotel restaurants  again back to the same thing I would like an explanation of what happen and is this the hotel policy not to let their guest buy any food from outside if yes they is should be plainly written on your website  Please keep in mind  that I m not looking for coupons and free stuff I m looking for better service and freedom to choose what I can put in my stomach  
N => Loved the Old world charm of the Hotel We had a three day stay in Delhi amp chose to stay at The Metropolitan due to its ambiance location amp old world charm  The building has a rare grace which is a rarity at most hotels today as the theme at most Hotels appears to be very Glitzy  The experience overall was very good though the brackish water in the toilet amp bath were rather upsetting this has resulted in toilet amp bath fittings getting rusted amp spoiling the overall experience a little The buffet breakfast is good with a good selection of hot amp cold food cereals breads etc  to choose from  We had only one meal at the hotel amp the South Indian fare for the Buffet lunch was very authentic amp tasty Overall a very satisfying experience  
N => It is difficult to get everything wrong    however this hotel managed it My wife and I have been working in Afghanistan for  months  Recently we were joined by our first dhter  We get  weeks leave every  months and we ided to go on our first family holidy to India   Goa to be more precise  However our poor dhter became struck down with various Indian stomach bugs and we ided to go back to Delhi a day earlier   the only hotel which looked semi ent from the websites   was the Metropolitan New Delhi  What we needed was an oasis of calm before heading back to Afghanistan  Sadly our one night at the Metropolitan Hotel made our holiday even worseWhere to start Perhaps with the staff   every single member of staff from the bell boys to the room service to the receptionist were sooo ingratiating and would hang around furtively looking for a tip  They only gave the impression that they were doing anything at all for a few extra rupees Next the room   it was tiny and looked like it had not been reated for at least  years   the style was very very out of date  Also the quotarate seating areaquot in the room amounted to an entire chair Hardly a selling point  Room service while coming quickly was mediocre at best but do not be tempted to order any of the desserts   the two we had tiramissu and New York Cheese Cake were terrible neither tasted like what they were supposed to  Additionally do not bother tipping for room service although the guy will hang around like all the staff looking extremely expectant since the hotel charges a   service charge on room service on top of the meal price Then there wa breakfast   generally the food was poor however you know a hotel has hit a new low when it is looking to apparently save money on the morning coffee  The waiter poured if for us and at first we thought it was tea It was so clear We asked him what was going on and he replied quotNo its just very weak coffee   quot It really did look like some hot water had been placed in a kettle next to a jar of nescafe but the two had only had the most fleeting of meetings    Finally to cap it all were their taxi policies  For some reason if you get a black cab from the Metropolitan their meters do not work  This of course then necessitates an annoing bout of haggling with the taxi driver once at your destination   Overall the Metropolitan just managed to get everything wrong  We understand now why it was the only  star hotel with any rooms available on that night     
N => please read my review before staying in this hotel we booked this hotel through thier website and clearly put  adults with  children we were checked in to this room that half the carpet was black from cigeret ashes and no extra beds for my two childs  contacted the front desk and they said they will provide as one fold up bed for one child with additional charges  they brought this fold up bed   i will not let my pets sleep in it after contacting the manager who was very very rude    he suggested to us that we all sleep in one double bed     i demanded to speak to some one and the assiatant manager came to the room  i had already taken photos of the bed they supplied and told him that i will post this on all sites i can  he was the only stuff that understood our problem and told us to check out the suits the suits came with a price but we had no options  the bed mattres springs were horrible  they also advertise tip free hotel    i swear the beggers on the street did not push you this much as they did   especially the front door man    he was unblelivable  the swimming pool area is discussting and please do not let your children swim    we did and my son and dhter both got sick    the we stayed thier in ember and the aircon in the room only blows cold air and when you turn it off   it turns on by it self at night while you sleep which gave us all cold   the breakfast in the morning was also horrible    i can promise you some of the left over food gets warm for the next morning like noodles  when checking out we had  stuff surrounding our taxi for tips  only  desrved tip   the other  had thier hand inside the taxi for tip   we didnt know why    the management were just looking  they should pay thier stuff more so they dont beg  tip is for a service   but when they ask money with out any service   thats begging    overall very very disappointing stay i will not recommend this hotel at all  the only man that i can say was help full was haider the assistant manager     poor poor quality hotel this can berated more like a   star hotel    it is very filthy and dirty also  
N =>  tarnished stars I flew into India in the wee morning hours arrived at The Met and was made to wait until they could a find me a room b proceed to clean said room after finding me one  I had pre booked everything expecting that upon arrival I would be ushered to my room where I could take a long hot shower and settle in  WRONG I was made to wait for about  mins  There after I was escorted to my room by staff eager to make a quick buck  I had just settled in after my shower when along comes a member from the cleaning staff having just heard that a new cash cow had settled into a room on his floor who knocked once and then proceeded to open my door  Good thing I had just come out of the shower and managed to wear something otherwise there would have been hell to pay  This persistent rude ignorant cleaning staff member was so cht up in trying to make a buck that he didnt realize I had just checked in under  minutes ago  He kept asking me if my room was clean  I should expect it to be so I hadnt had a chance to do anything  The view from my room looked out onto the back of the property which included an abandoned over grown lot with a bunch of dumped mattresses and some homeless children  Later on I needed to iron my clothes I called up reception who transferred me to housekeeping who said that I would have to put in a request for the next morning  I told them that I just needed to use and iron I would do it myself they insisted I put in a request for  something I needed done now  tomorrow morning  I also needed a charger for my phone when I phoned reception they said they would track one down for me  They did and it turned out that the pin size I needed was actually broken and wasnt working  I ended up spending over  INR just on local phone calls  Before checking out I spoke with one of the Managers who said they were sorry for any inconvenience and that was it  Food was mediocre as was service  I feel this hotel really needs to re classify themselves because honestly with the exception of upper management front of the house staff  all the other staff members are just keen on milkingbegging tourists and making a quick buck without providing any real service 
N => Expensive and bring your own bath gel I went with an open mind after reading the reviews on trip advisor  Although the lady at reception was really nice and pleasant the hotel and old and not too well looked after  What was really disappointing was the bath gel in the bathroom which came in a tiny bottle  It was so thick that you could turn it upside down and it would not flow outHousekeeping does not replenish toiletries and I had to ration to make sure that I had enough to use for my stay there  
N => very expensive hotel We stayed here in t  over  days we checked in  times as we were travelling around  it is very expensive to stay here the  star Sakura hotel food is awful and so is the service we had to complain as at   a meal in India you expect the best The bar rates are terrible we had  beers and  malibu and coke we Paid   Be careful as we got followed outside this hotel by a rickshaw driver they are in gangs to try to loot you please be careful dont listen to them  I would not stay here again as everyone expects tips even though it is a tip free hotelOur room view was a field were i saw people using the field as a toilet  All in All too expensive and well over rated  
N => Do not stay there   pay  US more and stay at Meridien for example staff was helpful enough to make it up for the very bad room and the overall conditions of the hotel We had to change  times because we could fell the wires inside the matress  Outdated rooms not so cold shower poor quality breakfast  We ordered room service and it was ok but nothing really good specially considering the price  us for a hamburguer  The only thing is that we hired a car to go to Agra and the driver was really good no incidents no crazy driving no offerings to stop at any shop expensive service though  
N => ent hotel A ent hotel  Pricing was quite reasonable and that was the reason for choosing this hotel Overall the rooms were a bit small but manageable   food at the restaurants was average and ent Not a very great lobby but was ok  Service was ent though people at the front office need to smile a bit Overall a good hotel for business travellers  
N => Little bit of Japanese in Delhi HiA Good hotel in a posh locality  Easy access to any point in Delhi  Plus being a Japanese themed hotel helped the other guests who stayed along with me The restaurant served very good food  There was some Thai festival going on at that point of time amp the spread was good  
N => Give it a miss I have just returned from a trip to India which included a night at this hotel at the start and end of my holiday  I really hate to be negative but this hotel has few redeeming factors  I appreciate that it is not top rate price for Delhi but the rooms were very ordinary and the club room I booked for one night was no different to the ordinary room  The restaurant was unbelievably slow and the staff were not at all attentive or interested  The club lounge was closed so could not be used although the patio restaurant was available for use but we had to explain that we didnt have to pay for our coffee because it should have been free in the lounge  Food and drink is very expensive  Also it has recently been renamed and taxi drivers and tuktuk dirvers do not know where it is   we had an unpleasant tour of Delhi at   pm in a taxi which could not find it   he kept saying that the address we gave was for a different hotel  
N => Excellent hotel a bit too expensive The Metropolitan is a comfortable place in quotGrand Hotelquot style conveniently located close to Delhis central Connht Place  The hotel facilities and rooms are of excellent quality although a bit limited no real bar only a noisy night club and two expensive restaurants   but a fine swimming pool Service was just average  The pre arranged pickup car at the airport wasnt there  Although friendly the front staff was not very well informed every question going beyond quotHow do I get to the Red Fortquot was met with blank stares  Room maintenance was excellent though  One day out of my  the water in my bathroom was distinctly brown but apart from that everything functioned I was more disturbed by the price of every extra  Hiring a car through the hotel cost about the double of what I could arrange myself internet acess at  Rs for half an hour is a ridiculous price for Delhi and the breakfast buffet though excellent at  Rs was also a bit hefty   this is Delhi after all not London But overall the Metropolitan proved a welcome oasis every evening after the hustle of Delhi  Knowing the city better now Id probably not go back and try to find a slightly cheaper hotel with more character but for a first timer with some money to spare this is a good choice  
N => Professional Staff Me amp my wife booked the deluxe std room for our wedding night but at the check in time we were provided complimentary upgrade from the management in the executive floor  a bottle of house wine Buffet breakfast in the morning was par excellence and so was the chocolate truffle cake we ordered from their bakery The hotel is centrally located in New Delhi and also offers in room dining hours  They have a great pool well equipped gym amp massage service and lovely spa to relax everyone Besides being positioned as a business hotel and we not being business guests we really felt nice with their hospitality We would definitely recommend this to other people across the world since we ourselves experienced the professionalism  
N => Very Mixed Experience  I booked two stays at this hotel in the last month  On the first occasion I arrived at about midnight and was given a smoking room which they tried to convince me was non smoking  After returning to the reception and insisting they moved me I was given a non smoking room  On the second occasion I was given a room with a non smoking sign screwed onto the door but it stank of cigarette smoke and thus was clearly not what I had asked for  The reception staff were relatively clueless and unable to answer any of the questions I asked  They always referred me to either the bell boys or the travel desk  The hotel did not have a concierge and the travel desk was actually a tour company so as you can imagine they did not give impartial advise  In fact when asked which train station my onward train left from they sent me to the wrong station luckily i had plenty of time to rectify the situation In terms of service the bell boys were excellent always giving me the information i needed with a smile The food was the best thing about the hotel  The morning breakfast included in the room price was an extensive buffet with European Indian and Oriental foods all very tasty   a very good start to the day  I also ate in the Indian Restaurant which was also high quality but extremely expensive given the costs of food elsewhere  Rpperson The internet was extremely fast but seemingly extortionate at Rp per hour or RP per hrs I initially booked this hotel because there was a   discount on the room rate  Rp from   If I had paid full price for the room I would have been very unhappy  Overall it was an average and expensive experience  This is in no way a   hotel it is a middling    Next time I return to Delhi I intend to try out a different hotel  
N => Perfection of scamming If you get a bit tired and annoyed with the scamming on the streets of New Delhi don t book into the Metropolitan because they have pushed things to a new level  We had arranged our own transport to the airport since we did not want to pay the inflated rates at the hotel but staff at the Metropolitan were barefaced enough to chase our driver away so that we had to use their taxi We were also not allowed to cancel our breakfast for the last night although we had to check out at am in the morning  Instead we were given a really impressive packed breakfast consisting of a small o juice a stale doughnut an apple and a sad Danish pastry at the charge of    If you don t mind this kind of callousness the outdoor pool is lovely after a day in the city and the rooms are nice enough if you are not after high end design  
N => Good enough Highlights Reasonably priced Good Location Friendly staff Good restaurants Nice gift shopDisadvantages Rooms are old More birds are swimming in the pool than people No convenience store Had the potential to charge you for everything e g  use of the business centers internetIf we were to travel back to New Delhi I might look for another place to stay  But if I couldnt find anything else close to the night range I would stay here again  However lets hope the hotel rooms get remodeled soon  Theyre over due  I would like to thank the staff for their kindness  We pre booked our rooms but had to change our plans due to an unexpected illness  Fortunately the hotel staff was understanding and accommodated our changes with no penalty  Thank you  
N => Excellent hotel    not sure about the restaurant After  days traveling round india in mid range hotels we ided to treat ourselves for our final night in India  The service and room did not disappoint us  All you would expect from a   hotel not sure it reaches    Its location is perfect for all the touristly hot spots and refreshingly it is tip free  However instead of having the relaxing end to our trip that we wanted we were violently ill after eating at the very expensive Chutney restaurant  In defence of the hotel I did not have to pay for the meal and they did supply us with a free airport transfer but this unfortunately I had to request this as it was not offered automatically  I can only assume that this was due to different expectations of customer service and the fact that they  not of had anyone complain about food poisoning before  We would stay here again but we would stear clear of the restaurant 
N => Building work   what building work We stayed here on two arate occassions two weeks apart at the begining and end of our holiday  The first time at the start of ch  no problems at all and infact we were very happy with our stay  The only quibble would be the addition of a   service charge and whopping   luxury tax on everthing making this hotel quite a bit more expensive than it might seem at first The second occassion was an entirely different experience  Having checked in room  we could hear drilling and hammering so we called reception to ask if this would go on for long and if so could we be moved  Having been assurred that the work would finish within the hour we ided to stay put  We headed out for some sightseeing returning late afternoon to find the door to a room two doors down was open and workmen drilling and hammering away  Another call to reception to ask why the work hadnt stopped and we were given more assurances that the work would finish immediately  It didnt By   pm the noise was still continuing so I went to speak to the duty manager who denied that any building work was going on  I asked him to come up to the room so he could hear for himeself and after he made a phone call he followed me up  Needless to say there was no noise when he arrived  He said there was a factory next door and the noise must have come from there  Not very happy at the suggestion that I was being called a liar I assurred him that if there was any more noise I would be seeking a reduction in my bill Returning from dinner at  pm I was staggered to be met by the sound of more drilling and so went to investigate where the noise was coming from  Through a service door on the th floor I find a team of workmen drilling and hammering away  While about to take some photos to prove to the duty manager that work was going on and in this hotel the housekeeping manager comes along claiming he was going to tell the workmen to stop  I asked the housekeeping manager to accompany me to see the duty manager to tell him that the work was continuing which he does and I am assurred by the duty manager that that really is the end of it   there will be no more work   minutes later back in my room what can I hear more drilling and hammering  Feeling pretty angry at this stage I was going to go and tell the workmen to stop myself but upon getting to the service door I find the duty manager there himself finally accepting that there is building work going on in the hotel and assuring me he will stop it immediately  Returning to my room I was called by the duty manager apologising for the noise and accepting that the hotel had made a mistake  I told him I wanted a reduction in my bill but he claimed I had booked the room at a good rate so he couldnt give me a reduction  An argument followed that the rate I was paying was not the point the point was the shocking level of service lies by the hotel staff indeed its managers and the fact that our day at the hotel had been ruined by the noise of building work  Request refusedWent to bed  The work near my room had indeed ceased    but I could still hear drilling in a distant part of the hotel until just before midnight they had simply moved to work elsewhere We had an early checkout to catch a plane and again I requested a reduction in the bill which was again refused  Not sure of quite how bad the legal consequence of leaving a hotel in India without paying could be and needing to catch a flight I agreed to pay the bill under duress but have advised them I would be complaining and ensuring that our experience was posted here on Tripadvisor which didnt elicit any discernable concern Not a happy experience  
N => Perfect for a very fussy other half Having visited India many years ago I knew what to expect from low to mid range hotels  Therefore taking along my girlfriend who simply has to have everything amp anything spotlessly clean and anticeptic I knew this was going to be a challenge What a find the Metropolitan was  Of the top range hotels in Delhi it was one of the cheapest  We paid approximately   for a room for the night no breakfast  However it was money well spent Location equal distance from Connht Place amp the Rajpath this meant that  main attrations were only  to  minutes away  A taxi ride of approx  rupees was all it took   an obvious rip off for locals but still an absolute bargain for tourists  Also at  mins taxi from the international airport approx  rupees then this was ideal as well  The hotel is an obvious island of luxury amoungst the chaos of Delhi but this is the same all over the city   if you want New England then go to not New England  Thsi is DelhiService quotTHIS IS A NO TIP HOTELquot Bliss No social errors here  Its not the money its the principle  Courteous and attentive staff  All said hello but were not obtrusive  Bar staff on hand when you wanted them  The reception desk staff were not the cheeriest in the world but were still polite amp attentive  The restaurant staff were extremely helpful and again only appeared when you wanted them to  Concierge  door staff were excellent at getting taxis usually arriving in less than a minute Security With the current climate in India this wa sof note  A good taxi search on our arrival  The gront gates were always manned by at least  security staff  Electronic front door check  The rooks were the usual card key type  Safes in the rooms  There couldnt be more effort to make us feel secure Rooms Spotlessly clean  Linen immaculately clean spotless amp crisp  Usual slippers to keep sensitive feet from the carpet  Bathrooms also spotless as were the fluffy towels  TV had a good selection of channels gt with a larg ish flat screen TV  Plenty of wardrobe amp drawer space and the rooms in general felt very spacious  Beds were made up immaculately and were very comfortable on the firm side Food  bars We ate in the Indian restaurant in the hotel  Very classy a good selection and again very clean  The service was helpful and knew whn to arrive or go away  As experienced Indian food buffs this was top stuff  You pay hotel prices but what you get is better than most places in the city  We also had breakfast a few times  A generla buffet covering EnglishUS breakfasts Indian or Japanese  Again no complaints  Very good tea  The one bar didnt seem to be used much and had the aircon a bit too cool but the service was very good Pool  public areas Lovely size pool  A bit chilly in ruary but certainly warmer than home Plenty of fresh towels on hand  There were only  recliners though  A minor fault  The open areas inside amp out had plenty of nice seating amp tables  The outside area was used for a wedding on  days which meanyt music at night but this finished at pm Overall money well spent and got a full thumbs up from my very very fussy girlfriend  
N => perfect for our final night in India We ided to stay at a five star hotel to give ourselves a bit of a treat as our final night   I think it was well worth it  The room was nice the bed was super comfortable The seafood buffet amp breakfast buffet were both quite niceThe hotel is looking a bit tired in places though and it could be a little cleaner To start with I like the fact it was a tip free hotel although what they dont tell you when you check in is that everything comes with a service charge   aka theres the tipWould recommend this hotel quite happily Not sure if this is a gay friendly or not hotel   but they had no problems changing a twin room to a double room ie giving us the one bed rather than having us in erate beds 
N => Very pleasant for me I travel to Delhi every two months at the moment I was offered a special promotion so I ided to change from my normal hotel booking to try the Metropolitan Hotel New Delhi The first impression reception services porter etc were very good very helpful and pleasant The room was excellent  The Spa was excellent Good internet services which are critical for me I didnt try the Japanese restaurant as I am not a fan of Japanese food  The Indian restaurant was very good indeed  The restaurant and bistro in the lobby was good food but I found service a little lacking on occasions  I did not use the hotel bar as I normally do as it seemed to be more geared to a young persons nightclub The central location of the hotel is superb If I can get the same special promotion I will certainly be back  
N => ent Hotel We stayed at the Metropolitan following a great stay at the Imperial  so that probably colored our experience  but the hotel was nice  the breakfast was pretty good and the rooms were dated but comfortable  The service at the concierge for arranging a car to the airport was lacking but no big complaints  If you get a cheap rate its a fine place to stay  Not much to do there  so a bigger hotel  be better 
N => A good place to stay A pleasant enough hotel  We loved the breakfast and the food on level one for dinner was superb  All staff are very friendly  As our first stop in India it was good to know an ATM was just a walk down the road  We only had one problem  We arrived at midnight after flying all day and were looking forward to a quiet nights rest  There is a bar downstairs which had been hired out for a function Sunday night  Doof Doof music finished around   Our heads stopped thumping about a day later  We must be getting old  No problems the second night  I would be cautious about booking this hotel over the weekend in case another function has been booked  
N => Not as advertised Both Hotels com and The Metropolitan guaranteed a comfortable stay for   Careful attention went into booking a hotel where  could sleep without a roll away bed  After calling The Metropolitan myself I booked the room that Hotels com and the hotel directly told me included  beds and a arate sleeping area with a sleeper sofa  When we arrived late at night after  hours of traveling we found a very small room with a roll away waiting for us in the hall  Besides that this was not the room I was guaranteed the roll away was rock hard the mattress disgustingly filthy and torn  They had to remove a chair in the room to make room for the roll away and of course there was only enough room on the floor for our  suit cases  We had to step over suit cases to get to the bathroom or out the door  The managers were firm in their position that this is what I had booked and would not consider moving us  It was not until I threatened to complain to Hotels com and American Express that a rd manager was willing to move us to the room I had originally booked but this room only had  King  All other rooms were booked  They did manage to find us a futon that was less disgusting turned upside down so I slept on an angle the last of  nights  The only consideration the hotel gave us was crediting the shuttle ride which we were overcharged for in the first place  The hotel is clean and the restuarant although catering to an international crowd was way over priced  We were also there during the attacks on Mumbai and although they informed us that they were stepping up security there was little visible additional measures taken short of checking our car when we arrived one night  We agreed to pay the additional costs to stay in a comfortable hotel and could have saved hundreds if not a thousand dollars staying in an ashram  
N => Star worth a visit if you can find a ent price Stayed at The Metropolitan for a few days shortly before Christmas  Not too many other guests around possibly as a result of the international economic downturn and the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai  However a party appeared to be enjoying a private engagement in the hotels public rooms at least one night during my stay As at other large hotels in the city at the moment all cars were checked for suspicious contents before being allowed to enter the grounds and visitorsguests handbags were searched I took a prepaid taxi from the airport to the hotel  Neither the driver nor the Delhi Traffic Police prepaid taxi booth attendant recognized the name quotThe Metropolitanquot but I was able to show them the location on a map I had brought and had no trouble going directly to the hotel  Im not sure whether they did not recognize the name because the hotel is alsoor used to be known as the Nikko All of the staff with whom I interacted from reception to checkout were friendly and welcoming  On checking in I requested a quiet room  I had booked a deluxe room through the hotels website Rs   per night which is about US before taxes and service fees    note that taxes and fees increase the total amount substantially however I was upgraded to a club room with complimentary breakfast on the side of the hotel away from the street  I didnt have a chance to take advantage of the breakfast    I was too busy eating my way around Delhi the rest of the day The fittings of the bathroom bathrobe and slippers daily newspapers etc  were all very nice but the view didnt quite fit with the concept of a club room in a quot starquot hotel  The room was comfortable although smaller than I had expected from the website description the website described a deluxe room as having a quotcomfortable arate sitting areaquot and I naturally assumed a club room would be even larger than that The bathroom was also relatively small but was the nicest part of the room There were be three dozen television channels listed in the hotel guide in the room  However the reception was acceptable for little more than a half dozen most of these broadcasting in Hindi My room was quiet during the night and I slept soundly although the mattress was extremely firm Internet access was Rs   plus tax per  hours  The website description of the rooms is misleading in that it suggests that internet access is included with the rooms rather than that internet access is available in the rooms for a arate fee  I was able to connect from my room most of the time I attempted to but there were a number of times that my laptop could not find a wireless access point or that the signal was lost The hotel is located about a  minute walk from Connht Place and the Rajiv Chowk metro subway station  There is also a cluster of restaurants including a shop that sells pastries and ice cream just  minutes down the block  After my first few days in New Delhi I ided to move to a hotel further south to be nearer some of the restaurants and other attractions I wanted to visit  Incidentally I noted while searching for hotels that the rates The Metropolitan was advertising had dropped considerably from what I was already paying  I called the hotels travel desk to inquire as to approximately how much a taxi would charge to take me to the other hotel which was about  km away and I was told Rs  plus tax  I ended up calling a taxi myself and paying about  what the hotel travel desk had quoted me Overall this is a reasonably well maintained and comfortable hotel that I would be willing to visit again for around US per night plus taxes fees  I would be more enthusiastic about recommending the hotel if the website presented a more accurate description of what is on offer and if more services were included in the basic room rates eg internet  I cant see anyone paying US per night as described in another review  For that kind of money I would go to The Imperial where I have stayed on most of my past trips to New Delhi  
N => Absolutely LOVED our stay   wish we could have stayed longer Frankly I am shocked by the bad reviews here because I had an extraordinary experience at the Metropolitan and the service was by far some of the best I have received in India We were in an awful hotel in the South Delhi area and wanted to make our last night in Delhi perfect  Thankfully the Metropolitan had a room and a discounted internet rate  After losing the better part of our day trying to get some hot water for a shower at the first hotel we finally made our way to the Metropolitan and were greeted with sublime comfort exquisite service and a hot hot hot shower We had a room on one of the Club Level floors th and it was perfect  Clean and comfortable well appointed and so quiet  It was magnificentWe ate lunch at The Patio the main restaurant in the lobby area and opted for the buffet  There were many wonderful things to choose from including some of the most artistic looking desserts I have ever seen  I found the service to be attentive but not overly instrusive For dinner that evening we opted for Chutney  I like the ambience of this restaurant with its comfortable seating low lights and nice service  Definitely a nice place for a romantic dinner  The food was good but not off the charts greatAfter my boyfriend left to make his flight home I had an entire day left before my flight  I booked myself a spa treatment which I will say was right on par with any spa treatment I have received in the US  A couple of times the power cut but hey   its India My technician was attentive and my massage and facial were relaxing and enjoyable  I appreciated the fresh fruit and tea afterwardsI found check incheck out to be problem free and quick and the bell staff helpful and organized  They held my luggage as I took in some sights of Delhi before my departure and everything went smoothly when I needed to retrieve it  My thanks to Nitin in The Patio for his sightseeing suggestions   I did manage to get to the India GateOverall I found this hotel to be one of the best places I have stayed while in India  My first choice usually are service apartments when traveling in India but since this was a one night stay and the last night we were to be in Delhi I opted for a little extra pampering  My only wish now looking back is that we would have stayed here our first night in Delhi also It was worth the extra  paid We enjoyed every minute of our stay and look forward to future stays when back in Delhi  
N => Unfriendly and unwelcoming Found the metrolitan hotel terrible   the staff were rude unfriendly and unattentive  We had requested a taxi pick up by email a week before arrival amp to confirm how much it would cost  As we had had no response we made our own way to the hotel  When we got to the door the manager asked us in a rude accusatory voice Our taxi is WAITING at the airport for you   why did you make your own way we literally hadnt even got in the door at this stage After waiting   hours we got to our room even though wed requested an early check in  The room was clean but just bland and certainly not  star standard  the pool area was very run down   old seats no staff there   no one seemed to use it  The bar downstairs was quite nice   although the air con was at arctic level and dont be fooled by the  for  cocktail deal   they double the prices to make up the difference  The crux of our disappointment was that the manager phoned us to tell us he was charging us for the taxi service anyway   we went mad and said there was no way we were paying for their incompentence of not confirming they would collect us  We argued about it and just refused to pay they kept claiming theyd confirmed by email the certainly hadnt  Any hotel that niggles with a customer and questions their integrity is just not the hotel I want to stay in  We had booked a nd night on our return journey but naturally cancelled this  You can stay in the shangri la for just  rp more and it is SOOOOOOO much better  
N => Service is Disappointing To be fair the hotel accomodation is above average  It is their services that disappointed us  Our lugguages were accidentally directed to Mumbai by the time we arrived New Delhi  When we checked in this hotel around midnight we advised the night shift staff about the Airlines arrangement of sending our lugguages back to our hotel that is Metropolitan the next day  We also advised the receptionist to take a photocopy of the Airlines claim form to ensure everybody knew about this  Since we were heading for Agra early next morning and would not come back until  pm to pick up the lugguages for an onward flight to Singapore that night we repeated our request by the time we checked out to avoid any mistake  Of course you know the answer there was no lugguage by the time we came back  At first we thought it was the fault of the Airlines  But we later found out that the hotel staff turned down the Airlines delivery because we had already quotchecked outquot To add on our request for one more bathrobe and slippers right after we checked in the room had one set only we had  persons was never been fulfilled or being offered an explanation  Was it due to understaff or what There was a high tendancy of long queue for checking in and checking out because only  receptionists were available  I definitely will not stay in this hotel for my next India visit  
N => Price too high poor services I spent  nights in this hotel  The room was always too cold every time I had a shower the bathroom was full of water the sheets were torned  The edges of the pool were full of pigeons  When I did the check out I had to wait that my room was checked by an attendant never happen to me  For these prices you can find something really better 
N => Expensive but nice The hotel itself was somewhat reminiiscent of the days of the Raj  The actual grounds was not not huge but was pleasant  The swimming pool was adequate  Like all Delhi hotels the price was high  The buffet offered a good selection  All in all it was not an unpleasnat stay but nor was it particularly memorable for its staff or service  
N => Good restaurant Stayed here   days  Hotel room very nice with good bathroom  Restaurant is excellent  Shuttle to the Airport also very good although driver overeggs the hints on how he needs tips to survive   Id say hes getting several times his monthly salary on tips Restaurant gave me complimemnetary bottle of water when I wanted to buy one fro trip to airport and I extended my use of the room after checkout until pm at no charge   which was nice Only problem area was reception where they were difficult to communicate with   I think their english was transactional so that if everything routine fine if not they had no clue and best option was to give up  I got food poisoning after a meal on Indian railways just before arriving at hotel  Extension to stay was required so I rang my Insurance to arrange  They rang hotel to arrange dor visit and to confirm that they would pay bil for extra stays  Then Insurance rang me back to say that reception needed me to talk to them directly  So I called down immediately whereupon Reception denied that they ofr any of their colleagues had ever been speking to anyone  When filling in customer feedback on leaving I mentioned this and manager came out to say that they had been contacted but there was a miscommuinication  When I asked about the insurance compamny paying any extra bills they did not know anything about this  Easiest thing was to pay myself and claim back   Reception had no clue and had huge difficulty doing anything beyond basic   I half expected that the reason Id been asked to call down originally was that they coulnt understand the phone call and wanted a second try  
N => Disappointed with the Metropolitan I booked this hotel via a travel agent and pre paid for a club room  I also pre paid for transport to the hotel from the airport and back  The first problem was that the transport never arrived at the airport and when I called the hotel they informed me that they had not received details of my flight arrival  I found out later that this was not true  I have been to India a few times before which was fortunate as if this had been my first visit as a solo female traveller it would have been quite daunting to make my way to the hotel at pm on my own  When I arrived I was allocated a room that I discovered the following day was not a club room  I got onto the travel agent who contacted the hotel and were informed that I had definitely been allocated a club room  Again not true  I was moved into a club room right next to the lift very noisy  Considering this was supposed to be  star luxury hotel it failed on several counts  I have stayed in several luxury  star hotels in India and this was well short of the k  The air conditioning was freezing even if turned up to C the television had a terrible picture and none of the channels matched with the channel guide the shower had a random spray and the hairdryer was broken  The staff were rude and unhelpful which was probably the worst thing  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted true  star luxury   stay at the ITC Sheraton the Taj or the Oberoi  There is also now a nice looking Crowne Plaza in Gurgaon which is handy for the business district in New Delhi and near the airport  This hotel should reduce its exorbitant prices and call itself a  star hotel which is what it is  
N => Lack of Communication We stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel New Delhi on two occasions in ember   The first was an overnight prior to flying to Kathmandu for a few days  I was part of a group of friends and altogether we had  rooms  My first nights room was fine and my only criticism was the incredibly long time it took to check in and check out  Others in our group asked to be moved that night due to a hotel wedding that was still going strong at PM but my room was quiet  Another reported problems with their room where the toilet flush button fell off the wall and where the quotclosetquot in the bathroom was clearly under construction with only a primer coat of paint and looked awful  When we returned some four days later I got assigned that room The walls were freshly painted and smelled  There was no art on the walls and the room was clearly in the process of a remodel but was being rented anyway  The closet was still incomplete and the toilet flush button fell off the wall the first time I pushed it  I attempted to use the room safe and found it on a bottom shelf of a cabinet freely movable i e  not hooked up to anything not anchored and with no directions  I assumed it was not working and when I reported all of these problems someone came to the room and showed me how to use the safe  but not how to keep someone from simply carrying it out of the room  Someone fixed the toilet flush button that should have been fixed when reported by the earlier occupant  No one would explain why the closet was incomplete or why the room was being rented while in the process of a remodel  On checkout the process was again very lengthy  I reported having consumed one item from the snack bar two days prior to departure and they had me wait while someone went to the room to inventory the bar something that should have been done the previous day  My biggest problem with the hotel was that despite their apparent desire to be helpful I had the impression that there was a cultural gap and they had no concept of why I was unhappy since they brushed aside each and every complaint as insignificant although they did eventually fix most problems  
N => great value we arrived in delhi after a very long flight and not knowing what to expect having left the madness of the entry roads  what we found was a lovely hotel with a great atmosphere helpful staffas all over india  nothing was any trouble  it had  erate restaurants and a erate bar very trendy  we tried all bar the japanese retaurant price and time were factors  we spent  nights here and was unable to find a complaint  
N => NOT  star hotel or service Arrived quite late around   pm  We were booked for  persons for for  nights in a delux room  Room had twin beds only so they said they would have to put in an extra bed  Looked at the room and agreed it was too small for an extra bed and argued such  They said all rooms were same size and that the hotel was full they had no where to move us too  In order to accommodate the extra bed they had to take out the table and  chairs meaning we had nowhere to sit but on the beds  No room for luggage either we each had  suitcases each which we had to put on the floor so no room to move around the room without climbing over cases  They said that most people do not come with so much luggage I dont consider  large case and  flight bag each much luggage  The manager dealing with us was rude and unaccommodating even walking off in mid sentance to speak to another customer leaving us frustrated  So as it was late we had to make do  No offer of anything complementary to make up for our dissapointment in the room or service even though we made our feelings quite clear As it was late we ate in the buffet restaurant food was lukewarm  They had the nerve to charge  rupees for service charge  This was a self service meal Buffet breakfast however was good Manager rude and staff unhelpfull  Would definitely not stay there again  
N => Good hotel for Delhi not the greatest location get a good rate Good hotel part of the Nikko hotel chain  Great restaurants Japanese and Indian  Excellent breakfast buffet   get it included in the rate New spa and gym up to date range of excercise machines Wireless internet access expensive around  USD for  hrs which run consecutively  Nice size pool very hot and not too many pool chairs  Good business meeting facilities Helpful friendly staffBeware if you prepay you cant get a refund or if you wish to leave early no refund on rest of stay Neighbourhood leaves something to be desired but walked there safely at midnight to Connht place although hotel said it might be dangerous  not recommended for sole walkers or women take a taxi or rickshaw Taxi can be arranged from airport  USD prepay to hotel room local taxis can be had for cheaper but it is nice to be met after your long international flight  
N => Good but no atmosphere This was a clean comfortable  star hotel but it really lacked atmosphere   we were the only people in the restaurant at lunchtime the pool side was empty and when we called into the bar in the evening it was brightly lit and the air conditioning was up way too high to make you want to relax and have a few drinks We were originally going to stay at The Imperial but it didnt get great reviews  However we had dinner at The Imperial that night instead of The Nikko and we wished wed stayed there instead   the bar was great   full of old world charm and the food in the Indian restaurant was really good the Thai restaurant was fully booked  The Imperial seemed to be far more busy in general and had a much better atmosphere  
N => Clean comfortable convenient hotel Stayed at the Nikko for two nights in    This stay was the last leg of our India trip and we wanted a little bit of luxury after having stayed in cheap hotels with family  Check in staff were extremely courteous and efficient  Rooms were of good size and the power shower was fantastic wed gotten used to the bucket and mug routine  Lots of TV channels for when we just wanted to veg out during our last day Location wise couldnt more be more convenient  Only a   minutes walk to Cannht Place  Being part of a Japanese chain there was a Japanese restaurant in the hotel which was pretty good  The main restaurant menu was a little unimaginative though  Also there were only two PCs in their Business Centre  I had to wait almost  hours to get a computer so that I could check in online  But on the whole it was a very pleasant stay indeed and would choose this hotel again the next time Im in Delhi  
N => Calm introduction to India We chose this hotel specifically because it is a Japanese business hotel and we got what we expected  Our room was a good size clean nothing overly spectacular but it was a gentle introduction to the madness of India we had only got ried  hours previously so didnt want anything too full on  We did find the service on reception at the travel desk a little slow but this is India so it wasnt really surprising although we found the staff in general to be friendly  Both restaurants were good and we thought the location was good   not quite in the thick of it all but pretty central  The Sikh temple down the road is brilliant a real oasis of calm in a mad city Other reviewers have said that the hotel itself and the restaurants are expensive but business hotels are expensive   ok so you dont get a true taste of India at the Hotel Nikko but it doesnt pretend to be either a cheap or authentic option  And as for overlooking slums which I think is a little extreme anyway   India is an extremely poor country so not really a surprise is it 
N => Very Pleasant Stay I was not sure what to expect when I booked this hotel because of the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor  The hotel photographs of the exterior on their website were not particularly impressive either I was pleased to find the hotel to be a good quality four to five star standard  The room was very comfortable and spotless with a very nice bathroom  The beds were a little firm for my taste  The food was first class  My wife did not like the dish she selected in Tuskar bar and the manager changed it immediately without any fuss Service in the restaurant and from the concierge was above average  Location is central with a short taxi ride to Connht Place  We enjoyed the Japanese singing group in Tuskar bar also The only downside was the view from the back of the hotel which is of a poor residential area  I would recommend this hotel  
N => Nice hotel but not a  star We stayed in different cities of India during  days and all the hotels where we stayed were  star hotels Our flight was delayed  hours and reached the hotel at  in the night since we had paid our room in advance we had absolutely no problem at all  Its a good  minutes drive from the airport to the hotel The Lobby was very clean and looked very nice and new  From the lobby you could see the pool the bar and the Sakura japanese restaurant The room was a bit small and the bed was more a japanese style extremely hard for my back  The bathroom was very small  My wife could only come in the bathroom while I was in the shower if not there was no space for both of us  On the whole the room was clean I have no doubt the Sakura restaurant is one of the best Japanese restaurants in India but it is also very very expensive Service at the hotel was very kind and helpful but be aware if you plan to rent a car to go around the city  We got the same car and service outside the hotel at a travel agency for  of the price Location of the hotel is excellent very near Connht Place  But its not walking distance You can take a Riksha from outside the hotel and will charge you  Rs On the whole its a nice hotel but not worth the value and of course not a  star  
N => Great start to India We chose the Nikko from a short list of  star hotels from thetripadvisor site and spent our first three days in Delhi at the Nikko before joining a group tour From the minute we were saluted by the regal doormen everything was perfect The room was furnished in traditional style and was very cleanand comfortablethe service was attentive and timely The meals were good with the waiters very friendlythe buffets were excellent especially the Saturday night seafood feast The foyer was stunning and the elephant backdrop in the main bar was beautiful In retrospect the Nikko was the best hotel we experienced during our  day stay in India which included luxury palaces and forts We were told that the in house restaurants particularily the Japanese were expensive but the main dining room was very good value Would definately recommend this hotel  
N => Lobby looks nice  but that is all We booked a few weeks in advance standard room at night US dollars This seems high but there are not too many high end names to chose from  Our room was horrible  smelled like cats lived in it carpet was worn  beds were really low to the ground and worn also  Lighting was really low probably because they dont want you to see how rundown it is in the rooms  We arrived late and were only there for the night so ided to buck up and not complain  be we had a really outdated room  but if that is the case that is not nice on the hotels part  the hotel was not full  Lobby was nice  but that is all I can say  
N => Overpriced but otherwise fine My wife and I spent a total of  nights here in ember  as part of our Golden Triangle tour  The hotel is modern clean and comfortable  Our room was very nice  However this hotel is overpriced  Two years ago we stayed at the Meridien which at that time we havent been there since was very nice with a much nicer location i e  not surrounded by slum conditions  The Japanese restaurant boasted rave reviews  The food was good but the atmosphere was so so made worse by the fact that smoking is allowed We enjoyed the buffet restaurant at breakfast  The selection was good and the food tasty  We had the supper buffet and it was excellent  We especially enjoyed the range of salads and the cheese plate  The desserts were excellent The business centre charges  rupees for  minutes of internet use about  Canadian  what The look on my face when the clerk told me that prompted some sympathy and she gave me  minutes free just to check my email  Find an internet cafe in Connht Place The staff at the travel desk were not helpful  We wanted to go to a shopping mall  After considerable discussion about what a shopping mall was remember this hotel caters to lots of western tourists so we couldnt be the first ones to request this the clerk recommended quota mallquot  minutes away and offered to arrange a car for us  The hotel car would cost  rupees for one hour  Yes thats two thousand five hundred rupees  We said we would get a taxi and he gave a little performance about how that might not be safe etc  We took the taxi and it cost only  rupees round trip  However when we arrived at the quotmallquot it was just a department store with  floors and nothing to recommend it  Not impressed The health clubfitness room was not available due to reations  I read a review from ust that indicated the same thing  This must be one heck of a reation theyre doing to last for  months There was one fellow from the housekeeping staff who was a real nuisance  He was very friendly but was obviously angling for a tip  Whenever he would see us returning to our room he would knock on the door quotto see if everything was alrightquot  This seemed like attentive service for the first few times but then it became annoying  He would offer us quotevening turndown servicequot at  in the afternoon  This is a clean comfortable hotel located close to Connht Circle  However it is overpriced for what it offers and the location is not attractive  I would definitely look elsewhere if I visit again  
N => Expensive and not worth the money The room and hotel were both nice clean and well equipped Staff were not particularly friendly After being told breakfast was being served until am I think staff refused to serve us the breakfast buffet at   We were just told this had finished Location is poor in my opinion  Its not within walking distance to anything  Taxis are cheap in Delhi but if youre going to get taxisrickshaws most of whom had not heard of this hotel then why pay for a central location which is what this hotel partly sells itself on Worst complain   our room at the back of the hotel overlooked the pool area which was used for functions on both nights of our weekend stay  This was very noisy and particularly irrating to us who with jet lag also had a am train to catch I would stay here again but only if someone else were paying the bill  This hotel is comfortable but has no features that justify the price tag  
N => Be Careful of Rip Offs We stayed at this Hotel twice on our Golden Triangle trip at the beginning and also at the end of the tour and after the first stay had wished we didnt have to stay again on the way back  Nearing the end of ober  we stayed here Even though nothing was majorly wrong with this hotel little things happened to make us not enjoy our stay  Our group of four people had two rooms one as a double the other as twin room the first stay was fine we had the standard or so we thought deposit of  rupees  We arrived late so headed to the bar for some drinks we ordered four drinks one of which was a coffee and they charged us over  rupees as we were tired and disorientated we did not say anything but looking back at this we know we were ripped off by the bar staff because we didnt receive a drinks menu to know the cost of each drink and also they never printed us a receipt they just verbally told us how much the drinks came to  We were at fault here not to question this but my advice to anyone is to make sure they print a receipt for you or at least ask for a drinks menu so you know how much each drink is  As when we stayed the second time i did get a drinks menu and receipt so seems that the staff were trying to rip us off previouslyOur second visit when we arrived we were charged  rupees this time for deposit which obviously is refunded back to you but we found it bizarre that we had only stayed  days previously and our deposit had been doubled  The twin room was ready but we were told this was the double room went all the way upstairs with the bell boy to then realise it was for the other people in our party we then had to wait over  mins for the double room to be ready which we were just told to wait in reception  The double room this time we were shown was absolutely freezing inside from the air con it was that cold you could see your breath we complained that when you leave your room the air con comes on automatically and is set at a certain temp which you cannot adjust unfortunately for that room it was on freezing We asked if we could just simply have the air con turned off when we were not in the room this seemed to cause a big problem and scratching of heads  Im positive we cant have been the only people ever to ask this but it took  times of asking then demanding to speak to manager before eventually they turned off our air con altogether so we had none but this was a damn sight better than not being able to sleep because your soo cold The carpets in both rooms were dirty  We did not try the japenese resturant but we did have breakfast on both occasions and we could not fault it If we were ever to return to Delhi I would not stay at this hotel again as too expensive for the service you receive and staff were not very friendly or courteous and also will try to make a quick buck out of you 
N => OK    but not worth the price  Spent a week at the Nikko Metropolitan Delhi in ober  While I would not be as harsh in my overall rating I definitely agree with the previous review  The hotel is nice enough but really nothing special  However where I felt the staff could have made up for the neutral surroundings they only added to my disappointment  I too found the staff to be at best aloof at worst rude  Upon checking in no one offered to tell me anything about the hotel or show me around  On my fifth day my room key card did not work  On going to the desk I was told that my room charges had exceeded the authorization they took when I checked in so my room was locked until they could take another authorization  On checking out no one even bothered to ask if I enjoyed my stay  My   a night room did indeed look out on what can best be described as a slum  The room itself was small ish the bathroom was quite nice the mattress was Japanese style which means HARD  The pool was nice but most of the time there was no attendant and I had to practically track someone down every time I wanted to order a drink or some food  Overall my experience was neutral  I know that there is a shortage of good hotels in Delhi and they are priced accordingly however I couldnt help but feel that I could have stayed someplace with warmer and more inviting atmosphere for the price  I dont think I would select to stay at the Nikko Metropolitan again  
N => Too expensive and unfriendly We were greeted in the nikko by very unfriendly arrogant staff  Our room looked out on a place that is used by the people as an quotopen airquot toilet  The rooms are too expensive for what they are  After our trip we wanted to come back to this hotel but had to reschedule our return flight and therefore had to cancel two of four nights we intended to stay  Following this the hotel doubled its room rates  So we annulled our booking and went to another place  
N => overpriced We have stayed in Delhi for two days in the Metropolitan nikko hotel after having spent several days in Agra  It was our first trip to India  I do not know how it compares to other hotels in Delhi but this hotel is way overpriced the rate was   a night for a very small room when compared to the sheraton in Agra the wood furniture was old and smelled as such carpet smelled of dust  The staff was very nice attentive and curteous and the lobby was a  star lobby  Did not try the restaurant but the breakfast was excellent too  Delhi and India in general is a tricky country to visit since the hotel is quite luxurious but when you come out of it it is quite a different story including the neighboourhood around the Metropolitan  The only area in Delhi that looked clean and without people sleeping on the street was the Diplomatic quarters  Did not see the hotels there though  A little far from the center also but taxis are cheap  
N => Great Stay The Nikko was our first hotel on our Golden Triangle trip  This hotel provided excellant service food and accomodation  
N => Great hotel in the heart of the city This hotel is clean comfortable and convenient to the airport  The staff was courteous and took time to make sure we had what we needed  I would stay there again if we returned to Delhi  
N => Nikko good value  
N => Not a Five Star Hotel  
N => Well kept place but far from action other then Bahai temple Despite the poor reviews this place is overall a very ent place to stay in Delhi  They cater more to business travelers but can also take good care of regular tourists  THe breakfast is nice and the rooms are well kept clean up to date and comfortable  The room service is tasty but not cheap  
N => PMP Training Recently i joined a course of PMP Training tpo be provided by Evayaa Gnosis  that was a  day training from AM to  PM  I had a bad experience of this hotel Services and food quality are poor  Even when you know in your hotel there is some training you shoulld not disturb the conference room  but there construction modification work was going on THAK   THAK    very much sound   Terribleeven after aksing to the manager too many times he did not stopped the work  while after  PM if calss is running upto  PM then they are worried and disturb the class like please vacate the place as your time is over So their behaviour was so rude  this is not the hotel to go for any stay or conferenec or training   please avoide 
N => UNPROFESSIONAL NOT RECOMMENDED We booked a few rooms for our clients in uary   We canceled one room  days prior to arrivals and requested for our money back  The General Manager through his mails confirmed that the refunds would be sent back in  days  We are still waiting for refunds and there seems no possibility that our Money is coming back  Absolutely Unprofessional Rude and Selfish Management 
N => Avoid    Upon arrival we discovered that the magnetic card machine was out of order and had to be taken to our rooms using the master card key  This was an inconvenience   The main passenger lift was mostly out of order during our stay  This was a major inconvenience   The stair well was ill lit   Front desk staff will guide you towards rent a cars at four times the fare rather than advising on where to find a taxi    Bathrooms are too small and the shower stalls are badly almost dangerously designed which allows water to stream out and make the whole bathroom wet and slippery   They dont check their emails very often so dont ask your office to forward any messages to them  They do check their fax machine but good luck sending a fax to India    Youll be cheated on the money exchange rates  Any  star hotels change counter will give you a rate over   better    The hotel has not replied to my written comments  
N => Overpriced and overhyped Though not quite as unbearably trendy as its siblings in Chennai and Bengaluru this establishment is not the right place for a serious working traveller to stay   certainly not at the price charged  Go a bit further from the centre of Delhi and you can get much better value  The room was the smallest quotfive starquot room Ive ever encountered and the bed far from being king size was an ordinary quot double  No fruit no biscuits no newspapers  Showering was an exciting experience as the water changed by itself from too hot to too cold with a  second cycle  Despite many people being in the dining room well before  a m  the breakfast start time there was no effort to speed things up and the two waiting staff were already overwhelmed by the time  oclock arrived  Just sliced bread available no other breads or pastries  I suggested when I checked out that they respond to the clear needs of their customers for an earlier breakfast but it was brushed aside  If you have to stay there get a room near the top of the building well away from the awful noise of music from the disco late into the night  I will not be returning  
N => Very average experience  highly priced   low value   The car for airport transfer was dirty and very ordinary  The price charged for airport trasfer was around Rs  incl tax one way  The drivers mobile kept ringing all the way from airport to hotel    I was the only person checking in  yet thefront desk staff kept insisting I sit down   whe you have a long flight you dont want to sit down  you just want to go ahead to your room  low sensitivity    The corridors of the hotel rooms were in very poor state   rd Floor   had chipped off tops  lots of finger ks etc  The room as such was somewhat of a saving grace  though small yet well appointed   housekeeping in room was good  The bar is overhyped and over priced  The Indian food was great   ordered room ervice and was delicious  Breakfast was a mess next morning   toast service is vertually not there and there are large queues for toast  Overall very average   for the price paid   I will look another hotel next time 
N => only  star We where dissappointed  The design is excellent but the hotel is already  years old The carpets in rooms and corridors are old and overused  Windows where not clean only one elevator working  In the restaurant you feel like in a students canteen not in a   hotel  Many groups  And at the end they tried to charge one night twice  Rather       Receptionstaff to young and not experienced  
N => Terrible Very Rude Staff Poor Cleanliness Dont Waste Your Money We were travelling with kids and an older parent  Throughout our stay we had several bad experiences which you wouldnt expect to find with this kind of hotel  You do not get the service expected for the kind of money you pay   First there were flies on food at the buffet area every day flying over all open food items  The staff at the buffet area was not very attentive   We got human hair in food three times during our stay   The water from the flush was black which caused concern of falling sick if the same water came from the shower and if we swallowed it   The rooms were unclean too  The rug was dirty and stained   The phone would start ringing at early hours  am and disturbed our sleep this happened twice among the  nights we were there  It turned out the phone quipment was faulty  This actually ruined our sight seeing visit next day    My father found a scorpion like insect in his room he had to call staff member to fumigate the room   Above all when we requested that our parent and kids sit in the receptionlounge area for an hour and half after we had checked out while we got some work done  We were refused outright and they were very rude  We could have ordered a drink or food and just left them there but we were courteous in asking them first yet we were not treated in kind  Considering their poor hospitality we wondered if they would have just kicked them out  We reported all of above issues to management however no courtesy was shown and no actions were taken In the past we have been to many five start resorts like Taj ITC Moghul etc  At any ent hotel if there was any inconvenience the senior management would take care of it in a courteous way  We would never visit any Park hotel in the future lttextareagt 
N => Not a  star hotel   be a  star Bar outside played insanely loud music until  am which could be heard clearly throughout the room  Kept us awake all night  Thin walls   could hear people talking and even blowing their nose  Poor service   both breakfast and dinner  Breakfast selection   cold and lousy  Elevators broken and rooms really small  Would not stay there again Awful experience  
N => Ok I cant say too much good about this place but not too much bad either  Our room was small but fine  The loud streets of Delhi are right out our window and pigeons were sitting on the ledge the whole time  That would be fine except the feathers actually were under the window and behind our bed  Not too sanitary if you ask me  Dogs barked all night on the street you are in the middle of the city you know The restaurant was good the Fire restaurant was excellent  Room service was really good one night as I had a falafel and hummous wrap yummy Its got a cool feel to it but thats about it  The breakfast was nothing special and the staff were blah    Sorry I dont have much better to say  
N => Not worth the money Dowdy room and bathroom Very expensive restaurant Pathetic staff uniforms  
N => mal functioning and poor service upgrade to club level without all privileges  We had to pay for our Sula wine served in champagne flutes  No snacks room somehow quotcheaplyquot furnished despite on club level  rain shower very inefficiently working especially getting rid of shampoo and conditioner took ages  The water tempertaure could not be ajusted remaining only hand warm  The aircon could not be adhusted either Hot or FREEZING  The hair blower had powercuts and was of no use at all The packed breakfast incl  in the rate and a necessity due to early check out consisted or one sandwhich and an appleThe hotel as a whole impressed through unfriendliness lack of service and malfunctioning features in the room I particularly disliked the quotdesignquot features in the room which were not comfortable at all  tiny tables attached to the couch instead of a ent table which made room service dinner unpleasant The hotel seemed somehow CHEAP from A to Z  
N => ananda spa himalayas stop over it is meant to be a  star holiday but is more like   star more  star    rooms are clean and pretty basic   the tea making faicilities are in big round brown box where the kettle does not work properly   i expect it was designed by someone who is not very practical    i think it is hidious    reception very helpful and courteous but the same cannot be said about the after services elsewhere     restaurant a real disappointment   platescutlery not clean and the presentation of the buffetlunchdinner not appetizing nor appealling    watch out for the rowdy music though i think this hotel should be ked out for teenagers and club goers who do not worry about cleaniless or other detail       
N => OK OK OK Hotel nicely done but food quality not good Pub is waste of time 
N => Excellent Location Very clean hotel in an excellent location  Plenty of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel  Hotels own restaurants are very good aswell  Service was what you would expect from a  star deluxe  Staff very pleasant amp courteous  There is a lot going on around the hotel as it is centrally located Be wary of locals approaching you amp trying to be friendly i e quot I dont want anything Im just a student amp want to practice my englishquot  They are just trying to con you into going to stores that pay them to get customers in Airport is no more than  minutes away so hotel is very central  
N => Lovely place to recover from Delhi Belly I have been surprised by the other comments because I found this hotel clean quiet and extremely comfortable   the best bed in India  As I had the room to myself I was not fazed by the bathroom  The service I experienced was superb   there was always someone on hand to help me and boy did I need itThe pool was lovely but unfortunately a little shady  I also had a wonderful facial  My only negative points are the cost of the internet which was certainly excessive and the cost of a bottle of water which I had thought was complimentary while sending emails  
N => Noisy Im usually pretty forgiving when it comes to the service I receive at a hotel but had to share this terrible experience from my recent stay at The Park My husband and I needed to be up by  am the morning after we checked into the hotel so we called it an early night and headed to our room at  pm  We could hear musicbeats inside the room so I called the front desk and inquired about the noise  They said it was coming from their club and wouldnt reach above the rd floor  They asked us if wed like to move to a room on a higher floor  We thought was nice and agreed to change rooms  When we got to our room on the higher floor we found we were facing the pool area where a party was going on  Now not only could we hear beats but the actual words to the techno songs   clearly  No pillow over my head would make them go away  So I called the front desk again and again and again  In all I probably called half a dozen times  The front desk would say the party would be ending soon the party would end at  the party was just ending the party would end at  etc  I was always polite when I spoke with them letting them know I didnt think it was their fault and asking them if they could quotplease just turn it downquot or quotdid  they  be have ear plugs I could tryquot  All I got was that there was nothing else they could do and that the party would end in some time  By the last couple calls the front desk staff sounded annoyed at having to speak with me and I was on the verge of loosing my quotnice quot So my husband called the front desk at  in the morning and asked them again to please do SOMETHING about the noise  They said a manager was taking care of it  At  the music FINALLY stopped  My husband and I got less than four hours sleep No one asked how our stay was when we checked out  I remember because I was ready to let them know how disappointed I was  I did leave a comment card though Even by Indian standards the hotel was not very clean  There were MANY stains on furniturerugs and the rooms were dusty  It felt more like a hostel than a hotel The door to the bathroom is about  feet from the bed  Its a frosted glass sliding door that leaves a  inch gap between it and the bathroom wall so there is not complete privacy  The lighting was also a bit difficult to figure out  Ive never written an online complaint about a hotel stay before but felt compelled to do so after this experience  I would never stay at The Park again  
N => Never go on a Friday We spent  arate nights at this hotel at the start and finish of our  week tour in India  The first night wasnt too problematic although the hotels trendy bathroom was totally impractical   a washbasin that was too high to use comfortably hardly anywhere to put stuff and opaque glass walls and sliding door which ensured no privacy at all The last night however was something else I dont know if Friday is the only disco night but be warned even if you are on the rth floor as we were you will not sleep at all  Not only was the music at full blast but there were also people talking and smoking in the corridor outside our room for most of the night  At   a m  I complained to the duty manager who was kindness itself and did tell the people to shut up The disco ended at  a m  so we got a couple of hours sleep then  
N => Barely okay rooms and lobby We spent  nights here upon arrival in New Delhi as travel service had chosen hotel for us  We had no problems with check in or check out fast and accurrate but a representative of the travel company got us registered and we were upgraded to the club floor  The area rug in the room needed to be cleaned the whole place felt slightly dirty  But bed and towels were clean  The club floor offered nothing different internet access was chargeable and so was coffee  We ate breakfast here and it was fine for a buffet which catered to all different nationalities  But service was slow and got fast only after we paid the bill as the waiters were looking for a tip even if they were not our waiter they raced over to collect it  The maid service was very uneven vrying from outstanding to poor   no replacement of bath towels without asking no additional coffee  The or is an attempt to be contemporary and quothipquot but ends up garish and tacky  Lots of small tour groups stay here especially French  Outside of the hotel gates there are so many hawkers that the first time we had to return as they would not even allow us to walk they blocked our path  The location of being central made no difference to us as we were picked up at the hotel and driven to the sightsquot  
N => Comfortable but not wow Obviously taking its inspiration from the W hotels right down to leaving apples and oranges in the room  Its not luxury but its a good base to explore Delhi from  The rooms are comfortable and generally clean but not spectacular  If youre a sensitive sleeper the noise from the nightclub  keep you awake  
N => Enjoyed the Park very comfortable Our agent moved us here at the last minute so I did not have a chance to check it out on Trip Adviser ahead of time  I was very pleased  Security at the front door was in full force  The staff was ultra courteous the room was small but spotless and the bed comfortable  Nice art on the walls and some sculpture too  Fresh fruit was waiting for us  Service requests were fulfilled promptly  The restaurant had a wonderful breakfast buffet with many made to order items  There was variety from standard Indian fare to Chinese and western style selections  This was our first trip to Delhi so I was a little anxious about the neighborhood but soon learned it was pretty normal for Delhi  We spotted several monkeys frolicking on the roof of a building behind the hotel that looked like a school  After walking around for a while and being bombarded with the Delhi stimuli it was a relief to return to the peaceful hotel  The exercise room was well equipped  It was too cold to use the pool but they were cleaning it anyway  Definitely would stay there again  
N => Slick property great location This hotel was under reation then but parts of it were operational  Conran and partners have done a fabulous job in terms of revamping this property  As you enter you are greeted by blue and pink interiors which they all boutique On the lobby level there is the MIST coffee shop which served wood fired pizzas  Also they have India restaurant called Fire which serves great food Room we got was on th floor  Size of the room was small but it was comfortable  or was good but housekeeping was not upto the k  If you are two people then the glass bathroom is not very nice Overall location is great and service above average  Not outstanding but ent enough experience  
N => Poor Management     money stolen from room by staff The most significant point in this review is that we feel we were robbed by the hotel staff     literally robbed  When we went to breakfast the last morning we left things in our room out of the safe shame on us   we ALWAYS use the safe because we were only going to be gone  minutes and we were re charging our DVD and iPod  Luckily for us the person who cleaned our room only got into the purse and stole   When we left our room with the quotDo Not Disturbquot sign on the door from the previous evening   no one had knocked all night or morning and the T V  on so staff or anyone else would not come in or knock  Unfortunately our room was very close to the elevator and the person who cleans our room was right there as we left the only person on that floor who saw us  He asked us if we had laundry to pick up  When we said no he asked when we were checking out  We told him we were checking out that afternoon  Upon coming back from b fast we noticed that money was missing  I notified the front desk about our missing money and asked if their system could track entries into our room  When we came back to the hotel early afternoon they notified us that the room was entered once and it was by the person who cleans our room  He said he was checking for laundry  because our clean room sign was on the door it was not  He then changed his story they said it was a language thing and said he was in there to clean the room      but NOTHING had been done  If something had been done it would then have been obvious to us that HE had been in our room  The management assured us that they would investigate and take care of this  Not a single thing was done and never     not once     did they even call our room or leave a message as to what was transpiring  I believe this is not an isolated incident and it supports some of the other complaints in T A  about management here We were here on a tour with Gate One  Pros Food was good  location not bad rooms were clean and modern Cons Obviously our stolen money and managements poornon existent follow up the elevators are VERY slow one being out of service the pool was unusable due to construction 
N => Good Location but poor or We have just returned after staying at this hotel for  nights   We found the location to be excellent and staffs were helpful  Breakfast was also good Beside the above there is nothing good to say about the hotel  Rooms are too small and there is no space for your suitcases  When we checked in our rooms were not particularly clean and I dont think the sheets had been changed  The Towels had stains and the bath Robes looked dirty as well  We immediately complained and they changed our bed linen and towels  We also complained about the size of the room and if we can be moved to another rooms as we had  rooms with long stay  Our request was not honoured and we were advised that only rooms available are in their Residence category with high rates  It is a run down hotel with dirty carpets in the corridor  Food in the Restaurant is too expensive  One day we just had  portions of toasted sandwiches and  portion of French Fries which costed us around     Our room keys never worked and we had to swipe the card     times   We asked the the reception to reprogramme it and it still did not work  Housekeeping needs to improve as most days they forgot to replace towels At the Mist restaurant it appeared that residence guest do not have priority as we were refused a table in the non smoking area as they were all booked   Staff at the front desk were aware of our dissatisfaction but nothing was done In my view this is  star hotel and no where close to  star in terms of hotel d cor room size and cleanliness   In the past I have stayed at Grand Intercontinental which a true  star Hotel  I would not return back to this hotel in future and will not recommend to any friends 
N => Convenient We stayed at the Hotel in il   my husband was on business and I was on holiday  The Hotel is tired and needs a refit we were both a bit disappointed when we arrived as it is classed as a five star Hotel and clearly it isnt   Our room wasnt particularly clean and I dont think the sheets had been changed  The view from our room was just an awful derelict site  Our room keys never worked and I had to go back down to reception several times a day to get them reprogrammed  The food was good in the restaurant and the bar service attentive but expensive The pool area was okay but there was a real problem with flies which made it unpleasant to sit out and the pool bar had a problem with cooling so all the drinks were warm  I had a spa treatment which was excellent  The staff were very friendly but desperate for tips so make sure to take a good supply of lower denomination notes  
N => Dirty poor service but pretty central This hotel is according to many locals The posh and most Fashionable hotel of New Delhi so we ided to give it a try  We booked via their website and asked for a non smoking room we got given a smoking room  We managed after an hour of negotiation to get the room we asked for in the first place the receptionist said she was doing us a favor The room was tiny but manageable for a couple  The biggest turn off was how dusty and generally disgusting the room was  Not to mention the sheets that had blood stains on them The frosted glass arating the bathroom from the main bedroom was covered with unidentified traces   The hotel is in general bad condition  The restaurant s white walls are covered with food stains    Needless to say we only stayed one night and quickly checked out  I would have believed in Murphy s Law if we have not met at breakfast another couple that was as disappointed as we were To add on to our list of negative experience our bill was not correct and we had to argue it out with the receptionist and we were not the only ones doing so  it seemed that most of the clients checking out as we did had something to complain about to the manager My husband and I have been many times in India and we have gotten a pretty good idea of what to expect for which price range but this is by far the biggest disappointment  For the same price you might as well stay at the Claridge even if it is a bit out of town it is worth the min longer cab ride to the city center  
N => A  star trying to pass for a  star I should have known better to stay at the international hotels but my travel agent told me that this is one of Indias finest  It is not  The hotel lobby has a stench that is not pleasing and there were quite a few about  Indian men just sitting in the couches in the lobby which gave me the creeps  I did not try the food instead I dined at the Shangri La which was superb but I can say that the spa at The Park is great  The price was pretty good but the therapists were superb The room was okay it was modern very boutiquey style a little small  Besides the room and the spagym I would not have stayed here esp  since their prices are comparable to either the Le Meridian Shangrila or Hotel Nikko  
N => Tacky and sub standard   Not good enough to be a   IT WAS TERRIBLE I was at the hotel in il  for one night  Me and my mom were actually staying at the Imperial for  nights however on the rd day Im perial was overbooked and so they transfered us to the Park for one night At the proch of the hotel you have staff dressed in shabby uniforms v neck velvet type tops and trousers once inside the unorganised front desk took ages to have a room for us and made us wait around even though we had a reservation  The lobby is small   is orated to give a modern and contemparary feel but fails and ends up looking cheapTo the rooms   its COMPACT   id call it a capsule room  The bathroom was tiny reminded me of the little toilets you have in an airplane  The bathroom was actually a part of the room   frosted glass walls was only what areted the two and there was no lock on the bathroom sliding door  IMPO   At one point someone was knocking on our door   we were a few seconds late in answering and this staff member thought he could just use his card to get access to our room  We complained about this   wanted to know who this staff member was and why was trying to get into our room   nothing helpful could be said by the manager  Being two women in the room I found this very disturbing knowing that anyone could just try barging through the room  We did not feel safe at night Few PROS DVD player in the room with free DVDs to watch available from the library in the hotel  Breakfast was good even though we were hassled by a staff member on where to sit in the breakfast hall  In the end I was relieved to be out of their and back into the Imperial which felt like a different worldAnd the fact that the Park cost Rs  and is rubbish compared to Rs  at the imperial its really worth spending that little bit extra  
N => Really comfortable stay I feel many of the reviews here are unfairly harsh on this hotel  Whether thats down to inflated expectations of Delhi I dont know but we found this hotel to be clean very comfortable and offered good service  OK so its not St  tins Lane hotel in London but you cant expect that because they dont charge the same kind of prices  All in all about the only mid range place that we could manage to get availability in and Im happy that we landed upon it Its conveniently located for Connht Place with a cab and auto rickshaw rank right outside the entrance which is superb for visiting Old Delhi the rest of the city and of course onward travel Great points to note   we got upgraded to the top floor rooms which have a private bar and dining area with excellent happy hour from     at time of writing  The pool area was great and the fitness room and spa well equipped with the latest machines  Breakfast also included in that top floor area which was a real bonus Points to watch out for   we always check the bill like a pair of hawks wherever we go and noticed they had squeezed a couple of minibar items that we didnt have  Despite upgrading us they had added more to the normal luxury tax that you have to pay  Our point was that in effect we hadnt chosen to be upgraded so thought it was unfair that they should make us pay for that bit of the tax  They removed everything we questioned with little fuss  Secondly on our experience and that of other guests we spoke to there is minimal chance that you will get to check in before noon if you arrive on an early morning flight so either book yourself a rest room at the airport and arrive later or be happy to leave your cases with the porter and do some exploring until your room is ready  The hotel was happy to check us in and charge us a reduced rate for the previous evening but considering that we had only six hours to wait we passed on the offer Finally although they looked good we passed on the restaurants in the hotel and ate dinner at the Banana Leaf   basic but excellent veg South Indian restaurant in Connht Place and stuffed our faces for under  rupees 
N => Acceptable quality very expensive The Park was the official hotel for a conference I attended  For some reason I expected to get great value for money in India and indeed outside the hotels you do  But the Park is very over priced and I would not pay their rack rate if returning to Delhi A friendly and polite driver met me from my flight and weaved through the amazing traffic system to the Park took about  minutesCheck in was polite but very slowRoom was OK but not special given the price  The rooms pictured on the Internet seem better than the one I was allocated The electronic door lock was annoyingly temperamental Generally staff were very helpful The food was the best feature of this hotel The bar was pricey by local standards At checkout an Indian guy pushed in front of me but despite my protests the receptionist served him first Although I was happy to tip during my visit the staff at the Park were certainly active in demanding their gratuities given the high cost of staying there I found that unacceptable  
N => ginal Not worth the Money This hotel was obviously very hip and clubby  Lots of youngparty people in the restaurant and in the club  It seemed tobe a popular spot for European tourists as well  The room wasclean and the accomodations were ok  I expected more for the ridiculous prices they charge  Due to a family illness wecould only stay one night although we had booked for   Whenwe arrived there was a man having a problem with settling something and he was talking to the manager  I thought he washaving a problem but later realized of the  times I was in the lobby each time a guest had a problem with the hotel staff  I found the service in the restaurant ok by Indian standards the food was good  Breakfast was the best part of the stay  Themost gracious employees were the bell hops  We had difficulty settling our bill early while checking out  It took a very long timeabout  hour to finally ide we were not going to get anywhere with this hotel staff manager finally and so we gave up  If you have to this hotel is in a good location  Just expect to pay way too much not get any value for your money and possibly have trouble getting a refund if you plans have to change  
N => Wierd and not designer Its not the same to design your hotel in an inane way and put objects which have no relevance to hospitality in your environment and claim to be a quotdesignerquot hotel   hello its not funky just wierd 
N => Dissapointing The hotel was booked some time before our arrival at   after a long flight from London  The staff appeared to be more concerned with paperwork rather than helping us to our room The hotel though was clean and had all the amenities you would expect from a designer hotel  You also got the feeling that Delhis fashionistas visited this place for drinks and so on Sadly on our second night we discovered that the hotel has a night club on the ground floor which would be fine had we not been jet lagged  After long and heated discussions with reception we were moved from the second to the eighth floor only to be woken up by an quotafter partyquot next door It transpired that the hotel had no staff to deal with this and did not care enough to send people to sort out the matter We left feeling quite disappointed and know that if we were to visit Delhi again we would not stay at The Park  
N => Badly Managed  Design Hotel  My business partner amp I were in Delhi on a  day business trip and wanted somewhere that was central amp offered us all the details and luxury of a quotDesign Hotelquot  Doing business in Delhi is tough with long days that can sometimes be rewarding but other days which just seem so frustrating that you want to jump on the next plane out of there As with most Hotels in India it seems that the housekeeping is done by men  As a woman traveler we have noticed that there always seems to be an invasion of privacy at some point of your stay and at The Park there was a real feeling of staff over staying their welcome in your room very pushy for tips and filling in comment cards  Security staff would take your bags to your room instead of the porters and then promptly ask for a tip Room service trays were not taken away and stayed outside our room for  days  Carpets in the rooms amp corridors where very dirty  Elevators had a mind of there own and you would spend  mins trying to get back to your roomThere seemed to be a real lack of visable management amp when a rather large problem did occur it was handled very badly which left such a bad feeling that I would never want to return  Receptionist had a very unwelcoming approach and were not very efficient with follow up on details which again I think comes back to Management The food was however very good  We had the buffet breakfast and room service which we found some of the best food in Delhi  Believe you me we have now tried a lot of the Hotels in Delhi and are still searching for the right one that we can feel comfortable to return to on our business trips to India  
N => Way overpriced Hotel is waaaaaay overpriced for what you get  The Park Hotel was a minor step up from a hostel  I will say that I think this is the case with many of the supposedly nice hotels in Delhi  There are just very few if any mid range hotels  I paid approx  USD for a room that in the US would have cost less than  USD  For what I had come to expect in Asia this place should have cost less than  USD orations are simple and pretty and the hotel looks clean and fresh but the room is tiny and the water quality is bad Water did not seem clean and after showering I always had a satly residue film on my entire body  Towels were dingy and floor was not sparkling clean Again this was not a bad place but for what I paid I wish I had just gone to the Taj  The hotel seems to be in a safe area  I am a female and I was traveling alone  There are a lot ot men that loiter around the hotel just not on the property per se  There was a bankATM next to the hotel I was able to go there with minor harassment  I was also able to walk over to the mini shopping center again with some harassment but not too much  Breakfast buffet was nice and flat screen tv had a nice picture but too few channels  Hotel charges ridiculous fees to use their internet  At these prices at least  free hour should be available to all hotel guests  
N => Beware   hotel tax SCAM At checkout   all guests find out that there has been a    luxury tax applied to their bill which is standard in India  The SCAM is that The Park applies the    tax to the RACK RATE not the room rate that we were charged  Our nightly rate was  but the luxury tax applied was based on a  room rate  For two nights this was more than   This tax situation is never mentioned when you book your room or when you check in you find out when you check out  We also stayed at The Imperial Hotel in Delhi   and they are doing the same SCAM to their customers but in their case we were charged    of a  rack rate over  for two nites when our room rate was   This proves that the RACK RATES are randomly assigned and have no basis in reality  The hotel staffs say that everyone who checks out has the same bad reaction  Who wouldnt This is unacceptable from any hotel especially on this level We will be reporting this unacceptable situatiuon to New York Times Conde Nast Traveler and Travel amp Leisure magazines  
N => Funky We began and ended our trip in India at The Park  So we stayed in two arate rooms  Both rooms had a funky s feel to them  There was fresh fruit provided in the rooms   we ate the oranges     dry and inedible  But since it was an unexpected bonus I wasnt really disappointed  The bathroom quotwallsquot were frosted glass  So modest people might be somewhat uncomfortable quotdoing their business quot Also the light from the bathroom can be seen through the walls disturbing other sleepers The lobby is small and was frequently crowded with tour groups The breakfast buffet was included with our room   it was large and designed to appealed to international tastes The lobby bathrooms as with many in India have attendants that expect baksheesh Dinner was very good  But smoking in restaurants is still the norm in India   and non smoking areas were not available  With closely spaced tables smoking was disruptive to our evening meal Drinks were also unchanged since the s  Manhattans and Rob Roys are available  Requests for more recent concions such as Cosmopolitans or Mojitos are greeted with blank faces  But the staff also expressed a desire to try new things and was more than willing to make something that they never had before  
N => Experience in Delhi Park   Awesome Soma Would like to thank your team for their exceptional support that we received at DelhiParkWe had a terrible  horrifying experience at DelhiAirportpost we missed our flight to Bangaloredue to late arrival of flight from Jaipur  Will explain the details when we meet next time  We were stranded at DelhiAirportat about pm without any flights being available or any hotel booking  I tried reaching you but your cell was not reachable  The only thing that came to my mind was HotelPark although I dint have the Delhicoordinates  I called Park Kolkata and spoke to Rajeev The Lobby Manager     on duty and explained the situation we were in  He immediately contacted your Delhi Office and in  mins I got a call from Ritesh Lobby Manager     on duty  He immediately heard me out and confirmed a room for two of us and also helped us with the transportation bit Post the kind of terrifying experience we two went thru and the way The Park Team helped us out was very reassuring I thought I should keep you informed about such a customer focused team they just made our day after all that we went thru  Rajeev and Ritesh Thanks a ton for your support  You just made it for us 
N => Good base for a few days Plus good location st staff more realistic price than the  s if booked via the usual web agenciesTrendy interiors flat screen TV LED bulbs  Nice pool area k Cons Glass walled bathrooms not completely private  Rooms not particularly spacious  
N => Okay but Overpriced We spent  nights here in two arate segments and it is a pleasant  star place even though it prices itself as something much better  The odd numbered rooms on the side facing the streetwere much better designed than the others because the bathroom door does not open drectly onto the WC  Breakfast was okay if you were willing to wait ages to get a cup of tea or coffee self help was discouraged but was often the only option available if you had less than an hour free 
N => A mediocre hotel with terrible staff and service We booked for two nights on the hotel website  However due to unforseen delays in India we had to shorten our stay to one night  When we called the hotel to change our reservation the manager on duty was arrogant and flatly told us that we could not change our reservation and we would have to pay for both nights  Inspite of being charged for two nights when we checked in a day later than our scheduled reservation at pm our room was not ready and we had to go for lunch to wait for our room  When we did finally made it to our room a massive reation of the corner floor was underway  The grinding noise and hammering was simply unbearable  When we called the duty manager to complain she wanted us to understand that as the hotel was full they had no choice but to give us the room next to the ongoing internal reation  She appeared miffed that we could not appreciate her dilemma and assured us that the work would stop by pm and only start again the next morning at am  We had to call again to complain that the work was still going on past pm  The rooms albeit stylish and tastefully furnished with designer furniture and pastel color bathroom were very small and designed with little regard for space maximisation  The food in the restaurant was mediocre for the prices  The staff at reception was disoriented and unfriendly  For all our trouble no one cared and inquired as to how our had been  I would not stay at this place again  
N => A very disappointing stay It was a very very terrible stay for me and my colleagues  There was absolutely nobody at the reception counter to guide us  We have been given wrong rooms  The staff was not at all friendly and some of them really misbehaved with us  Being a female I was often taken for granted and even few staff tried to sexually abuse me  Over all avery bad experience  I will never return to this hotel anymore nor would recommend anybody to stay at The Park New Delhi  
N => Bad Service Bad Food Just Avoid It I has just been staying at the Oberoi New Delhi and my family and I went to Mumbai and then back to New Delhi and styaed at the park  I walked in and though wow this is a interisting hotel concept design inscents burning lovely  But then i went to our bedroom it was tidgey plus the porters took about hrs mins to get our luggage to our rooms the food is rubbish the service is extremly poor the lifts dont work and the pool isnt even vaguely warm  Overall a very poor hotel which shoudlt claim itself five star  
N => A little diasppointing On first impressions I was a little disppointed since the lobby looked more like a glorified  star hotel rather than a  star hotel  However the room and bathroom were clean On returning to the Park after an overnight stay in Agra we had to change rooms twice on checking in  This was not due to any fault on our part  The reason for this was that despite specifically requesting a non smoking room both at the time of booking and at check in we were given a smoking room  Although the room was changed we had to change the second time due to another problem with the room Unfortunately for us this delayed us and we missed our engagement for the evening which we missed out completely since we were leaving Delhi the next morning  This was a little stressful for me I have stayed in quite a few  star hotels around the world and I appreciate that mistakes do get made  However I was a little taken aback that there was no gesture made by management to acknowledge their mistake for example at least with a complementary basket of fruit While the staff at the Park are very pleasant and helpful I dont think I will be rushing back to the Park on my next visit to Delhi  
N => Plenty of promise but poor service and staff attitude disappoints    This hotel really has so much promise   but Im afraid Im unable to write a positive review due to the poor attitude of the staff and resulting low levels of service  From the moment we checked in the service was very average   rather than greeting customers with a smile it seemed to me that everything was a bit of an effort for them  The staff at reception did not genuinely want to help   for example when I called up with a question about their Internet service they were quite unhelpful   instead of putting me through to someone who could help they seemed more keen to get me off the phone Unfortunately its not only the reception staff who need some urgent training   the service at breakfast was equally as poor  The hotel appears to employ so many staff however most of them were just milling about talking to each other rather than serving the guests  On some days we had to wait for a table as whilst the table was free it had not yet been cleared and re set  For the rates charged by this hotel the breakfast quality was extremely poor with not enough variety in the menu each day  Many items ran out regularly and were not refilled quickly enough The room we stayed in had been recently refurbished and whilst it was generally comfortable Im not a big fan of the nouveau styling  The sliding bathroom door doesnt have a lock and whilst the bathroom looks nice the strange shaped washbasin isnt particularly convenient to use  The LCD TV in the room is a nice touch but signal quality wasnt up to scratch and quite grainy on most channels  Also the hotel wont provide an extra bed in the room   only a mattress  We managed to convince housekeeping to provide two mattresses stacked one on top of the other however its still not particularly comfortable So my overall opinion of this hotel is poor given the fairly high room rate  They really need to make some urgent improvements in the area of customer service 
N => Comfy beds  
N => Surreal Lobby but soft beds  
N => Needs better customer service  
N => Good No Nonsense Hotel  
N => Mediocre Hotel not a resort GOOD POINTSBeautiful lobby nice looking amp clean room nice poolBAD POINTSOften noisy when theres a wedding or other outdoor event   be difficult if you need to sleep Breakfast selection is spare Unfortunately foreigners can expect to get the third degree at checkin  Supposedly the  questions are due to FRO office security requirements  Theyre just doing their job but its not a friendly Hotel location is considered the outskirts of Delhi so some tour guides want to charge extra for the distance  
N => Avoid at all costs First impressions were not goodthe hotel is about  minutes drive from the airport and a long way from the centre of Delhi If you arent used to India beware it is in a very poor area on a dusty smelly and very crowded main road  We stayed here for  days and our problems started from the moment we walked through the door I was asked to sign a credit card slip for over  rupeover  despite the fact I had already paid by credit card to the hotels booking agency the month before Trying to explain this to the reception staff who spoke poor English proved difficult and despite the fact that I had seen the debit on my credit card before I left for India they refused to believe I had already paid We went for a meal in the restaurant while they sorted it out and I was served the wrong meal and told my chicken on a skewer would be with with me in no time at all They kept their word but the only problem was that the chicken was raw inside and inedible We returned to reception and although nothing had been resolved with the booking agency we were shown to our room which was very small compared to previous rooms we had stayed in on visits to India The toilet is also connected to the bedroom by a louvre window which is not very hygienic and offers very little privacy The window does not open and felt very claustrophobic Being jet lagged we ided to have an early night and were woken up at nine thirty by what sounded like a loudspeaker at full volume in the bedroom A wedding party had started and it continued until gone  oclock in the morning The guests continued milling around the hallway and talking loudly until well gone  Oclock The cleaning staff start work at around  Oclock in the morning and make no effort to be quiet We recieved a call from reception at  Oclock asking us if we were going to breakfast We staggered bleary eyed into the restaurant and had  fruit juicesa coffee and two slices of toast As we left we were chased by the waiter who told us we needed to sign for breakfast I aked him why as breakfast was included in the price he said I was mistaken and presented me with a bill for  rupees which is over  The booking agent had informed us that breakfast was included in the price and we went to reception who refused to acknowledge this despite the fact that I showed them the booking confirmation clearly stating that breakfast was included We wasted a good hour at reception trying to sort out breakfast and the hotel refused to budge Normally in India this would not be a problembreakfast for two is no more than   at mostbut as there was no where to get breakfast locally this pesented a major problem especially at   a time We were told that the only day we were entitled to breakfast was on our last day which was the first of ober because we had paid   for that night As we had to leave at  am to get to the airport this wasnt much help We felt like nd class citizens during our stay at the hotel and felt like they believed we were rich westerners trying to fiddle them The sheets were only changed every other day and that was after we complained to reception and on one occassion were blood stained We never recieved our free cookies or water either I suffered from a bad case of Delhi belly towards the end of the holiday We had returned at midnight from a trip to the taj and after  hours on the road we both just wanted to have a shower and go to bed I turned the shower on and nothing happened I phoned reception and was informed the main water pump was broken but would be fixed within the next twenty minutes An hour later still no watertwo hours later it still wasnt fixed When you are suffering from a really bad case of gastro believe me the last thing you need is a hotel with no water Not one of the toilets in the hotel would flush There were wedding parties seven of the  nights we were there and getting a good nights sleep was impossible The hotel puts its commercial customers first and as I mentiond earlier we were made to feel like nd class citizens from the moment we first walked through the door We finally resolved the problem of the credit card payment and it transpired the had overcharged me by about   and ended giving me back money Ive stayed in  star hotels where the service was beter than here and unless its a last resort dont stay at this hotel especially as its very expensive by Indian standards at   a night  
N => Take note   not all it seems We have just returned from a holiday in India which included two stays in this hotel at the beginning and end of our trip The hotel is set in beautiful grounds with large rooms BUT it is not really a tourist hotel  Its main business is in catering for large scale functions especially Weddings and they have been know to have as many as  Weddings going on at one time This in itself isnt a problem but it does mean that there were often areas which were off limits to residents  Of the  nights we spent there the quotPubquot was being used for private functions on  of them  The restaurant was closed on one occasion but the Pub was open The food was good the staff were lovely with a couple of exceptions but      Our contract with the Hotel included Breakfast but at the end of the first stay we were charged for Breakfast and despite all reasonable attempts to sort this out one of the management was adamant that we had to pay His attitude was not very pleasant and on our return  days later he neither apologised or made reference to the matter despite it being dealt with by the agency we booked through  The room details also included cookies along with the tea and coffee but these never materialised  Additionally bottled water had to be bought   the hotel supplied water in bottles but as these werent sealed you couldnt be sure where the water came from  This was not a major expense but every other hotel provided at least some sealed bottled water  Another point which wasnt clear when we booked was that the hotel is a minimum of  minutes from the centre of Delhi and a taxi is the only way to the centre So if youre going to India and thinking about staying in this hotel then bear this in mind   nice place but do you want to be the only tourist in a hotel 
N => We loved it We were nearly put off after reading a previous review of this hotel  However we found that it was clean and well maintained  We loved the pool which was clean  The staff were helpful and we enjoyed the resturant  The chef even cooked a special curry not on the menu  There were functions taking place every day and night and for us it added to our India experience with wedding and engagment parties  Although there were so many people milling about we were not disturbed at night at any point  It was slightly out of the City Centre but the hotel Taxi costs us approx   to hire for  hours so if you want to sight see then this was a great way to do so We would recommend this hotel the price was excellent middle of the road which is often difficult to find in Dehli  
N => Poor service and overpriced We booked a quotday roomquot at the Uppal Orchid in order to have somewhere relaxing to crash near the Delhi airport before a  a m  flight for the U  S  Though Uppal reservations had told our Indian travel agent at booking that we could stay in our room until we needed to leave for our flight around  a m  once we checked in about  p m  they reneged  Instead we were forced to check out at midnight and sit in the lobby until our airport transportation arrived which was not a lot of fun In addition we found Uppals restaurant Bonitos to be overpriced and mediocore  Cannot recommend  
N => Ideal hotel near Delhi airport Was perfect for my overnight stay to catch a flight in the early morning  Good relaxation  Prices are possibly high but not unexpected for a  star hotel  
N => My most memorable stay in a hotel in India I had been to the Uppals Orchid when it was just inurated  Excellent environment  Excellent food  Excellent for business meets  
N => A green haven in the centre of Delhi  Arriving off an overnight flight we needed a place to rest before taking an evening train  Our Agent suggested Uppals Orchid would suit us as it has ten acres of grounds and a pool  He was spot on Despite arriving   our room was ready and we were made very welcome  The bed was soft and welcoming and sleep then ensued  Refreshed we enjoyed the  acres of gardens with its pool and plentiful birds etc  The whole experience was seamless and pleasant  A light snack by the pool was our only opportunity to judge the cuisine but it passed with flying colours  Later we bought some snacks to take with us on the overnight train and they were also very wholesome Our only regret was that this was only a day rest and we did not get the opportunity to sample the Restaurants and other facilities Just  minutes from Indira Ghandi airport this place is highly recommended for a peaceful stay away from the bustle of Delhi centre  
N => Serious problems    book cheapest rate not a Leading Hotel Booked this hotel through Leading Hotels of the World site and so paid close to   Huge mistake Front desk staff person was rudest I have encountered treated my wife and I as if we were going through an airport checkpoint  No quothello welcome to Uppals Orchidquot just quotpassportquot quotbusiness cardquot quothow will you be settling the billquot Granted we didnt look like Bollywood stars after just getting off a plane from Goa but moneys whats supposed to talk in a five star and our reservations were made a month in advance  Also if you book through Leading Hotels site you pay top dollar but in return are supposed to get fringe benefits like automatic room upgrade late check out bottle of wine free gift etc  At other hotels weve been given everything from two free one hour massages to  p m  checkout to an Italian leather portfolio to fresh flowers  Or all those things plus more  We dont view them as entitlements but Uppals Orchid clearly isnt taking the program seriously    we were shuffled straight to closest room off the lobby on first floor and assured it was a quotsuperior roomquot with no upgrade  Air conditioning didnt work teapot didnt work staff refused to open our locked private balcony for us at  p m  the next morning when we wanted to eat our breakfast out there we discovered why    it hadnt been cleaned in weeks and was covered in pigeon dung and feathers  We had to make two calls to maintenance to clean it and even then all the guy did was whisk a duster over the table  Finally we were begrudgingly given a one hour late checkout All that said the room was small but nicely appointed  The pool and swim up bar are nice and we enjoyed them the morning we left  The grounds are lovely  And when after paying the full bill I asked to see the manager to discuss our disappointment I had a half hour discussion resulting in some compensation So    would I stay here again Yes but not via the Leading Hotels of the World system  Uppals Orchid doesnt qualify  If you want LHW treatment go to the Taj Mansingh Taj Mahal in the city  I would book Uppals through an aggregator like Priceline or Travelocity and try not to pay more than  a night especially because of its location in the middle of nowhere between Delhi and Gurgaon  And enjoy the pool and restaurants    the Chinese one is spectacular  
N => Nice Quiet Hotel The main reason for my ision to stay here was its proximity to the airport but actually it was not that close to the airport  But the shuttle service was free  The hotel itself is not located on a main road like most other large hotels so it was very quiet  In addtion my room was facing a courtyard which was nice  My room was clean and reasonably sized Women who frequent India might have noticed this but the shampoo hotels provide even at a nice hotel like this one will completely strip oil from your hair  I carry my own shampoo and conditioner when I travel in India Since I arrived after  pm checked out early in the morning I didnt get to see exactly what the property has to offer but I did utilize their fitness center in the morning  It was very mordern and had nice treadmills and weight machines  They also had a nice looking pool outside  For  star hotel in a big city the hotel was reasonably priced  I would difinitely consider staying here again  
N => good place for families with young kids We had a very pleasant stay here at the end of a month long trip to Nepal Bhutan and Delhi environs  Nice way to finish the trip  I almost forgot I was in Delhi Room was modern clean and quiet  Grounds are peaceful with lots of room for the kids both aged four to run around  Great buffet with something to please everyone  The childrens pool was excellent     just the right temperature  The staff were very welcoming of and attentive to our little girls    gardeners picking flowers for them etc If I was pressed to say anything negative it would be that the staff doesnt have quite the grasp of English that you would expect for a hotel that clearly sees a lot of foreigners     e g  we would have to repeat ourselves three or four times very slowly to get across a fairly simple point and likewise we would have to ask the staff to repeat themselves so we could understand  But this was a very small issue     a great stay overall  
N => Rubbish After a magical week of staying in the Taj properties in Rajasthan and the Oberoi in Agra our final night before our flight home was spent at this hotel  This was a huge let down   desk staff weren t particularly friendly and were just going through the motions pool staff looked miserable  As we had an early morning flight we were given a room right next to the main lobby  All night in the run up to our  am departure you could hear banging doors and neighbours talking loudly in the next room   the noise would appear to travel through the air ducts  At am there was a bunch of guests in the lobby just wandering around aimlessly talking loudly and slapping the piano keyboard   infuriating if you happen to be right next to the lobby especially since the reception staff didnt seem to care even when we pointed it out to them Thanks to the energy saving light bulbs   the room looked dark and as cosy as a garage  But of course you can live with that in the name of eco friendliness However the eco friendliness didnt seem to apply throughout the hotel  For instance the air conditioning unit in the restaurant was set unreasonably low happily pumping more greenhouse gases than strictly necessary You could sort of turn a blind eye to the above if you were staying in a  star hotel and not paying very much  However since the hotel claims to have five stars and to be a member of the Leading Hotels of the World I feel the comments are justified I would not recommend staying at this hotel  If you have an early morning flight you will probably be able to get to IGI from the Taj Mahal hotel in Delhi relatively quickly and will be well looked after and get some much needed sleep before you travel  
N => Not worth the price   Not  star I stayed at Uppal orchid on business for  weeks in uary   First room they assigned me was overlooking the highway and loud  I got it changed to a inner room which was acceptable except for the elevator noise in the nights There are two restaurants one chinese and the other one essentially IndianWestern  Items on the breakfast buffet breakfast available only in the Indian restaurant were usually dry especially the south Indian dishes  You could however order eggs cooked to your style and freshly made  Indian dinner dishes were quite oily  The food was definitely not  star its more like   Service at the restaurants was very disorganized  There were  or  waiters asking you the same questions what would you like to drink eat etc and taking orders again and again very annoying Room service was very prompt so was laundry service  Cleaning crew did an ok job in the toilets I had to ask them to clean the tubs a bit more every now and then  Couple of mornings the water pressure in the shower was down to a trickle I was told it was something to do with the power failures Dont book travel through the agent at the hotel  The guy would not refund my money  I paid him for a trip to the Taj Mahal  The trip was supposed to be in a luxury coach but in the end it was a very small shaky and loud diesel van  I cancelled and rented a mini van  Extremely uncomfortable  Also the tour vanbuses dont pick you up from the hotel  You have to go to one of those real  star hotels like Taj Palace to board the bus  And they charge almost  just for a ride to those pickup locations  The whole thing is not professionally run The hallway leading up to the gym stunk like a cheap motel even though the gym itself was alright  Its nice to walk their small garden at least the part away from the diesel generators  The putting green is really small Cable TV was mostly Indian hindi channels  BBC and Deutche Walle were the only western ones Its close to the international airport  But the drive to the city center  take upto  hours depending on traffic  
N => Good service but missing the basics We had  rooms at Uppals Orchid during our vacation to India in     Both rooms were upgraded to a Club Room with jacuzzi jets in our bath tubs  However not many people must use these rooms  After our first night we woke up to no power at all in our room  No lights no heat  After a call to the front desk it appeared to be fixed but then the power was off again for a short period of time before power was finally restored  The nd room had no hot water  We were in a hurry to catch a flight at the airport and this did not start our day off right  After waking up the nd day both rooms did not have hot water  They sent in a technician into our rooms and fixed the problem  Before I went to bed I set the thermostat for  degrees celsius when it was currently at   I woke up to the thermostat reading  degrees  Another technician was sent into the room to fix the problem  One of our phones was not working and they had to replace the phone  All of this for a supposedly quot star hotelquot  Ive done a good amount of travelling and Ive never had to have a technician have to come into my room ever to fix something  Basic things like power heat and hot water should have been tested out and fixed prior especially since they were club rooms at a  star hotel  We were not given any consolation for our experiences only an apology from the manager on duty  Despite all of these issues the food at the restaurant was good the service was very good as the staff tried their hardest to keep us happy and the pick up and drop off at the airport was fairly smooth  I would recommend going to one of the chain hotels like Hyatt Radisson or Intercontinental instead  We had also stayed at the Intercontinental at Nehru Place previously on our trip and had a very enjoyable experience  
N => Location the only selling point Whats good about Uppals Orchid is that the room and its contents behaved as advertised the food in the buffet restaurant was pleasant and offered good variety and most importantly the commute to the airport is mercifully brief Otherwise I found the hotel wanting in several key respects  At about US per night one gets an environmentally correct US chain hotel e g  a generic riott or Sheraton  In India that should cost you about  less than it does  If you are happy to pay that extra cost for the feeling of environmental correctness in a country that sorely needs it you  not feel pricing to be as inflated as I felt it to be Another major issue was transportation  I requested a taxi to take me to the airport for an early  AM check in  I was first told to make my way to the front desk to arrange this a few choice words then convinced the staff member that in fact I was paying for somebody else to do the walking for me  In India full service is quite standard  There would not have been such back talk at the Oberoi it would simply have been done When it came time for me to board my taxi in the morning the driver quoted me a price nearly triple the standard fare for what is about a  minute ride at that time of the morning  Upset at such a crude attempt to price gouge I went storming up to the front desk  It was then that I found out this taxi was in fact not for me but had been ordered by another room for a drive outside of Delhi  But the hotel clearly didnt care enough to help me make sure I had the right car and the driver of course was happy to swap customers as long as he made his  rupees  About  minutes later a second taxi appeared and the sleepy driver bundled me off to the airport with meter running Uppals seems to have acquired enough steady business flow to skimp on its service while maintaining something of a room price premium  If you just want a clean place to sleep near the airport and you dont care about taking a DIY approach to everything else you might like this place better than I did  I was expecting some value for money and the value was gone by the time I finished dealing with staff laziness  
N => Attractive Hotel   BUT       When we checked in we were told that transportation to airport and quotearly breakfastquot were included  The early breakfast consisted of a greasy muffin  We had settled our bill the evening before since we had a  amflight  However we were accused of quotusing a computerquot in our room and the manager was demanding additional cash  all this while we were awaiting our quotfreequot transportation which turned out to actually cost US extra  We finally convinced them that we had no computer to be using in our room  Outside we waited and waited for our driver  Finally the driver arrived at a time to suit him because he was on his way to the airport anyway to pick up some people coming to the hotel  We barely made it to the airport security and customs for our flight home 
N => Fabulous Hotel We were returning fom a  day tour of India and our final hotel in New Delhi had overbooked and we were swopped to The Uppalls Orchid  It was wonderful superb beds so comfy wonderful food in a choice of resturaunts  The staff were really nice friendly and genuinely interested in where we had been  We used the spa and the pool and were amazed by all the eco friendly methods used at the hotel We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and would not hesitate to recomend it to anyone  
N => Tiene unos jardines bonitos pero no enca demasiadas cosas    
N => Bad start at the Vivek We arrived in Delhi at around am and were picked up by the Vivek staff  On arriving at the Hotel we asked to see our room before paying  We were shown a horrible dirty room  The bed was a short misshaped double with a thin bit of grubby foam for a mattress a window was hanging off the bathroom looked awful  We had booked a standard not economy room on the strength of photos on the website  We expected te actual room not to be as good as the photo but this bore no comparison  We were shown another room that was much better a worse variation of the photo on the net but was told this room was R as opposed to the R agreed online  We managed to argue the manager down to R for the better room but felt we had been conned  It wasnt a good start to our first India trip after  hours travel it made us expect to have similar problems at other hotels luckily this experience wasnt repeated  The resturant was quite nice  Staff were friendly food fine relaxing atmosphere  
N => Indeed the worst hotel in India I agree with mharley   the hotel is awful The staff was not friendly we arrived at   am and the check in was a real absurd   we had to pose to pictures holding our passports by our faces  All the rooms we have been shown were dirty and sordid before we entered the man from the hotel kicked off bags with rubbish  I guess they have various rooms but the ones we saw and the one we already took were horrible    When I saw a new Vivek webpage I thought I was going to die from lhing   it seems to be at least  star hotelLast year I heve been had    
N => Worst hotel in India Really this hotel was completely awful  We arrived in Delhi at am and were met at the airport by someone holding our names on a sign as we had paid the hotel for a taxi pickup  However all the guy with the sign did was call a taxi for us which took nearly  minutes and it was a complete rip off as it was more than double the price of our return taxi to the airport  Having to wait for  minutes after travelling for  hours at  in the morning wasnt great either  The hotel was a complete dump with the manager insisting we had to fill out all the forms there and then despite how tired we were not letting us see the rooms and insisting we had to pay up front for our stay  We were so tired we ided to chance it which was a massive error  The rooms were absolutely filthy unquestionably the worst we found in India we travelled in India for a month  The air cooler didnt work the shower was non existent in one of the rooms the toilet didnt flush at all and there were bugs everywhere  When we complained we were met by shrugs and indifference by the manager who clearly did not care at all what we thought of his hotel  The rooms were so hot and disgusting we gave up trying to sleep and got the earliest train we could find to Agra that day  Im pleased to stay that every hotel in India after Vivek was much better  Ive travelled to Morocco Australia and throughout South East Asia South America and Europe and Ive never encountered a worse hotel than Vivek  I could not more strongly recommend that other travellers avoid it  
N => Indifferet views but a good hotel   Indifferent views but a good hotel  I was a bit apprehensive before booking this hotel because of the indifferent reviews I read but I took the word of a friend who stays there a lot  I arrived and my room was booked and the check in was smooth  Then in the morning I ordered room service and it was slow but the food was good I really liked the restaurant its clean and serves up a few good dishes   I suggest this place to my friends an the readers    Cheers   
N => Vivek hotel do not stay in this filthy dump We arrived late at night at delhi airport and were met at the airport as arranged by someone from the vivek hotel  Then things started to go down hill  The man who had been paid to meet us was constantly pestering us for a tip  When we arrived at the hotel it was filthy and the room we had booked was nothing like the pictures on their website  It was filthy dark  dingy and damp  So damp in fact the camera lens was misting up each time I took a picture  The corridors were full of old sinks and bits of rubbish  We were offered a better room but at double the price  It was  oclock in the morning so they had us over a barrel  We stayed one night and found another hotel the next morning  I have stayed in a lot of budget hotels all over the world and can in no way be described as fussy  This hotel can best be described as a filthy rip off dump  
N => Just ok We booked the Vivek online from home and brought a printout of the email confirmation with us but still got cheated on the price We arrived and they took us to our room  When my husband went down to check in and pay they told him the price was much higher than our email agreement  They explained that we were in a better room  We never asked for any particular room or course and this one wasnt great believe me  He bargained them a bit lower but we still ended up paying more than agreed to by email  Welcome to India I guess but it was frustrating  They hotel is well located and fine enough but we found a much better place in Cottage Yes Please just down the block a bit which has an amazing veggie South Indian place across from it Malhotras Dosa Please that is much better than the restaurant next to Vivek  
N => Terrible rooms   good location Really interesting to see how different people rate this place  We were clearly not expecting much but compared to the other hostels we stayed in during our holiday in India this was the worst place and actually closer to a  star than  star rating  If there are reated rooms as described in other reviews we certainly did not get one  The staff was quite uninterested in our well being and the food was below average  Better visit the small restaurant m down the road where the Indians eat too   much better food for half the price 
N => Simple but Clean Hotel Vivek was recommended by a friend since I was traveling into New Delhi and needed to catch a train the next day  It was simple clean by Indian budget guest house standards and was reasonably priced for the room There was some confusion at the front desk as to whether or not I paid when I arrived which I did  so keep the receipts they give you just in case  Its in Pahar Ganj aka the hell realms but the food in the roof cafe Sams is safe to eat and theres a variety of foods I wouldnt vacation here but it was fine for just passing through New Delhi  
N => Dont trust Vivek hotel I was budget traveling for  months and the Vivek hotel by far was the worst place that I stayed  They cannot be trusted   period  They never showed up to pick us up at the airport  They gave away our room that we had reserved months earlier  They had one room left that was so beyond gross and miserable that we were unable to even sleep the first night  They claimed we did not pay for our room  They were trying to make us repay  I finally found the receipt they had given me  They did not make any apologies but instead said that I was a good girl  What does that even mean This place had a variety of room from pretty nice with AC to something resembling a Thai prison  Just because you make a reservation for a nice room doesnt mean that is where you will end up  Their word mean nothing  Also even though the rooms are nice everything else about this building is pretty grimy and gross  I have spent a few months in India and anywhere else is better than this  Please avoid and do not support these people that are unsavory bad people  
N => Dont stay here  A rip off unfriendly untrustworthy unwelcoming lacking of any charm place to stay We had booked a pick up from the airport which was not there when we arrived  There was no record of our booking even though I had emailed and called several times to confirm  When we got a cheaper pre paid taxi to the hotel we had a very unwelcome greeting and a man who showed us  awful rooms which we picked the nicest at inrs  I wish we had stayed elsewhere  Sams cafe was ok and had a good view of the main bazaar but was also really unfriendly  Food was average When we checked out the receptionist had the cheek to try and make us pay for the taxi which didnt turn up and they had no record of the numerous conversationsemails I had madesent  He even went through the name cards from that day to prove he had been there but couldnt find itStay elsewhere 
N => A complete rip off We booked a room at  rupees by internet because our plane arrived at night in Delhi and we wanted to make sure we had a room  When we arrived the owner insisted to make us pay the taxi  Just after he announced that he only had a room with AC for  rupees  We told him we had sent him several emails to make sure he kept a room for us and that he said he would but he did not even apologize  Another girl was in the same situation  He finally agreed to lower the price to  already extremely expensive for the kind of room  but we left very angry  It might be a good hotel but the owners are not the kind of persons you want to mingle with  
N => Vivek   untrustworthy The ac rooms are nice and the food ent and cheap  There are minimal creepy crawlies which is a bonus in backpacker Old Delhi  Its a good location near the train station and the ket  However we dont trust the owners  They seem out to make a buck rather than take care of customers  We booked through their website including a ride from the airport  The ride never showed we heard another couple complaining that they were being charged for a ride that never showed  Also they didnt have our reserved room instead we got placed in the sketchiest room on the top floor  We eventually got upgraded to a nicer room but they also raised the price on us from what the website said  When we reserved the same room for our return trip to Delhi  days later they didnt have that record either even though we gave them some money up front  Until we showed them their own hand written receipt they didnt believe that we paid them in advance  Then we got a smaller room for the same high price  I just get the impression these guys take reservations but allow anyone to stay when they arrive and would charge you again unless you can prove otherwise  We are seasoned travelers and have our cultural expectations in check but when people smile at you and say something and then turn around and do something else you cant trust them  And trust is all you have when traveling  I have no idea how this hotel has been in business for so long  By the end we unfortunately trusted no one there  
N => vivek hotel avoid it We stayed at the Vivek hotel in Pahar Ganj in ember last  We chose it because we wanted to be in the middle of the busy bazaar area to experience the atmosphere of Delhi  All I can say really is avoid it unless really desperate  We emailed our booking and had requested an airport pick up which they claimed to offer  it never materialised When we arrived they didnt seem to have our booking but that was ok because they had vacancies       with good reason  The room we stayed in was filthy noisy and did not feel at all safe  There were men hanging around on each floor and in the reception area constantly for no apparent reason  My husbands sandals were stolen from the room need I say more  We moved after one night to the Ata which was much nicer but also much more expensive  We consider ourselves accustomed to backpacking and staying in rough and ready places all over but could not possibly recommend this place even to seasoned travellersps the restaurant in the Metropolis hotel up the street was great 
N => Loved the restaurant   Friendly staff   a ent enough place to stay in  I stayed there  nights  paid rs  per night  Room was clean and had an outside window They have a nice terrace restaurant which is not to be missed   all in all a pleasent stay    
N => Give it a miss Hi all i have just stayed in the Vivek Hotel but checked out the next day  i went just up the road to Hare krsna Hotel which was way beter for a cheaper price  Vivek was a little expensive and the rooms are just filthy  Not maintained at all  The bathroom walls are grimey  There was even some clothes left in the bathroom from the previous tenant  Where as where i am staying now it is so much better and clean My opinion    avoid Vivek until they start cleaning their rooms  
N => Terrible Place I had the misfortune of staying in Hotel york a few days back   by far my worst experience ever The rooms do not have a fan   not do they have individually controlled AC   the AC was controlled centrally at the whims of the owners  Most of the times it was turned off as a result of which the room was very very stuffy  The night was really really bad tho   thinking that the guest would have been asleep the hotel turned off the AC at abt  P M  and despite repeated complatints refused to turn it on making excusses such as power cut in the entire area local power cut fault with the AC etc etc  Finally went to sleep at  after been fed up  the guys did not even have a table fanThe rooms were pretty sad too   matress was ok but the place was dingy   too too little light STay away form this place 
N => Superb restaurant The rest has a bit of catching up to do  Reception staff did not inspire confidence   dont land in late at night or you are fair game  Room staff friendly and attentive  Room itself ok for R   ask to see room bring bag  haggle there  Make to leave if no joy at first  Agree price leave bag  get written quoteI just paid cash at reception as staff can change day on day and they feel honour bound to try it on  Check out central Delhi then eat in restaurant  Food and waiting staff exemplary  Central location best  worst bit convenient to a lot but lively and noisy  It was much the same  years ago apart from prices 
N => Cheaters and too dirty   Not recommended Arrived late and tired in this hotel  We read the review in the Lonely Planet and thought it would be a nice hotel There where no rooms left they said but the Suite was free  Price  rs  We brought it down to  incl  taxes  After we agreed they asked us to pay  rs  tax  We didnt agree anymore because we agreed  rs including tax Then  out of nowhere   there was another free room  We where too tired and just took it  The price  rs excl  tax They told us all the rooms where like this room  So we agreed with the price but told them it was too high for the room  Soon we where regretting taking this room  It was dirty everywhere  The chairs the bed the toilet and the shower  Everything was really dirty  The shower was cold and there was a lot of noise at night from the personnel around the room The next day we discovered that the other rooms where different and that they cheated on us to pay this amount of money  We just walked into another room to checkWe made a complaint but there was no way of getting any discount or excuse  We where not allowed to speak with the manager by phone  I saw his number on the telephone display and went across the street to call this man He told us that we agreed with the room  In fact we did  But we did not asked for the noise from the personnel the dirt in the room and the stained matresses the COLD shower etc    Telling us that all the rooms where the same was a great lie We paid the full amount and left Have a look at the pictures    The cleanness of the rooms is on the same level as similar the service they offer you By the way they offer breakfast but you cannot have it in the York Resaurant downstairs you have to eat it in your room bon appetit   or in the LOBBY 
N => Disgusting Dirty Expensive Rip Off Thiefs On our way to Agra from Chandigarh we where forced to spend a night in Delhi  As this was not planned for we ended up having to search for a hotel at pm in the night  We where looking for Nirulas as that was highly rated by our quotLets Go Indiaquot guide but that has closed down so the nearest was York Hotel TRUST US DO NOT GO THERE  It cost us Rs  ZAR   US  the first room we got was all musty and smelt damp  As we thought it was only for a few hours we thought we could survive the room  We tried the shower and it flooded the room  So they moved to another room that was dirty no hot water and the bath tub had rings  Dirt rings  We ided to just suffer it out as we would be out in a few hours time  The next morning we didnt even take a shower as it was so disgusting  We just took our bags and headed for the train station Disgusting 
N => worst hotel in delhi dont stay here even if they pay youdirty smelly noisy dusty insecure uncomfortable do not touch anything in this hotel as it will breakif not already damaged plasma tv in lobby is only thing that works worst bathroomswash hands after touching taps beds dirty uncomfortable  
N => Awful place We stayed in the Yuvraj for four nights  There was nothing quotDeluxequot about it the room and bathroom were dirty  the bed was dirty the staff was rude and it got even worse when we refused to book a tour  We noticed that they went in our room while we were gone   at least they didnt touch anything of our stuff  But they didt take they rubbish out or changed linen either  It was also awful loud from morning till  at night they were repairing stuff around the house and there was a phone rining in the hall even at night The shower was not working and warm water was not available The pictures we saw in the Internet were totally misleading  It dint look like this at all but all shabby and dirty I would recommend staying somewhere at Connought Place  It does not take long to get to New Delhi Railway Station from there and it is so much nicer there  
N => Do not stay here This hotel is dirty and noisy the staff are rude and the in house travel agency will not leave you alone until you have bought one of their tours While we were glad for our car and driver who we booked there we did spend the rest of the holiday feeling completely ripped off as did just about every other tourist we met Do yourself a favour and do not stay in this hotel or anywhere in this area instead I would recommend that you book a homestay I have a strong suspicion that the glowing reports on this site were written by the hotel or customers forced into it   as we were when told to write a recommendation for our driver 
N => What do you expect for  This is basically a budget hotel and it would seem that budget in India costs more than anywhere else As with most of the hotels in this area they have spent all of their money on making the reception look nice and have forgotten to reate the rooms  Our room was dark but pleasantly quiet the carpet was old and the bathroom hadnt been cleaned in about  years  Oh and the bed was hard At first we were highly annoyed but when you consider that all the hotels in this pricerangearea are the same we probably got a reasonable deal in terms of how quiet our room was  The reception staff seem to leave you alone but the quotin house travel agencyquot was very pushy  We did not use them  Internet good value at  INR per hour  
N => Dont believe the two previous reviews We booked into the hotel after reading the two very positive reviews on the Trip Advisor site  Not only were the rooms dirty run down and loud but then the staff was loathe to let us check out the next morning   we managed it after one hour  The harrassment in this hotel was definitely on a level with some of the worst we encountered on our India trip
