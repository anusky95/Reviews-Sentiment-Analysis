P => My worst hotel experience ever I had to stay one night near the Delhi airport while waiting for a connecting flight    I now know I should have spent the night at the airport instead The room was really dirty and smelly the bed was horrendous   the linen was so dirty smelly and spotty that it was obvious that the linen had not been washed for ages  The towels apparently formerly white were brownish gray and contained samples such as hair and toothpaste from previous unlucky visitors  The shower offered cold water only and there was no sign of the internet connection which was promised at the time of booking  Over  euros for this crap is the worst rip off ever   never has the price and the quality of a hotel room been so far apart There were far more staff in the hotel than guests and all of the staff were of course waiting to be tipped and sweared at you if you didnt   as if the  euro room price was not enough for this quotqualityquot Do yourself a favour and never step into this craphole

P => a ent hotel in an interesting part of Delhi If you are wanting a good basic hotel at a good price offering ent accommodation inexpensive restaurant internet access and situate in an old part of the city then the Ata does nicely  They offer free transport from the airport  hours which is very handy when you are a first time visitor to India  The onsite Bureau de Change is an added bonus  Street noise can be a slight problem until into the early hours  
P => great hotel true value for money its a great hotel excellent staff very friendly and helpful rooms were clean n tidy and very close to public transport will go back to same hotel whenever will be visiting delhi again 
P => Good hotel in not so good area The pickup from the station was rather badly organised    car for seven people so we had to wait for a second car Hotel is in the Para gang area of Delhi   not all taxis rickshaws will go to the area This is ok as long as you know in advance  But the area is being redeveloped   it had changed enormously in  years so this  change The deluxe rooms are good   large clean and well equiped   but it is rather noisey  The staff are helpful  Breakfast is not included and the attached resturant is slow  
P => excellent value for money well run hotel nice and clean rooms excellent restaurant reasonable prices good location close to New Delhi railway station its really worth the money We will chose it again and also recommend it to our friends  
P => Good hotel great location I travelled to Goa and Agra this year and must say India Rocks  We landed in New Delhi and stayed at Hotel Ata  What a great location Right in the heart of the city  We walked to Connht Palace the downtown of Delhi on several occassions  The Hotel on its own was so self sufficient  Room service was good  I personally enjoyed the chicken dish at the Hotels Restaraunt  The driver of the hotel cab that we took to Agra was friendly and knew a lot about Agra  The Taj mahal was awesome  
P => Typical Indian exuberance outside helpful staff peace and quiet inside best of both worlds I stayed in the Ata Hotel in Delhi for several weeks in   It was an unusually enjoyable experience  The hotel is close to New Delhi station where the special ticket office for tourists is located and to Main Bazaar a huge shopping district where everything under the sun can be had  The Ata Hotel is in a street which is teeming with typical Indian life something that genuine travellers usually want to experience while at the same time offering an oasis of quiet order and cleanliness which Westerners also often want in order to recover from the usual Indian exuberance and noise  Staying there therefore gives you the best of both worlds Indian life and divine chaos on your doorstep and safety and quiet inside You could not have the same experience if you stayed in one of the super expensive luxury hotels which are located in areas and enclaves which are quotsanitisedquot to such an extent that no ordinary Indian is allowed in quotno Indian life is herequot and where you might as well be in a similar hotel in New York or London  Apart from the general cleanliness which is a feature worth stressing in all hotels which do not charge the earth I found the staff extraordinarily friendly and helpful  This is true of all their reception staff who soon know you by name and of the people providing various services like the cyber caf  where the guy in charge went to great lengths to be helpful Wonderful staff is there to give you advice on anything under the sun how best to travel to various parts of Delhi how to avoid being overcharged by taxi drivers where best to go to for buying specific items how to cope with the language and how to solve any other problems you might have  I was impressed by one woman in particular Take one look at her and you know you can trust her   unlike the many crooks and spivs with whom the tourist is soon surrounded in other parts of Delhi This is much more than I had the right to expect in any but the most expensive and exclusive hotels  But this one is NOT expensive and NOT exclusive  I noticed that it is used by backpackers by business people and ordinary tourists alike young and old from all nations under the sun and they all seem to be happy together The charges are very reasonable by Western standards and for the comfort that is on offer There is also a restaurant in which splendid cuisine is on provided and which is frequented not only by hotel guests but also attracts people from other parts of Delhi I am very grateful for having been allowed to stay there and was lucky to have by sheer accident discovered this hotel in the first place  I hope these wonderful people staff and leaders alike will continue to prosper Klaus BungBlackburn UKw httptinyurl comprtdce klaus rtc money co uk 
P => Feeling very safe as a women travelling alone This hotel makes you feel very safe in a big city as Delhi is  The pickingup from the airport is reliable and very fast and comfortable  Rooms are big and clean  The best you can get for little money 
P => amazingly friendly and helpful staff a greta value hotel we stayed at this hotel  times during our  week holiday to india it was a perfect stop off when travelling accross the country and was such good value for money that it made sense  You can be guaranteed a clean and quiet room for the night and a superb dinner in the restaurant although give breakfast a miss  Mrs Ravi in particular was a great help when organising trips to rajistan and she also helped when I had a an ear infection  
P => Terrible hotel One of the worst hotels i ever stayed in dont even know where to begin  First they couldnt find my reservation so they put me in a room on ground floorfrom where you can hear people on the street screaming while you are taking a showercause window cant be closed After when i asked about some restaurants and shopping places people from hotel saidnothing of that is working but they know very fine place to eat   Probably some comission deal I can go on and on    
P => ND worst hotel I stayed in I went to India for  weeks in t  Traveled to Mumbai Ahmadabad Jaipur Jaipur Agra and Delhi  HOTEL ATA WAS THE ND WORST HOTEL I STAYED IN the winner was Hotel Sheila in AgraThe room charges are excessive for what you actually get  The hotel charge for every little thing i e  internet access breakfast etc almost all hotels i stayed in offer this and more complimentary The pre paid taxi is overpriced the tours they offer is overpriced and they insist on only taking you on the tourist trail i e  where they want you to go and this always includes the tourist handicraft shops The photos on their website is nothing like what you get  The rooms are dull most have no windows some spit stains on the wall I travel to India twice a year and have been doing so for around  years now my experience is the good hotels wont take payment until you check out whereas the poor ones always as for full payment in advance this hotel asks for payment in advance My advice would be to skip this hotel and pick one of the  hotels on the same road  I believe as Hotel Ata are in all the guide books their standards have slipped considerably and feel they no longer have to go that extra mile for their guests  
P => Good comfortable choice for Paharganj We stayed in a family room  adults and  kids and a ior suite  adults  A friend of ours checked out all mid range hotels in the area in advance and picked this one for its cleanliness and space  The family room was reasonable  It was a good size with  double beds one of them circular which the kids loved although without any windows it was a bit musty  The bathroom was OK   about what you would expect from a budget place clean but old  The ior suite was done nicely with effort made and a better bathroom  The best part about it was it opened out onto a terrace which was great for enjoying a drink in the evening  Our main complaint was that there is a switch for the electricity outside the bedroom and someone came and switch off both rooms in the middle of the night i e  so we woke up with no fan  AC and hot  Overall Ata Hotel is a good choice for this area of Delhi  Just beware that despite its proximity to the railway station it can still take quite a while if you get stuck in traffic 
P => An oasis in Delhi For those travelling in a mid range or budget scheme the Ata is a wonderful suitable option combining reasonable prices with good services regarding to food connectivity security and travel assistance   look for Mr Manik at the travel desk   
P => Very nice hotel and helpful staf I stayed  nights at Ata and had a very nice stay  The staff was very helpful and even helped me with Indian simcard to my mobile  The pictures on websites are better than in real but ex deluxroom are very nice Arrangement made by the travel agency City capital was excellent Next time if there is any I definitive will stay at Ata J rgen KjellgrenGothenburg Sweden 
P => Comfortable first stop in India airport pickup a welcomed start We stayed  nights  We booked the accommodation through an online agent with a special offer for airport pickup  Our flight arrived in New Delhi at am and sure enough the driver was waiting for us with a clearly ked sign  It was a pleasant drive in and made for a good start  Upon arrival and check in we were offered a cup of tea   nice touch  Our room was a semi deluxe with a large bathroom  Staff were friendly  Guest needs to initiate requests  The hotel is located within walking distance of the New Delhi train station and there are some eating places along the street as well as a hotel restaurant   we suggest the vegetarian meals  
P => My Trusted Hotel since  was back for the rth time had a blast in delhi and great  days at your placemany diferent people new rooftop nice suite rooms and thanks for giving our upgrade my wife and I appreciated every thing the hotel and staff did for uswill be back next year same time  Special thanks to the reception staff for helping us book our flights and tickets onwards  
P => Dishonest staff and misleading photos on website Pretty appalling  Tours salesman pretty nasty and especially so when he found out we booked tours with someone else better at half the price   try the Tourist Info centre in Connht Place area   it should be ked on any tourist map   ask for Mustafa  BEWARE   this has a quotsisterquot hotel The Hotel Delhi City Centre   We originally booked there after looking at the photos on the internet but the photos were of the Ata  The Hotel City Delhi City Centre was a real dump nothing like the photos and when I challenged the staff they lied to my face several times  I had a look round and had to threaten to leave to get them to move us to the Ata  In sumy its a cheap hotel and we eventually got what we paid for after pushing pretty hard Im quot and dont take any crap so I dont know what they would be like with less assertive people i e  fairly clean but quite shabby rooms noisy aircon etc  My advice is DONT buy tours there DONT touch the mini bar especially the water and dont expect too much after seeing the website photos of the rooms 
P => Ok but Im sure there are better options for the same price  Our stay at Hotel Ata was fine but the hotel isnt especially nice  The staff were at times a bit rude and also quite pushy to arrange tripstrainsactivites for you  The food was ok but the restaurant wasnt a nice place although one night we ate on the roof and that was better  Our room had everything we needed but wasnt very well kept  The location is quite good as it is very close to the New Delhi train station  Basically its fine for a place to sleep and an ok option but be look around for a better option first  
P => Nice rooms noisy location good for a budget hotel We had a really spacious room but was at the front of the hotel  It had very thin windows so little sleep was had as the hotel is located in the flea pitbackpacker area Pagarhni of Delhi  The travel agent man within the hotel is a good saleman and booked us  day trip with a driver around Rajasthan  overall a good hotelshort stay but I wouldnt stay in Delhi too long anyway 
P => A good place in the heart of New Delhi A clean and quiet place in heart of New Delhi within walking distance from New Delhi railway station  The bustle outside is not affecting the stay inside the hotel  The rooms are clean and maintained  The restaurant seems to be good though I could not use the same due to my itinerary  The room service is OK but the time taken for service can be improved upon  The hotel offers one free pickup  drop from  to the airport  The hotel is reasonably priced  
P => Nice and safe hotel in Delhi I stayed at Ata hotel in several occasions  The staff are friendly and helpful they help you organize your trips you get safe taxis good advice on travel  It has  hr room service and hot water  It is a government approved hotel that means that you are safe in there  The restaurant has good food you have breakfast buffet which is very delicious  It is good value for the price  The location is also very convenient it is very close to New Delhi railway station and to the Paharganj commercial area you can go by walk You can take an auto to Connht place as well and it is quite close  A good and friendly place to stay in Delhi for a good price Plenty of foreigners choose this hotel as well  
P => Great experience at an amazing cost Oe has several apprehensions about booking hotels from another city  BUt what I saw on the net is what I experienced on reaching Ata Hotel The ambience and the staff at this hotel   Hotel Ata make you feel welcomed and the comfortable stay thereafter is worth mentioning Highlights would be the cleanliness and the prompt service  After a hard days work it does make a difference when you enter a good well kept clean room  And then when you need something extra it reaches you promptly  I would be making this review incomplete if I did not mention about their food  Give this place a try  You will come back 
P => Excellent Value for Money It is really great value for money hard to explain in words  The staff is very helpful and what to say about the location it is just perfect  I had no problems at all and being my first trip ever to Delhi i really needed a lot of guidance for what places to see what to eat etc and staff gave great suggestions and helped me get around the area  
P => Its an excellent hotel with great service location and value for money We really enjoyed our stay the staff was very helpful and provided great service  It is centrally located so makes it easier to move around the city  The rooms are clean and very good  All in all i would recommend the hotel  
P => Service at great rates I had the pleasure staying at the Ata on a business trip in  and have to stay the staff is way better than any of the large chains in country  any time I needed something it was there in minutes which is tough in India  a must stay 
P => Bait and Switch I am not sure how this hotel has rated  stars  be it is the low prices but this was not a pleasant stay  When we arrived we were shuffled off into a small room where we were told that they had no rooms  However the hotel in the rear of the building had rooms  We were logged into the books of both hotels evidently as proof should we complain on      where we placed the reservation that they did not honor the booking  I believe these are the same hotels as tehy both use teh same systems and the same credit card machine located in teh Ata  The Hotel is in the nastiest part of town and has a club next door that plays very loud music well into the night  The picture of the front of the building is definitely photo shopped  
P => Mrs  Ravi Kher Again This is the best hotel in the Pahargonj Area mainly in the Arakashan Road  The hotel arranged free transfer for us from the airport at midnight which was an excellent service I visited Delhi in y  The weather was very hot with scorching heat  My son got high fever after arriving at Delhi and we had to stay in the Hotel for three days for his nursing  But we found the hotel very comfortable to do that  We stayed in  different rooms in the Hotel in a span of five days    and   Except  the other rooms were excellent  I should mention the name of Mr  Gautom whose cooperation we cannot forget Lastly we would like to mention the the name of Mrs  Kher who arranged an excellent tour for us to visit Ajmer Pushkar Jaipur and Agra  Before the tour me and my wife asked her to give us comfortable vehicle and hotels since my son was sick  She showed us the photos of the hotels in her computer  But we were a little bit afraid  She promised that all the arrangements would be as committed  During the tour we found nothing to complain to her  Rather my Father in Law joined us from Jaipur and Mrs  Kher arranged an additional room in Jaipur and Agra immediately  Again she arranged a good vehicle for us to tour Delhi in eight hours  I would highly recommend Mrs  Kher if anyone wants to tour from Delhi to other cities  She knows the customer need and keeps her commitment I would also recommend Hotel Ata if anyone wants to stay in the Pahargonj area  
P => MRS KHER I had a very good stay in the Ata Hotel  I could recommend this Hotel to everybody  The staff is very nice and helpful they are always smiling   I also like to recommend Mrs  Kher Travel agency managerin in the hotel      and to thank herShe organized my trip very well and I felt alsways very very safe  I women  travelled alone  It was very nice and very safe  Thanks Mrs  Kher I hope to come back soon  See you and enjoy itGreets from SwitzerlandSeraina 
P => Highly recommend I was in Delhi last year for a quick business trip and wanted to find something centrally located and economical  I had never stayed at Hotel Ata before but was pleasantly surprised with the customer service and the room  The staff was very friendly and the room was very well kept the linens were clean and crisp  Overall a great experience for the price  I would highly recommend it  
P => Safe and very Friendly They made arrangements for me to be picked up from the airport amp gave a nice meal at  am at night and woke me up the next day with the breakfast ready as per my request in the email i had sent them earlier  The hotel staff spent time to answer all my questions and helped me with all my queries  I will definitely be back whenever i am in New Delhi next time  
P => Convenient location and great service  We spent four days at Ata enroute to Europe and found this budget priced hotel a great bargain with clean rooms and hospitable staff  The location is very central and the hotel provides good guidance and transport for city tours  We found other facilities such as free Airport pick upInternet Licensed Foreign Exchange Bureau very useful All in all we had a very pleasant experience and would look forward to return here on our next trip to India  
P => Clean friendly hotel for a great price Stayed here for a weekend in Delhi  Location was good and central for sightseeing We booked cars from the reception for both days   rates very very reasonable  Both drivers were reliable amp informative and the cars were in good condition Only ate breakfast in the restaurant which was fine Room was clean and bed was comfortable Security seemed very good For a tourist hotel it ticked all the boxes and was perfect for a weekend which was more about sightseeing than spending time in a hotel  
P =>  Star rooms  star service and  star pricing working for a leading international hotel chain I write reviews all the time on all hotels that i stay at this holiday trip of mine started with the ata hotel in delhi Ask them for an upgrade and they mostly oblige and I wanted to mentally challenge their every claim so went to order their butter chicken which they claim is the best in town and I was blown away super delicious served with these indian naanaz All in all a friendly stay everybody always willing to talk help lend solution t every issue i might have even though sometimes i didnt ask for it I will surely recomend this hotel to everybody looking for great rooms and great food on a limited budget  
P => GREAT LOCATION FRIENDLY SERVICE For the Budget traveller with a long stay in India    all in Hotels   this one really fits the Bill  Real value for money and easy access to everywhere in Delhi and the Railway Station on its door step  
P => Cant wait to go again My girlfriend and I are architects and arrived in delhi and found The ata to be an amazingly built property with rooms which are so royal exactly what tourists would lovelater we saw other hotels and realised that this hotel looks like the grand imperial hotel in delhi from inside and its rooms except its smaller much smaller and one fourth the priceI sincerely wish they would offer rooms with a view but I guess delhi doesnt have any real views to see All in all great service and excellent rooms Will be back 
P => Good friendly for the Price n amenities Its safe and reliable it is and that its a family run professional hotel and u took a tour to rajasthan and felt safe as they had a person in each city to help u and ensure u have a great trip    Car used for the  day trip was very comfortable and all hotels booked were carefully picked later learnt that they are recommended in all guide books for this travel agency called capital city travels     I would however suggest that they should serve more sandwiches and other easy snacks etc rather than only restaurant food  All in all good 
P => The perfect hotel for your stay in Delhi Hotel Ata has been used by my family and friends since   The service provided by the staff has always been excellent  I have personally booked three tours of The Golden Triangle with them and recently booked a trip for my parents who stated that Hotel Ata made their trip a memory they will never forget  The hotel is very well run and the facilities are more than adequate  The restaurant in the hotel provides some of the best Indian food I have had in India  You can simply sit at home in front of your computer and plan your trip of India with Hotel Ata  They have never let my family or friends down  I strongly recommend staying in this hotel and definitely booking your tours through them  
P => Wide variety of rooms The facilities are good and comfortable with a wide variety of rooms to choose from  The rooms are well maintained  Only problem is the location which is a bit shabby  
P => Mixed feelings The hotel is located at a busy lane near the New Delhi Railway station  Thats the priy reason I chose the hotel for my three day stay  Also they offered a pickup from the airport free  We arrived at Delhi airport on a Saturday and the hotel driver was there at the airport to pick us up  I was slightly taken aback by the appearance of the street where the hotel is located being very crowded however the hotel itself was neat and well maintained  The stay at the hotel was comfortable  However both the restaurant and the room service lacked promptness  The food quality was average  I think its best to avoid the travel desk at the hotel  The rates are high and no where near value for money  Another negative point was the fact that they did not accept credit card for final settlement and I had to run to find an ATM to draw cash in order to make the final settlement  
P => For sure worth the stay The rooms were comfortable staff was warm and helpful  Food wad great and is centrally located to get around the city  
P => Defiantely Worth the trip back home  As soon as I arrived in the hotel I was impressed with the warm and sincere welcome of the staff who offered to assist me in any way I needed  Check In was superb and and done so in an efficient manner The room setup was beautiful and exceeded my expectations to a much higher level The staff from all departments of the hotel were very professional and courteous and always had a friendly smile on their face no matter what time of the day 
P => Value for Money I stayed here ch     Check in was quick and painless  The room was HUGE very nice and extremely clean  With a king size bed there was a coffee maker microwave and mini fridge in the room  Bathroom was very nice with a ble sink tub shower with extremely hot water  Plenty of towels and toiletries TV was excellent   with an extremely good range of channels Its greatest asset is location very close to the popular shopping places like CP and Karol Bagh  Staff were friendly efficient and helpful even though they were extremely busy  
P => Nice hotel Shame about the location This is a really nice hotel  We had a free airport pick up the room was clean with a good shower and the restaurant was excellent  It is only a shame that it is located more in the old part of Delhi rather than New Delhi as advertisedIt is a Rs rickshaw ride to connht place which means that a white tourist is some what a elty  Be prepared to have more stares when walking round  I dont think I would recommend a lone female traveller to stay here  The room was very noisy through out the day and night dogs barking horns beeping and general crowded area sounds  On the whole a good hotel  
P => An okay choice for a short stay and for the price We stayed at the hotel for two nights on our way to Varanasi  We organised a transfer from the airport through the hotel and we had a seamless trip and check in We booked a room for two people and it was a little small and cramped although comfortable for a short stay  They are clean and our shower was very good with plenty hot water A bonus in India We were not so overly impressed by the service at the hotel  We found that their quotes for drivers taxis and day trips were very expensive  We never really got the feeling they were trying their best to help us  This is an issue with Delhi in general and we would recommend researching tours drivers before arrival so you have options  
P => Ok Hotel in Delhi My wife and I have stayed in this hotel around  times between uary and ch  The good thing about the hotel is that the prices are quite reasonable compared to Delhi standards  It is also in a central crowded area close to the Delhi railway station  If you want a quite residential area this is not a place for you   The room are clean and generally well maintained   They have different types of room but more or less all of them look same  So no point in spending more money on a higher room  If you arrange with them early they also provide free airport pick up  But during our last stay the car didn t come  But they provided free airport drop instead  The room service is also quite good  But my major prob with this place is that the bell boys who hung around you all the time for tips   Sometimes it gets on to your nerve   Although the reception is generally good some times they can be a bit rude   From a safety point of view it looks ok as we noticed a lot of female tourists   However I would be reluctant to allow my wife stay here alone as the street is quite crowded and not sure whether it is safe for a single female traveling alone  Also if you are just looking to spend one night in Delhi due to flight connection it makes more sense to stay somewhere else close to airport   
P => The staff made the difference Well I have to say that all the EMPLOYEES have been so nice with me caring alot about my staying   and this made the difference about my journey in New Delhi making me feel comfortable and safe like home  Rooms are not like those shown on the website on the website you see only the best ones        so at the arrival I was not satisfied about mine and they upgraded me immediately for free in a Superior Room N   this room need a real closet the one inside is invisible a small hole  BY THE WAY THANK YOU EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY MR  ARVINDER  I left the hotel for  days going to Agra and they let me leave my  heavy lugguages at the hotel  Coming back I had a Standard Room with AC n   with a very good bathroom just reated even better than the Superior I had before  Beds are comfortable  Restaurant is nice and good closing late at night and buffet breakfast in the morning is  RS  I found very useful the pick up service at the airport included in the price  There is a  hours Internet service but sometimes you can have problem with lines  min RS    hour RS The street is very noisy very very noisy so bring something for your ears otherwise you wont be able to sleep Now one thing important to say to my WESTERN FRIENDS cause i red some bad staff reviews      the reception sometimes is a little bit messy crowded people come and go and you dont understand who is a guest and who is an employee  Probably staff will stop you hundred times asking you where you go what your plan is    etc etc    SO DONT BE SCARED OF IT      WE ALL KNOW THAT BUSINESS IS BUSINESS it is just the indian way to do it     in Europe we do the same only in a different way   so my advise is BE ALWAYS NICE AND FRIENDLY TO STAFF   listens to what they have to say and their proposals anyway remember that the last ison is always up to you   To the hotel staff I should recommend to always introduce themselves and smile to guests before jump on them          remember that some Western people might be scared and impressioned by arriving in the hectic and caotic Delhi     so give them time to get used of it and make them feel safe like home  
P => Fair Hotel for just a overnight Our permanence in New Delhi would be only for one night  We wouldarrive in Delhi the  hs and the flight to Kathmandu would be inthe following morning and we found convenient the location and the free pickup in theairport offered by Ata Hotel  I found the driver very easily and itwas nice welcome to New Delhi by avoiding the grounds of all the taxi hawkers attn the airport  But a good clue is to buy the pre pay taxi at the airport that cost  rupees about of US    You dont have to bargain with the driverAt the hotel the room was clean  Bathroom was clean  I didnt see anycockroaches or mosquitoes  I was quite pleased with my room number outside of the building Seemed to be an annex  Unhappily the room didnt have a window  But the big surprise was when we check out and we came across aquotluxury taxquot of    and a service tax of   what did of the HotelAta a quotfake  starsquot  just in the price of courseWhat should have cost US  cost us US    Also they charged us   rupees for thetaxi of turn to the airport  turist trap If you dont have plans for the nex day take care It will be followed in breakfast by a personnel that had tried to sell the anycost a full day trip for any place Very pusher 
P => Great Customer Service   good coft stay Overall experience was wonderful very comfortable stay right from the pick up till the drop back to the airport  Customer service was great and the rooms were very clean and quiet gives you a feeling of staying away from the hectic city Great facilities like neat and hygenic food at the restaurant Business Centre Internet access Shop  Good food and quick room service   I would consider staying at the same place again  
P => A Travellers Haven in New Delhi The best mid range hotel we stayed at in India  Good food good company good service and a clean bright room  Thanks to Mrs  Kher at the travel desk for organising a wonderful tuk tuk sightseeing trip for us  Free collection from the airport ANNA and ANTHONY SCHLESINGER BATH UK  
P => Ata Hotel Delhi Good place good people Stayed at Ata fHotel not far from the very central Old Delhi train station or a week or so for ain international conference I attended in Delhi  Very comfortable and clean room very happy to discover free WiFi in effect nice restaurant on ground floor and on the roof  I upgraded to two better rooms on the last two days when my wife joined up along with a friend couple our travelling companions from back home Mrs Kher and all her good staff made all of us feel very welcome and we are very glad we set up our generic post convention tourism away from Delhi through Mrs Kher making our arrangements upon the groups arrival at the hotel  The Chandigarh and Benares hotels and all the Delhi and other town drivers and guides Mrs Kher arranged were fine  We particularly appreciated that when we missed our train one early AM due to unfamiliarity and tricky quothelpful bystandersquot touts at the nearby railway station Mrs Kher promptly arranged new tickets provided us a ride back to the station where she met us and got us safely on our way Best time to travel India in Northern hemisphere terms mid late fall through mid late spring  It was terribly hot and humid when we were there mid t to early ober  Ata air conditioning made a big difference its optionalextra but midspring through mid fall be sure to get it 
P => Nice Central Hotel A great central hotel near the train station and a helpful Manager Mrs Kher who organised out trip to Varanasi  The hotel is clean and the staff will get you anything you need for your rooms quickly  Mrs Kher also arranged a pick up from the train station and airport  The restuarant next door is nice food was nice aswell  The street at night was illuminated with all the hotels and travel agents names in very bright lights  All in all always agree a best price be it hotel or tours or clothes  India is an amazing place  Yet like in any country buyer beware We went around Jaipur  agra  Ramthambore and saw a Tiger on our first cantar ride  AWESOME  
P => Great value It was a great value and extremely good service  
P => Good pick up We booked one night through Expedia for A   My main reason for choosing this hotel was that we were arriving at pm on New Years Eve and the Ata offered a free airport pick up  The pick up from the airport worked perfectly Our room was clean but plain and too small  It was like a king sized bed in a single room  There are reasonable rooms at the Ata but you  be lucky to actually get one  The second night we stayed there on our return journey was better furnished but still too small and just stank of smoking  The clothes in our bags smelt of smoke days afterwards  It was disgusting The final room that we stayed in before flying out was better furnished and more spacious  But that was after paying for a very expensive tour that we purchased from the in house travel agent  There are six different standards of room according to their website and I do not know the standards of the rooms in which we stayed  Whatever the initial cost of a room that is the place from which to negotiate a better price  Everything here has the rider of by Indian standards and should be negotiable The Hotel Ata is in a street of hotels  It is fairly close to the New Delhi Railway Station but with the degree of difficulty in just walking down the street you still need a rickshaw or autorickshaw to get there with luggage or back start from Rs  The area is walking distance from Connht Circle without luggage The restaurant is small but quite attractive  First morning there was a breakfast buffet for Rs which was expensive but convenient  Another morning at a reasonable hour we had to walk into the darkened restaurant and tell them to open up  The food is okay and the service is Indian standard  
P => great hotel Stayed here in ember for  days  friendly curteous staff clean roomstravel agency in hotel was v useful and got a great deal to stay overnight in Agra travelling down by train  Incidentally hotel is v close to the train station in delhi would gladly recommend this hotel to friendsfamily staying in Delhi  
P => Great Hotel in Delhi We highly recommend this hotelWe booked our trip through lastminute com and then found www hotelata com and organised our FREE complimentary pick up from the airport We booked the superior room which was very spacious with a super king sized bed air conditioning TV table and chairs kettle mini bar with shop price drinks amp snacks shower en suite and towels The restaurant was lovely too   proud staff tasty food and bargain pricesAbout a  minute walk to Connht Place or a cheap R ride by auto rickshaw  
P => Not a bad hotel but noisy outside This was not a bad hotel and the rooms were fine   though we had booked two double rooms for two couples and one couple got a room with ensuite bathroom and double bed and the other couple got two single beds and use of a bathroom across the hall  The hotel has a pretty good restaurant and there is a shop selling bottled water etc just across the road  The worst thing about the hotel however was the noise   I could barely sleep all night because of horns blasting and dogs barking  Having said that a lot of the other hotels I was considering booking seemed to be on equally busy roads if not worse  The Ata did seem pretty expensive for what it is   we paid the same price in a smaller town Gwalior a few days later for a much better hotel  Having said that the Ata is probably a lot better than some of the more budget accommodation available and we had no problems other than the noise  The reception will also exchange foreign currency and travellers cheques which was helpful  
P => Better than the street good if desperate  Needed a place for  hours between flights overnight Booked it as they had a good website with OBVIOUSLY carefully selected angles of photos  We were exhausted and were shown a bad room in some mildew corner of the hotel  No windows basic bathroom sterile vibe  So went to see another  And another  Al the same bad boring feeling  Probably worth about   a night if not for AC  But really just a very dark place with a nice and far too busy reception with rather dodgy people  I you have taste and are with a lady forget about this place for anything more than one emergency night  
P => We really like this hotel We have been coming to India so in and out of Delhi continuously over the last  years and now we do business out of Delhi  Having tried the very cheap  rupees end of hotels and the very expensive   a night we have settled very nicely in the middle with Ata  We have never experienced anything other than friendly and polite service clean rooms excellent food in the restaurant and all our business contacts are impressed with standards too when they visit for meetings  So we give it the definite thumbs up and will continue to use as our Delhi base without hesitation  Nicholas and Laura Barwick UK 
P => Fabulous My buddy from L A recommedned me  I came to stay here with my friends  Awesome stay  Great staff and must try out the quotBUTTER CHICKEN DAAL MAKHANI Lentils  Mins from Conht Place and late night pick ups available from airport  Above all we felt very safe and comfortable  Checkout the newly reated rooms  
P => Among the best I have experienced Being an avid traveller I have travelled all over the world and have stayed in hotels big and small  Staying at Ata was a very pleasent experience   made my trip more comfortable and memorable  Location is excellent and ameneties are at par with most botique hotels around the world  However the best part was their customer service  They took care of me and my family and made us feel at home  What better can you ask when you are in a non familiar environment with kids  Friendly trustworthy and eager to serve staff   man I will definately go back there and will highly reccomend it to all my fellow travellers  
P => Excellent service  Its really the best hotel you can get at an affordable price good service amp at a convenient location  Kudos 
P => Amazing hotel because its got the People touch  Unrivalled hospitality  The hotel is run by genuine warm and caring folks who actually welcome you as more than a guest  At Hotel Ata youre family  Leaving you wanting for nothing the management and staff have the unique ability to satisfy even the unexpressed needs of their guests  Highly recommended place  
P => Treated like a Criminal I booked a room at this hotel with a Nepali friend before flying home  As my flight was due to leave next morning I only reserved one room for us both as I would have to leave the hotel at  am The hotel refused to give us a room despite the booking and the fact that there were rooms available  The reason Apparently it was because my friend is Nepali and male and I am English and female and there was no way they were going to give us a room together despite the fact that I would only be there a couple of hours It took us an hour of arguing being stuck in an office with the staff staring at us before we were offered a room in another hotel  We were either treated like criminals or ignored like a problem they hoped would go away I do not think we would have been treated like this if my travelling companion had been of another nationality  This is one hotel I will never ever stay in again not that I did nor would I recommend it to anyone  
P => Average rooms very efficient travel agency We stayed in this hotel for two nights first and one additional night after taking a four day trip to Agra and Jaipur through the hotels travel agency  First nights small room was a small disappointment since we had reserved a semi business room  However the travel agency manager of the hotel asked as the first thing in the morning if we likeddisliked the room and gave us another room for the second night  It was better  The room for the last night was ok as well but the toilet didnt flush without first pouring water in it from the bucket  Food in the restaurant was average but there are some well worth restaurants nearby to go to Roof top bar is very basic but internet facilities very adequate  The hotel has currency exchange and prepaid taxi desk and a complimentary pick up service from the airport worked well The travel agency in the hotel is surely worth recommending  We got a good deal for a four day trip to Agra own accomodation already reserved for two nights and Jaipur one night accomodation in the package including airconditioned mid size car with a very professional and nice driver and arate guides for both cities and a one day sightseeing with a driver in Delhi plus the last night accomodation in Ata  Altogether very efficient convenient and easy  No use for trying to gather the package together on our own with bustrain tickets and the hassle with baggage  
P => Service with a scowl Pros   Close to New Delhi train station and about a  min walk from Connht Place Cons   Service with a scowl  This place is terrible  Weve been traveling in India for  weeks and the Hotel Ata is one of the worst weve stayed at  The rooms are ok a little pricey for what you get though dont expect to get your room cleaned  The location is ent  The staff are generally miserable to interact with  The seem to actively dislike their patrons which makes for a rather unpleasant hotel stay  There are better places to stay in Delhi so avoid this hotel if you can  
P => Good location reasonable price Not in New Delhi but close to the main railway station and on the edge of Old Delhi this hotel offers reasonable value for money with an airport pick up included   The location could be a culture shock if you ve no experience of the third world Bedrooms can be noisy we had a large suite which was well equipped and no problems  Breakfast was extra at rps but very good  There is a travel agency within the hotel  
P => Basic but OK Our first impression was that the place and especially the street it was situated in looked seedy  The room looked somewhat tired there was a lot of noise from the street and a family of pigeons had made the air conditioner their nest  Apart from that though the room was clean the shower powerful and warm the bed comfortable  Breakfast at the resturant was pretty good dinner not so good The hotel taxi service was very good and on the first morning one of their in house travel agents cornered us to ask if wed planned the rest of our two week stay in India  We ided to hear him out as he proposed an itinerary around Rajasthan for us  Since the itinerary and price sounded reasonable we ided to go for it  It turned out to be two of the best weeks weve ever hadWe had one more day at Hotel Ata at the end of our holiday and stayed in the same room  Somehow the standard seemed a lot higher and the room a lot quieter than the first stay  I think after spending two weeks in India wed just gotten used to what seemed noisy and chaotic at first  
P => Dirty noisy expensive Dirty bathroom hairs on the floor noisy carpentry going on at   pm and expensive I estimate  rupees worth of hotel for  rupees  I complained about the noise and was offered a single next to the carpenters for the same price  Sour staff and expensive shuttle not free as indicated on their web deals  Would not negoitate although I mentioned their web prices  
P => Not great I think the only way to describe this hotel is disappointing The room we stayed in was reasonably sized with a comfy bed but wasnt particularly clean and the shower is best described as a lukewarm drizzle The food in the restaurant is very tasty and reasonably priced The location is handy for the train station but is a bit seedy and very noisy but then this is Delhi so thats not too surprising The worst part in this hotel is the constant hassle  The managertravel agent is constantly trying to sell you tours train tickets etc  At first its not a problem but he carries on asking everytime he spots you including when youre having a meal and it starts to get quite annoying  
P => Room cleaning optional Funny place   Ive stayed in literally hundreds of hotels over the years and this is one of the strangest  First of all they dont automatically clean the room everyday   you have to request it Secondly they were reating the rooms next door   till  in the morning     see photo  No amount of complaining made any difference  Although its close to the railway station its very hard to find and the website gives very poor directions On the plus side its friendly reasonably clean and has a good internet cafe The best thingthough is the travel agency which the hotel operates  Mr Kamal Gupta helped me organise a trip up to Haridwar on the Ganges which was very well run   and he suggested an excellent hotel  Thanks Kamal you stopped the Ata from being a terrible disappointment  
P => Grand little place if they cleaned up stayed here for a weekendfirst room was on the nd floor beside some building site very noisy and dusty when i asked to be moved they reluctantly did so to a far superior room on the th floor  Its in a noisy area and there is an open air venue right outside to the left of the hotel  The whole area is quite lively actually and this adds to the rough around the edges charmof the place Staff are pretty gruff but that didnt really bother me just dont tip in those circumstances  The restaurant served lovely well priced food and there were locals as well as tourists in the restaurant which is a good sign  Its reasonably priced if you are on a budgetwith comp pickup from the airport and they also arrange trips to Agra and beyond If only i was convinced that my bed had been made with clean sheets the first day and if only they had bothered to service my room the second day i would have said above average 
P => Good travel agency The hotel is okay and recommended for short stays in Delhi however it is situated in an crowded an noisy area I found hotels travel agency very helpful due to its capable experienced and friendly travel agent Mr  Kamal 
P => Great place to stay in Delhi Firstly the location is just excellent  It is in the heart of the city and accessible to shooping and sight seeing districts Next is the pricing  Real value for money  But I do not mean that is is devoid of luxury and amenities  Its a clean and confortable placeStaff is courteous and the over all stay was a rather pleasant one 
P => ent hotel terrible surroundings This is a relatively clean and organized place but is located in a chaotic area near the New Delhi railway station  Be aware of touts waiting right outside the doorThe restaurant offers ent food and there seemed to be a crowd of other tourists  Prices are fair but if you dont have a booking negotiate before accepting their offer  
P => Over rated Hoax Noting the pretty ent reviews about this place my friends amp I had the unfortunate luxury of staying at this hotel  The airport pickup was on time  Checking in past midnight was almost a nighte    Save that we were not in mood to argue with Jetlag setting in  The rooms given us were probably not cleaned in the last month  and those sheets  ugh Especially the toilet  If it wasnt for the ungodly hour we landed there we would have just picked up our bags and walked down the street in search of another place  there are plenty of them on this street The surrounding area is vibrant and full of life though the dust and noise intermingles The guys at the counter tried their best to rip us off at every turn and I can only imagine how some of those good reviews have appeared  The next day checked out despite their attempts to intimidate us    and found a nice clean place just down the street called Godwin at a much lesser tag  
P => OVER RATED trust me  its crap for the price Ok I read the reviews about this place and took it for granted  Its not a bad place   but NOT worth the price  I went to stay there for  nites but only stayed for  becuse there are better hotels along that streach for much cheaper and better quality  I stayed at the Godwin  Much better  Food was excellent and the servious was fabulous  Ata didnt even change the sheets  ITS CRAP absolutly OVERATED   Dont fall for the pics on the web site    just Trust me They also try to cheat you if you check in at mid nite onwards   they no you are tired and try to manupulate Just as the previous reviews stayted   they charged me extra TAX after confirming one rate and wanted full payment upfront  Do not fall for this  there is no such thing as paying full payment upfront Overall its an ok place the airport pick was on time    BUT it is absolutly NOT worth the price when you compare the hotels around that place  I will never book the place or recommned it to anyone  NO WAY they are over priced even if you think its cheap  If you are not convinced   stay there one night and then walk around and ask the hotels around you   check out the rates and the rooms   I bet you will check out the next morning Good luck 
P => The Ata is trying hard I stayed here about  years ago and it was a dump  In ch  I found it changed almost beyond recognition  They are obviously trying hard to capture the tourist ket  The airport pick up worked perfectly on both occasions I used it  Front rooms with windows can be incredibly noisy   ask for a change  Many rooms have in effect no windows but they are very clean and well maintained  The restaurant is very good and can get crowded  At present a lot of work is going on within the hotel and this can cause noise and disruption   and they need to get the lift upgraded All the front of house services worked well  Room service could be slow but it was ok  The staff are pleasant and helpful  So far as I know you are not going to do better for the price in Delhi  
P => Great hotel in a not great location This hotel was not my first choice but the first choice was booked  That said it turned out to be better than I expected and we stayed there twice for a total of  nights  It is family run and there are lots of people in the lobby waiting to help you  The hall porter on each floor is also eager to help he is your main contact for anything you need from room service to laundry  It is very clean and well orated exterior rooms have lots of sun and ble floors and street noise  Interior rooms have no windows and wall to wall carpeting and they are quiet  It also has a restaurant with a good breakfast buffet and the butter chicken at dinner is excellent  This hotel also has a travel agency on the premises that operates on the quotstrong armquot sales approach  While you  not like their sales style the travel agency is reputable and can help you plan and book your travel throughout India We used them with no problems  We also liked the hotel Internet room   about  computers with good connections at a very good price  One caveat this hotel is a short walk from the train station and the neighborhood is congested dirty and noisy  But once youre in the hotel it feels like an oasis  
P => Only prepay if turning up early to ensure ent room We read the good reviews for this hotel and thought it sounded pretty reasonable but when we turned up at am admittedly a few hours late for our room which we had prepaid for they must have given us the worst room in the place  There was a wooden board in replacement for the window dirty pillow cases hole in the floor toilet and manky bathroom  It looks like we were in the only part of the hotel that hadnt been refurbished  However we only had to stay for  hours before catching our train at New Delhi only R in a tuktuk to reach  The best thing about this hotel for us was that we were able to prebook all our train tickets and pick them up before moving on which was really handy  Moral of the story if you turn up late having prepaid   toughluck you get what youre given I would go back but only if I could see the room before paying and ensure a refurbished one  
P => Okay but depends on what you pay  Stayed at the Hotel Ata in ember of   Our airport pickup was there at am when we arrived but when we checked in we were given standard rooms no windows no working air conditioning barely functioning toilet and broken locks on the doors instead of what we had reserved  As promised they gave us their best rooms the next day which they call presidential suites but which are really just rooms where everything works  We were in town on business so we irked them when we said we had no need for any of their tour arrangements  I once overheard the matriarch of the hotel trying to convince a Swiss couple not to take another tour by a different company because it was run by untrustworthy Kashmiris  In India you have to take spruiking for granted but the Hotel Ata does take it to another level They wont clean your room unless you leave them your room key  The risk with that is that you  not have a room left by the time you return to collect it again  Do so at your own risk  The internet cafe is functional and probably the best on the street though the guy who runs it is always trying to screw you  The Hotel Ata is a standard experience for those looking for budget hotels in Delhi so if youre looking for a more relaxed comfortable stay perhaps try somewhere else  Being in the thick of things at the Hotel Ata might be something youd prefer to avoid  Delhi is full on as it is and someplace like the Taj Ambassador Hotel might be more to your liking Still it wasnt a completely negative experience   breakfast is ent for what you pay but avoid having lunch or dinner there  Guaranteed food poisoning Avoid if possible  
P => Good value if you dont mind being in the thick of it This Hotel is above average because it is good value  We stayed in a semi businessness room for  Indian Rupees per night including a ent breakfast  The room was big with a lounge coffee table and desk  With good light and an ok bathroom which was clean  A basic clean place with a roof top restaurant  It is in old Delhi so it is a bit full on as soon as you leave the hotel 
P => Ok go for it The place is not bad after all  I guess it depends on the room you get We booked the st night through expedia and where charged  euro  The room was spacious and with a nice bathroom but no aircon  Very noisy due to the street The price would not go down so we asked another room and we got a smaller one  with aircon for   euro which I thought was better  No idea why the other one is more expensive The restaurant is great value the lady of the travel agency is nice but asks you all the time what are your plans a bit pushy The room service is fast and does not overcharge so you can ask for a tea and get it in  minutes for  rp  euro cents I checked some hotels in the area and this is the average be even a bit better They all loook great from the reception and then it goes down once you are in the rooms  
P => Awful  ABSOLUTELY avoid this hotel  dirty expensive very unpleasant people we are furious we paid a lot and in advance and our rooms had been given to somebody else when we came back from a trip to Udaipur  They invented an incredible lie to justify it and were very unpleasant with us  You have to ask for your room to be cleaned up and just forget it for the bath we asked for a presidential suite and had one big and one little bed without any fruit basket people always ask for money we stayed blocked in the lift we were given wrong hour for the plane trip and waited  hours in the airport to go to Udaipur etc etc  
P => the ata trap con merchants seems an adequate description  the rooms are clean by indian standards  the so called free airport pick up seems to be a downright lie  you will be prssured to take out a tour to the golden triangle and the management will sulk if you dont book it   the staffa are at best indifferent and at wost rude    the floor staff will talk loudly all night just outside your room and will take every opportunity to ingratiate themselves  without actually being of any help your room  well smell of some weird chemical that i presume they use to kill bugs   you can get much better much cheaper in delhiso my advice would be book a room for one night then move on and watch the management sulk   sorry ata but we customers are important and very few of us are millionaires  hard to descrbe how unwelcoming the staff are undernath their smug exteriors  incidentally keep your eye on the email man who will make sure you spend the maximum amount  take a usb if you need one and use the small intenet caff across the road which is half price and friendlyish  
P => Terrible Dont make the mistake of booking your first few nights in Delhi at this place simply because its one of the only budget places to have a website Rooms nothing like the pictures payed over twice the price of similar style rooms you could get elsewhere  Dirty shower and toilet etc etc  Fair enough the airport pick up is handy and free  but this is more than made up for by the high room rates you pay  Just get a taxi and have a look around a popular central area in Delhi and youll find something better   i did this the second time i came to delhi a month later after a long flight and found something better for half the price   namely   cottage yes please strange name i know but good  
P => Do not trust the Lonely Planets recommendation for Hotel Ata Like many others I was duped into booking with the Hotel Ata because of the Lonely Planets recommendation What a mistakeFirst keep in mind that to secure a reservation on line the hotel charges you in advance for the room  You can imagine my surprise when I was met at the Delhi airport for pick up an hour late and then kindly informed upon arriving at the Hotel Ata that they had given my room that I had already paid for in full to another but that they had a room for me in their quotsisterquot hotel down the dumpy street Unfortunately the quotsisterquot hotel insisted on being paid for the room arately and did not appear to know much about its quotbrotherquot hotel the Hotel Ata up the road  When I complained about this the following morning at the Hotel Ata desk they refused to refund my money for the Hotel Ata booking and offered me their wretched breakfast instead Second after this awful experience I proceeded to cancel other reservations I had made with Hotel Ata for later in my India trip  Although Hotel Ata has been assuring me for the last  days with multiple e mails that they have processed my refund for these later nights I have yet to receive a refund and have had to turn directly to my credit card company for assistance  The bottom line is that Hotel Ata knows very well how to take your money and charge your card but God forbid they give it back to you even when they have agreed in writing to do soIf you believe that frustration wasted time and broken promises are part of any India experience knock yourself out and stay at the Hotel Ata  I never will  
P => Good hotel seedy area I stayed at this hotel with my son in uary  After having read more than  reviews with such variable responses I was a little cautious  Many reviewers were angry at the aggressive selling of tour packages  We arrived in the middle of the night and I expected an aggressive sales routine but there was none  The room was plain reasonably clean and cheap for Delhi  I booked on line for  US  The staff was courteous and fairly efficient  I did get a sales promotion the next day but after shopping around found a better deal but not hugely better  I simply lined and that was the end  The restaurant was good although the breakfast buffet was expensive and it was much cheaper to simply order a parantha from the menu  I would recommend this hotel but the surrounding area is quite dirty and possibly shocking for someone new to India  
P => You get what you pay for I stayed at Hotel Ata this    Basically you get what you pay for  The hotel is old but clean  The rooms are very basic but do have a television with cable  The hotel has a money changer internet cafe travel agent and a pretty good restaurant all under one roof  There were many foreign tourists there from all over the world who seemed pretty happy there  The one major drawback is the area in which the hotel is located which is Paharganj and is a total dump  However the hotel will arrange a carrickshaw for you to get you out of the area as easiliy as possible  I suggest taking your own blanket soap towel and an extra sheet if you are picky  These are things which will make your stay at this hotel more comfortable  If you can afford to stay in an area other than Paharganj I would do so because the rest of Dehli is actually very nice  But if you are on a budget the Ata has a lot to offer One more thing if you do rent a car and driver from the hotel  Be firm with you driver  Our driver kept trying to take us to the quotTouristquot shops Cottage Industries Govt approved etc  and these shops charge you more than double than the price in the kets  The driver pretty much refused to take us to any local kets without first having us waste our time at these quotgovt approvedquot kets  Hope you have a great time in Delhi 
P => Ata Hotel  Nice but couple of things to watch out for My girlfriend and I stayed in the Ata hotel in Delhi in    Its convenient for the station and sights of New and Old Delhi and a nice haven from the bustle of the Ram Nagar area outside Foods OK   nothing spectacular and they gave us a complimentary pick up from the airport  I would recommend it but watch out for a few things Make sure the room you are given is the standard you have booked and are paying for  We got shown a quotnice quiet roomquot windowless but which was clearly not the Semi Business Double we had booked and were quoted for  We did not use their travel agency services but found them overly persistent and pressurising  They will try and catch you with your guard down when you check in and give you the hard sell before you get to see your room or key  Say no and demand your room NOW They also used the old quotdelhi isnt safe   you must book all your cars etc through usquot tactic  Good practice for the level of touting in India generally but you could do without it from inside your hotel  When we left we booked a taxi through the hotels taxi desk to take us to the airport and strangely found ourselves giving a lift to the hotel rep who was travelling to the airport to pick up some other newly arriving guests  This is how they afford to give complementary airport pick ups   by getting departing guests to pay for the taxi  Dead cheeky 
P => You get what you pay for  There seems to be a lot of room for differences in quality of your stay here based on which room andor floor you are on  My room was nothing great but acceptably clean except for the serious musty smell of the mattress and curtains  My air con worked fine but a woman on the rd floor I was on the nd said she had to choose between being very hot all night or trying to sleep over the racket from her air conditioner  The airport pickup worked well which is a big advantage  But I thought the onsite travel agency was a bit pushy  The restaurant was quite good and reasonably priced  Overall this is a ent deal for the money especially in Delhi where prices can be outrageous  Definitely ask to see the room before checking in and dont be afraid to ask for another room if you dont like the first one you see  
P => Free Airport transfer close to Train Station We arrived in the middle of the night at Delhi airport and had a am train to the Punjab the following morning  We booked the hotel very easily on expedia and arranged a free hotel pick up not detailed on expedia but on their website  They were there waiting for us and took us safely to the Hotel we therefore avoided the much commented on Delhi airport scrum of Taxi drivers  Given that we paid   for a room for  of us the pickup was worth that alone it is a fair whack to the airport  We spent only about  hours in the hotel room which had no window but for somewhere clean to put our head and it was fine  Check in was fine and friendly  The station was an enlightening   minute walk at am but being so close made catching the train very easy  I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want somewhere to put your head on day one for an easy exit to the train station but not exactly the place to have a long relaxing holiday and I dont recognise the photo on expedia  The photo from the window posted on trip advisor is a good reflection of the neighborhood we saw  
P => An OK hotel in one of the worst locations in Delhi We have just returned from a one week stay at the hotel  We had a windowless room that was passable  Its clean and ent  However the staff walking the hallways are loud and disturb your sleep  The lobby is narrow and long and I guess because of construction dining is also there The staff at Hotel Ata tried to sell us overpriced packages to visit Jaipur and Agra and tried to convince us that this was a better deal  Its cheaper to take the Shatabdi express and do day trips to each city  There are a number of staff during the evening and it is fair to say they all hover around you and some of them need to know your personal business and your day plan The Internet Caf  was perhaps one of the best facilities that the hotel offers  The location of the hotel is unfortunately unappealing  Outside the street is filthy and narrow packed with cars rickshaws vendors taxi drivers and everything else imaginable  The staff is super nice only when you do things their way but dont be fooled  Theyre are there to take your money  Buyers bewareThe room was clean and ent  Seeing the room for the first time I was extremely pleased especially since I feared the worst from its outside appearance  As they say never judge a book by its cover  The service in the restaurant is extremely slow  My husband and I ordered at the same time  About ten minutes later a couple arrived  It was ten minutes after everybody was served that I received my order and by then the toast had turned into quotbiscottiquot Overall I wouldnt not stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it  
P => poor value We have been backpacking round India for over a month and got the Ata hotel from TripAdvisor  The room rates are variable they charge what they like  The reception is pushy they try to sell you a tour of Jaipur and Agras as soon as you arrive by taxi for  rps for  people which is certainly not good value even with accomodation   you can do the round trip by train for just over   accomodation at   per night for ent places The rooms are cleanish but a bit pokey and the shared toilets are dirty  The final nail in the coffin is the staff one guy who always seemed to be hanging around just outside our door had the cheek to demand a tip for quotmy good servicequot when we were leaving despite the fact that he had done nothing more than say good morning to meWe have to go back through Delhi and we wont be staying here

P => Great value place for backpackers A great place to stay for backpackers and those travelling on a budget  probably one of the more ent choices in the area as the adjacent hotels we had seen were disgusting  We paid  INR a night for a double room which was clean with ac hot water and even a plasma screen tv Great value for money  The hotel had a relaxed communal area with pool tables a German bakery and cheap internet wifi service  The only thing I didnt like was the food service in which I found the staff quite slack and the orders took ages to arrive The location is fine if you want to be part of the hustle and bustle the hotel is surrounded by local bazaars but if not it can be quite chaotic  Generally Ajay Guest House offers good budget accomodation and I would definately return there again  
P => basic accomodation   Good area We have stayed at Ajays  times and would stay there again It is basic accomodation in the busy Paharganj area The rooms can be a bit gloomy and typical indian bedding  thin mattreses but you get what you pay for The bathrooms do have a western toilet and hot and cold water which is another bonus They also have cheap internet on site and a travel desk to book tours and change money  The restaurant down stairs is alway busy and has nice toasted sandwiches and cakes they call it the german bakery If you want to stay in the paharganj area then this is in the middle of the hustle and bustle and is ok for the price  the prices have gone up since i stayed there last  
P => Everything a backpacker guest house should be and more I have regularly stayed at the Ajay hotel over the past  years mostly in the budget rooms basic room bed bathroom   thats it  This most recent visit I stayed in one of their refurbished rooms on the third floor and I was most impressed   INR per night for a good sized immaculate AC double room with sheets and blankets with wide screen TV cable and en suite bathroom As well as an excellent location what i like about the Ajay is that it provides everything the India backpacker could want   lots of communual meetinghang out areas roof top cafe seating areas on each floor a bakerycafe pool table and internet cafe   and all at a budget price for those trying to stretch their pennies as far as they will go On the downside few of the rooms have a window which can be disorientating if your body clock demands daylight to know what time of day or night it is and the large open design of the building means that noise travels rather too well within the building  Use ear plugs  On the plus side tucked up a little side street off the main Parharganj ket road it misses much of the street noise  Overall the Ajay is an excellent and dependable budget hotel by Indian standards and I have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful actually about  years ago I got a bit of a bollocking from the manager for not locking my room properly one time but that is a different story   it did show me that he took security seriously and is a safe and secure place in the quotdowntownquot part of New Delhi  
P => Terrible place I found address in internet and contact with them  They replied so I deside to stay there  Thanks for God I pay only for one night That place is horrible And absolutely agree with other comments 
P => Grubby and unfriendly My husband and I have just spent  nights at Ajays  Its not at all like the guide books say  The bathroom was filthy the sheets were stained there were men lurking on each floor  The staff were unhelpful and unfriendly  We asked for the bathroom to be cleaned as it was so filthy it obviously hadnt been cleaned in months they didnt clean it  We wont be going back  On the plus side you do get cable TV which is a good distraction from the dirtyness

P => Top Notch I was a great fan of the erstwhile Lodhi Hotel on whose site hotel Aman now stands  Located in one of the best locations of the city on Lodhi Road Aman is another name for luxury Right from their branded luxurious Ambassidor taxis to private pools in every suite they have it all  I stayed in a  bedroom suite for two nights on the th floor with my family and we were treated like royals  Every small bit was taken care of  The staff was helpful to the core  Unlike other hotels the uniform of the staff was ethnic Indian and really st  One of the unique thing about Aman is the quotjharokhasquot in the corridors which allowed partial light to pass in making very beautiful and unique atmosphere  Well worth a visit if one can afford  
P => Oh My Gosh From the view of a  year old The Aman New Delhi was the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in I am  of  children in my family  We stayed in a  bedroom suite on the th floor of the building  We had a huge balcony a private plunge pool and three plasma screen TV s  We got two rollaways in the room making it big enough to sleep all of us  We only stayed for one night then cht a midnight flight to Hong Kong the next day  The parents went out during the day to do some shopping while we chilled at the hotel swimming in the pool playing squash in the air conditioned courts playing on one of the  tennis courts exercising in the gym etc  They got back at  and we chilled some more  Then we got room service for dinner which was very special because our dad does not like room service and packed up for the airport  We were driven there in the specially made luxury made Aman ambassadors  The Aman New Delhi was awesome     
P => Stunning My spouse and I live in New Delhi but we stayed at this Aman to celebrate our anniversary  I agree with the previous reviewer   having lived in Delhi all my life I can say with some confidence that this is by far the best hotel in the city The highlight is the rooms  We had the basic one bedroom suite and it was absolutely gorgeous and this I say even though I slightly preferred the rooms at Amanbagh  Judging from the other Amans pictures Id say this is probably one of the nicest looking rooms in their repertoire  The plunge pool area with the daybed and large balcony is especially gorgeous what with the light streaming in through the jharokas  The service was very good and the the massage rooms were well done  The head assistant manager was amazingly helpful   he helped my wife set up the surprise showed her all the rooms she wanted to see so she could pick the one with the best view and many other little things On the downside the lobby area as well as some other areas were unimpressive the food was ho hum not at all tailored to the Indian palate and the choice of vegetarian food was sparse  The hookah they made for us was terrible so steer clear  They claim that they have a mughal architecture and aside from one or two design features they dont but whos complaining  The pool is nice but not nearly as good as some other Amans   Also I would suggest going after tember thats when they properly open if you want to avail of any of the following services   hammam steam and sauna one of which we did but were not told aforehand of its unavailability We were there on a Sunday and the church nearby had a huge procession going on from like  in the morning  They sang very loud and the songs were atrocious to boot and really ruined my night    I couldnt sleep for more than  hours  So check up on this   I dont know if its a Sunday morning thing or if it was some occasion Despite its shortcomings hopefully all temporary the room is so amazing that I cant justify taking off a star  
P => Best Hotel in Delhi The Aman New Delhi was not fully open on il th when I was there  Only  suites and about  dozen rooms were open but all were occupied  Even the local taxi drivers do not know it yet so ask to go to the Lohdi Hotel    the site of the new Aman  If you are an Aman Lover this place will not let you down  Ask to stay on the top floor of the aman wing  You can see Huans tomb in the distance from   All the rooms and plunge pools face inward and are very private  Service is insane Dont miss the Tapas bar or the spa  Each spa room has its own steam and make sure to book the room for at least  hours between treatments  They are currently running a Night special Plus fees and luxury tax so it definitely worth the splurge during this soft opening period

P => aya garden is a nice hotel with nice response to any querygreat food aya garden is a nice hotel with good staff nice response to any querytaste of food is really good you must stay in this hotel        just go there and see               
P => Cant say enough good things about this place  After traveling throughout India for three months I can say that this was one of my favorite places of the entire trip  I think Aaya Garden really colored my experience of Delhi and its a big reason why I enjoyed the city so much The location is great because its in Defense Colony which is a lovely neighborhood  The rooms are beautiful and the staff was the best we encountered the entire trip  Breakfast is included and they tell you to order anything you want  And they mean it  Most importantly its obvious that the owners want you to walk away having the best experience possible  That is supposed to be the motto of any hotel but the people here actually follow through with action  Aaya Garden is owned by two Frenchmen but one was out of the country when we were there  The other owner Alex was a fantastic host  We stayed for four nights but I would have been happy staying there indefinitely  I think the reason we loved the hotel so much was that they were able to make an incredibly refined BampB that felt like a home we had been living in for months  I cant explain it better than that  If youre staying in Delhi this should be the first place you try to stay  Its a great value and it will greatly enhance your time in Delhi  
P => FABULOUS If like us you like this kind of hotels where you just feel like at home where you are expecting for a welcoming friendly and personnalized service here is the place you should go in Delhi  We stayed there  nights after a nice trip around India right before flying back to Europe and if it had been possible to stay longer we would have signed immediately  The rooms are lovely very well orated and EXTREMELY clean which is a great point in India  The hotel is tiny and that might be one of the reason why the staff is taking a so good care of you  Baptiste one of the manager was absolutely lovely to us and made us feel like at home  Anything we were asking he could do it or find it for us he recommended us a wonderfull restaurant give us the perfect spot to try yoga and the dance show he proposed us was just extraordinary great  Even if it was very hot outside the garden is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a book with a cocktail  We wish we could go back next time we visit India  If you are looking for a room in Delhi do not even think twice and go there  
P => An oasis of calm  Excellent food lovely ambience quiet amp restful  Its like a home away from home  Nice location with the Defence Colony ket within walking distance  Rooms are very clean and sos the bathroom  Excellent service very friendly staff   an oasis of calm in a city like Delhi  We liked their use of hand crafted soaps and toiletries as well as the clean linen  Much better than many places in Delhi which charge you more for less  Will definitely stay there again  Only downside is that locks on the doors need to be changed  
P => Charming Boutique Hotel with great ambience a beautiful garden and so centrally located We had the most memorable stay here and would love to return again and again We stayed in the quotGolden Roomquot   it was so grand and spacious beautifully orated and very very clean indeed The bathroom was spacious and very clean too  The Dining Room and the lounge had a lovely ambiance and it was so tastefully orated I loved the chandelier in the Dining Area  We were served lovely breakfast in the garden and were greeted by one of the French owners who was so charming and caring  The entire staff was very attentive and polite and always attended to our needs  I would definitely recommend this charming beautiful boutique hotel to everybody   just experience it 
P => Perfect in every way My dhter had been on a gap year in Southern India and we ided to meet her in Delhi and spend a few days together  We chose the hotel based on the reviews in Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed  Tthe hotel is run by a French couple who are in the textile business  This is almost a new venture for them as they were responding to the needs of others in the textile industry that come to Delhi frequently  Its not a normal hotel and I would best describe it as staying at home with concerned parents  It even looks like a family home and has the same feel  When my dhter came up from Goa they picked her up at the airport and provided her with a driver to get around during the day and fed her for three days before we showed up  The driver plus car cost about       per day which is very reasonable  All the staff are very attentive and the breakfasts were excellent  The hotel is in a gated enclosure of a couple of square miles and all the gates bar one close at night  That can be tricky later on when you eat outside the community  Fortunately the shops and restaurants inside are very good and varied so there is no need to venture outside  
P => Exceptionally well run staffed and comfortable botique hotel This review is authored by a  year old Professor from a major research university in the USA who has stayed in countless hotels large and small around the world  From the arrangements for a driver to initially meet me and subsequently return me to the airport the managers and staff of the Aya Garden hotel worked tirelessly to ensure my stay at their hotel was comfortable and that my every need was given personal attention  Alex and Matheu are excellent managers of the hotel and truly care about their guests every need  Athaliya Pasha Charles and the other members of the staff act as if they are also owners in that they attend to every need with a smile and a quotcan doquot attitude  The rooms and beds are large very comfortable and quiet  The garden area contains many beautiful plantings and serves as a lovely place for meals  The chefs are well trained and can prepare an exceptional meal around almost any theme Indian vegetarian Continental etc  The hotel has arrangements with an excellent taxi service staffed with drivers who know Deli well and are attentive to their customers needs  As such I personally award this hotel the maximum number of stars for an exceptionally comfortable five day stay in a bustling capital city  
P => This is the one in New Delhi This is the most lovely place  Friendly clean great food comfortable rooms and beds in a safe convenient little enclave in New Delhi  Thank you other TA members who reviewed it  We met Alex who is one of the owners and he is just great  He employs lovely staff Delphine Gregoire and Jaspreet who dealt with our booking in such a prompt and sweet way deserve a very special mention The hotel is in a very safe area they have a guy on guard during the night outside just in case  Its lovely and quiet with trees in the garden yet Delhi is right out the gate and turn left or right and walk a bit lots of shops restaurants within easy reach  Its not far from the airport We used the hotel as a base during our month away returning there in the middle and at the end  nights in all  They kept luggage for us that we didnt need on the various parts of our trip  Our room was perfect each time we returned with lovely flowers clean beds lots of lovely soaps see the previous review towels bath robes in fact everything you would expect from   but most definitly not at a   price Can not miss a mention for their cooks and chefs  They offer  hour restaurantroom service and they really mean it  You can get any kind of food you fancy any time  Just ask Indian fabulous French delicious Mexican literally anything  They have got chefs from some great places including the US Embassy I believe  We had some of the best food of our trip at Aya Garden Thank you Alex and all the staff we hope to be back again one day soon  
P => Excellent response to reservation query I sent an email query and received a prompt and pleasant answer  They efficiently followed up again to remind me that they were still holding the room for me  Unfortunately my trip plans changed and I cant stay at Aya Garden  But I am impressed with their professionalism and I will certainly stay there in the future  
P => Amazing Aya I simply cannot praise Aya Garden and the staff enough We stayed  nights over Christmas and it was just a fantastic experience especially as it was our first time in Delhi The room was lovely the breakfast room lounge garden were all just beautifully orated and kept  The staff were all really nice and helpful especially Delphine and well I do not think I have ever praised a place this muchIt is not cheap for India but what a treat it is and when summed up it is total value for money I can highly resommend Aya Garden 
P => Absolutely brilliant the best antidote to a busy day in Delhi We booked directly with the hotel and stayed there in ember on either side of a friends wedding in Gujurat  I wouldnt hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone it is lovely  We were bowled over by how belpful everyone was and even though the hotel only has  rooms it has everything you could need  We ate in the hotel several times and were very pleased with the food the chef is around most of the time and you can pretty much ide what you would like and when instead of having a fixed menu Its not far into the centre of town   about  minutes by moto rickshaw  I have to say that Delhi is quite hard work in my opinion but I would say that having somewhere as restful as this to go back to at the end of the day was well worth the money We stayed in the Gold Room which was really lovely  The room was enormous and had a comfortable bed  occasional furniture and nice bathroom  Really nice or its like being in a quirky friends house Just an indication of the thoughtfulness of the staff it was my husbands birthday on one of the days we stayed and they gave him a lovely bouquet of flowers In short if I was going back to Delhi I wouldnt think twice about staying here again  In fact I wish they would open some in other places too 
P => an oasis in Dehi a wonderful find If you are not particularly into generic five star hotels then stay at Aya Garden or Haveli during your time in Delhi  I have been to Delhi many times and stayed at a variety of hotels  Aya Garden was by far the best   the location is great Defence Colony in South Delhi the rooms are beautifully orated in a funky and individual way and the service is excellent  Both the Garden and Haveli in Hauz Khas are more guest houses than hotels but that is part of the charm for me  Neither have many rooms but both operate a  hour kitchen do laundry and can arrange transport services  They both have wifi internet and one night we ided to stay in and they prepared us a lovely dinner  Breakfast is also served as the norm and in the Garden you can eat it in the garden  If your budget stretches to it I would chose the Garden but we also stayed in the Haveli and it was lovely  I will definitely stay again and recommend it to all my friends  
P => Funky and wonderful What a delightful place the Aya Garden is I have not experienced a nicer place to stay in any of Indias metropolitan centres  Staying at the Aya Garden is like staying at the house of a friend with good taste but with all of the comfort and service of a good hotel  With just four rooms the place is cozy and guests get full run of the funky sitting and dining rooms  The service is wonderful and there is  hour room service including reasonably priced wine and beer  Delphine the manager and all of the staff were incredibly kind and friendly throughout our short stay Our room the Green Room was very nicely appointed   scented candles comfy pillows a little balcony shaded by a large tree and a modern bathroom with a rainhead shower  The breakfasts were wonderful including French style crepes and perhaps the best cup of coffee we had in our  months in Delhi There are lots of other small touches   free wireless internet they can arrange a car and driver and charge it directly to your room bill so you dont have to worry about negotiating with the driver they even do mobile phone hire at a ent rate  The location is great   just  minutes walk to Defence Colony ket with its plethora of good restaurants bars and shops  There is no question that I will stay here again on my next visit to Delhi 
P => Amazing If you do only one thing in Delhi then stay at Aya Garden this place is amazing and probably the best place i have stayed  Its a little boutique place   only  bedrooms so book ahead  We had the gold room which was just stunning and the service is exceptional  Breakfast is amazing as is dinner and nothing is too much trouble  The hotel is located in a quiet residential area and v quiet which is heaven after been in India for  months  It was my last stay in India after  months and Im glad I stayed there   just wish it could have been longer 
P => Tranquillity amongst chaos What can I say about this place           pretty special and one that goes down as a must when recommending to others  The room the people the service simply impeccable  My partner and I stayed here after three weeks touring around India and this really did represent the best way to sign off a great three weeks  Unlike the big five star hotels which provide exorbitant fees but not much else Aya Gardens represent value of money if there is such a thing A big thank you to the hotel manager Aparna Sethi and her attentive staff who couldnt have done anymore to make us both feel welcome  The homely atmosphere was even more welcome when my partner developed a bout of Delhi Belly and Gandhis revenge at the same time  Their caring attitude was a real plus for which Anna will be always grateful  I could go on but I think you get the message  You can stay at a lot cheaper places and a lot more  This is the best of both worlds  I just hope anyone staying on my recommendation likes the place as much as ourselves  Enjoy  
P => Haven If youve heard about Aya Garden or its sister Aya Haveli which is apparently wonderful then youll probably already know how exceptional it is  Its away from the main tourist areas but youd be lucky to find a hideaway like this anywhere in the centre  My room was a cocoon in the hem of Delhi combining European taste with Indian history  The staff made me feel incredibly welcome   like a guest in their home  In fact it is more like a home than a hotel  It is in a residential area but that means you can come and go hassle free and take an autorickshaw or taxi wherever you need to go  Worth every penny and it cost quite a few but still cheaper than some of the ropey hotels on offer in Delhi  
P => Un petit coin de paradis  
P => H tel   recommander

P => Delightful period hotel with scope for improvement If as seems inevitable youre landed with paying extortionate prices for Delhi hotel rooms you  as well go for the period charms of the Ambassador  Lovely ambience and location  Solicitous staff  Bedrooms furnished in a tastefully understated manner  Here are some suggestions for improvements   Beds are a bit military in their springing  Something a little bit more luxurious would be appreciated  And pillows with a natural filling really should be the default in a hotel of this standard   When every bedroom overlooking the centre court enjoys the luxury of a balcony why not make more of it Put a couple of chairs out on them perhaps  The public areas are not used as well as they could be  The Yellow Brick Road really doesnt make the grade as a coffee shop in a hotel of this status  With its hard chairs lighting and surfaces it enjoys all the ambience of a works canteen  Escape from its noise into the softer surroundings of the bar and youre assailed by a Philippino karaoke duo  Please a little bit of quiet  And the only st restaurant in the hotel is Chinese  Am I missing something here Why do I want to eat Chinese food in India 
P => Good location spacious rooms The Ambassador is a charming hotel with a soul  Excellent service from check in to check out clean and spacious rooms and bathroom  Khan ket is in walking distance  Draw back Small breakfast room and limited selection of food for breakfast  High cost for internet access  IR for  hrs  The Ambassador would be my first choice for New Delhi except for the small breakfast room and the very limited selection of breakfst choices  
P => Taj Ambassador   Damaging the Taj brand This hotel is not worthy of sporting the Taj brand   had this been the first Taj that I had been too it would have also have been the last  I associate the Taj brand as one of quality but the Ambassador is simply not worthy The experience begins as you drive up to the hotel the poor quality barriers to stop traffic alert you to the cheap and nasty nighte that lies within  As you approach the building with paint fading peeling and the landscaping needing serious attention then it starts to feel like a substandard hotel The lobby is small but acceptable but the reception desk is small and old fashioned  The service is acceptable but nothing more  The cost of a room is far too high for what is being offered The walk to my room showed the hotel or to be tired and dated it smelled musty and was crying out to be refurbished  My room was terrible   nasty furniture uncomfortable bed and awful bathroom  I would rather have stayed in a  room in Delhi   at least I would have got what I paid for The quality of the food at the restaurants was not up to the quality of the Mumbai Taj hotels and I could not get myself to stay longer than one night  I checked out and moved to a nearby ent hotel Taj   drop the brand or spend some money  This hotel is doing you a disservice The d 
P => Close to perfect stay  and will be coming back Was here for a week of business at the beginning of y and as I am here in Delhi again for another week I booked again at the Ambassador as I had such a pleasant stay my first go around  I will be coming back to Delhi several times over the coming months and I fully intend to stay here The room themselves are excellent  clean and spacious with great work space important since I spend a great deal of time working at my computer from my hotel room  Service in the hotel is great as they have a very polite efficient and helpful staff  They can almost be too helpful at times and Ive taken to leaving the quotDo not disturbquot light on to avoid the seemingly incessent knocks at my door asking if I need anything The food is also excellent in all  restaurants as well as from room service  Only criticism I really have is for the lounge  InSomnia  It could be a great place to relax if the music werent so bad  apparently he feels that at the end of a business day a lone business traveller wants to listen to heart jarring disco beats   Overall great hotel  terrible DJ  
P => Lovely stay I stayed at Ambassador quite a few times in the past but this time it wasnt really the same  No dont get me wrong it was largely because of the metro construction close by that the approach to the hotel became quite a pain  Anyways i did spent three days in the hotel and the place   once you get inside   has its own quiet charm  The rooms are pretty spacious and I did like the fact that they still have the old kind of balconies in the room where you can go out and stand  The restaurant   Yellow brick stone is quite a hit both for the in guests and outsiders  It surely has a nice warm feel to it and the menu card in the form of a newspaper was very pretty  The pub is mostly deserted and i didnt find much crowd there and you do feel a bit silly sitting all by yourself in a pub   although the interior and the or is done quite well  But there is a bit of an old legacy feel to the hotel   in the way its constructed in the way you see the interiors and also the way you get treated  Room service was pretty good as is the case with most Taj hotels  Overall a pretty good stay at the hotel and i do hope that the metro construction finishes soon so that the approach to the hotel becomes as smooth as it used to be in the past  
P => Business pleasure I found the Ambassador Hotel very convenient  It is certainly well located next to the airport  The rooms are clean and comfortable  No complanits about the service  
P => perfect location for a short business trip While on a short trip for a conference nearby I found the Ambassador Hotel very convenient  It is certainly well located next to the airport  The rooms are clean and comfortable  No complanits about the service It  not be the best hotel for the money you pay but it is certainly convenient for a business trip as you avoid travelling on the busy Delhi roads  
P => I loved the location and the service quality  It was way back in   when me and my family members ided to visit New Delhi We were advised by our relatives that the Ambassador A part of the Taj Group is the best hotel available for us reason being Khan ket just next to it We really had a good time though or stay was short but the location and the service quality of the hotel is excellent  The staff is so polite and co operative which is something I really liked  
P => great hotel in good lcoation Very good hotel rooms are large and the staff are friendly and efficient  Good choice at breakfast insomnia bar is a good choice for drinks and dinner in the Chinese restaurant was good  Taxis are available on demand at the door and the hotel is in a good location  Khan ket is a few minutes walk with a good selection of shops for essentials or gifts and some restaurants  
P => great rooms Rooms are large as well as the bathrooms  Very comfortable  Loved the large tv screen  
P => Business with pleasure As a formal guest of the United NationsUNAIDSgoing back to Delhithe city of my alma materAIIMS was indeed very exciting both in anticipation and also in real terms  The visit was very different from the other official visits to Delhi for formal meetings at NACOGovt of India where I have queue up to get a pre  paid cab and go through the rituals of shouting my name and destination to the traffic cop supposedly working for the convenience and safety of the passengers It was real treat to be welcomed by a turbaned and liveried chauffeur with an attendant carrying an exclusive placard with my name calligraph ed as in my MBBS and MD degrees The big limousine or at leas t it looked like one to me  used to travelling in black and yellow ambassador taxis with noisy body parts and noisier drivers or whatever that AMBASSADOR vehicle was had air conditioned at the right temperature and humidity levels Before taking my permission to stay back at the airport treated me royally by offering a glass of cold water in a tray which also had the newspaper and two magazines to be read in a drive which any case could not last longer than  minutes  Quite expectedly the services in the hotel definitely matched with the mobile outreach services extended to me in the car itself Indeed an experience I cherish to this day  
P => good location location is close to the airport  lobby is good but the services are not great  
P => Bit surprised by the reviews we didnt find this value It is a while since we stayed here but well over usd a night is not value for this level of hotel  Delhi clearly has a lack of supply when it comes to hotel rooms as everything was booked solid  This was the most expensive accomodation of our trip and yet the most average accomodation   compared to the TAJ in Mumbai and Goa very basic  The room was large but very basic felt a bit like an old boarding room with a nice tv  Front desk service was ordinary but the concierge woman was fantastic  Location is quite good being a short walk from Khan mkt and Lodhi gardens  We used a car service one day from the hotel and it was fine  The pool is a tiny above ground pool the type u used to see in aussie backyards in the s and s  Brekkie in the little coffee shop was pleasant  Would stay here again if the price was considerably lower  
P => Delhis best value  star service The or  not be quite as ritzy as its sister Taj hotels but this is a great hotel for the price  Amazing service delicious room service and top notch linens toiletries etc  I cannot say enough about the hospitable and helpful staff  When this hotel is discounted on websites it is well worth the extra   over other mid range hotels  Outstanding location too   walking distance to Western catering Khan ket  
P => Very Nice Hotel Great Staff Nice or Big Rooms Very Comfortable Beds Good Food  Downsides were a hotel pick up from the Airport that was  minutes late very small lifts and the price of the hotel is a bit too much for what the hotel provides  
P => If you have to stay in a Delhi hotel          Delhi is under hoteled and therefore over priced  Ambassador is not the best hotel in town it  be the best value for money  Some  say that it cries for a refurb  There are past their time tenanted shops on the ground floor outside  The retail concessions inside are modest  The nearby Khan ket is one of Delhis best shopping areas and blessed with interesting small international menu restaurants  For India it is relatively quiet just out of town mercifully free of beggars and con men at the door  We appreciated the large rooms fairly well appointed even if they were done some time ago During the extension of the Delhi Metro the pool was out of bounds  Management kindly provided free transport to the better pool and gym of the nearby Taj Hotel  
P => Highly Recommend this Hotel I stayed at the Ambassador Hotel for  nights  The room was large comfortable and nicely appointed  This is an older hotel with a nice ambiance The construction for the Delhi Metro was right outside my window  When I saw it I immediately asked to be moved to a different room  I was told it would be impossible that night but they could move me the next day  However I was not overly bothered by the noise and ided to stay in the original room for my second night The restaurant provided an adequate tasty breakfast buffet There are three roof top patios  all on the same floor  They are hard to find but nice to sit on The hotel staff are very friendly and efficient I would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P => Odd Mixture of classic and modern Like India itself the Ambassador is hard to describe in a few sentences  It is a grand old property with large quotstaterooms quot Mine had a huge balcony as well as a fireplace    neither serving any purpose beyond oration but evoking some bygone era  The location is convfenient  The clientele is diverse and appears travel wise  The restoration of the hotel is schitzophrenic  The hallways and rooms have some pictures and features invoking the Raj  To get to my th floor room you had to walk outside on a funky roof terrace to get to the other wing  But these are offset by bad imitiations of charmless s Holiday Inn room design e g  showerbath and boxy uncomfortable chairs  The breakfast restaurant is equally odd a cramped space painted yellow far from the lobby that could have been some roadside dive in the U S  but incongruously orated with colonial era posters and knicknacks The staff is unfailingly cheerful and helpful on the whole but i had some issues at checkout as they attempted to charge for airport shuttle service which had been promoted as a free benefit  They did erase the charge  Internet wifi was unreliable  From what Ive seen there arent many Delhi hotels that are neither pretentious nor seedy  The Ambassador fills that niche  
P => Functional Hotel nice and quiet Its an old colonial property perfectly converted into a great hotel  The service was excellent and just loved the restaurant which reminded me of a typical American breakfast restaurant  The food was simply excellent and when we booked they were offering a huge discount so got it at a very good price  It is very close to a central business area of New Delhi  I will suggest it for business travelers as well as for tourists    
P => Very good luxury value for money Being a Taj hotel I expected high quality amenities and service and thats definitely what we got  We stayed at the hotel for  days  during our holiday in India in their superior room which is a bit bigger than the standard  The room was spacious with comfortable furniture and very attentive staff who ensured that the room was cleaned and tidied twice a day the bathroom was cleaned and checked twice a day and minibar was always well stocked  Fruit and small floral orations were always fresh The  hr restaurant is a bit small but the breakfast is very good and the service is very good  I used the  hr business centre a few times everything worked just as I wanted We found Larrys odd name for a Chinese restaurant to be one of the better Chinese restaurants in Delhi   and weve tried a fair number of them  The hotel is next to Khan ket so going for a stroll to shops and restaurants is a breeze The hotel is very central just  km from India Gate so getting to places all over Delhi is easy  I spent hours in the horrenduous Delhi traffic so I really appreciated the   mins I saved daily compared to the luxury hotels nearer the airport Since the swimming pool was closed due to some construction work we were offered a free car to drive us to the other Taj hotel just  minutes away and use all the facilities there just by showing them our room card  We charged our poolside expenses and retaurant bills to our room and when we were done we just asked for a complementary car tht drove us back to the Ambassador free of charge  A bit more cumbersome than taking a lift down to the pool but we cant grumble Considering the price we were genuinely surprised that this renated s hotel was so luxurious Will I stay there again You bet  
P => No Fuss Hotel Taj Ambassador is situated near the Mansingh road and is easily one of the best localities in New Delhi  This hotel is not so grand but is a no fuss hotel  A top notch taj service is what you can express  Rooms are about  sqft  It has all the modern amenitites of a  star hotel  THe hotel is small and a cozy one  Ambassadors breakfast is a little small considering its Taj  But one can expect a great deal of ala  carte menu  If you dont look for grand lobbies at the hotel than this one is the best deal for you as you will be almost experiencing the star quality and service from the Ambassador  But ya dont forget to visit the Taj Mahal jus  mts away from the ambassador its worth a watch  
P => The Taj   Unplugged The Hotel Taj Ambassador is one of the most affordable hotels of the Taj group   A forty minute drive from the airport and your greeted by a white dressed doorman not in his Taj uniform but with a Taj smile  The lobby is just about ok  Nothing special no Belgium Chandeliers or Italian fabric sofas  No forty feet ceiling either  ent though its what you would expect from a  star property in Delhi  The check in was really quick  In less than five minutes I was unpacking  The room was ent enough  It had a good sized bed a sofa and table mini office chair and desk a large mirror a wardrobe with locker forty inch Samsung LCD TV and a mini bar  The daikin air con was really powerful to take the Delhi heat  The bathroom was really big  It had a huge mirror and bathtub  Sadly the only area where you can bath is in the tub  Careful as it can be slippery  The hotel has two restaurants and one bar  The first one is called the Yellow Brick Road  A small multi cuisine cum  coffee shop  Cant call this one as cozy or star or  It serves the morning breakfast as well  The breakfast was nothing great limited dishes and no live kitchen  They serve Polk  Something I didnt like  Usually Polk and beef are not served in breakfast in most hotels that I have been to keeping in mind religious sentiments of the two communities  I could not try it for lunch or dinner as it was always packed  The second restaurant is called The Larrys China  With a limited menu choice the dishing are both spicy and pricey  A gravy dish is for anything between  to  Inr  Many of my favorite dishes like Chinese fried chicken and fried ice cream were missing  The chef promised me these on my next visit  You  want to try the lemon chicken   The bar was out of bounds for me as I dont drink  They have a gym and a spa  affiliated to mystic  on the fifth floor  It has two techno gym treadmills and two cross trainers along with a couple of free weights  No strength machines  The spa is with limited massage treatments    The young staff  many trainees I assume  are always on their toes  Anything you want its a smile Yes Sir and its done  They never seem to refuse to anything  I do believe the property has a swimming pool but I could visit it during my two day stay  The hotel exterior looked dated  It really needs a paint job  Moreover its sandwitched between two sets of apartments giving it a rather two star look  Lot of lazy taxi drivers sleeping around  All in all a good two day stay which was well worth the money  I booked through their web site as it makes it thirty percent cheaper than booking over their front office  The Taj experience is always unique  Whether its their five star property or a three star one  They really know how to take care of a guest  I have been to many hotels across the length and breath of my great country  This group really knows a guests needs and makes sure every stay is memorable  A group which believes in acquiring historical palaces and converting them into hotels rather than building modern structures  At checkout you would want to come back soon  A feeling very few hotels can offer you  However its Taj unplugged  If you want the full Taj experience try the one right behind this hotel  The big apple quotThe Taj Mahal quot I had the time to visit it  Its simply out of the world and can be compared to none other than The Imperial Delhi  On my next visit in y it would be between these two hotels Best wishes 
P => Not the best Taj hotel but a good stay for the price This is the lowest rent Taj hotel Ive ever been to but it was still clean and comfortable  I had the feeling that this was the hotel where the Taj organization trains a lot of their staff  We ran into at least  quottraineesquot while we were there  nights  The staff seemed rather confused in general but luckily I didnt need to call on them for any emergenciesThe building has a colonial feel  One quirk is that we had to walk through an uncovered outdoor patio on our floor to get from the elevator to our room  Next the Khan ket and easily accessible everywhere by cab or tuktuk The restaurants in the hotel were kinda lame  For a real treat take a cab a few minutes up the street to the super posh Taj hotel and take your pick of fantastic restaurants  
P => Good location but an international hotel This hotel is a very good standby for New Delhi  By far its best attraction is its location  It is in New Delhi so good wide streets next door to Khan ket not a ket but a small area of good standard shops and close to Lodi Gardens if you wanted a stroll  Also close to some good restaurants if you dont want to eat in the hotel We stayed in heritage hotels for the rest of our stay so this hotel was never going to stand up by comparison  It is more of a business hotel  The rooms had no character but were big and clean  The breakfast was very average service good but the food is not of the high quality we experienced the rest of our time in India  In conclusion there was nothing wrong with the hotel but it just wont be one of the highlights of your trip  If you do stay the Chick Inn about a  minute walk is well worth the effort  It was recommended to us by our guide  Apart from us the rest of the people in there were Indians which was good testimony  The walk to the place is mostly on main roads and we felt very safe  Try the garlic bread  
P => Quirky Hotel I received a lovely welcome after arriving exhausted into Delhi  This level of warmth professionalism was shown by all staff thoughout my stay  The internal restaurants were great too   very quirky   bordering in kitsch but very humourous too  The location was great rooms good size and it was great to go for a walk in the nearby park in the mornings before the heat of the day  A little dated but that adds to the charm 
P => Very good hotel by Indian standards though This would probably be an overpriced just average hotel somewhere else but in Delhi this is actually a good choice if you get the discount rate booking through the Internet Service at the hotel is good with plenty of attentive staff everywhere  Rooms are not modern but they are large and comfortable  Some of them are being slowly reated I had a  LCD TV in my room while some coleagues got an old   Toiletteries and fresh fruits in your room are reated dayly  Food at the hotel is ok but the hotel being just a block away from the Khan ket allows you to avoid the ridiculous prices of the restaurants and eat at an expensive again by Indian standards but safe and tasty place like quotThe Big Chillquot    great food and desserts at half the price The low points   Pool Small sometimes bad smelling plus you have to go through a restaurant to get there   Wi Fi I think its ok to charge this service but US  per hour seems a bit too much  Same with calls just use the payphone at the shop next to the hotel  
P => Enjoyed the tranquillty of the hotel Despite what others have written I really enjoyed this hotel  I have stayed at many of the other   star hotels in India and although this hotel is a bit older than some of the other hotels I actually liked the charm and enjoyed the convenience of the location  The staff was great  The accomodations although not extravagent were comfortable  The dining area was quaint and made me a feel a bit more at quothomequot than a lot of the other big chain hotel  
P => Ambassador a o delight My superior room was huge comfortable and included immaculate bedding and fresh flowers  The hotel is a small  quiet gem with staff who truly care  An oasis from the chaos of Delhi steps from Khan ket good shopping  Stayed there twice on recent trip and felt a tug when leaving  Well stocked mini bar with reasonable prices and also a small tuck shop at the edge of the building  Excellent breakfast at the Yellow Brick Road was included in my room package If you begin or end your India visit in Delhi the Ambassador will add to the fascination  If it wasnt half a world away I would return just for the enjoyment of the hotel  
P => Ripoff After staying at some of the best Taj properties all over India this one just stinks in comparison  We went during high season butstill paying  for a dinky little room with peeling paint moldy bathroom with broken tiles and ancient fixtures is just one huge ripoff I cant figure out at all how this even qualifies as a Taj hotel The restaurants there are pretty good but for my money Id stay elsewhere and just come here for a meal  
P => HUGE Rooms    Pleasant Stay    This was the first hotel we stayed in when we were in Delhi  The lobby is nice and the staff was fine  The rooms are absolutely enormous  We had a balcony and sitting area  We had  in our group so three rooms  Some of the rooms even had a flat plasma screen TV in their rooms  The bathrooms are enormous too  THey didnt have the quotextra amenitiesquot like a robe or slippers but it was very comfortable  The bed was very soft and comfortable  Breakfast was included and it was very good    buffet style with eggs that you can be ordered arately  We had dinner there as well  It wasnt the best but they did have a lot of variety and it wasnt that expensive especially for a hotel  Overall it was a nice hotel but not over the top in service  If you want space this is a great choice  
P => Great location  
P => Very pleasant excellent location  
P => average but ok for delhi  
P => Great location lovely hotel  
P => Quaint with Quality  
P => Quality BusinessTourist Hotel  
P => Overpriced  
P => Overpriced poor rooms great people  
P => 
P => You get what you pay for  The location is convenient and provides a real experience of Old Delhi  The staff were helpful and a free transfer was arranged from the airport The hotel is very basic  The room was clean but damp and had most things promised including air conditioning and a television no hot water though The roof top restaurant is not too pretty to look at but the food was good great value and with friendly service   it s open hrs which was a very nice am arrival welcome We used Ananda Hotel as a base for exploring Delhi independently   we didn t spend much time at the hotel and we didn t use the expensive hotel travel agent Bearing in mind the price and facilities I think this hotel is good value and an acceptable budget traveller choice   at the time of booking the rate was half that of other hotels in The Connht Place area of Delhi  
P => Nice small hotel with friendly staff Located in Karol Baghthis hotel was in a good jumping off point  The staff assisted me with arrangements for my trips to Agra Jaipur and Haridwar  I found the room to be clean and attractive and theprice was more than right  
P => Nice hotel near shopping area  Nice clean hotel near the shopping streets of Karol Bagh The staff were helpful and the hotel had a car and driver that we hired for daytrips and airport pick updropp off  Only  minutes walk to the busy ket streets were we did the most of our shopping  
P => cheater and careless staff  I booked it after surfing trip advisor but quit disappointed  I don t know if these happen with me or the good review written are wrong  No pick up upon arrival staff sleeping and can ask you for a  VOUCHER  to print at  A M  when you are so tired  Then how you in a dirty room I forget what cleanliness means here it was stained towel smelling toilet and mosquitoes around the room  Anyways this comes to an end when I was checking out in the morning  Above all before the final and to my misery an extra   of the agreed room rent on the net rate inclusive of taxes as to come was changed  Hotel is not for Europeans or people who prefer clean place to sleep  
P => Terrible hotel for tourists  If youre a tourist read this review I booked three rooms at Ananda after reading some of the positive reviews the hotel has received  If youre visiting India from another country PLEASE read this review as I hope I can help you avoid an experience that we unfortunately had to go through  I cannot understand why Ananda is rated so highly  One possible explanation many of the reviewers seem to be Indian business travelers who have a completely different set of expectations and needs  In any case dont stay at this hotel  You will undoubtedly be tempted by the price which is admittedly low  But there are a TON of other cheap options in Delhi Delhi is not an expensive city The rooms themselves are comfortable enough  But the rest of the hotel has a shabby bombed out appearance  The rooftop is disgusting and left me with a lasting depressing image of Delhi The location of the hotel is terrible  Karol Bagh is full of shady characters  A routine walk around the neighborhood left me worried about getting mugged didnt feel that way ANYWHERE else in India  Spend the extra money and stay closer to Connht Place  You wont regret it Finally and this is the most important part DO NOT USE THEIR TRAVELTRANSPORTATION SERVICES The hotel has partnered with scamming traveltransportation companies that will try and try and try again to rip you off  The story is a long one  Suffice it to say that we were quoted a price which we agreed to  The drivers repeatedly tried to take us to places where theyd get a commission and they got angry when we asked them politely to just take us where we wanted to go  At the end of the night they demanded that we pay them triple the agreed upon price  We obviously refused and they proceeded to berate us  Hotel management did not intercede on our behalf despite admitting at one point that the company is quotfull of crooks quotAll in all this hotel was the WORST of any we stayed in during our trip  Avoid  Please  
P => Good Hotel I stayed there for one week  The location was excellent  Nearby shoping places and crowd put extra value  Room was clean more importantly bathroom was clean Breakfast is sufficient and good nd Floor Wi Fi was best but during my stay at st Floor It was dissapointing Staffs were friendly and cooperative  
P => Delightful Such a dimaond in the rough  The staff at Ananda was amazing  incredibly helpful and attentive  The rooms were small but very clean and comfortable  Free internet and an damn good breakfast included  Incredible value  
P => cheated by staff Hotel itself is good and located near the ket but staff was the cheater  Beaware from staff tricks for making extra money from the customer by selling expensive tours  I am very depressed from the hotel staff and never recommended to others  
P => worst experience there After stayed there and other parts of India I faced worst experience in this hotel  Staff was unprofessional and misbehave with the customers  When I said them to arrange a car for same day agra tour they quote me the price  usd for both of us which not include the entrace fees and the same tour I booked from the nearby travel agency in just  usd   food is so so  
P => great location great staff great price As a solo traveller all the way from London i was slightly nervous about about staying in a hotel in Delhi that is more at the quotbudgetquot end of the scale but i have to say those worries went as soon as i stepped in the front doors The staff were amazing incredibly helpful friendly treated me like royalty and really made the holiday for me they helped getting sim cards currency exchange and organised trips for me nothing was too much trouble The rooms are simple but very clean comfortable and more than worth the money i paid per night for them i stayed  nights wish it could have been more thank you ananda          Highly recommended            
P => Relatively clean and quiet Im visiting India for a month and stayed here for  night on a short unexpected work trip from Jaipur to Delhi  I had originally wanted to stay in the Ginger hotel but the Ananda was the only available space i found  The reviews looked good and the price was fine so my boyfriend and I took a deluxe room which they gave us for a lower price than stated on the website  The rooms power went on when you put the key in a slot so it was a bit hot at first but the loud a c  cooled it nicely and the room and bathroom were large and sanitized  I appreciated the western toilet for a change  The shower was cold but after a hot day I didnt mind  The room was fairly clean with some ks on the bed sheets that were bearable small black ks that looked like ink  The under sheet was not fastened to the mattress and slipped a bit  The area of karol bargh is fun to explore the kets but far from most sights  Rickshaws are available right away though  I had a very sensitive stomach and ate some raita and naan from the hotel kitchen and it was tasty and clean  Good free wi fi also  The nearby temple bells can wake you early in the morning but the hotel was basically empty the people working there were efficient and nice and the room felt comfortably clean and simple despite the slightly ked bedsheets and slightly grey towels  In India and Delhi in particular it is a good find for a reliable place to spend a night  
P => Better than first glimpse but nothing great Ok  First of all the hotel is fine  You can stay here and visit New Delhi its close to the metro station Krol Bagh and about  minutes from Connht Place by  wheel taxi which will cost you  rupees on a bad day and  if you persist a little  The hotel is not dirty but not too clean either lets say a bit dingy  My first reaction when I arrived from the airport was that the website sure looked good and the reality was about  notches lower  This area has a busy ket and also the immediate streets around the hotel are NOT illuminated at night which made me a little nervous coming back at night  I dont know if robberies happen in the area for sure but I stayed  nights in this hotel and remember seeing a police man taking a statement from a couple of foreign travelers about some kind of incident at least twice during that week  The ket that is nearby is interesting but most of what you see you could find at home too as it is a busy ket area from about am the noise in the street would wake me up so I tried to go to sleep early  Also the hotel is a bit of a construction site they are installing an elevator but looks like progress is slow for the moment there are only stairs  They offer breakfast on the rooftop which to me sounded fabulous but the rooftop as well is another construction site with piles of debris and bricks and piping and cement and who knows what else  On the rooftop they also have the quotrestaurantquot which in reality is a kind of open air lean to  After my first breakfast on the rooftop I never returned theres other places nearby that offer good and reasonable breakfast options As for the room the AC was great  I would return late afternoon each day soaked in perspiration and immediately enter the room turn on the AC and jump in the shower  One reason was because I never experienced hot water in the hotel  Just cold and less cold so coming in from the street was the best moment to shower  As for the towels they are supposed to be white each day I had three in my room and would examine each one one by one to look for the less stained and almost clean towel  Usually I could find one that was acceptable The worse part of the visit to Ananda Hotel was the checkout  They had offered me a rate of  rupees per night for a deluxe room  But at checkout they wanted to charge me  rupees  Luckily I had the email confirming the rate with me  Also the gentleman at the counter tried to tell me I had stayed  nights so we counted the nights together on our fingers  times until he finally realized that it was just  nights  I had ordered a taxi through the hotel to take me to the airport at a cost of  rupees  Not one block from the hotel the taxi broke down  I jumped out at started to flag another one  It was the most jarring uncomfortable ride I had had in India I think a  wheeler would have been better  Best thing about this hotel is the free wifi internet  
P => Relaxing stay at Ananda Hotel Our booking via venere com was successful at the first try The staff was very friendly amp helpful and the rooms were clean although the elevator was being exchanged we didnt hear it in our rooms The location is not at the centre but very easy reachable via tuck tuck etc  The Jessa Ram Hospital Karol Bagh is known and the hotel is m away from it It was really a nice stay at Ananda an we can recommend it  
P => A cool and quiet Place for Business People in the Bustling ket of Karol Bagh I was very happy with the hospitality and the room service and the kind of privacy they offered to me   Since I was traveling for business purpose I had to say the staff was very cordial with my clients also they never objected the continuous arrivals of my client   And the plus point is the parking  there are ample of parking place and as every one knows Karol Bagh is a crowded place so a good parking is an exception   I would definitlely recommend this hotel for business people it offers great value for money   
P => Clean great food and friendlyhelpful staff I had read quite a few reviews on various hotels in Delhi and I ided to opt for this one as all in all the reviews appeared extremely positive  Also price wise it was one of the more cheaper options  Much to my friends and my own delight it lived up to its review reputation as a clean hotel with extremely friendly staff  As promised the taxi was waiting for us at the airport free of charge and I have to say the quality of the food in the restaurant was very impressive  It just so happened that one of the managers was also a tour agent which makes for a great selling point in the hotel but in all honestly when you are on a tight timeline it genuinely did make things a whole lot easier  
P => Ananda is an oasis Ananda was an oasis in the middle of the bustling city and some of the things I was grateful for included courteous highly professional staff an impeccably clean bathroom with steaming hot water and internet access  The lobby and room had a distinctive sense of style and I enjoyed my stay in the Ananda  
P => Excellent service great value highly recommend this hotel My experience at the Hotel Ananda was exceptional  The service was outstanding   the hotel arranged for an airport pick up the staff was so friendly and helpful and anytime that I needed anything they were more than willing to help  The room was clean and comfortable and was at a great price  The hotel even has Wi fiI really just cant say enough about the staff at the hotel  It was like being among family and I definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Clean simple and friendly Rooms are not luxurious but definitely more than basic good bed spacious bathroom and clean  I stayed two nights both nights I had warm water and the air conditioning was working well  As requested the hotel had arranged airport pick up complimentary  The staff was very helpful and friendly  The location is good not too much traffic easy ride with the tuk tuk to the  centre  and the metro station around the corner  If you don t mind breakfast in bed there is no breakfast room so breakfast is served in the room at the time requested and are looking for a friendly and clean place to stay this hotel offers good value for money especially in Delhi  
P => fantastic stay in ananda hotel ananda is a newly built hotel as it seems to with all new amenities All latest facilities like wi fi  hours hot water courteous staff hours food facility we had our personal function in Delhi so I booked this hotel for my relatives and friends  who came from all over India and they enjoyed a lot thats what reviews I got from my relatives So i can say its a place worth staying and spending my hard earnest money Money wise also it was cheap and best my best wishes for all Ananda staff Thanks 
P => Friendly and relaxed environment I was visiting India with my family and wanted a clean and reasonably priced hotel  This was the first visit to India for my wife and  kids and therefore wanted a trouble free hotel which can cater for all our needs  I could not have asked for any more  The location is good about  minutes from the Airport and  minutes from New Delhi Railway Station by car  The rooms were clean and spacious  We had a suite room and a deluxe room Staff were very friendly and helpful  They had a computer in reception which the kids were allowed to use Room service was good and prompt For our stay in Delhi we had hired a driver and therefore did not use the public transport nearby If travelling to this hotel you should mention the landk of the hospital in the hotels address  
P => a quiet clean place in the buzzing capital of india i stayed in the ananda hotel for  days as i have been traveling through india a lot i know what most of the hotels are like but i was surprised with this one  i enjoyed my stay the rooms are very cleanbig and comfortable nice bathtube and big windows the staff was very friendly and the service excellent the hotel is situated in one of delhis shopping areas karol bagh and the metro station is just walking distance i was very happy with the hotel and recommend anybody who travels to india to have a look at hotel enjoy your trip to india its an amazing place  
P => 
P => Good hotel for an overnight stop We spent two arate nights at this hotel as part of our tour of India As others have said it is heavily used by and geared to tour groups There are a lot of arrivals and departures in the night and early morning which  be disturbing to individual travellers This is a good hotel though  Our room was pleasant and the bathroom clean  The food was good and the service very friendly and welcoming except at the front desk where staff were a little abrupt The gardens are very well maintained quiet and peaceful  On our second visit our enjoyment of them was increased by the beautiful orations and fairy lights for a wedding reception to be held that evening We would not hesitate to return for an overnight stay  
P => Old but comfortable On a five star scale rating this hotel would qualify as a high end  star hotel  Its an older resort style hotel but has few amenities  The building and the grounds are surrounded by a tall wall which is what erates the front of the building from the busy street  We stayed in a room facing away from the street and did not have any complaints about the noise  The bathrooms were clean and so were the linenes  There are nice big flat panel televesions with tons of local cables and news stations to watch  The grounds are manicured and well kept and the pool was clean  Since it was the winter season when we were there we opted not to go for a swim but the pool itself seemed nice  The gym is a bit cramped and dark and equipment seriously out of date but if you are just looking for descent cardio equipment it should get the job done  The breakfast served was minimal but all you can eat  Overall our stay was pleasant and would consider staying again  
P => Total Rip Off This is one of the nicer hotels in Delhi and is conveniently located quite near both the domestic and international airport  While the rate on the asiarooms website was fantastic guests should be warned that this hotel charges astronomical rates for its taxi service so this certainly would not suit the budget traveller  Where the pre paid taxi from the international airport to the hotel charged  rupees the hotel then charged  rupees plus tax for their own taxi service back  This is more in line with what one would expect to pay in Europe for the same distance  However the taxi service was very timely and efficient Food and drinks are also very expensive here  Where a bottle of water would only cost  rupees elsewhere this hotel charges about  rupees working out at about     The quality of the food in the restaurant is substandard for India  Dinner consists of a self service buffet of food which has been sitting for hours heating in a bamberree and breakfast is the same  Very disappointing  The dinner works out at three times the cost that you would pay for a lovely dinner served in a good quality restaurant in other parts of Delhi  As this hotel is quite a bit outside the main centre of Delhi it is not a good location for anyone who is interested in using it as their main base for sightseeing  I would recommend flagging a rickshaw from the main road up from the hotel to the city centre which should cost about  rupees insist on the meter being used Expense aside the hotel is very clean and the grounds are beautiful  It is a very relaxing place to unwind after the hustle and bustle of downtown Delhi  The pool is lovely too The hotel is fine for a one night stopover to get to the airport  Bring plenty of money 
P =>  Welcome to our beautiful hotel  Now pay up  We stayed at this hotel in il  The positive aspects arethe staff is very polite Addtionally the Ashok is very beautiful and at least when we were there quiet It also has a lovely pool despite the smell of sewage in the air at times I wonder what they water the plants withAlthough the rooms certainly aren t  star standards by any stretch of the imagination no hot water when we were there they were comfortable had soft beds and large cable plasma TV s   All this aside however The hotel is overpriced and its directorial policy   greedy The rates changed when we were there they went lower because we were there at the end of the high season but they still charged us for the higher rate quoted in our e mails   During our entire stay it felt as though the Hotel was only trying to get as much money out of us as possible In the  hours we were there we paid a very expensive day rate as well as our overnight stay not once were we offered as much as a complimentary glass of water  Instead the guests are charged  times the normal price compared to anywhere else in India  It just made us feel a little taken advantage of since the hotel is in the middle of nowhere And it was hot  Furthermore just to use the internet the price is almost  times that of other hotels in India and the minimum charge was only for an hourly rate not half hour  At every turn one feels that the hotel is doing any little connivance to get as much money out of the guest as possible  Finally on check out the desk manager sent a boy to look at our mini bar in case we were being dishonest with our laration  It was a bit insulting especially since we had been so courteous to everyone at the hotel All kidding aside we spent over  rupees in the hotel for one overnight stay a day rate and a modest dinner  We certainly werent about to rip off a bag of potato chips I think these practices are put into effect because the hotel is really an establishment for tour guests being offloaded by buses who are there for a short time  For privately booked couples however spending some time in the hotel one feels pretty targeted  Even the restaurant upstairs was the only one in India in the  and half weeks we were there which added an additional tax in an attempt to make the prices on the menu seem lower than they were Plus the lights are on full during dinner so it is anything but cozy despite the fine d cor I mentioned a lot of this to the manager and informed him that had things been done differently we would have eaten dinner there instead of at the airport on departure  He thanked my for my honesty something which was commendable and admitted that he had heard some of this before  The pictures look great but the hotel doesnt exhibit much class despite how beautiful it looks or what its prices are A hotel with class does not send a boy to double check the mini bar right in front of its guestsA hotel with class which is secluded should not over  charge  times the normal price for water which is a necessity  not a luxury despite its affordability  It leaves one with a bad feeling Should you stay there Well it is comfortable enough just don t expect to be treated as anything more than a pay check  
P => Poor Value We husband wife and teenage dhter stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for one night only   fortunately  Probably the poorest value for money place we stayed in during our two week holiday in Rajasthan Agra and Delhi  Given the relatively high rates Id rate the resort as below average at best  
P => No Complaints The Ashok is basically a transit hotel used by holiday companies to accommodate travellers for one or two nights on their way in and out of India  It is set in tidy and secure grounds a short ride from the airport  During my stay I found the hotel staff to be polite and helpful  The food at both breakfast and dinner was extremely nice although service was sometimes a little disorganised  The first floor rooms in the hotel are rather dark and dismal and in need of some refurbishment  The ground floor rooms are a lot nicer cleaner and more modern  The pool area looked very nice  Reception changed cash Euros for us quickly and easily at a reasonably good rate and gave us a proper receipt for the transaction  If you want to do online check in for your return flight the hotel has a single computer in reception that you can use  The internet connection is very slow  
P => cold hotel with nice garden The homepage of the Ashok Country Resort promises more than the hotel can provide  The garden is very nice but it isnt calm because of the traffic outside  It looks so nice from outside and in the lobby  But the room was not very clean and the beds were clammy  The room were also cold the small heater did his best but this wasnt enough  The food in the restaurant is everage the breakfast small  I was really disappointed  
P => Good for being close to the Airport Great hotel very close to Delhi International airport ideal for a  night stay before an early flight The large pool area is relaxing and they served a good and varied snack menu since we didn t want to wait until the main restaurant opened at pm  This is a buffet style restaurant fine if you are hungry enough but not for light meals Whilst I was relaxing on my sunbed it started to rain  There was a flurry of activity and the next minute I had  staff surrounding me putting up a huge gazebo  A bit embarrassing to lie in the middle of it all going on but it saved me having to go indoors The bedroom was quite small but functional with a nice view over the garden 
P => Convenient Hotel for Airport and a Great Escape After a week in Inida experiencing the Rajasthan and Agra this hotel was a very welcome rest away from the hustle and bustle prior to leaving Delhi We turned up on spec and were presented with a good room at a reasonable rate    The well manicured gardens and the relaxed bar and restaurant were just what we needed The hotel arranged our airport drop off and wake up call for am very efficiently In sumy a good place to stay if youre flying the next day or wish to get away from the crowds  
P => enchanting lovely grounds we arrived at this hotel on a kuoni golden triangle tour upon initial impressions i was captivated by the gorgeous well kept gardens and the lovelly swimming pool it is a tranquil retreat after say a day of the hustle and bustle of old dehli please note if you drink wine the price is astronomical staff friendly but we encoutered a problem when they tried to charge us for our transfer to the airport which was sorted through kuonibut you expect these tryu ons in india food was good i loved the omletts at breakfast the rooms were very well orated so overall this is a lovely hotel with truly lovely gardens 
P => Convenient Stayed here as part of the Kuoni Taj Tour  Although the hotel is on the outskirts of Delhi it is a great escape from the city and after full dys of sightseeing it was great to be in such a calm place The pool was nice and the grounds were really well kept  I can see why they chose this hotel for us  Due to the location the hotel is the main option for food unless you get a taxi  However the food here was good  We were generally pleased with this hotel  
P => Convenient for the airport Like the previous entry we stayed at the Ashok at the beginning and end of the Kuoni quotTaj Tourquot  It was conveniently situated for the airport but a longish taxi ride from downtown Dehli  The rooms were clean and comfortable although some of our group reported that their room smelt musty  The pool was pleasant and the staff were fine  The buffet breakfast had a mix of Western and Indian food and was satisfactory  We had no complaints about the hotel or staff and it was particularly convenient for the airport only about  minutes away  However it was too far out from Dehli we would have preferred to be closer  Also there wasnt any other restaurants nearby so we had to eat in the hotel  The dinner buffet wasnt really very good and it was relatively expensive for India We got a taxi into Dehli two evenings and went to the sound and light show at the Fort which was enjoyable I wouldnt particularly recommend this hotel but if it is part of your trip then it will be fine after all holidays are often what you make them  I certainly didnt find it as bad as some of the other reviewers have suggested  Happy to give further details if required  
P => Handy for the airport We stayed at the Ashok at the beginning and end of the Kuoni quotTaj Tourquot  It was conveniently situated for the airport but a longish taxi ride from downtown Dehli  The rooms were pleasantly orated clean and comfortable  The pool was lovely and very nice to sit beside with a cold beer  We enjoyed the buffet breakfasts which had a mix of Western and Indian food  We had no complaints about the hotel or staff and would recommend it as a useful stopping point going to or from the airport  We phoned for a radio cab to take us to the Sound and Light at the Red Fort well worth seeing and found this a convenient and not too expensive way of getting into town  
P => Not a bad transit hotel Not bad as a transit hotel for  night but wouldnt stay any longer than that  Stuck out in the suburbs with nothing in the general vicinity   mins from the airport Must request a quiet room as this hotel is located right next to a busy road what is it with the locals and their need to blast their horn at every living thing they pass regardless of the time of nightHad a noisy room st stay and  days later had a quiet one   miles better  ent size though aircon pretty forlorn and controls didnt seem to work  Clean and tidy Breakfast and dinner buffet OK  Meagre supplies in the bathroom and shower never passed lukewarm on either stay  Plasma TV didn turn it on  Nice garden pool looks OK little shop is rubbish  Free safety deposit box on reception Had to leave at  am and got wake up call at  am found reception fully staffed but werent offered teacoffee until rep arrived and asked why Popular transit hotel and I think rooms can be hired for  daynight  Guests coming and going at all hours and somewhat selfishly they make no attempt to avoid disturbing everyone else within a  room vicinity  Perhaps some QUIET PLEASE notices might be in order Id stay there again if I needed a stopover but not for a proper holiday   too far away from the centre of Delhi kms I think in the rushhour traffic that distance takes forever  
P => Stay only if your objective is proximity to the airport The positives were the food in the restaurant quite good and the pretty grounds including the pool and resident peahen  Somehow they managed to have green grass and trees in spite of the pollution The negatives were the room and the dust inside  The public computer in the foyer was filthy with grime and dust  The pollution in the area near the hotelairport is horrendous and it seems a losing battle at this hotel  Although I had been in India a week the air quality really bothered me here and not elsewhere The room was the bare essentials  It reminded me of Eastern Europe in the s I had a lot of time to kill at this hotel before my flight and there really wasnt anything to do  The gift shop was not enticing  The hotel is not easily accessible to sights  
P => an oasis in the culture shock thats delhi this is a very nice hotel the rooms are clean and large it was cold so the staff put heaters in the rooms the bathroom was a little old but clean all the same  the only problem was that they only put the hot water on at certain times of the day so its either cold or tepid showers overall a nice place 
P => Ok for a quick stay but only OK Stayed here on our first night in India on Voyages es Verne Golden Triangle tour  The hotel chosen I suspect because of its proximity to the airport  When we arrived Delhi was very smoggy and that atmosphere pervaded the hotel  Our room smelt very smoky but that could have been because of the terrible air in Dehli city  I couldnt help worrying about the athletes coming here for the Commonwealth Games I hope they clean up their air quality before then Anyway back back to the hotel   the room was adequate but beds really uncomfortable  The bathroom was OK and other facilities in the hotel were rather limited  There is a small bar and a small restaurant area  Breakfast had an interesting variety of foods  The cooked omlettes looked great and there were good yogarts fruits and cakes  There was also an assortment of curry based dishes and other cooked things too  In short this hotel is OK to use as a base but dont expect to really enjoy the ambiance  The motorrway is very close and somewhat noisy during the night but all in all this hotel was a convenient stop over en route to more exciting places  
P => better then rest on airport I stayed there because It was near the aiport where I arrived at midnight and had a flight leaving next day at eight My first iimpression from the room was quit good exspected it worser for  rupees  But the shower didnt work  bath did And it was very noiscy  Its located near the highway and even in the middle of the night the noice was dusturbing It was very near the airport  The hotel taxi was parked  minutes walk away and with paying the carpark it took  minutes before we arrived at the hotel  My flight was delayed ended up staying for  hours a good advise for whn you tay shortly ask or you can nagociate the price  
P => India that works  am is not a good time to arrive anywhere for sure not India  The hotel provides an well signed adequate and reliable transfer for IGI Airport to hotel transfer time  mins  The rooms are big clean and fairly comfortable  Feeding arrangements are good but beware hordes of French groups on tour and Kazak aircrews on layover  A good feature is the attractive garden with good swimming pool plus a slightly under standard gym When you re book dont believe the Front Office staff when they say you are re booked get it in writing A short stay helps us to prepare for the assault on the senses which India is about to bring  
P => A welcome return to the st century after eight nights in heritage hotels Privately owned and operated this full service hotel is located between city and airport and caters to Indian businessmen and European tour groups  Upon arrival one can not help but be impressed by the beautiful ble floor and stair case of the two story lobby with its massive crystal chandelier  The owners son sits on a desk in the lobby and is very accommodating as is the staff  Our ground level well lit spacious room was very nicely furnished and the king size bed with a comfortable soft mattress cushy sheets and pillows sported mirrored headboards  A desk mini bar over stuffed chairs glass top table TV phone Wi Fi Internet connection quiet AC teacoffee making pot and supplieslarge closet and Indian area rug made for a comfortable stay  The bathroom with floor to ceiling granite tiles was stocked with ample towels and a standard assortment of toiletries incl Kleenex  Sink and shower chrome fixtures bear witness of years of scrubbing  All was spotlessly clean yet the grouting in the tubwall joint was somewhat unsightly  A window onto a garden corner promised a quiet night but that was not to be  Two European tour groups partied boisterously in two rooms with doors open near us until way past midnight while awaiting their transfer to the airport  Equally staff dealing with their luggage carried on loud conversations and did not be concerned with quietness The ble floors made the long hallway into an echo chamber A large clean pool in the vast manicured gardens invited for a cooling swim  A well stocked gym gift shop lobby lounge with giant screen TV and the upstairs restaurant with a very pleasing ambiance rounded out the facility  Indian Chinese and Continental food was offered buffet style and a la carte and it was very good as was the breakfast All in all were it not for the racket during the night I would recommend this hotel to anyone  
P => ashok country resort as hotel rates go in delhithis is a real surprisewe paid    per room per nightand that included bfast and airport pickup and drop Hotel is in a quiet location near the airportrooms are big and comfortablestaff are polite and nvery helpfulfood is not bad either swimming pool is clean and big in sizegardens are well kept Only minus points are  no live entertainment very basic shop  can get crowdedas this hotel is used by travel agenciesas a Delhi transit hotel  
P => Excellent calm in the storm We stayed here two nights in late ch   An excellent hotel I worried at first because we didn t see the hotel s driver at the Delhi airport anywhere in the crowd holding a sign with my name on it  When I took a second walk through the area though he was there and helped us with our bags led us to the hotel s shiny new SUV and drove us safely to the resort  The room was clean and spacious and staff was helpful and polite  Breakfast buffet was good and lunch was excellent in the resort s restaurant  The well maintained grounds with lots of flowers a treat for us having come from a long Alaska winter a pool and benches gave us the breathing space we needed after a long flight  The entire resort is fenced off and so it feels insulated from the hubbub and traffic  Its small shop sold high quality souvenirs and clothing  They let us take the salwar tops back to our room to try them on  Checked my email in the lobby bought bottled water to take with us on our next leg  hour drive to Nainital and had them book us a room for our return through Delhi at another hotel as Ashok Country Resort was booked Hotel Deeks nearby  Their recommendation for that hotel turned out to be fine  I highly recommend Ashok Country Resort 
P => small but ok Stayed here on st and th day of the Kuoni Taj Tour  Its mainly clean everything worked in the bedroom although we had a very noisy fridge  The bathroom looked a bit tired and had a very mouldy shower curtain The bar area is very small and there is not much of a sitting area  The restaurant was fine and the food good for both dinner and breakfast Nicest thing were the gardens with loads of flowers  Pool looked ok too Reception staff not the most helpful I have ever come accross though 
P => disappointing hotel We stayed at the Ashok Country Resort for the first and last night of our Golden Triangle tour and again for a final night after our extention to Shimla  The room we had for the first night was OK the second stay was not so nice but had a better view over the garden  It also had information about the Beauty Shop  had we known about it the first day we could have had a massage as the hotel is very isolated and there is absolutely NOTHING in the vicinity          we walked to the local village     took  minutes not  as reception told us   BIG mistake       The final night we paid a supplement for a quotClubquot room and it was the worst of the three     It did have a big plasma screen which only had one English language channel        we had only  tea bag and  sachet of coffee    the bathroom was grubby   the toilet very noisy and the strange smell was there too The food in the restaurant is mediocre during the day and in the evening but the buffet breakfast is not too bad  Because of its location there is no choice but to eat there The only good thing about it is the proximity to the airport     
P => disappointing This was the most disappointing hotel we stayed in in India   The room was not cleaned properly  smelt a bit damp  no information in room about hotel facilities  poor outlook onto courtyard  no hairdryer in the room  chipped paintwork and rather dreary breakfast  only redeeming features were friendly staff  nice grounds and near the airport suggest try elsewhere  the Radisson is also near the airport and far superior   
P => Nice room terrible restuarant Room was lovely with a large screen plasma Very clean  Far too expensive for what it was I paid    The grounds are very nice but the buffet restuarant is terrible The chicken I had was hardly cooked and they didnt really seem to care  Good for the airport and the atmosphere feels very relaxed  
P => A true Oasis This hotel is a top quality hotel The representative picked us up from the hotel with a placard carried in our luggage and gave us a warm welcome  The rooms are modern and beautifully orated  The pool is large and refreshing in the midst of hot Dehli  The restaurant is delicious a delicious indian breakfast buffet is included and there is a nice lounge area open  hours if you need some masala chai or a beer late at night  The internet access is fast but only one computer is available for guests  So you  have to wait for a turn  The hotel staff were all very friendly and they even agreed to hold one of our bags for us while we did our golden triangle tour  Finally the proximity to the airport makes it an easy place to stay at the beginning and end of your journey  The only downside is the distance to the city   it is about     minutes and costs about  by taxi  So it  not be the best place to stay for your entire journey if you plan to go in and out of Dehli everyday  Enjoy 
P => Ok but not for a second time We family two children of  and  stayed twice in this hotel one night at arrival from the airport and flying the other day and a second time two nights to see Delhi before we left India to go home  The hotel is comfortable near the both airports nice when you arrive in the middle of the night and need sleep  What you see in brochures and on internet you also see in reality  It is a green surrounding with lovely green lawns and palm trees  The rooms have a good size on the bathrooms you see the complex is older but we have no complaints about it The restaurant is moderate  The first time the breakfast was very poor because there were hardly any guests  The second time when there were some groups it was sufficient  When having dinner you are offered the buffet  You have to ask to eat   la carte  It looks like the policy of the hotel is to promote the buffet Although it looks like we enjoyed the stay in this hotel I wouldnt recommend it  You get what you see in the brochures but what I didnt like was what you smell and feel in the hotel and in your room  When you enter the hotel and your room it smells odd  It smells like water that has been kept in a bottle for too long  Uncomfortable is that the bedding is humid  When I was lying in my bed it felt like the staff had forgotten to tumbledry the sheets  I have complained about it by housekeeping  Although they paid attention to it and renewed the bedding the next evening I had the same problem  It would be a good suggestion the staff dried the rooms if it is dry season in Delhi or check the airconditioningsystem  Normaly with airconditioning the complaint is that the air is to dry instead of too wet cel Braakman The Netherlands 
P => Nice hotel Stayed here for one night only as its convenient fot the airport and we were flying home next day  No complaints   helpful staff comfortable room and good food  The gardens are lovely and theres a ent pool  The man on reception rang through to an Indian friends mobile for us and refused to accept money for the call  These little things help  
P => Overpriced Fairly ent  star airport hotel  Seemed filled with tour groups  Rooms were good sized but had a distinctly mildew smell you noticed the second inside the door  Our room certainly could do with some fixing up and it looks like maintenance is not high on the hotel s list of priorities Wouldn t want to spend too many days at this hotel but for a transit airport hotel it does the job and would fill the niche of a  star airport hotel if only they would lower the room price by about a third  And on that note they also tried to overcharge us for the room until we showed them their email including the price  
P => No real complaints Stayed here twice for one night in different rooms during a tour with Kuoni  Overall the hotel is quite acceptable for a short stay and its only approx  minutes from the airport  The rooms were fairly well appointed for a medium class hotel the AC worked well though the beds were very firm we later found out that this is normal in Indian hotels  The restaurant served a buffet in the evening but there is a arate menu that the staff be werent keen for us to see but is there if you ask for it  Thought the buffet was OK think it cost about  rp approx   per head but you could eat as much as you liked and was a three course affair  On our second night my partner had Delhi belly though the rest of us seemed OK  We think it couldve been either the trifle or the custard served as one of the desserts  Theres also a pool in the well maintained gardens if you need to chill  I think the other reviews Ive read seem a little harsh and  be due to particular gripes but we didnt have any apart from the Delhi belly which affected at least some of the group at the various hotels we stayed at so we feel it deserves a little more positive feedback  Would stay there again but only thing to bear in mind is that its an hour by taxi to central Delhi but if like us your on a tour with prebooked hotels on you itinerary then there isnt much you can do about that  
P => proche de la roport mais loin de tout le reste

P => Old glory that has disappeared for ever I stayed at The Ashok for  nights at a business trip in the beginning of ember   What a disappointment  Old glory has gone and it will take a multimillion investment to ever get this back  The state of the hotel is miserable the only thing that has been restored is the entrance lobby  The room was middle sized and looked rather Ok but there is a big cleaning problem here  The floor was really dirty no way to walk bare foot here  Free wireless internet was available and it worked well but every  hours you had to return to the reception desk very long walk to get a new voucher  There is a problem with staff in general and the front desk staff in particular  They are not interested at all to give any service to their guests  Their only interest seems to be to get tipped As an example I was informed two times wrongly about meeting places because the staff just didn t care to look it up properly which resulted in two times a  minutes  walk to the wrong place The Ashok is a very big hotel in the diplomatic area of Delhi so the surroundings are nice  This is the only positive thing I can say about this hotel  Next time I definitively will look for another place to stay in Delhi  
P => Definetelly not a  star hotel I stayed in Ashok for  nights during a conference  The booking has been made by the organisers of the conference so I had no choice  Before visiting the hotel I read the reports n the tripadvisor and I was terrifiedUpon arrival I had some positive feelings because the lobby areas is really fine and the service I received in the front desk very good  Upon entry in my room the disappointment started  The big problem with the hotel has to do with the cleanliness  The hotel and particularly the rooms are dirty  The space of the rooms is fine the furnitures really old but OK but you can see everywhere that there is no proper cleaning  I tried the room service and although efficient it took about  minutes the food was of a fast food quality Staff was friendly and the wireless internet fast enough and free  In no case this is a  stars hotel but it is not terrible  
P => Good loaction average service I stayed in Ashok last month with my family for a brief holiday  The location is quite good almost midway between the city center and the airport  The staff was courteous but a bit lazy rooms were good but seemed a bit old as far as the upholstery is concerned  The bathrooms do need a lot of improvement and this was one negative factor of the place  The food was average and we preferred eating outside in the private restaurants situated within the building  The pricing was definitely on the higher side as compared to the services offered The place is undergoing some massive reation and i expect to have a better experience the next time I am in Delhi  
P => Cheapest Five star in delhi  expansive but moderate service Great expansive property in one of the best areas in Delhi Right in the heart of diplomatic enclave this hotel has seen its better days Still it is trying to modernize post privaitization and addition of Fbar and the host of events it hosts is propelling it forward Price is normally around k INR which makes it one of the cheapest if not the cheapest in Delhi Always full of foreigners mainly backpackers or organized trippers Indian bureaucrats and Indian airlines crew this is a nice value for money hotel During one stay i got a refurbished room which was a huge improvement over the previous ones  In room dining can easily be accomplished for  per person a steal Sagar ratna is a recommended restaurent  The pool isnt heated and the staff are servile and still retain the sycophantic outlook always on the lookout for tips in all stay if you want a five star at the cheapest rate in the best part of delhi  
P => Great Business Place Great LocationBest FoodGood Pool Good Business FacilitiesGreat House KeepingHelpful staff 
P => loved the disc this hotel is situated in a good location    and can say   its value for money 
P => Subject of an Emperor As an invited participant of an International Stakeholders consultationI was accommodated in The AshokChanakyapuriNew Delhi  An aristocratic name in the diplomatic enclave of the capital city raised our expectations to perhaps somewhat unreasonable limits There were major problems with the attitude and approach of the staff which started considering you as subjects of the royaltya subject Praja of MaharajaEmperor Ashok the moment they realized that for the second class guests everything is on the houseto be paid by the organizers Even an offer to utilize the services against a payment was looked in a dubious manner with not so polite insistence on submission of all the details of credit card etc I am sorry but even after a passage of more than  years I do not remeber a moment after the seesions which I enjoyed there though it could have been very easily done I still cherish the time spent at Hotel JaphuKohimaNagalandTajChikmaglurHotel OberoiCalcuttaHoliday InnGenvaHotel KigaliRwanda and Taj Colombo Sri Lanks etc  mainly beacuse of the welcoming and accomodating attitude of the respective staff  
P => Very good property no value for money The ashoka hotel is one of the grandest hotels in India built by the govrnment  The hotel has exceptional facilties   the gym and swimming pool is very good  The price is very high though for the qulity of service and good  The service is more govrnmentish with people wanting tips for even small work  The gym is one of the best in India and attracts the political class and sportsmen  The food is good and has signficant variety  I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to spend a short time in New Delhi and needs access to central delhi 
P => lousy place at a very high price This is a very lousy place with nothing great about it and comes with a very high tariff rates  Everything is very costly and rooms are not well maintained  the only exception is the its Restaurant Frontier which serves good food  
P => Nice but over priced good location near airport Good pick up at the airport nice room and grounds but over priced  
P => sad    Was my th stay at the hotel since  and sorry to state that its not getting better  Staying there as its the place of the conference I am attending so its just to avoid taking taxis on several occasions per day     Had booked and confirmed room with balcony though received room without  When referring back to the receptions staff be aware of the cashiers as greedy as the years before was informed that the rate is the same    Its by far overpriced and one has to greet the staff its not the staff greeting you     Meals at coffee shop are quotOKquot while the staff at coffee shop is at least trying to be friendly and fast     trying    The staff at business center tried to be of help and while services are really expensive none of the  mails I had send arrived      
P => What a view I and my wife were travelling to Delhi for romantic getaway  We wanted to experience some really good places amp things together We wanted to spend time in some good hotel so we could remember the stay as well as the places of stay  We had heard a lot about Hotel Ashok how magnificient it is and how velous the view from the hotel top looks We called up and booked a reservation for us  When we visited the hotel we were impressed by how huge it looks from outside and how well it was maintained  The reception was quite good  The wait at the checkin was not at all there and within few minutes we were escorted to our room by a bellboy The room was spectacular  It was well furnished and even the bathroom had ble tiled floor and huge mirrors  The room was spacious and had a very huge balcony  The Balcony was overlooking some gardens and playgrounds  THE VIEW FROM THE BALCONY WAS AWESOME  It gave us a very open view of the outside yet private from others  We loved it The restaurant in the basement was quite good  They have different types of restaurant serving different kinds of cuisines  We tried few of them and they were quite good food Coming to the cons As known before the hotel is slightly on an expensive note  It is not easy to use it as a regular getaway  We had our own transportation for most of the time and hence distance wasnt the matter but on a few occasion getting public transportation was not easy  However the hotel do have lot of Auto and Taxi guys waiting around and the doorman can help to get one for you Overall it is a great place and we really enjoyed it  
P => loved the ambience I heard a great deal of bad reviews before we left  The Ashok is a government owned hotel and hence does not have the massive private investment of the other in the diplomatic enclave  I was greeted in a friendly manner when I arrived am cant say Im to impressed with Delhi Airport staff were friendly and helpful throughout my stay  I am on the rd floor in a really nice room I have two beds to myself my room is cleaned and stocked daily  Everywhere I go I am saluted or bowed to the or is good the place is clean  A few things to watch for A few of the plug sockets have issues but for RS you can get a pretty good plug adaptor the food in the Coffee Shop is good enough nothing special and the Pika Chicken is awful dont try the chinese restaurant we ordered  plates of food and some rice and each dish got steadily worse the first was what looks like a plate of ears Chicken the second looked like a pile of rotting cat poo Beef and the third looked like a collection of arteries and viens Lamb   absolutley disgusting The rice wasnt bad though  Stay away from most of the food check out the Fusion bar the staff are great and really freindly  I would definatley come here again  
P => dont ever think about it OMG I dont know what kind of star it has definitely its not shining My husband and I went there for a medical convention we arrived late evening checked in and went straight to our room  voila smellybedcovers are dirty yellow stained pillow casescreeking wavy faux wood flooring and bathroom was filthy thanks heaven we brought our rubber slippers you cant walk inside without it haay the next morning we went to the convention and came to the hotel room late   Surprise room was smelled up with tobacco i was angry but my husband told me to keep my cool  the next day we let the cleaning man tidy up our room my husband was in the shower and me reading seated behind a desk  peeking once in a while to see if the man is doing his cleaning job properly  satisfied we gave him a big tip and closed the door  my husband went ahead to the convention and left me  while i was in the shower someone rang the doorbell thought it was my husband and might forget something i ran to the door since it has no observation hole asked loud quot sweetheart is that youquot  then that someone spoked indian that i dont understand and i said quotlaterquot with emphasis  after a shower i put on my clothes and was taking my time putting on my make up somebody rang the door again  the cleaning man gave me a basket of fruits and a bottle of coke and i said thank you and closed the door  rang the door again it was a man wearing black suit and said that my laundry will be delivered that same day i said thanks and closed the door  after i made myself up i headed to the door to go out but suddenly the phone rang thought it was my husband i picked it up and said quothello sweetheart helloo hello but the other line was just listening to my voice and all of a sudden i heard this voice of a woman moaning and in indian language lewd i placed the receiver down in a hurry and frozed wondering what was it who was it after several seconds the phone rang again i let it rang  times i answered it again with firm and loud voice quot dad is that you hellowho is this hellohello same thing happened again i banged the phone tremblingterrified  ran out the door and asked the cleaners who was the prank caller that made the lewd calls  i dont know if they understand me my gosh this is supposedly a five star hotel in their country is it or never after i complained i noticed that there are more securities all over the hotel holy cow weve been around the world and never encountered such a thing we will never go back to that place again before that thing happened the staffs look at you creepily as if they havent seen a woman before and outside of that hotel as well creeeepy rating BLACK STAR 
P => Value for Money Room rates in Delhi are surely overpriced as there is such a dearth of world class hotel accommodation  In such a scenario the Ashoka Hotel is one of the most reasonably priced  star accommodation available as it is still government owned The acommodation is good and the service even better  Though many years old the hotel has good rooms that are well appointed and reasonably big  Will surely use this hotel again  
P => Dirty buggy and ridiculously overpriced My husband and I stayed here for a conference at the end of ruary  Its a dump  Our room hadnt been vacuumed in ages there was hair everywhere and orange pits on the bathroom floor and our room and a colleagues had cockroaches  Were seasoned travelers and have stayed in dodgy places before but for night the conference rate we expected to at least be able to walk barefoot from shower to suitcase without accumulating someone elses hair and food on our feet  I dont know what the cleaning staff does there besides barge into your room to deliver unnecessary and unrequested items matches extra bottles of water when you already have three in the hope of getting a tip  In addition the elevators shorted out on us a couple of times and our electronic door key receiver thing took three or four tries to unlock  The consistently rude hotel staff gave me the key to someone elses room and then acted like Id done something sneaky to get it and they lectured my husband on the proper insertion of the key card when he tried to get a replacement for his non functional key  Conference meals were held in a courtyard area with thin carpeting laid over a mystery substrate that was apparently full of rocks  I saw many conference goers trip and spill their food  No great loss as the food sucked but dangerous all the same To top it all off the lobby is full of carpet and trinket shops so if you havent already grown sick of hearing quotmadam take a glance no need to buy just lookquot then youre sure to get your fill on your way to the elevators Try hard to stay away from the Ashok  
P => A Shoker Delhi is suffering from an accute hotel room shortage  The result is the Ashok at USD a night for an ordinary hotel room ordinary tired property with ordinary to below average service  The room is clean the bed comfortable and the water hot but for USD you want a little bang for your buck The fridge was faulty  TV reception unwatchable despite three visits by repairman  Mod cons like the quotwirelessquot internet served up a strength that redlined at least once a minute making transfers of longer documents virtually impossible again technicians could not help  Request for ice through room service no machine or alternative available on the executive floor was accompanied by high expectations for a tip and on one occassion unannounced entry when I left the door ajar accidently ie did not knock before entering Seriously there are some great hotels in Delhi I like The Park   The Ashok is not one of them 
P => Stay clear of the Ashok Overrpiced   London prices for poor quality rooms and miserable service  The lowest point was when the waiter in the lobby lounge wiped the tea cups with his finger and later washed our cups behind the desk with water from a mineral water bottle from which he was also drinking  The same waiter also had poured us two cups of tea then whisked the teapot away to finish the rest of the tea with his colleague  Do not stay there 
P => They issued the room to another guest  hr after I checked in I was shocked that someone opened my door after midnight and we found out that the hotel issued the same room to another guest I think that was an inexcusable error what kind of security is thatI booked for a Superior Room but was given a Standard Room instead  The room is qutie recently reated  The bathroom has no bathtub so the floor is wet after shower  There is not enough space to place toiletries too  The sound proofing is not good  I could hear TV noises from other rooms and the staff can be loud when they go around their duties along the corridor The breakfast buffet was ok your best bet is Indian food  The masala dosa was good  But no dosa on Sunday The best part of the hotel is its gym  Modern equipment with individual TV screen  The staff seemed to be more friendly towards the regular clum members though  
P => The good and the bad OK good things first The hotel has a an awesome architecture and presents the atmosphere of the historical New Delhi  The reception hall and the sheer size of the hotel is impressive The service is friendly and the restaurants are of good quality  The fitness and SPA area is really first class Latest equipment and qualified trainers For the rooms the experience is different I stayed in the th floor my room was obviously reated and had parquet floor and relatively new furniture  The cleanliness and hygiene however was beyond any acceptable standard and would not be accepted even in a roadside motel The bed was dirty and old curly hair from previous guests still present on the linen     eerrgg  The toilet was bearing week old traces of dried detergent fluid and the seat was spotted with different brownish colors  The shower handle just fell from its bearing upon touching and clear water only came after several liters of rusty brown water went down the drain  Obviously no room checks were made before renting it out to the next guest  On the following day the bed clothes were replacedso no hair anymore but then the linen had black greasy spots on it with doubtful origins  So I used towels as bedsheets  To sum up for a five star hotel unacceptable and overpriced  Hygiene and cleanliness were kill factors I do not accept this at  or  star hotels not to speak of a five star  As I said in the beginning the hotel has a good potential and facilities are worth five stars  If the management can cope with the housekeeping issues it will certainly get better ratings  For me however it was the last time that I stayed there  For this room rates you get other five star hotels in Delhi  
P => Lovely Hotel Im glad I didnt read these reviews beforehand  My husband and I stayed at the Ashok Hotel last weekend and we had a lovely time  We did not have reservations and when we inquired about rooms the receptionist upgraded us to the executive floor at regular rates  The room was clean with a view of the pool  The bed was soft and comfortable the room included many amenities and there was plasma tv  All the staff were accomadating and friendly  The food and drink at the restaurants were great and the pool and spa were beautiful  The executive lounge was nice and convenient breakfast was served just down the hall from us on the th floor  We are from Canada and I was not expecting to stay at such a nice place  It is an old hotel but that adds to the charm  It was beyond my expectations  The only reason I did not rate it above average was because of the price  It was expensive but a weekend in Delhi to see the Taj Mahal was worth it  
P => Trust these reviews   honest As a government owned hotel the service is about as bad as it gets  Hotel restaurants are pretty poor as well   I had to send back under cooked chicken and the fish got its revenge during the night  Was probably a great hotel  years ago but now rooms are shabby and run down  Do yourself a favour and stay away  
P => Very very disappointing Do youself a favor and trust all the negative comments about this hotel  Its definitely not value for money nor what is expected of its quotstarquot rating  I stayed two nights at the hotel and the first night was terrible  The room was muggy sheets were dirty and the bed was not even flat The telephone looked like it hadnt been wiped down in  years seriously no joke  I demanded a room switch which reception took forever to concede to so the second night I stayed in the newly reated ones the older crappier ones will be reated on soon but call ahead to see if its done bc it might take some time and they were better BUT my sheets had hair on it and the bathroom was not very clean  Rates for the reated rooms and the old crappy ones are the same If you have no choice but to stay here make sure you get the hotel to assign the new rooms to you  That said be prepared for reception to tell you the day that you arrive that those rooms are all taken and they give you one of the crap ones instead  
P => Not quite as disturbing as others say it is    but then again it is definitely not a good hotel either  I found it to be basic but ok  Then again if you think of how much you pay there it is quite a rip off  In Europe I would say this hotel is ok if you pay not more than  EUR a night for a room  Sure everything is a bit old there and some parts more run down than others but that is because their furniture is often made from wood and uses carpets where more modern hotels go with more practical furbishing  However staff was quite friendly room service quick and they have a nice outside pool and spa  Also the adct restaurants seemed to be alright  But like I said everything there is just alright which is not good enough for ca   EUR a night  I would probably go there again if my work sent me there but I would definitely not recommend this as a honeymoon location  It would be fairly disappointing  
P => Never Stay   Read This and see pictures you will know why Hotel Rooms were stinky  It was worst hotel I ever stayed in  I paid   INR  for  Night Hotel reception was ok but Rooms are dead I needed a hotel near US embassy so I unluckily chose this one  Embassy was walking distance  Room was so disgusting that I cant mention it     I dont have words     If I write something I am sure tripadvisor com would bann me    so I took pictures of the room  Which speak itself     Its like no comments     Just check it urself  Room BathRoom   Oh God it was like a  people used public toilet  Dirty like anything Have pictures of these as well Regarding Breakfast   It starts at  AM and I was very hungry at  AM so I landed at breakfast area at  AM nothing was ready on the serving table  I ate some toasts etc by  AM  by the time I was done  AM I saw they started putting lot of other new tasty stuff too  So dont go before  AM incase you want to enjoy everything Never ever stay in this hotel  
P => Terrible Terrible Terrible This hotel is definitely a place where you should not stay even if you had a gun pointed to your head  I did not have the privilege of booking into a hotel of choice as it s peak season but I did check this website ahead of my trip here  The reviews should have been warning enough as did the candid travelers pictures posted and the PICTURES DO NOT LIE  This hotel classifies itself as a  star DELUXE hotel and it probably was  years ago  The exterior looks charming because of the architecture very colonial but Indian at the same time  However the inside is a different story Firstly upon arrival at p m  there wasnt any porter service and that is quite strange for a  star deluxe  Whilst the lobby is clean it looks dated  The LCD TV at the lobby showed nice standard rooms in the TOWER block  I guess the tower block have the newly refurbished or recently cleaned and fumigated rooms as it appears a FAR CRY from the rooms that were assigned to us there were  of us and all  rooms were of similar dismal condition which really defeated the need to ask for a change of room  The key to the room weight at least one pound as it was solid metal and HUGE the red paint on the key had discolored in parts which tells you how old these are  Enough to knock anyone out if you threw it at him or her  You need to put the key into the key hole turn in clockwise and at the same time turn the doorknob anti clockwise before the door opens  The carpets in the corridor as well as in the room look as if it had never been changed for the  ades since the hotel was built  So old that where it has thined you can see beneath the carpets and the dust that accumulates there  Where the carpets are completely worn out a patch of new carpet is fitted on top  There are stains everywhere  Even on the bed sheets  The pillows are hard probably compacted from the years of useEverything in the bathroom that is metal has rusted  Cannot tell about the metal in the room since the lighting in the room is best suited for nurnal animals  The toilet seat had a wrapper around it that says  Disinfected for your safety  and I believe them Just wondering why they did not disinfect the rest of the room  The flush to the toilet is unique and is a knob that protrudes out of the wall  After turning it round and twisting it you actually need to use all of your strength to push it in before it flushes as the rust is quite advance  Underneath the dresser there are phone books that say  but look like  year old manuscripts  The furniture I don t even want to describe If by now you still do not have second thoughts of changing your accommodation be prepared for the live in guests that come FREE with the rooms since one night here costs USD  Cockroaches  These creatures were everywhere and in all  rooms that we had  They were in the cupboards on the water bottles supplied in the toilet and on the towels so bring your own  I did not see any on the bed but I would not discount it  I don t want to know if I had anything else sharing the bed with me shudder  One night at the Ashok was indeed an experience never to be repeated again  We checked out the next day Luckily for us we managed to get a room at another hotel  My advice Trust the reviews 
P => Noisy  My husband amp I were booked into the Ashok for many days by his company after another hotel in Delhi fell through  After changing rooms once the first had twin beds amp a damp carpet reeking of insecticides we wound up with what was probably one of the best rooms in the hotel  Newly reated it had laminate wood floors brand new bedding and was generally bright amp cheery  HOWEVER the majority of my husbands colleagues were not so lucky  Their rooms were generally grubby and threadbare  Several reported cockroaches in their rooms one had bed bugs and several had rooms so dirty they had to have housekeeping scrub them twice and these are generally not picky people  The hotel is also ridiculously noisy  NONE of us slept well because a series of megaphones for a taxi stand outside go on ALL NIGHT LONG broadcasting traffic instructions and call ups for cabs  It was like trying to sleep in an auction house or an air traffic controllers room  Sounds of honking outside the airconditioning vents and the pounding nightclub downstairs only compounded the problem  Whats more the hotel does stink of must and exterminators chemicals  The stench was so bad that before we switched rooms my husband couldnt sleep because the smell kept him awake and by the end of our stay our clothes were saturated with it  Another travesty is the service  Except for the Coffee Shop staff and a smattering of housekeepers the service ranged from indifferent to rude  When I went to the travel desk to arrange a half day sightseeing tour the man there ignored me for five minutes while he chatted on the phone then told me dismissively quotIm a very busy man right now  I dont have any cars available  Come back some other time quot When several of my husbands colleagues checked out the reception staff tried to charge them a higher rate than had been contracted  It was simply outrageous  The Ashok has some great restaurants an excellent spa and bags of potential  But the government has got to stop pretending this is a five star hotel  Probably it should get out of the hotel business all together  In the hands of a private interest and with some SERIOUS reations and overhauling the Ashok could live up to the delusions of grandeur currently pictured on its website  But right now its an out of the way run down noisy unappealing overpriced wreck of a place  
P => dont stay at this hotel in delhi accomodation is terrible  This has got to be the worst hotel ever  The rooms are old and run down  There is a stink in the hallway and staff are generally not very helpful  The only good things are the staff in the restaurant and the breakfast buffet  If you are staying in india spend a bit more money and stay somewhere else  It cost us  a night which is a complete rip off  We were really looking forward to getting out of there  The sheets were dirty and we asked them to change it  Noticed the next day the sheets were the same but changed towards the end of the bed  They dont change your sheets everyday  The electricity cords are dodgy too  It is a gross place to stay and i would avoid it   be back in the s it was good but not now  sorry to stay but it is the truth  yuk 
P => Overpriced with poor service and grimy rooms Lesson learned Never stay at a government run hotel  The Ashok is a tired grimy grubby hotel  The rooms are dirty and dated the service is surly and unatentive  I couldnt beleive this hotel was given a  star rating    until I found out that it was government runowned    The Taj hotels Taj Mahal and Taj Palace are FAR more pleasant at around the same price  
P => I wish I had checked the reviews I cant believe how bad this hotel has gotten  I originally was here in the early s when it was one of the best hotels in Delhi  With the exception of cable TV I dont think the rooms have been updated since then  The beds are uncomfortable the hot water is almost non existent the paint is peeling  the internet service is one of the worst I have had in India and to top it off the food is awful at best and expensive  The sad thing is I originally was excited to be able to stay here after so many years  Between the lousy food the crappy rooms and the creepy guys security amp maids in the hallways   this is one hotel to avoid  
P =>  pretend to be   We where surprised arriving at   hotel where we found grey towels and bed linen  All over the hotel were signs of government ownership   too much of staff equipment out of order etc  I expect for that price you can get much better deal  
P => Expensive but Worth It Location In Between Airport Sites and Central CityService Above Average Price High for location but worth the ratingRoom Within the rating 
P => Not a five star hotel Hotel Ashok is a big hotel in the diplomatic district of new delhi that is not close to any tourist destination   it has many restaurants and shops and the lobby is Ok But Ashok hotel was nothing near being five star  I would rather call it something in between one and two star hotel  quotCleanlinessquot had no definition in that hotel  my bed sheet was dirty and stained  the minibar refrigirator didnt work and it was empty  The toilette mirror was rusty  I really didnt dare touch anything in that hotel as it seemd that it had not been cleaned for the past  years Although I have to admit that there were two parts in this hotel and the other part seemed to be Ok I stayed there in    for  nights and I would not be back there ever again  
P => Soviet Era Luxury Indian Style What a dump  Stay at hotels such as Oberoi which are in a similar price range but deliver first class amenities and services on all fronts  
P => like al india needs a clean up the receptionists personel asked my wife how long we are going to stay like they were afraid that we dont have enough money to pay despite the fact that we were coming and go again at the same hotel for a  and  months the rest personel its ok   the restaurants had a good service except the chinese restaurant which they warm the food for nd time before the serve it  Surely it needs a good clean up change of mattresses change of all carpets painting and repairs in the wc    and one more thing    the people in the parking area have to stop shouting through loudspeakers in the middle of the night      all night long   i have changed  rooms in this hotel and the situation was more or less the same  the surrounding area is peaceful and clean i wish the same with the hotel 
P => Majestic property    truly  
P => Happening Disc

P => I visited this Palacial hotel first time and liked it lot   
P => Avoid at all costs  
P => Ashok Hotel   A shocking Hotel  
P => 
P => Not worth the money spend External appearance is great  The employees dress like professionals  But it is only in their dress and salutations All employees accept great tips  But service is really poor  I stayed in one room  There was heavy construction noise very nearby  Also there was block in bathroom sewage  Reported the trouble  They changed me to another room  Room was clean  But again not so good bath room and toilet for the amount they charge  In the bathroom ventilator of this new room there was birds nest and the birds were making noises  Looking out of the th floor room window the view is in to the yard of a small house  You can enjoy everything happening in that house  Internet connectivity from your room They charge you almost   of your room rent for internet connection for a full day and the connection is very poor  You cannot do any serious work with their connection  I stayed only for two days even though I was in Delhi for more than five days  The third day early in the morning itself I moved to another better hotel  
P => Good hotel excellent service We stayed at the Atrium for three nights in il The service from check in to check out was excellent all staff were helpful and friendly The entrance is grand the communal areas are well orated and the rooms are comfortable  Power can be erratic at times but this is to be expected in Delhi You will need transport if staying at this hotel as it is a little out of town All in all a nice hotel and I would stay here again  
P => 
P => Amazing what can i say    drive through the area it is situated in and you are thinking the worst   but turn the corner and the Avalon comes out of nowhere Fantastically designed hotel with great rooms and good food Gym and pool is always a nice addition which the avalon certainly does not lack  Only one quarm i can think of and that was the shower door not fitting properly leading to a large puddle of water on the bathroom floor  Apart from that    Amazing  
P => Claustrophobic and No maza The approach road to Avalon appears unfriendly and dilapidated  I dont think you want to take a stroll around the hotel  Inside the courtyard the rooms are trendy and has a mini kitchenette  The long french windows lead into nothing     err a completely covered space  No fun  We used the place to grab a nights sleep as we kept ourselves busy with NewDelhi during day times  The courtyard boasts of a heated indoor pool but the heating system wasnt functioning during our stay  Breakfast spread is ok  
P => Modern and pleasant but totally out of the way The Avalon was a pleasure to walk into   bright and spacious reception with modern or  Very clean and pleasant check in procedure  Lovely double room   almost a suite very well equipped with TV sofa comfy bed with clean and fresh bedding  Staff were friendly and attentive when required Downside is the location    we booked this through an agent and so did not realise the location otherwise would not have stayed here  If you want to wander into town Delhi this is the wrong place to stay  If you want to stay in a quieter hotel in a residential area then this might be for you  
P => Awful Location dry alcohol hotel drivers with scams for money but lovely rooms  Fortunately the only savior with this hotel is the rooms are completely fantastic  We arrived in the evening and found our room entirely lovely  However on the following morning we booked a car through the hotel only to be scammed by the guide  The staff are entirely lovely and the restaurant is ent  IF YOU DRINK THIS IS NOT YOUR HOTEL as this district of dehli is completely dry  Also you must keep in mind that if you travel outside of this hotel you  need to pay a tax to get entry back into the district your taxi will not pay this fee  It is also far from the sights and city center so be prepared to pay around Rs for m or  hours and then fees above if doing any sightseeing  We probably would NOT go back because of location and proximity to anything in Dehli worth seeing  
P => Ultra modern clean and very friendly I stayed in one of the Residence suits which was lovely   spacious well equipped with kitchen large bathroom sofa TV and very comfortable bed The staff were delightful really friendly and helpful The spa was very nice and all facilities were included in the room priceInternet was super fast but expensive at RS for  hoursBreakfast was also delicious It took just  minutes to get from the hotel to the airport for my homebound flight so it was really convenient as an overnight stop  
P => GReat Hotel This is a very nice clean well serviced hotel  Location isnt great but for a nice room and attentive staff it is fantastic  The gym is great on staff massages available  The food is fine  and they staff will attempt to make anything for you  the internet is really good although expensive A great find  
P => Pub with no beer We arrived at the Avalon Courtyard after flying in from Australia We travelled along rutted filthy streets in the rain so our first impression of India was not so good The driver pulled into a lane way and said here we are we couldnt see a hotelOnce inside a huge and atractive atruim apeared it was very nice our room was lovely very big with kitchenette living area and bedroom with well appointed bathroom a good suprise The restaurant served excellent food only one drawback     it is a dry hotel no bar no liquor served at all and it is in the midle of nowhere so nowehere to go and buy any For a group of Aussies arriving after  hours of travelleing that was not a good thing Other than the location and lack of beverage it is a very good value hotel that I would hapily recomend just BYO 
P => Ultra modern noisy and charmless  My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night at the end of our recent holiday The Avalon Courtyard is ultra modern and totally lacking in any of the character and charm we experienced during our stays at all the other wonderful heritage hotels and palaces throughout our trip  To say my girlfriend hated it would not be an over statement When you enter it you feel like you are walking onto the set of some science fiction movie  All the rooms open out onto corriders which overlook a central courtyardatrium There is one cafe style restaurant from which you could sit and watch people in the indoor pool if anyone used it  The hotel at the time of our stay th ch  had no licence to sell alcohol As mentioned by the earlier reviewer it is not conveniently located for access to other bars and restaurants so a taxi would be necessary should you wish to do so  When we asked why this hotel was chosen for our last night the reason given was its proximity to the airport The room was very modern and clean although quite small  There was no bath  The walls must be incredibly thin as I counted next doors alarm going off  times as the occupant made maximum use of the snooze facility  The windows are single glazed and serve only to keep the rain out since they are more or less ineffective at keeping out Delhis noise  The view from our room was of a concrete wall arated from us by only  feet or so On the positive side the staff were extremely courteous and friendly  One even took the trouble to return my suitcase keys to me which I had accidently left in the room when we checked outOverall I would say if you can avoid staying here then do so  If not then treat it as a stopover en route to somewhere better  
P => Nice rooms friendly helpful staff New property that had just opened this month  Rooms are spacious and well suited for a medium term stay  Microwave couch and a small frig in each room  Beds are great  Very nice gym with new equipment  Drawbacks were a challenging location nothing close by within walking distance so taxis required  Property faces village road with two ninety degree turns on the same block  Cars horns are used to warn motorist and pedestrians as they approach the corners  Staying towards the back of property is recommended  
P => 
P => Good Place for Private Function  Although it was my cousin riage arrangement on    Really good stay and dining arrangement with family for couple of days  Hall amp Poolside Lawn are perfectly maintain for private function  
P => Made with Class Hotel is made with class amp surrounded with greenary area  Staff was Courteous amp well groomed  I really recommend this Hotel  
P => Nice Hotel for Stay Room are quite spacetous Coffee Shop Blue Pearl ambience is impressive amp food is wow   specialy indian amp pastas  open pool with huge lawn for exercise or move around  Over all nice hotel for stay with friend and famliy  
P => Generally OK Not a bad hotel  Cox and Kings travel agency used it as an quotairport hotelquot although its a  minute drive from the airport  The rooms are clean and ent but the quothotquot water was only lukewarm when I took a shower at am

P => Clarion Collection A very comfortable and clean hotel in Delhi  The rooms are very spacious and very well maintained  The hotel restaurant is very good and serves Indian and continental food  Almost all facilities are available within the hotel  A very good place for business meeting and conferences  
P => Good location comfortable for business visitors Had been to Qutab for a business event  The hotel is pretty centrally located which makes it ideal for business travellers The conference hall was huge and the staff was cooperative  They did make all arrangements as per our requirements  The lunch was arranged by the poolside  The rooms are very comfortable  The food is ok not great  Overall good for business travellers and tourists travelling alone or couples   not be attractive or value for money for families  
P => not recommended i stayed in qutab hotel in ch for a day its purely not a business class hotel building is old and very average in terms of rooms and services cleanlyness is ok but not very good moreover the surroundings makes it worse there is a garbage dump near by no gud ket near by bad locality i would purely not recommend it  
P => A very good  star hotel  Thats right     stars  This is not a  star hotel by any standard  There are true luxury hotels in Delhi and this is definitely not one of them  I would actually say that this is a good  star hotel   I think its the best way to describe it The place is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nothing  The building is old and tired and so are the rooms  It looked like a weird block of flats that at some stage was converted into a hotel  The staff is friendly and professional but sometimes a bit clumsy The most annoying thing for me was the unreliable internet access  It kept dropping out and was terribly slow  Its terrible if you plan to do some work here    During meetings and presentations there were also repeated power outages which was annoying as it kept cutting out power to the projector which needed time to be reset The breakfast was among the worst breakfasts I have had in a long time  The pastry looked felt and tasted like it had been sitting there for a week  The choice of food was very limited too The restaurant food lunch and dinner was otherwise ok  I had some food there and also some room service and it was fine  No complaints  I think the problem is just the breakfast Would definitely not return here and wouldnt recommend it  
P => Nice experience I stayed at the Qutab twice for a total of six nights in e   I was nicely surprised by the stylish overall appearance including the design and spaciousness of the room  Internet worked fine and   Euros per hour is not an unusual charge  Food is not bad and there is an additional very stylish Indian restaurant in the compound that is quite good  You dont want to walk around in the neighborhood except be into the park just next to the hotel  It takes  min by taxi to get into a lively part of town  I was booked into the hotel by my customer who gets a discounted rate that comes out at about  Euros  night  By Delhi standards this is good value for money  If you have to pay the rack rate things are obviously different  What I didnt like was the fact that I had to pay fully for the night of arrival where I got into the hotel at  am and the night of departure leaving the hotel at  am  
P => Not Recommended Rated and regarded as one of Delhis Delux hotels the Hotel Qutab was a severe disappointment being nothing better than a standard Holiday inn but at exhorbitant prices  I stayed in the hotel when I arrived and then upon my return from a Golden triangle Tour booked through Diplomatic Holiday in Delhi which I would never do business with ever again  The first room was part of the tour with an enormous plasma television screen on the wall and nice toiletries including a silk bathrobe  I paid for the last wo nights as they were not part of the package and was vastly over charged   U S  for a much smaller room with a standard television  The food was generally good but overpriced and the service excellent  The drawback to this property is that it is not located in the downtown core of Delhi if one can even identify a downtown core but set admist absolute squalor  I felt as if I were a captive in the hotel  One short walk outside of the compound for some fresh air was enough for me  This property caters to mostly Indian business people and is definately not for a tourist visiting Delhi  Not recommended  
P => GreatGreat Great We stayed at the Quatab for  days last year and the service especially from the restaurant staff was exeptional  We are trying to book again for   Excellant 
P => 
P => Good Location Conclave Comfort is one of the  hotels by the same group in the surrounding locality  Ideally situated specially for people travelling towards Okhala  Comfortable stayent Food Good Service ently Priced 
P => Nighte It is totaly overpriced and pure nighte  Staff sleeping on the floor and cleaning means spraying insecticides The phone on the floor rings very loudly every time the hotel gets a call   annoying its impossible to sleep  The room is smelly warm water tap doesnt work  Lot of parts have never been cleaned fridge doesnt work and is very dirty  Breakfast room is ridiculous dishes not clean  And so on The hotel is just disgustingPay attention there are  hotels in Delhi named quotConclavequot  The other one is ok as far as I know  
P => 
P => You get what you pay for Corus is supposed to provide a  star experience to a business traveler with limited budget and location CP in mind  For the frugal sorts whose budget is below K this seems to be the best place available  Though if you increase your budget to K there are better places My experience was average with the following highlow pointsThe goods  Rooms and bathrooms were clean and the ACTVMini Fridge worked well  They were small but as I said if you want to stay in CP for less than K your choices are limited   Staff is extremely courteousprofessional and helpful   Cafe coffee day at the entrance and the general location is excellent as far as connectivity is concerned  Inner circle B blcokThe bads  Problems with internet  In  days the internet was non functional for nearly half the time  A big nono for a business traveller   The buffet breakfast included in the price   is just plain bad  Didnt even bother going to the restaurant after the first morning  
P => Comfortable Stay I stayed in the hotel for two nights amp enjoyed my stay   The hotel is very centrally located  The room had a wonderful view   I could see entire Connht Place  alongwith the quotCentral Parkquot  I think thats what they call it    The breakfast was included in the room rate  so we could have it in the room or in the restaurant with no extra charges   quot Bonsai quot the Restaurant very well done up  vibrant and fresh look  served excellent food and drinks in style  nice bar    not missing the wonderful outside garden area  Definitely this is the kind of hotels you want to find  Ill be back  
P => Good location ok hotel   by Delhi standards Corus was the most expensive hotel we stayed at in India and it certainly was not the best  This is to be expected of hotels in Delhi which are all over priced and not worth the cost The location was great right on the center ring of Connht Place in between Old and New Delhi  The sidewalk and streets in front of the hotel were filthy and filled with people begging for money  But upon entering the hotel the vibe is much better   theres a great coffee shop in the front with REAL coffee hard to find in India  And the check in lobby was welcoming  The staff were helpful were quick to respond when we needed something  The rooms overlook a loud restaurantbar but we were never kept up by the noise  The rooms are on the small side but arent bad  Breakfast   just stay away from the fly covered fruit on the buffet and order from the menu  The food we got from room service was greatI would recommend this hotel if its in your price range  
P => Rooms   ONLY    all the rest are dungeons We had three rooms for our group two of which were dumps  No windows and no life  But one room on the top floor at the front of the building had access to a superb terrace with a gorgeous view of the Connht Place  Others have complained about all kinds of aspects and theyre true  Its kinda dirty the breakfast was terrible and the rooms are horrid without the terrace  But folks this is Delhi  Its really hard to find a good place here without paying a fortune  The location of the Corus is superb and for me that helped to make up for the downsides  Id probably not go back unless I had rooms   or  guaranteed  
P => Worst hotel Ive ever stayed it BUT    Myself and  colleagues stayed at the Corus at the end of ember for a week  The hotel was booked by our Indian colleagues and after reading the reviews on here I was a little concerned  However although there were problems the hotel was reasonable   and much better than I had anticipated  The main problems were  No hot water for showers  My room was the only room with a window  the shower flooded the bathroom when you used it  At night it was very noisy outside and my colleague had a boiler above his room which made noise constantly  The room serivce was terrible   microwaved luke warm processed food  The beds were too short for a person of average height  The loo roll only had about  squares of paperHowever none of the above were massive problems for us  I used earplugs every night kept asking for loo roll and braved the cold water and it was fine  I havent stayed in other hotels in India so have nothing to compare it to but it exceeded my expectations   and there were some plus points  The staff were always helpful and friendly   the manager in particular was lovely   The beds were fairly comfortable after getting used to them  The mini bar was fine for drinks  We were all provided with a large free bottle of mineral water every day  The rooms were clean and I had no problem with bugs etc  We had airport pick up which was fineSo overall this hotel is fine if you are looking for somewhere just as a base but I know it is fairly expensive and you could probably get something better for your money  
P => OK hotel We stayed here for one night at the beginning of our stay in India  We arrived to our room around  pm and requested an  am wake up call  Either they misunderstood us or there  am looked like  am and guess what we were woken at  am  Our room was small with no window so we could only assume it was  am  We got dressed and then looked at our watch so we ended up drinking tea in the room until breakfast  Breakfast was outside in a patio area and was done very nice  They didnt put out an abundance of food so the hotel must have not been full but it was tasty  There is no elevator in the hotel  The lobby is up a flight of steps on the nd floor so if steps are a problem this would not be a good choice  It appeared to be in a good location of the city but we left early so only walked around the park which was across the street from the hotel  The hotel offers free internet service  This is a no frill hotel but was clean and adequate for one night  
P => Mixed experience Hotel was reasonable rooms very small but clean excellent location right on the inner circle of Connht Place  The first room we were shown had no windows but they then moved us to one at the back with a window off an external corridor  This was much brighter but anyone walking along the corridor could look through the window into our room meaning that we had to keep the curtains closed a lot of the time  There were a lot of bugs that came up through the shower drain but perhaps this is just a feature of New Delhi Reception staff seemed either exceptionally helpful or surly no in between There s also a great coffee shop at the front and a nice restaurantbar on the ground floor Overall a reasonable hotel for the money in a great location  Next time though I might choose to spend a little more and stay elsewhere  
P => Dirty and stained A friend booked this hotel through a travel agent and when I checked out the hotel on TripAdvisor the pictures made it look much more promising than it really was  Walking in I was taken aback by the trash on the stairs  The rooms werent any better  A green chair had deep undertones of brown because it was so dirty  When I pulled back the blanket the sheets and pillow cases were stained and was covered with strands of hair  The shower wall was covered with soap scum and grime  The air conditioning was either not in commission or at an uncontrollable full blast  The walls had obviously suffered some water damage and were stained On the plus side everyone who worked there went out of their way to try to be helpful Still would never stay at this hotel again  
P => One of the best options in New Delhi I worked in Delhi for a few months and needed a convenient hotel that stayed within my budget  Corus hotel ended up being my favorite option Delhi is not a place famous for its service or efficiency so bearing that in mind Corus hotel was far and away better than its peers The best part of the hotel is its location   the inner circle of Connht Pl  You are right in the heart of Delhi and next to the subwaymetro which is actually a safe and convenient way to get to some destinations in the city e g  Red Fort  Old Delhi The rooms are small and some bathrooms are better than others however the place is quite clean the beds are more comfortable than most and typically you do have hot water  Please keep in mind that in India absolutely none of these things can be taken for granted  The rate includes breakfast which is just OK but better than nothing  There is a fairly good japanese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel with a garden  The food is pretty good if a little expensive  Careful though   some nights it turns into a disco so rooms in the back of the hotel are sometimes subject to loud noise until  or  in the night  The hotel also has a ent room services and some continental options as well as traditional Indian  A quotCafe Coffee Dayquot is connected to the hotel in the front which is the Indian equivalent of Starbucks which can be a nice bonus the brownie sundae is recommended Good luck Bring plenty of pepto bismal and immodium  You will need it    but it will be worth it  
P => Not bad    I stayed in this hotel on ober  for  nights  Everything depends on what you expect from an hotel especailly if you are going to stay in Delhi    If you spend most of your time in the hotel to meet some friends or colleagues I dont recommend it   But if you are gonna be out of the hotel during the entire day and go to the hotel only to sleep then there is no point to spend a lot of money to the other  star hotels which you need to pay between   USD per night    First of all this hotels location is perfect    Its at the Inner Circle of Connht Place      where you can find many international fast food restaurants shopping places post office etc   and close to the all local bazaars  The hotel is clean and modernly orated  There is hot water but you need to wait for few minutes to get it as they most probably use solar panels during the day and central heating system at nights    If you order the cheapest room from their website youll stay in a room without a window   Actually this is not a problem for me as I never stay in my room during the day  There was no big bath towel in the room but when you ask for it they bring more than you ask  There is no hair dryers in the rooms either  You can ask for it too if its available but its not powerful  There is air condition mini bar without much options and TV showing mainly local channels in the room  They have free wireless internet and I didnt face a connection problem  There is no lobby where you can sit and wait for someone but there is a modern nice and popular coffee at the entrance of the hotel   There is also a nice open air restaurant Bonsai in the hotel  I dont recommend to order a pick up service from the airport especially if you arrive to Delhi late at night  I have ordered one but there was no one waiting for me Later they apologized for the mistake and provided me a car for my departure  Its better to take a quotpre paid taxiquot from the airport and go to the hotel by your self I paid  rupees  The taxi drivers  not know the name of the hotel but if you tell the driver to take you to the Connht Place Inner Circle you will easily find the hotel  As a result this is not the best hotel that I stayed so far but if you wont feel uncomfortable with some small problems I can recommend it   
P => great Hotel  great place good service excellent oriental cusine at the restaurant called Bonsai  overall a very comfortable stay  keep it up  
P => Great Location Great Service Price Excellent Location Excellent   CentralService Hospitality Redefined   Pleasantly Surprised   New Hotel Great ServiceRooms Small   But Reasonable   Neat Clean and comfortable They should show more of their room pics than passage photos on their website  
P => Only the location saves it We stayed here for  nights after arriving in India for a  week tour The room was large but with grubby sheetstepid water and the special bonus of blood stained towelsThe breakfast which comes to the room is only white sliced toast although we noticed Indian guests having cooked food in the corridor as there is no dining room Mysteriously we got a letter from the Manager telling us chicken was off the menu due to bird fluThe one saving grace is the location at the heart of Connht Place with a new Metro station outside and you can walk in the evening to a number of good quality restaurants very close by  
P => Hotel MINABLE  
P => 
P => Great place We just stayed at Cottage Yes Please and found it very nice clean a good value for Delhi  Our room was large  beds one off in a little alcove the AC and fan worked great TV was great and bathroom was clean  The only suggestion I would make is for the management to put a hook up so that the hand held shower thing can be used as a regular shower  They have no restaurant but the South Indian Veggie place across the street Malhotras Dosa Please is so amazingly good and open all day they even boxed up our order to go and we ate it on the airplane home  We had stayed in another hotel on Main Bazaar Vivek and found it so much worse for the same money  Cottage Yes Please has friendly and helpful staff and a nice guy that says quotNamastequot to you when you come and go out the front door  The only downside is that they no longer have free wifi    it costs  rupees per day now  
P => What a welcome  After having checked many hotels in PaharganjI chose this one because I needed a WiFi connection  When you arrive at the reception heavily loaded and tired you are requested to show your passport as they cannot wiat  minutes for you to get in the room unload and refresh  Then they demand you pay in advance   even if you are out of local currency and you have stacks of dollars to show them  So I would say that please give m one hour to rest and Ill pay when I have recovered from my journey Hot water is more like medium hot  Windows are tapped with an outside wall  
P => Good value free WiFi close to New Delhi railway station Ive stayed here twice and would stay again  Im sure this is the cheapest price youll find for a WiFi enabled hotel in Delhi especially of this caliber  If you dont need WiFi you can find some cheaper digs but be not the same standard of quality and cleanliness Staff was fine the rooms were clean and I had no problems The hotel is one street over from the Main Bazaar road in an area called Pahar Ganj  On the plus side the Bazaar is teeming with activity and there are endless shops where you can get any kind of inexpensive handicrafts clothes colorful tapestries henna body painting etc  Another plus is that the New Delhi Railway station is at the end of the Bazaar Road  Its be a   minute walk from the hotel and of course there are also bicycle rickshaws  The downside of the area is that its rather grimy and crowded  The hotel is kind of funny there like a diamond in a pile of mud The hotel has no restaurant but there are two directly across the street  You can order room service and the food will come from there  The restaurants are inexpensive  If I remember right most entrees were around  rupees US  While I was there I needed to buy a laptop and the gentleman at the travel desk recommended I go to Nehru Place which was spot on thats definitely the place to buy computer goods  I tried to offer him a Rp tip to thank him for his help but he actually refused    a rarity in Delhi where everyone seems to be after your money One of the staffers speaks Japanese and their website is in English and Japanese so a fair number of guests are Japanese  The website annoyingly does not list their rates but the lowest level is around Rpnight  
P => Clean comfortable bargain We chose Cottage Yes Please after reading a number of positive reviews and we were not disappointed  For  rupees a night    about  US    we got a clean and comfortable place to stay with free wi fi  We stayed five nights overall The hotel is on a side street off the main Pahar Ganj bazaar  Its the filthiest neighborhood Ive ever stayed in with mud and livestock in the streets  There must be a hundred or so hotels and guesthouses in the area  We saw prices of  dollars a night but I was not tempted The hotel is quite a contrast with the neighborhood  Theres a lot of ble at Cottage Yes Please    floors stairs the lower third of walls    and that contributes to both a cool feeling and easy cleaning  I think there are four floors  I didnt count the rooms but its big enough to have two lifts Our only complaint was that the quothotquot water in the shower was only lukewarm The hotel owns two pretty good restaurants across the street    Malhotra and Dosa Please  We ate breakfasts at Malhotra which includes continental and Chinese food on its menu  
P => Totally OK   with wifi Good hotel considering the price and location  Reasonably clean though there seemed to be a small colony of cockroaches residing under the fridge   Fully functional and reasonably priced wifi Location is good its in dingy Pahar GanjMain bazaar but really close to the metro station so you don t really have to walk through Pahar Ganj if you dont want to  Nice staff The room service was so so though the restaurant that delivers the food got the orders wrong and the food was not great But for the price  for a single with AC I was pleased and will return  
P => compare to Delhi clean hotel I reccomend the room  it has three beds and quite big room  It locates at Phar Ganj very convinience to go to Agra  The hotel is very clean staffs are so nice  All kinds of facilities are available ex train booking taxi internet money change  I hope that now the restaurant on roof top is started when I was there it was under construction  
P => Average Hotel This place looked more promising then most in the Paharganj area in Delhi the entrance and the building look new  The rooms are ok a reasonable size with some natural light and ours had a fridge and tv  I dont think it is being maintained too much though there were stains down the walls which Im sure could have been removed with a good clean  We had an ac double room which was IR which was ok for what we got relatively  Room service is supplied by the restaurant across the road and was reasonable  Be careful of onlookers through your window though as the buildings are very close

P => Horrible Just stayed for one night  Looks very run down from the outside   a lot different from the online photos The greeting room entrance is fairly nice  Dont be lulled into a false sense of security though  The rooms are dirty and beds uncomfortable  Bathrooms old and dirty with no hot water even when asked specifically if we wanted hot water we did not get any Staff unhelful and annoyingly pestering for tips despite not even helping Didnt eat breakfast there   didnt dare  
P => Choose rm   or  Karol Bagh    This is a good hotel for a max   nite stay anything more and you dont want to be located in Karol Bagh  Rooms   amp   are the only reated rooms in this hotel  Located on the same floor as the restaurant  Nice breakfast but horrible dinners  I wouldnt suggest ordering anything walk around the corner and get a veggie burger at McDonalds  Karol Bagh is really busy   I suggest not staying in this area if at all possible  The only food options are McDonalds and the Indian sweet shop   Bikanervala  Book on makemytrip com for best pricing  
P => What a dump Stayed at this Hotel  on the  ch for one night because my agent E  Holidays couldnt get me into the Broadway which is a great little Hotel  Its web site makes it sound like the Ritz What a shock when I arrived  Reception staff not very friendly workmen on the stairs painting and repairing the lift  The room was dirty the bathroom was falling apart and this was in one of the suites  The dining room was just as bad  Dont go near the place   Pete Thompson  Melton Mowbray England 
P => Avoid unless you want a sleepness night Travel agent said was one of the better hotels in Karol Bagh I would avoid and go to the Hotel Swati down the roadRoom Very noisy from street noise plumbing etcShower Poorly maintainedService OKRestuarant Dull dimly light ok foodmenuBreakfast Standard fayre 
P => 
P => We Enjoyed the trip It was an excelent hotel and the food was also good  There were Swiming pool and spa facility were excelent  It was well maintained  We got hair hair cut from Silvi  The room was awesome  It was in a posh area  Lobby is very good  Garden were very well maintained  
P => Delhi belly Good service nice and clean quotToo muchquot attention sometimes from service staff Nice with gym inside the hotel  
P => Not what I expected The room service staff are friendly and eager to please but if you dont keep the privacy button on they knock in the hope of tips The reception staff were rude and unhelpful on every occasion Buffet restaurant is just indian food and no variety surrounding area verry dirty 
P => The Crowne Plaza Delhi is  Star Deluxe Hotel located in the heart of New Delhi The Crowne Plaza Delhi is  Star Deluxe Hotel located in the heart of New Delhivery very good arragment      
P => capital stay cozy interiors make you comfortable in the rooms  all the necessary amenities are at available great reastaurant and nice food makes everyone happy  Convenient drop at the airport with a smiling face  
P => Dont eat here Overall the hotel is nice the room is comforable and clean and serviced well  The room service staff are friendly and eager to please but if you dont keep the privacy button on they will knock frequently in the hope of tips The reception staff were rude and unhelpful on every occasion I needed to speak wih them  Havent tried the pool but it looks well maintained and relaxing  My main complaint is the food  The breakfast offer is terrible   cheap nasty cereals runny porridge runny yoghurt runny scrambled egg that was white Mini single serving pots of jam on the tables were already used And worst of all a curly black hair on the overcooked greasy bacon  The room service is prompt but never seemed to come with everything described on the menu and was generally cold and greasy  The Chinese restaurant on the top floor wasnt too bad but nothing to shout about  Overall not impressed for a hotel of this standard  I stayed at the Intercontinental last time I was here on business and would rather stay there next time  
P => Beautiful LIke most   hotels in India this is a great stay  Great staff food and entertainment  The pool is amazing also  You can rent a driver and car and tour around Delhi which is amazing  It was my birthday when we booked in and as you have to give your passport they saw the date and arrived up to my room with a birthday cake present and flowers  Staff are amazing and add a very personal touch to everything  
P => Crowne Plaza   Should first learn the meaning of Hospitality Before venturing into hospitality industry      i suggest you learn the meaning of the word Hospitality      Crowne Plaza should make sure that the staff quotDoes not Humiliate and Insultquot its guests Learn the Basics before even thinking of running a hotel     
P => Good quality and reasonable value Ive stayed in the Crowne Plaza Friends Colony Delhi on many trips  The property is large and well appointed if not particularly attractive to look at fomr the exterior The rooms are comfortable and clean  The food is good and room service very efficient  In some areas the property is beginning to look a little tiredout of date but that is a minor observation  The location is handy for New Delhi and anyone travellingworking across south DelhiNoida  Its in a peaceful upket suburb  The gym is modern well equipped and well managed and the pool is popular  The property attracts large up ket groups of tourists local business types flashy parties and business travellers  At the time of writing e  the room rates are competitive but as always everything else e g  laundryfoodwi fi is comparatively expensive  
P => Loved the Ambience I had an opportunity to visit new delhi recently and to stay at crowne plaza  new delhi  At the ist sight of the hotel  i was excited and knew that I had made the right choice  Check in was really easy with cooperative staff  The room was very good and exactly as promised on the hotel website  The stay was for  days but I extented it for a day to enjoy the hospitality for a bit longer  In short it was worth it  
P => lovely rooms Surya has large and spacious rooms the food is excellent the front office staff is very efficient but not well groomed the hotel building is not very beautiful but it s quiet functional location is good too considering the size of delhi  
P => Good for business five star hotelgood for official partieslocated in posh south delhicentral location in southgood servicegood food 
P => Quite contemporary nice and cozy environment had a one night stay    the room was quite contemporary   floor  regular twin bed roomnice breakfast great room service    bathroom fitted with latest amenities   defintely a recommend for any frequent travellers 
P => LOVED THE CONVENIENCE Most covenient as regards the location  my office being on one of the floors of the hotel building itself The hotel has all the faclities required to unwind post the days work with a courteous staff to guide and assist with Finally to end the day  the chinese is absolutely delicious One step more to relax  the shopping arcade is reasonably priced and shopkeepers open to negotiation so one can get a steal  
P => Standard business class hotel Sufficiently impressive for a hotel of its star rating but nothing makes this hotel stand out from its competitors  The location is so so and the surrounding area less accomodating to intrepid guests than other parts of the city  
P => Poor value In my experience the two superior hotel chains in the Intercontinental group   Intercontinental and Crowne Plaza   play weather man and woman on pricing but Intercontinental is consistently superior on quality  This was certainly borne out by my experience here  This time around Crowne Plaza was a tad more expensive for which read extortionate this is Delhi after all than the admirable Nehru Place Intercontinental full alas but some way behind on quality  The walls of the executive lounge appear to have been painted by the same five year old responsible for the grouting around the shower 
P => nice place worth a visit nice place nice membership benefitsclean all facilities centraly located nice bufffets and everything u think is above normal grade worth a visit really 
P => Great Hotel Poor service The hotel did a very poor job of organizing the leisure package that I had selected  Even after talking to the resident Manager Mr Rehman they did not address the matter  Very poor service for what the charges are  The room are well done and the restaurants amp spa area is very modern  Highly recommend the ayurvedic massage  Not very sure about service and quality since rates are equivalent to dollar standards but service is not  
P => A great place to stay if you have the misfortune of being in Delhi Lets face it New Delhi is not the greatest place to stay in what is the wonderful country of India  Sure its convenient for Aggra and as a brief stop off before going to the North but not really a great destination in its own right  Anyhow if you do happen do be in New Delhi I was for  days on business il  then I certainly recommend the Crowne Plaza  The rooms are excellent by any countrys standards and the staff are friendly and good fun if you make the effort to talk with them  The restuarants are pretty good although sometimes a little pricey for what you get and the bar is functional enough although like others have said lacking a bit in atmosphere  What really stands out at the Crowne Plaza Delhi is the excellent Gym and Spa  I used the gym every day I was there followed by a sauna and swim  No charges this is complimentary and of the highest quality  I paid rupees for a great shoulder and back massage too  The area that the hotel is placed in New Friends Colony is pretty crappy but then again where exactly is nice in Delhi There are brief power cuts every day but you have to expect this but the gym treadmills are not affected by this The only downside for business stay as far as I was concerned is the slow internet connection which was pretty much non functioning for the entire time I was there  Anyway highly recommended hotel especially for business   a bit of an oasis in Delhi 
P => excellent place Its an excellent hotel    Stayed there many a times on official visit    Excellent ambience service location 
P => Good Hotel For Business Traveller A good quality business hotel in a convenient location with good dining options  
P => Loved the hotel The hotel is extremely good  Rooms are lavish and beautiful  I liked the hotel rooms the most See the room photograph below  
P => Clean hotel but looking tired This hotel is fine for business   not too expensive but rooms getting a bit shabby and tiredthe hotel gym is small and smelly and is crowded as everyone gets there at the same time after work and your better in doing an early morning workout before you start work food is apalling and the choice of western food is disappointing  Sister hotel Intercontinental has fresh bread compared to the crowne plaza food found the staff helpful but dont seem to remember regular faces  
P => loved the stay it was a very good and restful stay in the hotel 
P => Good value for money The hotel is well appointed in ambience facilities and service  
P => Value for Money Excellent location warm welcome and Great food  This hotel perhaps is the best in Delhi for business travellors  well connected to delhi and neihghbouring states UP Haryana etc  The Shopping arcade amp food courts adjacent to the Hotel is the best  Very spacious lobby too Rooma are big and has excellent view  
P => Crown Plaza Always a pleasure Crown Plaza in Delhi is always a great pleasure to stay in  It has good restaurant good rooms and good location  
P => Excellent for a long business stay I stayed here for almost  months  The hotel is one of the best that I have come across in New Delhi  It has all the modern amenities that are required for a business hotel  The property is crunched for space but that does not make the place less attractive  The food is very good variety is low but access to resteraunts in the shopping center next door makes up for this  The fare has risen in the last few months but corporates do tend to get attractive discounts especially for long stays  
P => Crowne Plaza Delhi is way better than what you get in the States After and exhausting day touring Delhi it was nice to get some peace and quiet  The restaurant and bar were very nice but really expensive  The breakfast buffet was really good everything is geared toward Japanese and Western tourists  The service is amazing and rooms were very comfortable  
P => Nice hotel poor location ent typical international chain hotel with large clean and well equipped bedrooms and bathrooms  Nice bar and restaurants  There was a Goan promotion at the Seven Restaurant during my visit and the food and ambience was excellent  The main problem is the location with nothing to attract close by except for a large shopping complex  The surroinding area is quite filthy and the hotel is some distance from both the cultural centre of Delhi and the international airport over half an hour   a full hour in busy periods   from each  
P => Good hotel for a busy city Hotel rooms in India are expensive but in this hotel you receive exactly what you need after a busy day in the city clean rooms bathroom comfortable bed international TV channels internet etc  The food of the Indian restaurant in the hotel is very good  The buffet breakfast has a lot of choices both asian and western The restaurant staff was very friendly  
P => Very Comfortable Anyone who has been to Delhi knows that its hectic   well this hotel will give you a pleasant retreat All the staff were very helpful and courteous and even those you just passed in a hallway would always smile and say hello  The cleanliness was good in the rooms and around the hotel  I only noticed an odd smell once lurking about the hallways on my floor and I couldnt ide if it was a rather unpleasant cleaning fluid something more human or a mixture of both Food wise they have a very good Chinese restaurant on the th floor that has views over the city  Its pricey compared to what you could pay outside but the food does come in large portions one dish would probably fill you up  They have a  hour caferestaurant on the ground floor which serves Indian and Continental dishes  For those that fancy a real break from the deeply tasty Indian dishes or if you just fancy a midnight snack   they rustle up a good plate of fries which are great sandwiched between some butter naan This cafe also doubles up as the breakfast room in the mornings where a ent buffet breakfast is served up with a good range of Indian and Continental  There is a small coffee shop in the lobby that sells cakes and pastries which are as tasty as they look  My final word on food is that as far as I can see and from my experience it is safe and clean  I was travelling with approx   people and nobody got ill The rooms are of a ent size and comfortable  The first time I stayed I was in a standard room which was absolutely fine  However if you have a little extra cash definitely go for a deluxe room  Slightly more space flat screen TV mounted on the wall lights and air con plus a few other things can be controlled from a small touch pad next to the bed and your own iron and ironing board in the cupboard  All the rooms have tea and coffee making facilities two small complimentary bottles of water and an in room safe There are some gift shops on the floor below the lobby and an outdoor swimming pool on the st floor  I didnt use either but the latter I wish I had if only there was the timeLocation wise it is very close to the Lotus Temple and there are some shops and an ATM if you take the exit behind the hotel then do a left  Currency can be readily exchanged at the  hour desk in the lobby I liked this hotel and would definitely stay there again  
P => Pleasant stay Stayed here at beginning and end of tour in India booked with Jetsave  Reception area lovely and pool very nice with beds in shade  Unfortunately several swimming lessons for local children held in the pool made it crowded and noisy at evening time when you wanted to use it  Room good with complimentary bottles of water and tea and coffee making facilities All our meals were paid but drinks pricy here  
P => lEnjoyed the Crown Plaza New Delhi India  Crown Plaza Suyra      Eileen QueensN Y  My stay at the Crown Plaza new delhi India was a happy and memorable one  The hotel is located nearby shopping areas banks resturants local kets ect    I enjoyed my stay at this hotel for the nice rooms with all ammentiesthe pool was great spa was very good I enjoyed that very much after along day touring  Good relaxation in the evening with three resturant to have dinner casual an elegant dining in the evening with live indian music a bar for evening cocktails ect  This hotel has a nice or to it and is fit for any kind of travellerfor businesstouristor family vaccations ect  The friendliness of all the staff is kind and careing from the doormen to the bellhopsthe resturant staff   The staff and the managers for the day and night shift was very pleasant and careing  Checking in was very pleasant and checking out was also pleasant  When travelling around the world and staying in hotels it is our home away from home and with a open mind one should make the best of our holiday  I enjoyed my stay and if I should travel to India in the futureI will choose this hotel for my stay  My thanks to all at the Crown Plaza Suyra in New Delhi India  Suyra the Sun shines bright in you always 
P => A good few days I stayed at the Crown Plaza for three nights in il  The hotel certainly looks better inside than it does from outside  Since I last stayed there eight years before it has had a big refit  The main open areas are airy and bright nicely fitted out and while the bar area below reception lacks atmosphere it s a good place to meet  My room on the forth floor was good nicely fitted out with good facilities  Service was very good   I was met at the airport by the hotel car reception was helpful and service at the bars and restaurants attentive  Breakfast buffet was very good especially if you like Massala Dosa for breakfast like I do there was a good selection including omlettes and fruit  The evening buffet was very good and a meal in Seven the a la carte restaurant was excellent  The location is little too far south if you want to get to the central tourist spots in Delhi but it can be a quick ride if the traffic is good to you All in all a good stay and based on my experience a good hotel that justifies it s rating 
P => Large hotel with spacious public areas and ent rooms My business colleagues booked three nights for me in the Crowne Plaza during a recent business trip to our nearby India headquarters The public spaces are spacious and flashy and are intended to impress  My Club level room was large and comfortable  The Club level breakfast buffet was not overly large or varied but entirely adequate for my needs  I did not personally experience the other restaurants  I did not take advantage of the large pool The staff was overall reasonably professional  The Club level clerk who checked me in was cold bureaucratic and officious with little sympathy for the late hour and my travel weariness as she demanded every detail of my travel plans  I did not find the Concierge to be very helpful when I inquired about taxi options for local travel There were a number of tour groups staying in the hotel  From my observation they seemed reasonably content with the hotel Since I had a free Sunday during my visit my colleagues arranged a car for a visit to Agra and the Taj Mahal  Round trip from the Crowne Plaza and back with three hours for touring and lunch in Agra took thirteen hours total with normal Sunday highway traffic conditions There are a number of shops in the lower lobby area of the hotel  In addition there is a small commercial area just off the hotel property with an assortment of Indian and Western restaurants and shops of varied quality  Use your quotstreet stsquot if you venture into this area Overall I would stay at the Crowne Plaza again mainly due to its convenient location near my colleagues work location  
P => Dont go there   it is a waste of money The only thing which is star at this hotel is the price  We spent a few days at the Crowne Plaza and we really regretted it  The service is bad  Food is not good  The hotel has a problem with the air conditioning at restaurants and in the lobby it is very cold  In the rooms it is not possible to have a normal temperature either you switch on the AC and its cold or your switch it off and it is getting too warm The waiters in the restaurants are slow  It takes ages till you get served tea arrives after the breakfast is done As said above   we cannot recommend to anybody to stay at this hotel   especially not to families with childrenGenerally an unpleasant place We didnt like it at all  
P => Good Hotel for Delhi I have stayed in this hotel  times over the past  years travelling on business the last time was ember   I stay because of its proximity to my businessThe rooms are clean and spacious and really what youd expect from a  star hotel  I lhed when I read a recent review about the lobby smelling of Damp   it doesThe smelly lobby aside the hotel restaurants on the upper and ground floors are excellent and for a simple buffet the Cafe is fineIts a good base for travellers to Dehli however be warned ember   uary is wedding season in Delhi and probably India and its very busy with private functions 
P => Excellent hotel no complaints I spent  night at the Crowne Plaza Delhi and found the hotel in excellent condition  The double bedroom was large enough to move without problems big bed with excellent mattress clean sheets room equipped with deskchair sideboard armchair with table flat screen tv  Bathroom was like the bedroom spotlessly clean no mold anywhere great Ayurveda toiletries  Breakfast buffet offered breakfast for Asian and Western tastes currries etc  but also bread butter melade    Really no complaints which you might expect from a  star hotel  When in Delhi I would come back to the Crowne Plaza any time  
P => Under reation but still enjoyed stay Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for  weeks while on a business trip  Hotel was clean and staff friendly  Overall an excellent hotel and will be even better once reation works are all completed unfortunately this did mean loud noisebanging sometimes but staff always helpful and apologetic and did move me to a quieter room when possible  Nice pool area and choice of restaurants but the hr cafe did get a little boring as it was the only place open after work due to working to fit in with UK time  
P => An Excellent Stay at the Surya We were in Delhi twice in ember and the first time we stayed at the Taj Palace you can see my review on its hotel page and the second time we stayed at the Surya the reason being one of our local friends recommended it  While the hotel itself isnt as luxurious as the Taj Palace the service is still pretty good  We had a regular room booked but since we had a lot of luggage we mentioned that we needed a bit more space so we were upgraded to a suite for free which was great The suite had more than enough room and some great features for example we were able to turn the shower on from the phone next to the bed so it was nice and hot when we got in there  The location of this hotel is also excellent much better than the Taj Palace it is within walking distance of some great resturants both Indian and Non Indian Ego Thai which is nearby was great and some of the best thai food I have had from around the world  The hotel also has a club which wasnt that happening but played some good music  Overall this hotel isnt as luxurious as the Taj Palace in Delhi in terms of service food and comfort but its still pretty excellent I found them slightly more accomdating and our suite was bigger than the one we had at the Taj Palace  More importantly the location is fabulous you cant go wrong with either hotel  
P => Good hotel Stayed there for a week everything is nice and clean  The hotel has a nice outdoors pool and a big plus if to avoid shopping in the center it hosts a lot of shops selling stuff at the same prize like outside it only needs some negotiations like everywhere in India  The hotel has its own travelling counter which is way too expensive but the reception can be very helpful to book anything from outside  Dont be surprised some of the receptionists speakunderstand hardly any English others do  The hotel is not closed to the center but you can hire a  wheeled car a tuc tuc for  rupeehs per hour dont pay more  Transfer by local taxi to the International airport is  rupeehs and takes about min  I really recommend the location Ana Switzerland 
P => Super stay I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour  The hotel was in my opinion excellent  The restaurants were good and breakfast was excellent  The hotel entrance was wonderful and the rooms as one would expect from a four star hotel  Enjoy your stay 
P => Clean  Some of the rooms are a bit dated or wise but I believe the hotel is in the process of under going a make over  At present I would rate it as a   property  The bed was really comfortable amp we had no problems getting a good nights sleep  The lobbyreception area is most welcoming amp the restaurants serve a wide variety of food  The hotel is located on the outskirts of the centre of Delhi but as it is such a vast metropolis I would not make location an issue  
P => Rubbish Grubby hotel  look like a  star from the photos  but when you get there the place is grubby and in need of reation We booked for  nights but could only handle   we managed to get in to the Hyatt hotel   new and clean   much better and near the middle of Delhi   the Crown Plaza is miles away for anythingBook the Hyatt or the Grand I wish we did from the start Good Luck 
P => A great and comfortable place to stay  The Crowne Plaza was in the heart of New Delhi with all the hustle and bustle going on around you  However once you were inside it was like being in a different world The reception was huge and dazzling There were plenty of lifts available The dining was exceptional with  or be  places to eat withing the hotel itself  The breakfast was buffet style and very good  They catered easily for my Gluten Free diet The staff were courteous and friendly  
P => Bailed out after one night   Avoid I booked a reservation at the Crowne Plaza in New Delhi through the Holiday Inn Priority Club  I stayed at a Holiday Inn in Australia and joined thinking that I would accumulate points  What a mistake  The Crowne Plaza in New Delhi was probably a great hotel ten years ago but it is showing its age  Apparently parts of it are under reation and supposedly some floors are completed  I did not see those floors  The lobby needs help  My room needed help  The room had excellent Wi Fi and a large plasma TV but the electrical outlets were iffy the fixtures were cracked and fading and the ble surfaces were showing a lot of wear  For  a night I expected better  Particularly from an ostensibly five star hotel  This was just the beginning  I need to have a working electrical outlet next to the bed for some medical equipment that I use when I sleep so it is a non starter when the outlets do not work  The front desk sent up power adapters which blew the fuse in the outlet along with a young man who tried to blame my equipment then asked me why did I not call housekeeping then they sent up a very nice handyman who fiddled around in the ceiling with a horrifyingly antique looking fuse box and after some trial and error he was able to get the outlet working but the lights in the room no longer responded to the light switches and so they would not go out  No problem  I unscrewed all the lightbulbs so I could get some rest  Then I jumped onto the internet and booked a room at the Metropolitan Hotel Nikko  The first floor lounge restaurant offered somewhat surly help waiter was fine the night manager was tired perhaps and a very weird version of spaghetti a la carbonara  The banana shake was good though  Oh yeah  One other thing  The hotel neglected to send a car to meet me at the airport  I requested this when I made my reservation  I had to hire a car at DEL which was    an adventure  I only wish that the Mandarin Hotel Group had a property in New Delhi  Trying the Hotel Nikko tomorrow  I am punching out of the Crowne Plaza never to return  Strongly advise giving this joint a pass  
P => one night review What a pleasant surprise After reading many of the reviews on tis site I was a little anxious about staying at this hotel but I stayed here for on night with my partner using Priority Club reward points for one night nd    We arrived early on the morning after an overnight flight and were very pleased to be given a room at  am and given an upgrade to an executive floor room on the top floor The room was newly refurbushed with flat screen TV and well equipped  The design felt a litle unusualold fashioned but the room was newly refurbished and clean The executive lounge facilities were basic but ofered free internet access a very limited breakfast and limited evening canapes and evening drinks  there is however an excelent indian restaurant in the hotel and for those seeking more western options a Mcdonalds and Dominoes Pizza round the corner The location is not central and away from Connht Place but we were touring and had a car and driver so this did not seem to matter The pool was nice and my partner took advantage of of a pedicure in the hotel which was excellent value for money  The hotel was very quiet during our stay but the service was excellent and I would recommend  
P => A very enjoyable stay Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for  nights had an excellent room on the th floor  It had been recently refurbished with modern amenities including a large plasma TV  The Chinese Restaurant was excellent but not cheap we used the executive lounge for breakfast and snacks and the food was very good  All the staff we met were very pleasant and helpful  Spent an hour sat around the outside pool area listening the noisy Delhi traffic  We did not venture far outside of the hotel on foot as there did not seem to be much to see apart from some American fast food restaurants  
P => Better than the rest Just spent two nights in Delhi at the Crowne Plaza  On first impressions this is a good hotel but delve beneath the surface and youll find a few things that definitely lower the   ranking  Most of the rooms need refurbishing and the bar area has got to be the most inhospitable place in India Forget any intimate surroundings this bar is in the atrium with  m high ceilings  The breakfast is OK but the restaurant is far too small to cope with a full house which is nearly always in India  The location is also well removed from downtown  Im sure there are better places to stay in Delhi  
P => Loved it very nice

P => Everything awesome about it and its at a very low price Now this is what is called a great hotel at a great location with the best price  I stayed in this hotel for two days and had booked a quotstandard room meant for two people due to non availability of a single occupancy during booking time i know its a waste of resource    The rooms are awesome Very much clean  The corridors and the waiting lounge was very comfortable as well  The bathroom was good too but with no bathtub  It does matter to some   It seems that the commode was meant for those people with a height gt  feet as when you have to use it your feet cannot touch the floor  What the heck The hotel has a restaurant named Comesum which is a chain of restaurants tied up with IRCTC which serves amazing food which being tasty was hygienic at the same time  The best part was its location  Its located right next to the New Delhi railway stationNDLS  So if you are coming by train you could even walk to the hotel  For local travel the metro station is again at a walking distance in fact closer than NDLS As far as my stay was concerned I faced no problems except for they dont allow to take your car near the portico and you have to take your luggage and walk for some distance not much  It could be bothersome when one has a lot of luggage but shouldnt be a iding factor according to me given the security issues which the country faces All in all my stay was good and I dont see any reason why I should give anything less than five in ratings  The negatives i mentioned shouldnt be a iding factor as far as I believe  thanks for reading     
P => best value for price Very warm and cozy rooms plush interiors nice service and tasty food  Good connectivity for business and tour planner available in the hotel  Best value for money 
P => Great quality for the price  For train travelers its PERFECTION The quality for price cannot be beat in Delhi   for  you get clean rooms with satelite TV AC wireless must pay but only  for  hours and clean bathrooms   perfectly comfortable rooms  We stayed at a few other hotels for the same price range in Delhi and India and found them all to be MUCH worse  We also stayed at a few  star hotels which were as expected better but then again cost us      found Ginger to be the best bargain around Also   we traveled around quite a bit by train using delhi as a our main hub and for this the LOCATION CANNOT BE BEAT you are literally across the street from the train station VERY helpful since some tickets can only be bought  hourse before the train leaves   if the train leaves at am youll be grateful you only have to cross the street to get your am tickets  Its also pretty close to Connht Place central Delhi   around  km or INR  by tuck tuck  dollar Good luck mp 
P => A Clean Hotel in Dirty Delhi We had three one night stays here as we used Delhi as a transit point for various excursions during our month long holiday The hotels location just yards from the unimaginable filth and detritus and all round excremental disgrace that is the New Delhi Sewerage Station I mean   New Delhi Railway Station is undoubtedly very convenient The large hotel is easy to see even at night time and even with luggage you can just walk across the car park that lies between the station and the hotel With all the building work going on for the Commonwealth Games Surely flattening the city would be a better option After all it s been rebuilt several times already over the centuries it might look daunting to get to but walking is far quicker and cheaper than any tuk tuk or taxi   as we found to our cost the first time we tried to get to it We had three different rooms during our three stays and despite reports from other contributors we found each room clean in all respects with all the facilities youd expect in a business hotel albeit a budget hotel including copious hot water The  hour coffee shop  restaurant was fine   lots of well dressed locals were even coming in for takeaways Staff were pleasant and helpful but they wont store luggage so youll have to use the Left Luggage Office at the station  Lock your bags and padlock them to the bays   thieves had a damn good go at attempting to break into my friends suitcase The hotels location is also its biggest problem  The AC can inevitably bring in the smells of the station but this isnt the hotels fault nor is the damn awful noise from the trains coming through the station whose horns even the deaf can hear What is it with Indians and noise anyway Perhaps ask the hotel if it has rooms facing away from the station  Otherwise take ear and possibly nose plugs Anyway   the plus points are of the hotels making and the minus points apart from not storing luggage for late leavers isnt I would happily try other Ginger hotels  The only reason I wouldnt go back to their Delhi hotel is because it would mean my going back to Delhi  A more hellish scenario I cannot imagine  
P => Best Place To Stay In Delhi Ginger hotels is a chain of hotels in India mainly set up for business travellers however if you are sick and tired of staying in terrible accomodation while travelling around India I would recommend paying a little extra and stay at a Ginger hotel  The Delhi hotel is right behind new delhi train station so centrally located for seeing the city  The rooms are very clean flat screen tv air con clean sheets clean showers nice staff and teacoffee in room  Rooms have a tiny frindge which does not get very cold but otherwise well worth paying a few extra poung to stay at  I would recommend booking ahead on their web site if possible to get the best price  
P => value for money was clean and appeared safe  there was ample of room with clean bedding and hot water  additionally there is a good restaurant business station and travel desk within the lodge  railway station is  min walk away  
P => What a place   I say friends all those of u who want cleanliness ginger new delhi cant be ur second choice    it was so calm peaceful and so clean that at time i felt to leave the place never  So cheap and nearby to the station it was an amazing place to live in 
P => Great place for a solo traveler This was a great place for a business trip  A spotlessly clean room comfortable bed bathroom and desk   plus wireless for an extra fee  I could also grab good inexpensive food downstairs in the restaurant downstairs  Very key when I was pressed for time or needed to get something late at night and didnt feel safe heading out on my own after dark  This hotel has small rooms for  person which cost about half of a standard room so perfect when traveling solo  Not great in terms of character but great if you just need a clean and safe place to sleep  If getting there by taxi be sure to tell the driver its by the Ajmeri Gate of the train station or theyll have a hard time finding it   and be sure to book at least a few weeks ahead of time  It books up mostly by locals  
P => Well worth the money A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge  We were a party of    adults and  teenagers and for INR a night this was a bargain  Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV  The restaurant is open hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive  Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only  mins away by foot  Downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get a three wheeeler in order to get to them Connht Place mins which are available just outside the hotel  There is a pharmacy located on the hotel premises which is great  All in all if you are only needing accomodation and do not require the hotel luxuries as we were sight seeing and arriving after pm this is a highly recommended hotel  The hotel is quite hard to find due to construction of the metro and even taxi drivers do not know where it is   It is located next to ajmeri gate on the one way system  
P => An excellent choice This is an excellent choice and great value for the price  The room and bathroom were clean AC was great flat screen TV with cable hot water though much better in morning than night very cheap phone calls internet in the lobby and very helpful staff  Restaurant is ok  If you check their website it will show it fully booked for months to come  In reality it seems to only take reservations in the short term  Excellent location right next to the New Delhi Station  although everyone will have a tough time finding it  Tell them to go to the New Delhi Station and then ask for the Rail Yatri Niwas  If you are walking you have to walk through a dark crowded industrial area to get to the hotel and solo women  not feel comfortable  Otherwise highly recommended  
P => excellent value for Delhi Stayed one night at the beginning and one night at the end of our two week holiday  Support majority of positive comments already made about value cleanliness and convenience  At the end of a long train journey the convenience of being able to walk to the Ginger Hotel was a great asset  The restaurant was nothing great but its only one stop by Metro entrance very close to the hotel to Connht Circus where there are plenty eating places  Would definitely stay there  
P => Good value for the money I was quite satisfied with my stay here  I stayed here my very first  nights in Delhi and on the trip  The hotel is basic but clean enough  Room has complimentary water  bottles a day hot water pot TV  Right now I cant even picture the bathroom but I was fine with the room and bathroom  There are  computers available in the lobby for Rs  for  hr  The staff was friendly and means to be helpful  One just has to give them time  I agree with the other reviews here in terms of the value for the money The location was great for going to Old Delhi and Connht Circle  Also because it is next to the railroad station the pre paid taxi driver from airport knew how to get to it  There is a large sign up high so once at the station you can see it  There is construction around the station and you actually need to go to the back of the station to reach the hotel A short walk from the hotels gets you to a pre paid stand where you can hire auto rickshaws  There is a booking agent of sorts in the hotel so I used them to book a car to the airport for the next leg of my trip  I said I would take non AC for Rs and I got a car with AC One negative was trying to book a room online  I did use direct email to the Delhi Ginger hotel but they dont book much in advance and they also get full quickly Hope this helps  
P => Everything we wanted and nothing more What can one get in New Delhi for  rupeesThe price the location and the Tata brand were my main consideration when I booked Ginger for our  night stay in New Delhi  The location is amazing   bang next to the railway station  Yet so peaceful as if away from the city Once I got into the hotel I didnt see a porter running towards me to pick up my baggage  Instead there were some super convenient trolleys   self service is the mantra here The room is not of a five star quality but just of the right size and has everything one needs  In the common area there is facility to iron your clothes  Amazingly designed to save costs and yet not compromise on the comfort of the stay There is no room service but you could pack your food from the restaurant and carry it yourself  
P => Perfect place for family An excellent hotel strategically located with very good Customer Service  The cost of the food in the Restaurant is little higher which TATA need to relook at as they have opened this Hotel in the Railway Station Complex and not inside near Airport  
P => Value For Money Real Value For Money hotel   An ac room at rs    neat room well maintained   Has coffee  Tea maker  complimentary water bottle   Rs  is an steal   
P => LIKE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH       We were on the way to Kerala and stayed here in a twin room  This was really a great beginning of Honeymoon  Clean and comfortable rooms with a multi cuisine restaurant made our trip wonderful  We strongly recommend this hotel to all the visiting couples and families  One of the best thing is the easy access of railway station  You can even see your train standing at platform no    and  while having west side window opening rooms  
P => good value for money This hotel is just steps from the New Delhi train station  It has clean rooms comfortable beds and ent bathrooms at very reasonable prices  The area around the station does look a bit intimidating but I never felt in danger even late at night  The restaurant offers good and safe food at very competitive prices  
P => My most preferred hotel economical Ginger Yatri Nivas New Delhi I recommend this hotel because its clean the staffs are very polite No disturbance Overall I would say you get an ambeince of a five star at the cost of  star hotel  The rooms are very clean the toilets are also clean  Clean bedsheets towels wifi AC  Really a comfortable place to stay and at the heart of New Delhi  The metro is just a  meter walk from the hotel  Isnt it Great  
P => THE best Value in Delhi for your money   period    Great hotel with everything you need   mini fridge flat panel TV   beds in family room  free water bottles  arate showertoiletwashbasin  saves time when you have a family getting ready in morning  Nice restaurent downstairs WIFI for approx  hrs  pharmacy  book store next door etc  Just keep this quite guys   already too tough to get a room   this place   seriously when I travel in India I am going to look for a Ginger hotel everywhere I go   
P => Fabulous hotel great location for the railway station and VFM Stayed here on  arate occasions during ch and rate the hotel very highly  Its location is walking distance from New Delhi train station which is ideal if you want to catch a train at  in the morning  The area around the hotel does not win any awards in fact some parts look well dodgy especially late at night  The hotel however has a security check point and they do actually check people coming into the hotel so no problems there  The rooms are very clean modern looking have a good air conditioning system flat screen TVs good hot showers and comfortable beds  Best of all the rooms are very inexspensive  There is a cafeteria down in the lobby area that serves various meals and drinks the food is reasonable and good value  
P => Best place in Delhi to stay The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessmans hotel but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance  What I say that quotBest place in Delhi to stayquot 
P => Best hotel near New Delhi railway station I had to take a train at  AM  So I was looking for a hotel which should be at a walking distance from NDLS station  The hotels at paharganj looked shabby  But Ginger hotel The erstwhile Rail Yatri Niwas is very nice hotel  The interiors are very good  The hotel uses latest technologies loke self check in etc  The room rates are also resonabel at around  Rs  I would certainly recommed this hotel if you are looking for stay near new delhi railway station  
P => Budget hotel in India Im a Brazilian living in Bangalore and  this year my family came to visit me and my wife  I planned the visit to New Delhi and Agra so I booked on line two double rooms  Two weeks before I called to check if the reservations were really made luckily it was  Finding this hotel is complicated and if youre a foreigner no taxi driver will believe you know where it is even you have a map in your hands  Tell the driver that it s next to Pinto Road and that he has to go through the rail station carrickshaw s parking area to get to the hotel The location is pretty good to visit the sites in New Delhi This is a budget hotel so don t expect any frills  You ll find a bed AC little noisy LCD TV a desk with a small fridge and a standard western bathroom  Our towels were a little dirty and the bed sheets where smaller than the bed even thou cleaner than some  star hotels I ve stayed in Pune Chennai and Mumbai There s a  hours restaurant in the ground floor if you like Indian food you re going to enjoy yourself  If you don t you can get an auto rickshaw for   minutes and go to Connht Place to eat something  The hotel does have omelette and toast The hotel does deliver what it promises a safe and clean place to sleep  If you re looking for some glamour try other hotels but if you don t want to spend money this should prove good enough  
P => yes yes yes Even if it is not easy to get there you can see it from the railway station but the road is not direct weve found it very very worthy  Room is basic but clean Wi fi everywhere for  rupies per hour the restaurant always open not expensive and average quality food just outside the door a pharmacy and a corner shop  Also a tourist desk is there and their car rental with driver service is good and not expensive at all compared to the others we checked  We will sure look for a Ginger hotel everywhere well go in India 
P => A good base in Delhi The Ginger is cheap clean and comfortable The air conditioning was welcome after the  heat of the city  We tried a  bed family room and the  bed twins both fine the twins have better bathrooms The  hour cafe downstairs was useful not the best food ever but adequate with a fair amount of choice Tell cab drivers you need New Delhi station Ajmeri Gate as others have noted they often dont know where the hotel is with just the name  The surroundings arent wonderful but it is very convenient the metro is just outside Would definitely base myself here again  Good for families  
P => Budget at its best Hotel Ginger is a quality accomodation and a steal for the low prices that it offers  The fact that the building belongs to the Railways and was a Rail Yatri Niwas  have a major role to play in its pricing But the makeover is unbelievable  Simple changes have made the hotel a great buy in for business travellers who visit the hotel only for a good nights sleep The rooms are very tiny but well done up  The corridors are a maze but blame it on the old building and construction Currently accessibility from the city is a big problem because of the construction of Metro but once that ends this hotel will be a hot favourite for people travelling by the Railways Ginger provides option of ordering food from any local restaurant nearby and also makes available their menu cards which is a great option if you want to choose from a variety of cuisine All in all a value for money 
P => excellent value for the money Based on Tripadvisor reviews I booked four nights at the Ginger Hotel in  and was not disappointed  The hotel provides excellent value for the money  I paid more than double for the same setup at another hotel when I returned to Delhi in e  The Ginger has all the atmosphere of a businessmans hotel but the rooms are clean and neat and staff is responsive to requests for assistance  Service is snappy and professional  While all this doesnt sound that exciting trust me when I say that youll be really thankful for such efficient service when you arrive at AM after being given the runaround by your taxi driver  The hotel is sort of hard to find  Its on the back side and across the tracks from New Delhi Station  Adjacent to the hotel is some sort of operations which involves lots of bales and carts and looks like recycling activity but is probably rail related freight operations  Its not pretty to look at but the constant activity makes the area relatively safe and once inside the hotel all is nice and calm  You get courtesy bottles of water every day  Theres internet access albeit with a slow connection and expensive at  rupees an hour  And the restaurant isnt too bad  Theres a metro very near by  If Delhi werent so beastly hot the hotel is within walking distance of Connht Place and Old Delhi  The place always seems to be booked so book early  
P => romantic rooms The hotel is magnificent   It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go anywhere  Its ambience is so peaceful no disturbance at all from anyone    In delhi with such a atmosphere you can not find hotel at such a reasonable rates  Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel in the price range of Rs   per day  It is in the heart of delhi hence transportation is no problem at all  ONly negative point is its entrance through New delhi Rly station which is little crowdy but one you in it all peaceful neat and clean rooms with very good aesthatics 
P => Nice cute place We were scheduled to travel to Agra and planned to stop by at Delhi for a couple of business meetings  My brother was trying for hotel accomodation through the internet  He had a fancy for Ginger hotels and kept trying for a room from  month before our visit  He did not get one initially  But on repeated attempts there appears to have been a cancellation and he was able to book a room The hotel is just a stones throw from the railway station  We flew down and took a taxi to the Station  We just walked over the platform into the hotel  We got an unbelievable price and when we walked into the hotel the warm reception at the desk and the manners of the staff in the reception reminded us that this was a Tata hotel  Absolutely friendly courteous and professionalWhen we went into the room we saw a beautiful room with a spacious bathroom  It was an unbelievable facility for the price at this location  A tea kettle with coffee and tea packs was provided in the room In case you get hungry there is a restaurant in the groundfloor that offered food and beverage round the clock and we had arrived late at night without food and helped ourselves to a good tasty dinner there A nice hotel at a very convenient place  But if you are planning to stay there please make sure that you book a room well in advance  
P => for young independent travellers Very clean place to sleep and have a spot in the city  Do not expect a lot  Rooms are small claustrophobic with single window fully covered by AC machine  Older old fashioned ppl are really confused when they have to deal with card locks and all those modern tools  The area around the hotel isnt too safe quiet or clean  It is just near the New Delhi station so u can imagine all that mess around and how is it at night  But one good thing is that u have a metro station just at the corner and hr Comsume in it  Food isnt great but safe  
P => Complete VFM Nothing but the best Value for Money Easily the best option for all kind of travellers Id give it  
P => Best Hotel at the Best Rate We used to visit Delhi quite often and it use to be a very difficult task to find a ent hotel at a ent price  Then the last time I was planning my trip to Delhi I learnt that Ginger had opened in New Delhi and that to it is right next to the NEw Delhi Railway Station and so I booked Ginger  The hotel is very neat and clean and for the price I think one cannot get a better deal  They also have a restaurant laundry service LCD TVs in each room etc  I think this hotel is a steal in Delhi for the price they are offering  
P => Good value for money Good value for money  The family room contains  beds  With AC pretty spacious room with LCD TV for  is too good  Also proximity the New Delhi railway station is BIG plus  Now dont have to go for the infamous Pahadganj hotels Only issue was with respect to booking  I had done day visit booking with checkin and checkout dates as same  I had some trouble had to wait for almost  hour to get the room  And the reception staff and the manager were not polite to say the least  
P => Convenient Location A good value conveniently located hotel next to the Metro and New Delhi Railway Station It is located on the North East side of the Railway Station taxi drivers might find difficulty in locating itI had already checked it out on Google Earth and so we directed the taxi driverThe staff were very attentive and the restaurant was adequate  Hey it is a budget hotel We stayed four nights and the room was well cleaned every day Yes I would certainly return here particularly if I was travelling by rail Oh there is also a pharmacy next to the hotel  
P => Great hotel with excellent value We enjoyed staying at the Ginger New Delhi  The rooms are compact very clean and every small detail is taken care of including complimentary bottles of water every day wifi in each room internet cafe etc and the facilities are managed well Food is available at the  hr coffee shop at the ground level  The service here is very slow though the food is nice  Pre paid auto rickshaws are available at the New Delhi railway station which is a  minute walk away and the metro station is  minutes away as well  The only issue is that auto will drop you off a  min walk away on the return since the metro work has made the entire road difficult to enter  
P => Value for money hotel Good hotel to stay if you are travelling on business or work for a day or two  The facilities are minimal but adequate  
P => Great Value For Money We traveled BOM DEL by Rajdhani Express  The hotel is just oppositte the New Delhi Railway station within the station premises  Its a fine  storeyed building with no frills and no excellent views from hotel room  BUT it offers great value for your money We took a family room for just INR   The room had  window ACs  single beds  The entire room was very neat and tidy  Toilets were clean  Everything worked to perfection  Any other property in New Delhi offering what this hotel offers would easily cough up   bucks from your pocket Seamless check in and check out procedure  Nice room service   bottles of mineral water and tea and coffee kits provided on a daily basis  A nice  inch LCD TV to take care of your entertainment needs  The quality of the beds mattresses is very nice The restaurant offers a very limited menu  It is something which can be improved upon  
P => Best business class hotel in Mumbai Ginger hotel is truly a business hotel for a frequent business traveler like me They best advantage with Ginger Delhi is its location advantage The facilities provided by the hotel are above average I specially like the Ginger concept and now I am a fan of it I will definitely stay with Ginger next time I am in Indias capital soon  
P => ent place   low cost ent place  reasonably clean and located next to the railway station   Remember it is a budget hotel so a few things one should keep in minda Carry your toiletriesb Food is available but is in a cafeteria like place Had a few issues with them messing up over the bedsheets but was otherwise ok 
P => best budget hotel in new delhi in new delhi in area near to railway station ginger is not only best budget hotel but with most professional management compare to other hotels in same area with same price tag it is the best one all facilities like taxi food shopping is available nearby  
P => loved the ambience the stay at hotel was awesome with excellent room amenities and that too economical  jus the place outside hotel is to be maintained   
P => Basic   but does exactly what you need for  night We initially booked this as we were going to be catching a train from Corbett National Park into New Delhi station  minute walk away  However we ended up catching a taxi from Corbett instead and our driver had all sorts of problems trying to get to the front door and ended up parking in a nearby car park Its not in the nicest of areas I definitely wouldnt advise walking around on your own at night It is a standard stopover hotel like a Travelodge or a Premier Inn in the UK  Its a pretty basic room but has most that you need with air con flat screen tv tea coffee and water  Its clean the check in and out were simple and theres a restaurantcafe downstairs  Its unbelievably cheap at about   for a night and with the money we saved here we went for drinks and dinner at The Imperial Hotel  
P => good price what I like about this hotel is the central location and the attractive price for room it provides It is basic yet it has what you need and it is clean enough although they do not provide sheets apart from the one covering the mat 
P => Well worth the Money A great value Hotel similar to a UK Travel Lodge  We were a party of    adults and  teenagers and for INR a night this was a bargain  Rooms very clean with AC and a fridge and LCD TV  The resteraunt is open hours with good food although the staff are very rude and un anattentive  Location is great for those wanting to use New Delhi train station as it is only  mins away by foot  Downside is that there are no shops around the hotel and you need to get a three wheeeler in order to get to them Connht Place mins which are available just outside the hotel  There is a pharmacy located on the hotel premises which is great  All in all if you are only needing accomodation and do not require the hotel luxuries as we were sight seeing and arriving after pm this is a highly recommended hotel  The hotel is quite hard to find due to construction of the metro and even taxi drivers do not know where it is   It is located next to ajmeri gate on the one way system  
P => ent The hotel is ent amp as per Ginger standards  The rooms are goodamp clean  Its located very conviniently esp if one wants to travel from NDLS station or arives these late at night  On the negative side its in the congested amp poluted area of station amp u cant step out for a snack or stroll if u desire  
P => Purely St Basics  Loved my stay here  Hotel is clean amp proper  Has a good restaurant as well Rooms are self sufficient though small if you are looking at spending more than  days here Staff is extremely helpful Located right in the Delhi Railway Station premise so good for Train travellers  At the same time its away from the hustle bustle of the train travellers at the station However the entrance is a little dificult to locate the st time around  Entrance way is crowded as well if coming via car Also if you are a very light sleeper then the Honking of the night train can disturb you  But less likely  I slept like a LOG General store cum Medical store in Hotel complex is fully equipped and is priced at MRP Overall good experience for a one  nite stay for work  
P => Excellent value but a bit of a nighte outside Its an Indian TravelLodge  So excellent value for money good clean room with ac and good clean bathroom but basic or and a bit echoey in the corridors  The restaurant  snack bar is good try the plain dosa  It is a short trundle across the car park and through a little gateway from New Delhi railway station  You cant leave your luggage before  after check in but theres a rather forbidding left luggage place in the station  The hotel has a perimeter fence and a security guard  Immediately outside youre in a horrendous noisy tide of hand carts jeeps motorbikes etc   or you can hit lucky and find it pretty quiet  Getting in is OK if the taxi knows the circuitous route to the entrance  Otherwise theyll drop you right by the building and it is quite a challenge to find the way in  Expensive internet  
P => Very nice and clean hotel but the restaurant Very nice clean hotel with good room facilities good location just at Ajmeri gate m from NDRS and metro nice stuff   willing to fully refund one mine canceled night but also sometimes act too bureaucratically  Hotel restaurant is a different story  It works like fast food and they had no croissants and breakfast like food at the morning even if listed in the menu  Same with fruit salad  
P => Exceptional value in a big city We stayed for two nights early ch and then again a week later  Both times the rooms were immaculate we stayed in a double room costing just  rupees per night the rooms are equipped with Satellite TV kettle tea and coffee fridge celan bathroom with shower curtain these are a rarity in India We had a problem with our toliet on the second visit but maintenance were at the door almost as soon as we had put the phone down from calling reception and the problem was rectified The hotel is a couple of minutes walk from New Delhi station which makes it perfect for early morning train journeys  We too had a problem with a taxi driver not knowing where the hotel was but we also had a tuk tuk driver who didnt know where Connht Place was The staff in the hotel are really helpful and work really hard to keep everyone happy they even called Dominos pizza for us as we were having trouble with their pay phone  
P => Absolute value for money no frills located right next to Railway station A Compact small room with wooden flooring clean bathroom with a telephone air conditioner and a cupboard with hangers was all for Rs   A standard room means a Queen side double bed whereas a twin bed room are two arate beds  There is also a category with four beds at the same price if there are more people The rooms are small and one could compare this with Ibis in Europe only that dust in India makes it harder to keep the property as clean  But no complaints There is a restaurant at the ground floor Comesum which serves ent food options  The location is excellent next to the Railway station and to Connht place N Delhi  When we stayed there was lots of metro rail construction happening around the hotel which made access slightly round about  However we could walk to the railway station early morning strolling our bags on our own there are baggage strolleys available in the hotel restricted till the main entrance of the hotel in about  minutes The laundry service was reasonable and prompt   deposit in the morning and receipt by evening  pm We booked online and check was easy too  There is a helpful reception desk  The hotel is quite busy due to the price and location and one needs to bear with that Overall a comfortable and convenient stay  
P => Ginger Hotel Our stay at the Ginger Hotel was great  Forget expensive bed and breakfast hotels the Ginger Hotel is a no frills and a great hotel  Our family of  stayed in  rooms as the family room INR was totally booked  We stayed in a double and  singles rooms INR each for  days  We arrived at the hotel which is located next to the NDLS railway station  It was chaotic outside  We approached the hotel gates security didnt let the car through security check we got off and headed towards the lobby  Check in was a bit of pain as Indians dont understand getting in line to get attention  We were soon given our room keys and went upstairs  We but our bags in the trolly  THe rooms were clean and had the basic necessities   water bottles inside the room  Heater and AC were part of the room w remote control  TV was LCD  Internet was expensive but we didnt care as we were at the hotel to only catch night sleep  THe floor consisted of an iron table in the hallway  THe hotel at the lobby is superb  Order watever you want as they are open  hrs indianchineseswestern and is clean  We ate dinner here every night as we were sure not to get sick  THe hotel also has a gym and meeting room  Newspaper free at lobby  No outside noise was noticibly  Pick this hotel if you want a inexpensive   star service  Its centrally located to all monuments and shopping areas are a taxi drive away  Since its located near the train statin catching a taxior a  wheeler was a breeze  Walk outside the gate and towards the train station there you will find an office for the  wheelers  Tell them where you want to go and you will prepay your trip  No negotiating  For taxi the black taxis are outside too but here you have to talk to the drivers  We took a taxi to the airport for INR but all intercity trip to visitor monumentsshopping were done in tuktuk  wheelers  Would I stay here In a heartbeat  Save the money and use that on shopping  You are on vacation and will use the bed for only night  hrs of sleep anyway  I spent INR for a bed and breakfast hotel on the last stay which was pathetic house of lords spend the money at Ginger  Make sure you prebook online if you want the Family room  ppl for INR as its in HOT demand  We couldnt get the deal so we took the regular rooms for  at INR each which is still great  Staff is super friendly will go out of the way to help  Theyve even got a ground transportation group at the lobby but I thought they were expensive  A medical store exists in the lobby as well  Request a room in the higher floors for a greater view  See pics of the location  This is a gem in the city no doubt  Coming into a foreign country from the US is a headache but staying at Ginger will calm the situation a LOT  
P => Great value for Money Stayed at Ginger during a short trip to Delhi in uary  with friends  There were  of us so we got the Family room which has  beds for Rs nightThe stay was comfortable and just what it advertised itself as   a no frills hotel  Though service at the hotel was good there were areas for improvement    The hotel provides only  towels in a room meant for  persons and you need to ask them for extra towels  The towels could be of better quality   they shed threads which stuck all over  WifiInternet access is expensive at Rs hour compared to internet rates elsewhere  The room key card repeatedly stopped working and meant a trip to the lobby each time to fix itOn the positive sideThe staff was very polite and helpful  The  hour cafe is convenient especially when you need to leave at odd hours of the night  The food wasnt bad either Having a metro station at your doorstep is really usefulThe beds were very comfortable or be I was just really tired  The location of the hotel near the New Delhi Railway Station and Metro station is convenient BUT it also means that road access to the hotel can be confusing as it is in an area surrounded by a parking lot and a railway parcel area Overall if you arent going to spend a lot of time in your hotel room and just need a comfortable safe and clean place to spend the night Ginger is the place for you but dont expect a full service hotel  There are still a few kinks they need to iron out but the helpful staff fixes any problems quickly I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Delhi  
P => Great value for a family of  We stayed in  twice for  nights each in a family room which sleeps   The first time the room was not very cl an   but the second time it was  Great location   great price INR  per night  If you check in later or check out earlier they automatically give you a reimbursement  The surrounding area is not recommended to go for a walk Due to heavy construction work and proximity to the railway station it does get loud if you wish to keep the window open  There are however  ACs in the family room and  fans The  hour restaurant in the basement is OK   its clean and has a wide variety of dishes southindian north indian even blackforest cherry cake  The car rental service in the hotel is however a rip off  Book your transport elsewhere  Staff is friendly and helpful  You can also get your clothes washed there  Internet access works most of the time  
P => A good value hotel in Delhi I choose this hotel after extensive research of hotels in Delhi The thing that finally swung it for me was that is was cheap The selection of hotels in Delhi swings from the cheap to the ridiclious The Ginger seemed to be a hotel that served the purpose of being a safeclean bed for a couple of nights We flew in from Goa for a couple of days of sightseeing a day trip to Agra and then onward to Jaipur This hotel was adequate for that purpose The good points were clean rooms serviced daily on site hrs cafe close to the new delhi railway station great for catching the shatbadi express at   to AgraThe bad points the construction work of the metro makes the area chaos a taxi ride from anywhere else you over look an interesting area expensive wi fiConclusion If you want a good value clean hotel in Delhi the Ginger hotel is a good option 
P => Value for Money Surprisingly Rooms at Ginger Hotel was available for the dates that I was traveling to New Delhi  it was an hazel to reach the hotel with all the construction work going on around it and its location near the station gave jitters  All these was only till we reached to the hotel  The people at the reception were friendly and the room pretty clean and tidy  Could not say it was big but was sufficient for  persons  The only point of concern was the food at comesum restaurant housed inside the food was just edible though the live music at the restaurant was pretty good Overall the hotel is complete value for money 
P => Excellent Value This is the best value hotel Ive ever been to  Its thoroughly modern with all the basic facilities including payed Wi Fi at rooms  The location is good too with Metro station right outside and one metro stop away from Connht Place i e   minutes  Also its easily booked online  The downsides   the shower area is a bit small and the beds are very light which can be a bad thing if you want them to stay put  Its also quite busy just outside due to the railway station Indian Railways not the metro  There is no room service though the affordable  hour restaurant Comesum is ent  
P => best thing about the hotel is self service    loved the ambience i have recently gone through a very fantastic service in the hotel industry in india  the service provided to me was through the hotel ginger in new delhi  the system of help yourself is catching up fast in india and much to my delight the price of the hotel is fair enough to shell my wallet  
P => Excellent Value for money Excellent value for money   Neat and clean  Within the New Delhi Station hence a great choice for people travelling to or from there  There is a  hour medical shop and a vending machine for those late night hunger pangs  All of this for less than a thousand bucks  
P => Excellent Deal   No one could imagine such an excellent stay at the heart of New Delhi I stayed for  Nights  The room was perfectly Clean  I will definitely opt this hotel again if I visit Delhi againThe Price was the great attraction  It cost just  rupees  But It gave the facilities amp comfort of  Rs room  Superb   Real Value for Money 
P => More than Value for Money  This is a new Budget range Hotels from Tata Group operated with the brand name Ginger and Tata Group also owns the Taj   Hotels in India amp Abroad An existing  Floors Rail Yatri Niwas which was managed by Indian Railways has been handed over to Ginger Hotels to run the Buget Hotels and it has been refurbished completely and opened in ust   With the Hotel Pricing at   for AC Room with LCD TV Mini Regrigerator with small but neat and clean rooms you cant ask anything more  The biggest surprise was even a  Bedded Family Room also was priced at Rs   with Two ACs  They have WIFI Zone Mini Gym hrs Restaurant Vending Machine and also a hr Pharmacy Center within the complex  I had seen around   International Tourists staying at this place  The Rooms are with Dark Shades with basic interiors and Hot amp Cold Water  No Room Service is provided and they manage with few staff and thats where they are able to cut down the costs  However compared to other Ginger Hotels this one is priced at much lower rate I guess it could be because of the agreement with Indian Railways because they have provided the Land amp Building  
P => Parfait pour un aterrissage en douceur  
P => 
P => Grand hotel indeed  Grand Godwin is a fantastic hotel such great value for money  Our first night was in a Super delux as our room was not ready  It had a hairdryer and fridge and was slightly bigger than the delux we had for the rest of our stay  It also had a blocked off window so it was really quiet  The delux was road side and a lot noisier  The beds were fairly comfortable and the rooms were very clean  The restaurant is  hr and the food is great  Good breakfast too  Godwin in central location between old Delhi and Connht place so easy to get around  One of my favorite hotels on my India trip  
P => Comfort and Location Stayed at the Grand for one night on our way through Delhi to Udaipur  Have stayed here before for longer stays  Our room was comfortable and clean check in was quick and easy and Wi Fi is available  The roof top restaurant offeres an expansive breakfast  If youve never traveled in Asia the neighborhood can be disconcerting at first  But the Grand is an easy  or  minute wald to the train station and a quick tuk tuk ride to Connht Place for some shopping  
P => Good hotel Good hotel in a nice area near metro station and interesting spots  Especially having breakfast at the roof top in the morning is really nice  
P => ent value I enjoyed my  day stay here  Room service was very kind food was excellent and the room was clean  Its centrally located and in an interesting area of Delhi  Only negative is that I had constant trouble with Internet they gave me my fee back  
P => Probably the best hotel in Pahar Ganj An excellent choice near New Delhi Station  We first stayed one night in room  at the beginning of our tour of India  Very clean large and comfortable room  Very good breakfast  At the end of our tour of India we first stayed one night at Jyoti Mahal Guest House which we left because it was dirty and we went back to Grand Godwin Hotel for  nights in room  which was a little smaller than room  but as clean and comfortable as room   Price of the room  INR   per night breakfast included  It is true that the neighbourhood is noisy but in the hotel it is very quiet  They have a taxi service to the airport which we used  Good service price INR  for a non AC car for a drop off at the airport  No doubt for us  the best hotel in Pahar Ganj  
P => surprisingly nice  Ok when you get there you are at first sight of the neighborhood quite   frightened  Dont be get off your car make it through the crowd the dirt the unpleasant smells the COWS the motorcycles and the rickshaws and let the doorman open the door of a peaceful all in white ble lobby  Service is efficient god they are ALWAYS cleaning for real rooms are not too small when they say triple rooms they actually mean THREE beds which is not so common in  stars indian hotels as i discovered AC is working just fine  No view  Funny elevator Breakfast is not very good dont bother trying to get something else thant a Nescaf  in   of indian restaurantsamphotels but you can get eggs fruit juicetea toasts etc no problem  I would advice to give it a try to the roof top restaurant non expensive and tastytry the Biryani the best ive ever had  Dont forget to ask them NON SPICY it will still have enough of flavor  
P => bad dirty shaky shady and old     absolutely inadequate for most travellers  perhaps ok for some very low budget low demand backpackers and some locals    we left it on the second day to find another hotel and fortunately Incredible India guys helped us greatly with rearranging hotels for us in different cities  It was especially great to have them help us in the middle of the night when we arrived from the airport first day  Note that initially whole trip was planned by myself without any help from them or other tourist agency  I ran into them at night when looking for the hotel and they helped  
P => Grand Nighte wow I am writing this from the lobby of the hotel unable to sleep because of the infernal noise from constructions going on in front of the hotel and my room  What an awful place Stay away at any cost  When I arrived my reservation wasnt honored  However they offered me a quotbetter roomquot for the first night  They dont actually have the room they offer and want to make you pay extra  Given the roon isnt really expensive it is not much  but the attitude behind that makes you feel not welcome at all  Well I wont pay extra   They don not appreciate your business  The place is located in the slum areas around Delhi central station  Exiting and interesting Ill be looking for another hotel tomorrow dont waste your time here  
P => Well sited Although located in a street full of hotels the Grand Godwin is different from most of the others in that the attractiveness of the lobbyreception follows in the rooms  Many of the hotels have a nice lobby but the rooms are not so nice  The Grand Godwin has perfectly fine rooms although the bathrooms are a little compact  Not a problem if you dont mind the water from the shower going all over the bathroom  I guess they dont mind cleaning it up Its well located for convenience to New Delhi train station  great if you intend to travel around India by train  The area around isnt much to look at but then again its only  mins from the Metro  mins from there to Connht Square or Chandni Chowk etc  The restaurant is basic but we didnt use it apart from breakfast time  The inclusive breakfast is limited but adequate to stave off the morning pangs of hunger  The staff are pleasant and helpful and internet access reasonabely priced  Its an ok place to stay and your stay is unlikely to gave rise to any complaint  The price is a little on the high side though  
P => Surprisingly nice hotel After reading the reviews on tripadvisor I was a bit hesitant to book this hotel  But it was surprisingly nice and the staff were very helpful  Our room was clean and modern as were the lobby and the elevator  We stayed there twice and both times the hotel arranged taxis to the airport that were reasonably priced and worked well  The restaurant was quite good for breakfast and dinner and open  hours which was great because we arrived very late at night  Our room faced the street and was rather noisy but thats hard to avoid in Delhi The hotel is located in the Paharganj section of Delhi and walking the streets of Pharganj is quite an experience  The sidewalks are very narrow and often covered with street vendors so it is usually necessary to walk in the street with heavy traffic consisting of autorickshaws trucks cars motorcycles cows bicycles and pedestrians  We also stayed at the Prem Sagar Guest House in the Connht Place section of Delhi and I just posted a review of that property  Connht Place is much fancier than Paharganj with wide sidewalks Western clothing stores and easy access to the Metro  But the Grand Godwin was a much nicer hotel than Prem Sagar at a significantly lower price and the Paharganj experience seemed more like the quotreal Indiaquot so I would definitely recommend Grand Godwin over Prem Sagar for anyone who needs a place to stay in Delhi  
P => Amazing hotel Okay so the hotel lacks a little character but it is extremely clean and well equipped  However the overall package is what impresses me the most  The staff are attentive and courteous and when I had a problem with a scammer who stole my money a crook that sold dodgy airline tickets they went out of their way to help me  The General Manager is a saint and even when dealing with this from the UK he is always there to answer questions and he truly has been doing all he can to help me in this situation  They seem to really care about what tourists think of their country and have been quite disgusted by the behaviour of this individual  I really cannot speak more highly about this place and will always recommend it  In an expensive city like Delhi it also very good value too  
P => Great value hotel The hotel is conveniently located about  minutes by tuktuk from the train station  I chose this hotel because I needed to catch a few train from the Dehli Train Station  The staff arranged airport pickups for us twice and they were always there waiting for us  they were firendly and attentive  They also arranged a tour and a pick up at the Agra train station and it was well worth it  The rooms were clean as well as all the bed sheets and comfortable  The hotel is located on a popular street were there are other hotels  They have room service internet access for a small fee and included breakfast  Id recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for a place next to tre train station  
P => Impressed My partner and I stayed at Hotel Grand Godwin just a few nights ago during a holiday in India  The hotel was lovely very grand and beautifully orated  We opted for the deluxe rather than semi deluxe room for  rps a night including tax and breakfast  Our room was great   clean comfortable and cooled with a vert quiet AC system  The staff were friendly and efficient booking an airport taxi for us and arranging for breakfast in our room at  am before our flight Although the hotel says the breakfast is continental it included much more than croissants and coffee  They had cereal fruit an egg station as well as a full range of Indian dishes  At am when my partner and I hadnt shown up for breakfast yet a member of staff came to our room to check we were okay We had one evening there meal which was also good a little pricey compared to elsewhere but tasty  The hotels location is fab on a busy street in Parhaganj about a   minute walk from the train station and from the main bazaar street  As with most Delhi hotels it wasnt quiet at night   you could hear people out on the street outside but it wasnt so bad that you couldnt get to and stay asleep at night  Overall very impressed  
P => A good hotel in a good location We stayed at the Hotel Grand Godwin at the beginning and end of a three week trip to India  We were really impressed with the hotel it was well located the rooms were a good size and clean and the breakfast served at the roof top restaurant was particulary good  The hotel is a  min walk from the main bazar or a  rupee cycle rickshaw ride and a  mins walk from the train station an auto rickshaw ride to Connht Place is approx  rupees  We used the hotel taxi service to collect us and take us back to the airport and we found the staff really helpful  
P => Very clean and good price Very clean hotel room I found in New Delhi with Fare price  The staffs of the hotel specially the front office are very helpful  All kinds of Delicious Indian foods are available  We had wonderful friendly service  My room is only US per night with break first  Hot water is available  AC and big TV worked my room  Secure airport transfers and sight visit tour arranged by the hotel  Only the thing is surrounding of the hotel is too crowded during my stay  
P => A super find in the heart of Paharganj This place is a clean friendly oasis from the teeming madness outside  All the staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms and linens very clean  A super deluxe was Rs per night and I had a big room with tiled floor TV coffee making stuff and an ensuite  It was a bit noisy outside but it did quieten down a bit at bed time but this wasnt a huge problem once the ear plugs were in place    The breakfast buffet on the roof terrace was fine although I didnt sample the evening cuisine which was available  There was an internet connection available on the ground floor a travel desk who organised a taxi for me at a reasonable cost and an exchange desk  The hotel is only a ten minute walk from Connht Circus along a straight road under the flyover that carries DB Gupta Road and is also round the corner from the Main Bazaar with internet cafes small shops and cheaper hotels and guest houses  
P => Comfortable well run hotel convenient for New Delhi Station We stayed three times at this hotel in oberember  using Delhi as our hub to explore northern India  The hotels airport transfer is expensive much better to use the pre paid taxi stand at the airport you learn this after the first time The noisy dirty side street location of the hotel is a bit off putting but inside it is clean and comfortable and efficiently run  Do not confuse this hotel with the Godwin Hotel next door which is truly awful but run surprisingly by the same owners  We were informed that it is due to be demolished and rebult in   The rooftop restaurant of the Grand Godwin is clean  nice staff and the food good  The included buffet style breakfast was very good  Rooms are well furnished  hot water and aircon all worked as did the cable TV some rooms have wide screen There is free wireless internet in the hotel lobby or you can use the hotel computers for a small charge  Best of all it is a  rupee auto rickshaw ride   mins depending on time of day to the New Delhi train station and not too far from Connht Place The hotel gets booked out so best to book ahead if you can All in all a good place to stay and fair value by Delhi standards  
P => Good for Price We arrived at  am and after battling with a pre paid taxi driver who suddenly couldnt find the hotel arrived with the       They had us sorted and in our room  We didnt much like it so next day requested to change and did so to a front street facing room which was fantastic  The breaky was great and hearty and the restaurant even served pretty good dishes for lunch  The location is the only issue  If your female expect heaps of hassles and expect heaps of poverty  My partner was never comfortable walking the streets at night and so we only travelled by autorickshaw  If I went again I wouldnt stay in Old Delhi    and thats coming from someone who always likes to stay in the guts of things  They organised us a driver for a day at a reasonable rate  Expect to tip at this hotel  Many hotels have communal tipping jars which is better   pain in the    to have to constantly stick your hand in your pocket and to have to scrounge for small notes with this in mind It was a lovely hotel and clean   very clean  I still would recommend it though  Pretty good value for   
P => threw out my reservation Dont bother making a booking  If the hotel is full theyll give away your room to anyone walking in off the street  You can confirm your booking tell them when you will arrive leave a copy of your passport do everything they ask and they still will not hold your room for you I watched them give away a room  mins  after a guest booked it   in person   while he was down the street getting his luggageAt the hotel next door they told me this happens several times a day every day The staff at the GG reception is positively useless  
P => Perfect locations Great location very close to New Delhi train station which was perfect for an early morning train journey to Agra or anywhere else  The hotel is on a street that runs parallel with the main bazaar but isn t directly on it  The main bazaar street is the centre of Paharaganj and is where a lot of the guest houses bars and restaurants are  Only takes a few minutes to walk there but quite nice to go back to your hotel to escape from it  Location great as a good base for the first visit to Delhi and could easily get a rickshaw to sights The main bazaar has great shopping for your typical traveller   shortlong trousers which lots of European women travellers wore and a really good buy bags incense sticks with loads of other things  If you ve been to Thailand then this is the closest thing to Khao San Road  More hectic as is all of India and less bars but the closest thing in Delhi  There s also the most amazing jewellery shop that s the best in everywhere we went in India  It s like an Aladdin s cave and I could have stayed for hours You can also buy the Indian bangles that are everywhere  There s a lady that sits in the fork in the road and she has some great colours for about  rupees for   There are quite a lot of places to eat and drink but we found that if you trust the lonely planet you cannot go wrong  We ate first at a bar called The Gem Bar on the straight part of the main bazaar  The staff were really friendly and the food was OK but as the book says we would recommend this more for a drink rather than an eating place  Again following the book s advice gets you a good restaurant and the Metropolis is a great choice  It s also a hotel and from what we could see it looked OK to stay and was our second choice if we couldn t stay at Grand Godwin  Nice rooftop restaurant and the butter chicken was lovely  Again it s a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the street The Grand Godwin hotel includes breakfast and the freshly cooked omelettes are a good start to the day  The hotel will look after your valuables behind reception which is handy and they do change money but there s another place down a side road opposite that does a better rate  There s a TV in the room not that you need it a hot shower and the standard room and perfectly big enough Would recommend it for anyone on their first visit and especially for the station  
P => Surprisingly good accomodations in New Delhi During our month long journey through India we were in New Delhi on  arate occasions  Its unfortunate we did not discover the Grand Godwin until our last stay  For starters the hotel is a short walk to the New Delhi train station  It is also a short autorickshaw ride to many New Delhi sites such as India Gate C P  and museums  The rates are good the rooms are clean and if I remember correctly they offer complimentary breakfast All in all one of the better values in New Delhi 
P => Really great hotel in paharganj close to everything We went to India for a wedding and stayed in Delhi in the Grand Godwin before and after  For almost all of it I am quite satisfied with the place  The rates are great and the staff most but not all are friendly and helpful and gracious  You  experience difficulty when you make an arrangement with one person currently on duty and then face another person on duty the next daylater in the day who has no idea of the arrangements and refuses to accept it  Perhaps ask for things in writing signed Nevertheless the hotel is wonderful  Their travel desk though probably more expensive than hacking it yourself is worthwhile when you consider the quothassle factorquot e g  getting off at a train station and being mobbed by toutstaxi driversetc  The place is clean the rooms are wonderful and the bathrooms are very good with hot water  The food is really good and the breakfast buffet is totally worth is  I would advise anybody going to Delhi to stay in Grand Godwin  We saw some Indian people staying there as well so obviously locals also consider it worthwhile Its well placed in that it is within walking distance of the New Delhi train station as well as the New Delhi Metro  If youre up for it rather walk there than get a rickshawtaxi as theyll charge you tourist rates to go really close  You can catch the Metro to many major places and even Karol Bagh and Connht Place shopping  The Metro is really very nice and worth using to travel around Delhi though not in rush hour and watch out for pick pockets  Some areas are not yet serviced by the Metro but it is ever expanding We had only  incidents worth moaning about at the hotel  We were three in a room and one of us was leaving at am for their earlier flight  The bathroom door became stuck and she couldnt get out  Eventually we had  guys from the hotel in the room trying to get the door open it was  minutes before her taxi was arriving to take her to the airport  They realised the urgency and broke the door down  However the rest of us only left at pm and there was obviously a shift change and the new guys apparently didnt know anything about the door  We had gone off in our taxi when they phoned the driver and asked him to bring us back to the hotel to answer for the broken door  They wanted us to pay  After some quotheated discussionquot someone relayed the information that the door had become stuck and that we werent at fault Also a small tip try and avoid the number  room on each floor etc as this is directly across from the supply closet where the staff member on duty any of them will noisily spend his time playing cell phone games chatting loudly to other staff packing and cleaning at all hours of the day and night Nice benefits the plug with multiple types cell chargers already installed in case you forgotmisplaced your charger aircon hot water free cold sealed mini waters on arrival nice tv with loads of channels room service any time of the day or night travel desk  
P => A pleasant Surprise Long but helpful review I have been to Delhi on a number of occasions for my personal business and on each visit I have tried to find a new hotel that meets the following formula best hotel  cheapest rates  Now this for those who have been to Delhi or any part of India know is virtually impossible  Hotels in India are VERY expensive  A  Star hotel in Toronto thats where I am from would be classified as a  Star in Delhi with the price of a  Star in Toronto  So when I hear or read other reviews from people who have not been to any part of India and expect so much I cant help but smile  So here is my advise to everyone from N America or UK or Australia or NZ or any first world country dont expect too much     even if you have to dish out night  Dont expect the hotel that you will have booked your room in to be like one of the hotels in Toronto or Chicago or Auckland or Melbourne  Unless of course you are willing to pay about  night  Having said that you could get lucky as I did on my last trip to Delhi last month   On my previous trip to Delhi in ember  I stayed at the Mehga Sheraton in Karol Bagh  Apparently the owner of this hotel Naresh owns two other hotels not far from each other the Mehga Sheraton the Madonna and third hotel I cannot remember  The Madonna is the quottop of the line from all three with rooms at about Rs night US    Rs  a   The Megha Sheraton that I stayed at was around Rs    The room was small the bathroom smelly the couch stained and lots of noise  And get this the site advertises quotFree internetquot  But you have to go to the Madonna hotel to use the internet the one I was staying at does not have it  So anyhow on my last trip to Delhi I found this gem of a hotel  The Grand Godwin or be its the The Godwin Grand  Now again dont compare this to a hotel in a first world city  But for the price of Rs   US   this hotel was twice as nice as the Megha Sheraton and lest than half the price Finally I had found a gem  The bathroom was clean the room was spacious the service excellent the hotel itself rooms lobby very clean  And it had wireless internet that actually worked The hotel also has a sister hotel The Godwin located right next to it in the Pahar Ganj area  The Pahar Ganj area itself is not very clean  Its crowded congested and smelly  But because I was out most of the day and in my hotel at night it didnt really bother me  The New Delhi Railway Station is about a  minute WALK from the hotel  Connht Place locally known as CP is a downtown core with plenty of shopping and restaurants and is about  minutes auto rickshaw ride from the hotel  For those people who are on a budget I strongly suggest you check this hotel out A few tips about travel to India   DO NOT trust information about hotels on their websites  Most of the time it is misleading  For eg  the Internet scenario at the Mehga Sheraton on my    trip   Most hotel managers not all will smile bend over backwards for you and while doing that will empty out your pockets  Be st and ALWAYS negotiate   When planning a stay in a Delhi hotel or any hotel in India NEVER book through any online consolidators Expedia Travelocity etc even if it is a few dollars cheaper  You have to pay in advance for the number of days that you will be staying and should you not be happy with the hotel after your first night you are stuck And recovering any money would be a nighte if not impossible  Best thing is to get the tel  number of the hotel call them and book a room for  night  Try it out and if you dont like it you can change the hotel  Of course the risk with that is they  not have rooms available for more than one night  But if you are travelling during off peak months you should be alright  Some of these hotels when booking will ask for your credit card info  I normally dont give it out and almost always pay by cash   Peak months in Delhi ember to ruary  Pleasant weather  Between  and tember it is very hot and generally off peak months  During these months you can most likely negotiate room rates   Most hotels charge about   tax on hotel rooms  Be sure to ask if the rate you are being quoted includes tax   Ask questions  If you are told quotthere is Internet connectionquot ask if the Internet is in the same hotel that you are staying  If they say they offer wireless internet ask if it works  I am saying this from experience   Be polite to the locals  They work very hard and are very poor  They have less than   of what we have in N America or other developed countries  Negotiate with them for eg  the rickshaw people with cycles who transport you for the best price  But then when you arrive at your destination give them a little more  Many times I had travelled by these rickshaws and see them sweat as they work their way through traffic and in the heat  I normally give them about Rs   more than what they had asked for  And the look in their eyes the gratitude they display just melts my heart  For me that Rs   is fractionally more than a dollar but for him it will feed his entire family for that evening  Be generous at the same time be wise   Finally go to India with a totally different frame of mind  Dont expect things there to work as efficiently as in your own city  When things dont go right and believe me there will be many times when they wont bear it tolerate it and lh it off  When you say quotwell   back home things are done this way or that way or this fastquot you will end up having the most miserable time of your life  India is India Period  End of Story  Be open minded and enjoy  It took me a long time to figure this out  Earlier when I used to go to Delhi Id want to come back back to Toronto after  days During my last trip I went to India with a different frame of mind and enjoyed my stay  Or perhaps it was the euphoria I experienced when I found the right hotel Anyhow hope this has helped and enjoy your trip  I will be going back in ober  if anyone is planning a trip to Delhi around that time wants to hook up  
P => A clean well maintained hotel with reasonable rates At last a clean well maintained hotel in Delhi with reasonable rates  After  weeks of travelling through India it was so comforting to find clean linen and a well maintained hotel where everything actually works The hotel is on a busy street close to New Delhi Railway Station but the rooms are quiet  Booking was a breeze with the excellent website  I paid  for a single including breakfast  Strongly recommended  
P => Great hotel w wonderful restaurant We stayed at the Grand Godwin not the Grand Godwin Deluxe This hotel is a great value  The hotel lobby is snazzy w ble and a glass elevator  The room single Deluxe was on the smaller side but was clean and nice  The bathroom also was clean  It has fast internet in the lobby  The restaurant on the top floor surprised us because it had really wonderful food and I think we had our best meal of India there Altogether a great value  I paid  for the night  It was very very reasonably priced  I would definitely recommend this place to people who are looking for a good mid range hotel  
P => ent hotel in Delhi We had travelled to India on a previous trip and stayed in the same area Pahar Ganj  This is the rundown cheap traveller area and a bit of a shock if you havent been to India before  However the area was safe to walk around and a convenient location We arrived late at night and were quickly checked in and brought to our room a couple of minutes later we were called by the front desk and they had given us the super deluxe room instead of the deluxe we had booked and paid for  They said we could move the next day  After a great nights rest and breakfast at the hotel we had our bags ready to move but our new room wasnt ready and we wanted to go sightseeing  The hotel had no problem with us staying in the superdeluxe room until later that day  Overall the rooms both the deluxe and superdeluxe were a great size with clean bathrooms  The staff was very helpful and always pleasant  I recommended this to other travellers later in our trip and they stayed and enjoyed their stay as well  
P => good choice in Delhi This hotel was quite a good experience for us  It is certainly not fancy but more than adequate  The rooms were clean and the hotel staff were organized and helped us with our travel arrangements  We found accomadation in delhi to be either too expensive or cheap and got very strong negative reviews  This place is close to the train station which is handy and had good food at the restaurant  They picked us up from the airport our first night there which was great and had all our train tickets and flights booked and ready for us the following morning  We made prior arrangements which saves alot of hassel especially if you are short on time everything books up fast so plan ahead either on your own or through a good agent  In all honesty Delhi is not a place where you will spend alot of time  Its a big dirty city with alot of noise and poverty however this hotel for us was a good place to stay while in transit to other places  We stayed in both regular rooms and a suite for one night  There is litle if any difference between them so opt for the cheaper rooms as you will probably not be staying long and its really not worth the extra expense  The area is close to a tourist ket which is okay and there is some restaurants there  If you are choosing to stay for more than a day or two you  want a nicer place closer to tourist spots but for a day or two its a good choice for exploring and transit through delhi  
P => Great Hotel Review prepared by two senior citizen couples that have traveled extensively in the far east and limited their hotel cost to between  and  US per room per night  Stayed in this hotel on two occasions for one night each at a cost of  per night per room including breakfast  Found hotel to be excellent  Rooms were clean of sufficient size central air conditioning and heat central hot water and met all our expectations of a hotel in the city  Bathroom was fully adequate  Breakfast buffet on roof was adequate but not extraordinary  Hotel personnel were friendly courteous and very professional  Hotel is located near New Delhi train station on a street that has an estimated  hotels  The Grand Godwin appeared to be the one of the newest and best  Ten minute taxi from Connht Plaza  Recommend hotel highly and will stay there on next trip to Delhi  Hotel has own website and recommend booking directly through it  
P => OK Hotel Can dDo Worse and Can Do Better Currently staying at the Grand Godwin Hotel until th    Booked directly after finding their home page The hotel is situated in the back streets of the Paharhganj district of Delhi As the reviewer from Canada has stated they d have internet acces but i have just been informed that they charge  Rupees per hour and not free as he has stated or as it states on their card Service in general is ok  Loads of touts once you set foot outside the hotel doors  They also have a Travel and tourism desk but the bloke who runs it seems a bit of a dodgy character  We paid  Rupees each  of us for a tour of Agra Mathura and Brindravan  Sure that we could have got it cheaper So much to write about but not enough time Rooms are ok but the Super Deluxe rooms dont have fridges and so you cant chill your drinks etc  
P => best value This small friendly cheap clean hotel is by far the best option I found in Delhi in the  star range  Conveniently located next to the train station its the perfect place to stop while traveling through Delhi  They have an internet connection that doesnt work superbly well but is free  And you can make cheap phone calls abroad  The restaurant is very ent

P => Very Good I stayed here for almost a week while attending a conference in the same hotel Found the place quite good in terms of the rooms amenities facilities like the restaurant and conference setup  Large rooms and a great buffet in the restaurants were definite plus points One negative factor is that the place was a little bit far from for example the city centre  Otherwise it was good  
P => 
P => Great hotel  Perfect launchpad from which to see Delhi then return and unwind  Delhi and the Hans Plaza was my first stop in India  I had no idea what to expect so I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel  First of all its ideally located  You can hop in a tuktuk for  rupees and be at Connht Place in under  minutes  The hotel itself is a tall tower I think  stories if memory serves  The facade is undergoing some mild reations nothing major  The interior is spotless businesslike and modern  The rooms are really pleasant   excellent quiet AC nice linens modern furniture plasma TV safe great views of the city and a clean blegranite bathroom with iron blowdryer etc  Its extremely comfortable and clean  A overall The restaurants are on the nd floor  The amazing thing about this hotel is free Wifi if you stay more than  nights and also buffet breakfast excellent and a meal voucher for two people every day which can be redeemed all day anytime including after midnight  The meal voucher includes almost anything off the menu and the portions are huge  Excellent food overall first rate kitchen they are running Overall an excellent hotel for the money and the perfect place to see Delhi from  Its not uberluxurious but if you want a clean neat modern spot to come back to and showersleep its perfect  
P => Centrally Located  This is one of the good hotel located centrally in New Delhi  Very much in the heart of the city i e CP  View of the capital city Delhi from room s window is velous  You can have a bird s view amp that is the most important point of this hotel  Its away from airport but near to railway station Rooms are clean well orated  Food is OK but very costly  Its recommended for business trip  
P => A good place to stay in Delhi We liked all the positive aspects described by other reviewers  I liked the restaurant with a view of trees Its only a short walk to circus area with shops and restaurants its not the wild west as described by a previous reviewer and apart from crossing the busy roads its safe There are also some good views across the city looking toward the train station in the distance 
P => Pleasant stay My office arranged for the hotel accomodation for this trip and i did not expect to have a hotel room on the th floor  The view of the busy roads of Delhi was quite a sight  One cant help thinking that Delhi is lucky to have such wide roads with four to six lanes on each side The room size was adequate but the carpet could do with some vacumming  The house keeping surely could improve and the standard is clearly indicated from the towels that are kept for use The food however is good  And the location of the hotel is central I would recommend this hotel as a pleasant stay provided the stay is not for more than  days  
P => Good location warm staff Have stayed at this hotel about  times during my business visit  Centrally located very good restaurants clean rooms and overall a very nice place to stay  My frequent visits were good enough for me to get upgrades  
P => Excellent clean hotel in cental Delhi We stayed in the hotel as part of a package and it was very good  They upgraded our room as we were going to be there for  nights and the rooms on the th floor are big and clean although the lifts a little erratic  The location is certainly central as its only about  minutes walk into Connht Place and  to the nearest tube but there is hassle the moment you step out the door The restaurants are good although a little on the expensive side  Breakfast a mix of indian and western food so should be plenty for most tastes  Transfers werent included in the deal so as we were arriving at  am local time after a  hour flight I e mailed to arrange a pick up  They charged a whooping  rupees for this whereas local taxi companies charge normally  rupees so worth e mailing one of the reliable companies in Delhi instead  
P => Comfortable clean hotel in good location Excellent hotel although slightly overpriced  Clean comfortable rooms  Great location  Helpfull staff but extras such as tours organised through the hotel more expensive than at other hotels we stayed at  
P => Very nice hotel  I stayed in this hotel for  nights for the start of a   week tour of India and was pleasantly surprised The room although not very large was beautifully appointed Nice clean and modern bathroom The breakfasts were great  Interesting Indian food as well as continental Good location   close to the very clean and modern metro line I would certainly consider staying here again In my opinion it was an excellent introduction to India  
P => Book through their website not over the phone or via a third party After perusing tripadvisor and seeking a place in downtown Delhi for  and quality we found this one  I checked out their website and found a rate of   Couldnt believe it so I called them  They quoted my  on the phone  I told them that theyre site was   They agreed  THIS WAS UARY ND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN  I then went to expedia and bla bla and they all quoted over   So I booked online Then after I booked they sent me an email if I had any special requests  Great service I asked for two housecoats some slippers a good bathtub and a high floor  No problem We arrived at around pm and sure enough all of our requests were met The room is wonderfully clean with a great bed and good room service  The rates are all fine and it really is a  star The location is gold but still a rickshaw is required as there are plenty of pathetic touts around the hotel  We had two follow us to practice thei englishso I just took a photo of them and walked up to a police officer  They ran  I just asked the police officer the time but anyway it worked Great place very clean and honest front desk people  incredible price and the best accom secret in Delhi  
P => Stayed Twice During a Recent Vacation A perfectly acceptable hotel  Nothing special but clean and modern  Good central location  
P => Clean hotel helpful staff convenient location Firstly you need to look beyond the exterior of the hotel which is absolutely terrible and in serious need of updating    the inside of the Hans is clean well looked after and the rooms are well furnished and a reasonable size  They are also high enough away from the street to shield you from the incessant traffic noise outside remember this is the centre of Delhi The staff speak good English and were helpful and attentive to our many requests at any time of day or night including helping to dress a saree for the wedding we were attending  They are also generous with providing complimentary bottled water which is a must in India The complimentary breakfast is of a good quality runs until am if you dont want to get up too early and the choice is reasonable  The hotel restaurant offers both Indian and Western food and the standard is quite high The location is convenient being   minutes walk from Connht Place  But be warned it really is a walk on the wild side Despite being right by a supposedly upket shopping area in the nations capital you should be prepared for manic and downright dangerous traffic beggars thieves wild dogs roaming the streets people constantly trying to sell you trinkets or get you into a rickshaw dust dirt and pollution that hurts your eyes and throat  Suffice to say we only tried this walk once In sumy the Hans Hotel is rare in being a good quality mid range hotel in a convenient location  If you really have to go to Delhi and dont want to run to  star prices or risk somewhere more downket then this is a good choice  
P => Stayed here ember  Stayed  nights at the Hans Hotel in ember   Didnt actually stay in the room much as I was on tours all day both days  This is one of the least expensive but nicer hotels though the Deluxe room is a bit small The problem I had is that I called Housekeeping  times to bring a power adapter as my universal kit does not fit the power outlets in India  They kept saying quotyesquot but it never came  
P => Looks Belie The Facts We booked three rooms for our family members on our way back to Auckland after the riage of our son in Amritsar The hotel looks okay but the office staff are terrible eg I get a call at pm one night asking me when will I settle the hotel bill The Italian Restaurant meal had a fly cooked in our fried egg  miraculously they did not charge us for that meal  Kaffe restaurant meals and staff were the best thing this hotel has got Showers in the room leaked toilet paper was rationed as if there is a world wide shortage On my advice a family has this week cancelled their booking at Hans Plaza  it is well located but the charges are like a five star  
P => Terrible customer service This hotel is in the heart of the city and centrally located  However that customer service is terrible  There were so many issues including the additional dollars they charged for a cancelled night  The manager was least helpful if trying to work with a customer who has been to the hotel before  Yes the hotel is close by the train station and in the middle of delhi and the price is not bad  However the customers are paying for a service which is not there  From the bell hop to the front desk clerk to the manager and the restaurant staff there is no hospitality  I am not going to stay here anyone  
P => Not worth the money I stayed at the Hans for one night because it was close to New Delhi Railway station  I was told by the front desk who checked me in that I was upgraded to a better room so was happy  Upon initial entry the room seemed good enough and worthy of the  star rating of the hotel As well as the high price for India However as soon as I looked at the bed I found that three of the four pillows on the bed did not have pillow covers and two of the four pillows had horrible yellow stains on them not a good start  Also I found some tiny insects walking on the bed sheet the room wasnt bright enough and I didnt have a flash light but I am fairly confident they looked like baby bed bugs  The bathroom only had one towel and the shampoo bottle was already opened and previously used  If this were a budget hotel I would not complain but this is a five star hotel and is the most expensive hotel I stayed in India but was by far the worst  There is also a lot of noise from the street some people  say this is India but I stayed in other hotel that were very quiete at night  
P => Really good hotel but a bit overexpensive This hotel is located at a great location close to tar Mantar and a Metro Station  We were served with drinks upon arrival and even our rooms were upgraded to a bigger one  The food is perhaps the best that Ive had in New Delhi The food served at the Kaffa restaurant at the Hans is better than all of the Five Star Hotels that Ive stayed at in New Delhi even though it is only a Four Star Hotel  The staff was friendly and cooperative and the rooms were EXTREMELY clean  The or was soothing to the eyes  The buffet breakfast was also excellent   I recommend their doughnuts especially The downside is that the food and beverages were ridiculously expensive and service charges were astronomical In fact The Intercontinental The Grand which is just a stones throw away from this hotel is actually cheaper to the Hans in this regard  The airport taxi that we requested was also unbelievably highly priced for New Delhi About  rupees  Cellphone reception was also terrible as my Airtel line was continuously searching for a Network except at the doors entrance But I had a wonderful stay and look forward to come back to this hotel someday  
P => Reasonable Stay   But be careful of the details      The Hans Plaza is a clean and centrally located hotel which offers one a sense of comfort at what seems to be a reasonable price for Delhi  inc  taxes per night  Overall staff was very friendly   but one has to be careful of a few things  There are vast differences bw the different rooms with regard to confort and age of beds etc  Also ask for room facing North quieter and better view   If everything goes OK  then things are great   if not   it is hard to get satisfaction  We received a room where the airconditioner quotbubbledquot for about an two hours  They could not reallty fix it and were not terribly interested in compensating us for the above   though we lost two hours of sleep because of the above    Do not use their car services they are far too expensive But all in all  a reasonable place if you keep in mind the above  
P => Great place to stay for a cheap price This was a great hotel for the price  It does not have all the fancy frills and thrills that the five star hotels in Delhi have but you also dont have to pay   to stay here  The resteraunts at the hotel are good and offer a variety of foods to eat  I stayed in three different rooms over a  week period and all the rooms were clean  They upgraded me the last day I stayed there to the deluxe room which was very nice  I would definitely recommend staying here if your looking for a good room at a cheap price cheap for New Delhi  
P => Great hotel We stayed here as part of a tour group and had an excellent stay  The rooms were a good size and start on the th floor going up to the th floor from what I could tell by the buttons in the lift floors   were missing  This meant for good views over Delhi from the room which was great as I could watch the black kites circling in the sky outside  The beds were a ent size and comfortable and although the room felt very cold at least the air conditioning was adjustable so I could make it a more suitable temperature The bathroom was clean and of a good size   the shower area was great as there was plenty of space to dry off as well as shower We ate at the Kaffe restaurant on the nd floor and found the food of a high standard trying out a variety of foods including the pizza thai curry burger and hotpot  It was some of the best food Ive eaten The service was quick and the waiters were attentive The reception staff and porters were very helpful  Currency can be changed at a very fair rate at the hotel reception and stamps can be bought from the porters   as far as I know they were also going to post my postcards for me as they told me they would deal with them  
P => Ok but a bit on the expensive side Hans Hotel is a pretty nice place  The rooms are big the views are nice and the restaurant is good  In fact as an American traveling in India for several weeks it was absolutely wonderful as they served beef I cannot tell you how awesome that was  The price is a bit high for what you get but then again Delhi is not exactly an easy place to nab a room for a good price  Overall my experience was good  The staff seems pretty willing to help  They were quite good at helping me out of a jam with a driver who clearly tried to overcharge me for a day trip around Delhi  The location is quite good also right in the heart of New Delhi not down some dark and disgusting alley  If the price is right seriously consider going with them 
P => St modern hotel We stayed here as part of a private tour and I was impressed with the hotel  We had a good first night here after arriving by plane and a pleasant pit stop on the last night of the tour From the description it seems rather expensive but as has been said elsewhere this is an expensive city for hotels and there isnt really a middle ground  Its not in the same league as the big name hotels but Id stay here again If I were going to invest in something Id buy a Travel Lodge franchise in India and set up low cost modern hotels 
P => Good average Stayed at the Hans Hotel no longer Hans Plaza beginning of ober  Reception was friendly  We arrived earlier than expected in the morning they still gave us a room earlier than booked for but had to wait a little while  The rooms are on the  th floor so there is an excellent view over delhi  The room was quota good averagequot but not the rating given for the hotel  a common problem in Delhi  We had booked directly on the hotels web site which was a rate as good as any other internet booking engine  At the beginning of ober I would say the prices were ok for Delhi but the rose significantly later in th month  Breakfast buffet was adequate but not a huge selection  When we looked at the building on the outside we were shocked at the statte of the facade floors below the hotel floors and hoped it did not reflect the state of the building structure  fotos Hotel is within walking distance of Connht Place Prepaid taxi from delhi airport is the best option  For retrun to the airport the reception offered ther own cars more expensive  but also offered to phone a taxi 
P => Beware An average hotel with lifts that dont workBeware of using their phone I made a five minute call to the UK and they tried to charge me over  The location is good but the restaurant is overpriced You can do better 
P => Average Hotel in Delhi The Hans Hotel is well located in Conht Place  It ia a bit poor hotel for the price  In Europe you would get a far better hottel fot the price you pay  But Delhi in general is far more expensive then the rest of India in terms of hotels and I belive there is no mid range  Nothing special just clean  The air conditioning works well it is actually pretty cold in the hotel and the breakfast not bad  
P => Great relief to get to the Hans Plaza Great location within walking distance to great restaurants shopping and subwaymetro station right around the corner Welcoming drinks very helpful staff clean and modern facilities The restaurant has good breakfast Indian and Western We stayed at this hotel during the last part of our trip to India which was a great relief for us after being just about everywhere Two minor issues  The charge and not cheap for internet access in the room   Some people arrived in the middle of the night with zero common sense making plenty of noise Bottom line trying to save some money staying somewhere cheaper  be a really bad experience  This is a safe bet and good value  
P => Incredible IndiaIncredible Hans    We were a group of friends on our nd trip to Incredible India and we must say that she was enchanting as ever and the stay at Hans was the icing on the cake  A fabolous hotel run by a wonderful team  Personalized but at the same time professional  Special thanks to the ever so friendly Front office team FampB team and the perfect service from the House keeping  The rooms were spec and clean at all times  The USP of Hans is the splendid view you will have of Delhi from the rooms  With the rooms on the    th floor you cant ask for anything more grandeur  If we go in search of short comings the only draw back  a minute one is in the Italian Restaurant when cooking with cheeses it will be great if you could mention in the menu as well the type of cheeses used because the cheese can change the flavour of the dish completely and rightfully it will be great to know whether its your preferred choice  And to serve double esspressos in the appropriate cup rather than a normal coffee cup  Th reason being that The infrastructure and the or of the Restaurants are definitely to the latest International dining experiences the accompanying cutleries and the crockeries should definitely compliment it  Rest assured ITS DEFINITELY VALUE FOR MONEY AND DEFINITELY SALUTES INCREDIBLE INDIA  Thanks to the wonderful team for making our stay memorable  Alessia FalconiFederica Cenci Carmine Selvaggio Mirko Mancuso Antony John  
P => Good location lovely hotel This is a well situated hotel  I was pleasantly surprised with my room it was larger than average very clean and of a high  star standard  Breakfast was always a treat and I ordered room service once which was also very good and reasonably priced  The staff were courtious and very helpful  The hotel is a  min walk to the metro   an excellent way to get around Overall Hans Plaza is highly recommended   and Im very fussy so thats a huge compliment 
P => Average hotel good restaurant I stayed here as part of a tour group   but Ive seen how expensive it is on their website and I would have not paid that much Rooms   clean and comfortable   great views over New DelhiReception staff   not brilliant   short changed on our currency exchange got our alarm call wrong called us  hour early   irritating Housekeeping   came very quickly when I complained the hairdryer didnt work  Noise   no double glazing here   plus there was building works during the day Restaurant   good breakfasts and worth a visit for lunch or dinner  Staff here very friendly although getting a cup of tea in the morning is a bit of an effort Location   good central location I wouldnt recommend this place to my friends  
P => Nice room  terrible service We booked the Hans Plaza via the internet for three people  Upon arrival we were given a room with a king size bed and told that a cot and extra amenities would be delievered soon  Despite many repeated calls to reception housekeeping and management they were never delivered  At check out we were charged an extra USD for the cot which never arrived  When discussed with management they refused to amend the bill  The room itself was modern and clean  but pity about the terrible service  
P => standard well located and friendly We stayed  nights in Hans Plaza at arrival and departure from India in  ch   First time the room needed reation but the second room on the th floor was OK with a superb view  The lobby area is not very accomodating but the staff was friendly and helpfull  Its worth the price 
P => Good hotel    stars Stayed in this hotel as part of group a three families on arrival in Delhi and just before departure  Had no problems with our accommodation it was clean and warm  Rception staff a bit lazy and aloof  Restaurant staff charming  Food excellent 
P => Small  A very nice hotel  We spent one night there  The Hotel lacks the facilities of pool gymetc  but the staff are very good and kind  they run a good show  Breakfast buffet is ent 
P => Hans Plaza   hit and miss I stayed in the Hans Plaza for  nights over a  day period and was impressed with  of the nights I stayed there  Was given a very nice room on the th floor each time with excellent or and in room facilities   good size bathroom also  The rd night I checked in there I was given a room on the th floor which was far inferior to their other rooms  I complained but was told they were full  No bathtub no coffeetea facilities and not even bedspreads on the beds  In my opinion only  star standard for these rooms  I was also kept waiting  hours until   for this room with no apology from reception or refreshments while waiting  I would stay here again but only if guaranteed one for their newer rooms  Breakfast is poor unless you want a cooked one stale pastries and toast otherwise  This could be an excellent hotel if they complete the refurbishment and retrain reception staff  
P => Good value for money Ive stayed in Hans Plaza in tember   Although the rooms need reation and the reception area is not that comfortable I still found it value for money  The staff was friendly and helpfull  On the last floor there is a restaurant included breakfast was very good from where if the weather is clear you have a great panorama view of Delhi  Connht Place and path are  min  walk away  
P => Ni se te ocurra alojarte en triple  
P =>   
P => Muy bueno  C ntrico   
P => 
P => Expensive for what it is I am not sure if it is worth to stay into this hotel  I think it is too expensive for what it is PROSLocationCONSThey ripped us off with the taxi cost coming from the airport use the prepaid taxi when you arrive at the airport Not really cleanNoisyForget about the restaurant 
P => Whole area   Under construction I dont know if it is the looming commonwealth games but the whole area around this hotel is under construction which made getting to it and even finding it quite difficult it also didnt feel very safe at night  Hotel staff were helpful rooms were dodgy run down and dusty well overpriced basically your paying for the city location  
P => Its somewhere to get your head down    Hotel  is an adequate hotel with a s styled interior which is quite in need of an update  It is centrally located in Connht Place and thus convenient for exploring  Our double room was cool and for a pleasant change there was no requirement for AC of the fan on during the night  Bedding was musty but clean and the or is average  Shower was hot and towels provided  Staff were friendly and helpful This is not a luxurious hotel and should not be regarded as anything other than a convenient centrally located overpriced hostel  It is absolutely a   at best and guests should not expect something modern or luxurious  
P => Adequate and comfortable good service Hotel  is an excellent option to stay when exploring Delhi Rooms are clean staff are friendly good airport pick up Be aware of unscrupulous travel agents that roam around and in the hotel  
P => Ticks most of the boxes for budget accommodation in Delhi I have been staying at the quotquot for nearly twenty years on a fairly regular basis and do not recognise some of the negative reviews which have been posted regarding it  No its not a luxury hotel it doesnt claim to be nor does it have a sumptuous dining room or gorgeous bathrooms  What it does have is friendly and unfailingly helpful management and staff comfortable and clean rooms and in the very heart of New Delhi superbly located for the railway station by the way  The tariff is not bargain basement but then what is cheap in Delhi nowadays but given its plus points I wouldnt stay anywhere else although I would avoid the front rooms which tend to be a little noisy 
P => hi ther im nshat from iraq thes hotel it is Very good and Comfortable and Good service and The most important thing in Central City I stayed three days in it 
P => Hotel  inexpensive and safe  I had a nice stay at Hotel   Before one books here they need to set their expectations  This is a one star hotel with  rooms  I stayed here for three weeks  I have never been waited on hand and foot like I was at Hotel   You have to take advantage of their hospitality  The breakfast menu was a bit limited but the food was very good  I commonly would tell the manager I wanted some food not on the menu and it would appear about twenty minutes later  They will send someone to one of the local restaurants to get what ever you desired The rooms and bathrooms are clean  They are simple and the fixtures are about  years old but considering how horrid an Indian public bathroom can smell there was nothing wrong with Hotel s bathrooms  They did not smell at all  They always had hot water  I would not recommend drinking the hotels tap water but they provide bottled mineral water I never saw any bugs in my room however on the terrace there were some small leafhoppers  These seem to be every where in Delhi  I really enjoyed the terrace however I wish they had turned the lights off at night so the leafhoppers were not as bad  The terrace is pretty with potted plants and stucco walls  Its kind of amusing the furniture on the terrace is plastic  My friends and I spent many nights enjoying that terrace The staff was very trustworthy  That is important in a city that likes to hustle the tourists  I accidentally left my door open a few times and no one ever entered  The manager is Mohan he was helpful arranging my travel to Jaipur and finding drivers for travel in Delhi  If you ask nicely they might let you use their office computer for internet otherwise there is no wireless or ethernet There are some things that I think were funny but some would find a bit odd  Remember this is India if you are traveling here you should immerse yourself in their culture  There were two staff members who sometimes slept in the hall at night  They were very nice gentle hearted men and I was told that they were there to serve the clients who  be arriving very late at night  On busy nights they did not have enough room to accommodate all of their staff members  I got used to it  If you need something just tell them and it will be in your hand within  seconds  There are some rooms without windows which seem to be quieter the Delhi traffic is loud  I think the first floor is a bit quieter You have to get used to having people do everything for you  You will never carry a bag and the chi tea flows like water  I met many interesting European travelers here  Many females stayed at the hotel while I was here and they said they felt very safe The hotel is in Connht place  If it your first time to Delhi you  want to avoid walking around Connht at first until you become more saavy at dealing with the people of the street  The hotel provided us with a car right as we walked out of the door and took us to some nice peaceful places in Delhi  
P => Worst hotel in Delhi This is probably the worst hotel that Ive resided in New Delhi  I still remember opening the wardrobe and a flurry of mosquitoes burst out It was horrifying  I requested the hotel staff to atleast spray some insect repellant but it fell on deaf years  The rooms were terrible and moldy  Avoid like the plague 
P => Worst hotel ever This hotel has GOT to be the most squalid and disgusting place ive ever seen and ive stayed in some dives  Words cannot describe how repulsive this place really is  We stayed in Delhi for  nights and heard about hotel  from the lonely planet  The hotel website is incredibly misleading and claims to be  star when I would question how it was ever classified as a  star  In line with other reviews the driver never arrived at the airport although the manager was adament that he was still waiting for us once we had arrived at the hotel  They gave us a filthy small and stinking room at the front of the hotel overlooking the road  After complaining about the noise they moved us to the nd floor at the rear of the hotel  This room was also filthy and looked like a prison cell  The bathroom was full of mould grime and limscale and the bedding was filthy  The hotel staff were lounging around drinking  Cutlery and soiled linen was strewn in the corridors and remained there the  nights we were there  The roof terrace if you can call it that is big enough for  plastic chairs which were also covered in black grime and mould  Thankfully the  full day we spent at the hotel was taken on a day trip to Agra  On our return which we were dreading the room had not even been touched since we left at am  I felt really unsafe especially since there appeared to be only one entrance the hotel is situated up  flights of stairs above a shop and no fire exits  The manager was very quick to mention that the lonely planet had the star rating wrong  they accurately classify it as a  star whereas the website says its a  star  He told us he always recommends his website as the information in the lonely planet is wrong  Frankly it ruined our experience of Delhi and I wish I had photos to add to my review to show how disgusting and squalid the place really is  
P => okay If you are expecting any kind of luxury you will be disappointed hotel website in this case is perhaps a bit misleading but if you want reasonably priced in terms of its excellent location basic accomodation than you cant go wrong  Staff were fairly helpful  All in all I was quite satisfied with what I got for my money  Could have paid less and stayed further out from the centre but enjoyed waking up and having everything on my doorstep seeing as it was a short stay  Though with the advent of the Metro this location advantage  become less pronounced as it takes   minutes to travel in from cheaper location  
P => the absolute worst If you enjoy staying in a windowless grotty and filthy room smelling of gasoline with the noise of about  indian guys yelling their head off until the early hours in front of your door next to the reception go on and book this hotel  And the guy at the reception works together with some other locals that hang around in the lobby who try to scam you every way possible they did the whole phoning the airline to reconfirm a flight and discovering there is no reservation charade selling ridiculously expensive tours that are crap and every other scam they think you might fall for     This is absolutely the worst place i have stayed in while in India 
P => hotel           Arrived late at night on train and didnt really have any other options at that time the room was already booked when we arrived we found that the room charge they had up on the board was  Rups more than the Indiatourism pamphlet indicated got into room and it was terrible small grotty and generally crap  Were quite concerned that we would have visitors with more than two legs during the night  Left first thing in morning just couldnt be bothered arguing Best advise stay as far away from here as you can avoid it like the plague try something around main bazaar much cheaper and alot nicer  Connht place is not the location it is cracked up to be  
P => 
P => An OK hotel for someone who wants to visit CP New Delhi Well its a very average hotel with congested and small rooms  However the AC was comfortable and the bathrooms neat and clean Its a hotel that is ideal for a short stay and charges around Rs   per night for double room I guess the main advantage of this hotel is its proximity to the best resturants and shopping place in delhi  Its located in the P block at CP   There is a Mc Donalds right below the hotel and other famous eating joints like Nirulas KFC Rodeo  etc are  mins walk The PVR Plaza and PVR Revoli are  mins walk from the hotel Overall an ok property to stay if you are planning to spend most of your time around CP  
P => Overpriced with terrible service I stayed at this hotel for  nights in    It was my th visit to India and this is the worst hotel Ive seen in the country  My wife and I had booked a double room over the phone and followed this up with an e mail  As we were arriving at am we wanted security that a room would be availabe  However when we arrived after a  hour flight they had let our room go  More accurately they said our room was quotunder constructionquot  No idea what this meant but as it was am we had to make do with a single room which was drab cramped and hadnt been updated for about  years  We were given a camp bed which promptly collapsed  The showers dont provide hot water in the night   it takes between   minutes to quotwarm upquot  We got no apology for the cock up just a shrug of the shoulders  We have relatives in Delhi  They were surprised that we were staying there as it has a terrible reputation  I really would avoid this place   its overpriced for what you get  And the service is really poor  In the interests of fairness the location is good if youre interested in shopping at Connht Place  And the restaurant is excellent   the food was tasty safe and reasonable and the service unlike the hotel itself   excellent  
P =>  BEWARE    DONT STAY HERE  Unless you are on a budget  and less stay elsewhere  Delhi hotels are way way overpriced   keep that in mind  Stayed  night t   Hotel is about  star stayed in quotdeluxequot room slightly larger than others  Beds hard as a rock dirty no hot water  We paid AU pnight incl bfast  Hotel staff O K very relaxed vibe  Location on Connht PlaceRadial Outer near KFC McDonalds Pizza Hut Yuk dont expect an Indian experience if you stay in Connht area as its full of touts crap shopping and food  Only saving grace is the CoffeeHouse in the inner radial fantastic foodProblem with bottled water in fridge   all seals broken and different types of bottles in fridge  Asked reception for a bottle of sealed water and they gave us again an unsealed bottled you know the ring thing below the lid   broken  They are obviously just collecting bottles and refilling with Delhi water  Go  doors down to McDonalds and buy water here Rs  small bottle If you are on holiday and dont need stress spend more and go to LeMeridian or Shangri La AU pnight and have good food pool and no stress If you are on a budget stay elsewhere  
P => absolutely hopeless What a nightmere if anyone is thinking of booking this hotel then forget it it is not worth the trouble  It has a very central location in Connht Place thats the only advantage  The hotel rooms are not worth talking about  They are unclean and we had a job to get the sheets and towels changed daily  Everytime we placed the quotplease clean my roomquot tag on the door the lazy room attendant very cleverly reversed this to read quotplease do not disturbquot  Hence on our return to the room later in the day we found it as we had left it  We had to make several pleas to the manager to get our room cleaned  There is just one restaurant vegetarian which is boring and service is poor  The coffee shop has about  waiters who simply wait and watch the TV despite being called for help several times  The reception staff are just as bad Even the manager has no time for you  Overall it is the worst hotel we have ever been to so far in India  Never again 
P => Welcome to the House of Mirrors The best thing about the Alka Hotel is its good location   right in Connht Place in the very heart of New Delhi  Its a relatively clean and tidy small hotel but the or is dated  The orators   back in s or s   went beserk with mirrors One small hallway on the second floor has mirrored walls and ceilings  In my room all the walls were mirrored     stepping out of the shower and bathroom into the bedroom was my naked reflection in the mirrors into infinity not a pretty sight The lobby walls are adorned with fancy gilt framed mirrors Are the owners of this place also in the mirror business By the way the restaurant on the second floor    not the vegetarian one off the lobby    had excellant food in a dimly lit romantic setting  The staff was friendly and helpful  
P => What a horrible place We stayed there for  nights and I cant say we were very pleased with anything except the Vega restaurant  The staff speakunderstand very litle English our promised confiremd via email hotel airport pickup service never arrived and we never got a clear explanation of why    The rooms are small and old  They are also dusty toilets leak bathrooms have broken tiles the tv signals are very poor and often not there at all  Rooms with carpets have a strange smell to them The staff expected tip for the smallest things like opening the door for you  If you didn t tip they were clearly not pleased When ordering roomservice we would often get the incorrect order due to their lack of english skills  We ordered quotBlack teaquot and got a Blanket  We orderd food with NO CHILLLIES and got food so hot they probably would have had problems eating it themselfs  The phone in the room was of huge annoyance  Either they had disconnected our phone for no apparent reason or the phone simply didnt work  At any other hotel in India one gets a ent breakfast consisting of Indian dishes andor nice continental foods  Here you only get jam an omlette  pieces of dry toast warm juice and teacoffe   extra pieces of toast will cost you  Rs  The hotel is gloomey and strangely dark  It is by far luxurious or elegant  I was completely shocked when I looked at their website after staying there   the information is absolutely misleading  How such a hotel can claim to be a   hotel I cannot comprehend at all  I have stayed in   hotels that are  times better than this  This is more like a    hotel  It would make a good backpackers  
P => An awful hotel In short   horrible location albeit central on squalid Connht place   stay in South Delhi instead  Cramped dirty rooms with no window and substandard soundproofing  Staff were rude and were aggrieved when we didnt give them a tip  Avoid  
P =>   
P => 
P => Best hotel in the area Stayed for  nights  The room was clean and the staff was the best  They also had amazing food from room service  Quiet at night as well and close to the kets Do check out punjab sweets as well  Good hotel would recommend to anyone  The staff was exceptional  Oh and they also had Wi Fi  
P => Basic but good value We stayed here for  nights in total spread over three arate visits  It was organized for us as a part of a car and driver trip  It is what I would call a basic  star hotel  The room was clean and well serviced  While it didn t have a window looked onto an airshaft it was quiet  Breakfast was included in our package was served in the room and was OK  Could have upgraded it at an extra cost  Staff were friendly and helpful  The bed only had a bottom sheet and blanket but staff were happy to provide a top sheet Location is OK  Relatively quiet street with kets at one end of street  A number of reasonable restaurants in the street and internet cafes nearby  Felt quite safe walking around in the evening  Is a  minute autorickshaw ride from Connht Place  Autorickshaw drivers have trouble finding it so make sure you take a hotel business card with you  
P => 
P => Top notch service    We arrived at Aster Inn after staying in the riott in Mumbai and were expecting a massive difference as the prices were of different leagues for starters but we were pleasantly surprised  The rooms were very clean the furnishing new and the toiletries provided of a   standard  The service was definitely the best amongst all the hotel we have stayed at during our India tour  The staff went out of their way to help us be it to exchance currency to give us information about shopping areas and even negotiate Rickshaw prices before we jumped in  There is a kind of homely atmosphere at this hotel everybody is very accessible and always ready to help  I felt the bigger hotel chains lacked this personal approach and Aster Inn wins outright The breakfast was always hot timely and very tasty  The Massala Chai was to die for we ordered it everyday without fail I read a previous review about the AC being turned off and I have to say as soon as we stepped back into the hotel the staff would endeavour to turn the AC back on in our room without us having to ask  As an customer who is very passionate about eco friendliness I felt this was a very commendable simple act that could yet help the planet loads in time  I am shocked to think some customers would want the AC to remain on whilst they would be out the whole day  Top hotel top service  will definitely stay there again when I next visit Delhi  
P => Amazing Aster Inn I would like to highly recommend The Hotel Aster Inn to anybody considering staying in New Delhi for any type of trip  As a newly established hotel we found this to be great value for money  The rooms were nice and clean true to the advertising on their website  It is well located within reasonable reach of New Delhi centre  stops on the developing Delhi Metro  The service was great  The hotel staff were attentive and the manager was accommodating and helpful with all of our enquiries  Some minor criticisms though Hot water   needs notice i e  run it for about  mins Not so quick on breakfast   can take up to an hourNo internet facilities installed yet although the Manager allowed us use of his own office facility  All in all we had a great experience staying at this hotel  I definitely would stay here again if I were visiting New Delhi again 
P => Cheap but good value for money The location is a bit of a culture shock   but the hotel is a comparative oasis to the bustling and grubby streets that surround it  However its only a five minute walk to the excellent if limited metro system  The rooms are clean and comfortable with adequate showers and the staff are generally attentive even calling to ask if we wanted beer    Breakfast was painfully slow in arriving   half an hour for toast stretches credulity  However they ironed our shirts in a flash and were generally pretty good  Its not the Ritz but you its excellent value for money  
P =>   Service On our arrival at the hotel the staff were extremely friendly and helpful  They all went out of their way to help us whether it was directing us to a local hot spot  arranging a day tour to Agra or providing general tourist information  The breakfasts were delicious and the traditional masala tea addictive room service was efficient  The location is in the heart of Karol Bagh   great for shopping  I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone spending some time in Delhi whether it be for business or leisure purposes  
P => good location excellent room condition great service What I liked   only a few minutes walk from the metro station   the room looked new and well orated   enjoying air con and hot shower was no problem and there was even a fridge   hotel staff was very courteous helpful efficient and speaking perfect EnglishI suggested the hotel to offer internet access  be it will be offered when you stay there   
P => CONVENIENT MODERN AND GOOD PRICED HOTEL Its very difficutl to find a modern hotel well located in new Delhi  Aster hotel first of all is very modern the staff is extremely efficient and the location is very convenient    just  km walking from dewalan metro station and just one station from famous ket Ramakrishna Ashram g metro stop and   from Chandi Chowk historical centre We paid for a double room  rupie per night  its not so cheap if you compare to the rest of India but its among the best you can find in New Delhi In new Delhi hotel are crazy expensive in Connht place and not worthed   if you choose other convenient area the famous Pargaji where everybody goes the hotels are old and the area is dusty noisy and old Do you want to sleep and be conventiently located in a clean environement Choose Karol Baghdewalan area    Aster was our choice 
P => Overall nice and pleasent service Room condition average above average service and nice location for a budget stay in Delhi 
P => un hotel neuf dans un quartier pauvre mais typique  
P => 
P => Hazzle Free stay Telephone booking is always confirmed whenever I have stayed here  Check in is smooth  Sevice is good  Breakfast is always complimentary which is a plus  
P => Budget Hotel This hotel is one of the small hotels located in crammed up localities of Old Delhi It is recommended if money and price are a issue for you  
P => It is worthy to go Good place only several minutes from New Delhi railway station  ble floor the staff is nice asked me for water several times but finally charge me Rs its OK  The room is clean and the hotel price is reasonable cheap 
P => 
P => Hardly luxury but not that bad We stayed at the Broadway on two arate occasions as part of a recent tour to India  We had two different rooms   one at the back looking towards the mosque and another on Asif Ali road side  This is a reasonably budget hotel located on the edge of Old Delhi  The rooms we stayed in were of an acceptable standard  not exactly luxurious but you get what you pay for  The air con worked which in y was essential  The bathroom was clean  We had a friend who stayed in a single room which did not have a window   which would have been a bit depressing  So watch out for that I would agree with other reviewers that the hotel is noisy  If youre at the back you get the call to prayer from  mosques  At the front there is the incessant beeping of Delhi traffic  The best thing about the hotel was the restaurant   which has won awards for kashmiri food recently  The bar upstairs was pretty grim though   no window and therefore smelled stale  
P => Veeeeeeery noisy    I would never go back to sleep I would go back for dinner the restaurant is very nice the staff is helpful however the hotel is very old and being wakep up by the mosque every morning at  am is not my cup of tea  
P => Two weeks at the Broadway I stayed at the Broadway for the last two weeks of y  with a large group  My room was on the top floor at the back overlooking the Jama Masjid  My sense is that the quality of the rooms varies a bit  The folks in front complained of traffic noise particularly those on the lower floors  There are also rooms in the middle of the hotel that have no exterior windows just opaque glass facing the corridor  You must get used to it because no one seemed to complain about this  My room was lovely  It was very light small but clean and bright  The bathroom had ample water pressure and hot water though the shower usually took a minute to warm up  The air conditioning was quite powerful be a touch too cold  It is true that the hallways have no AC vents but enough cold air vents from the rooms to keep the halls relatively comfortable The staff were prompt in providing room service and kept the rooms clean over the two weeks  They did not pester us at all but that  be because there was no point in pestering a group or because the hotel was full so they were making money any way  Laundry was cheap and returned same day but be careful with delicate fabrics as most drying in India is done by Iron and sometimes the laundry did come back a bit damp  The mosque behind the hotel does call the neighborhood to prayer in the early morning but I found this charming  Sometimes I woke up and listened drowsily before rolling over and going back to sleep and sometimes I didnt wake up at all  On weekends all of the children of the neighborhood get out on the roof tops and fly kites  From our room we could literally see hundreds of them  Also on the weekends on the street in front of the hotel there is a used book fair  My sense is that if you are looking for a hotel that is inexpensive and not in Paharganj the Broadway is a good bet  The attached photos show our room  There are also pictures that earlier posters added of a room orated by a French designer who stayed at the hotel  Fear not almost all of the rooms in the hotel share our or and not the loud multicolor or of that room As for food we ate breakfast in Chor Bizarre every morning  The breakfast buffet was was more than adequate though the restaurant was a bit dim for a morning meal  Every morning featured hard boiled eggs as well as either omlettes or fried eggs  Also at least one curry cereal toast juice tea or coffee and on some days fried veggie cutlets or samosas  There was fruit juice and they will bring bananas on request  It is true that there was no other fresh fruit but this is India  We were also fed lunch in a conference room which gave us a sample of what the kitchen can do  Suffice it to say that lunch was generally excellent and Im sure that those eating at the restaurant for lunch or dinner would agree  As for the bar Thugs yes it is a bit of a dive  Who wants to go to India to drinkAs for location a tuktuk to CP or New Delhi stationpaharganj cost  Rs  The Muslim neighborhoods behind the hotel are interesting to walk in but better to go in a group  I saw no obvious dangers but one of our more intrepid members did come down with a nasty virus The Broadway is not the lap of luxury  But it is a solid mid range hotel in the heart of Delhi that exceeded my expectations and is definitely better than most of the reviews here would indicate  
P => Common areas look great        This hotel was booked as part of a package tour of Rajasthan and Agra  It lived up to most of the reviews   an average sort of place  The common areas were quite clean and attractive including the breakfast room  The room itself was fairly large with twin beds and nicely appointed  It looks like the furniture and fixtures were recevently updated although the walls were stained  The bathroom shower sprayed a fine mist but the vent vents into the hallway so not only is your privacy compromised but youll also hear everyone  everything in the hallway  The room was not well insulated so we could hear honking horns all day and all night as well as the barking and howling dogs  For those in need of English language television there are about  cable stations of India and English language programming  The airconditioner worked but the heater seemed a bit lacking so ask for extra blankets if youre cold The breakfast was pretty skimpy   toast thin oatmeal hardboiled eggs bread potatoes artificial juice tea and coffee  On the second day fried eggs were also available as well as cold cereals  The cleanliness was a bit suspect as we saw the staff wipe the used plates and cutlery and replace them on the table        using the same cloth that just wiped off the table  However perhaps because it was the start of our trip this lack of cleanliness did not have an immediate effect on our digestive system that would come later in the trip We didnt get a chance to eat dinner there although the guides and drivers reked that the food was supposed to be quite good The front desk staff was accommodating in making change for us and made us feel welcome  
P => Inexpensive and just OK My son and I had dinner at the hotels much praised restaurant Chor Bizarre in   It was outstanding a Mughal feast  For that reason I ided to stay at the Broadway on my solo ober  visit  I thought I might take all my meals at the Chor The restaurant was a diappointment  Breakfast offered just two kinds of eggs    scrambled one day hard boiled the next    and few other dishes  The entrees I ordered at lunch and dinner were good not great My single room had one window it looked out onto a corridor  Actually my two rooms  Without explanation the staff moved me after two nights    to the room next door My first room was designed to appeal to a six year old  Its curtains were orated with cartoon characters as was its bedspread and other items and parts of the room  Since the bed was a single I wondered if many young children checked in alone Aside from a bed the room also had a chair and table the latter attached to a wall a small closet a full length mirror orated with cartoon characters and a safe The bathroom was quite modern    and also very cramped The Broadways location is a bit distant from Connht Circle    about half way between Connht Circle and Old Delhi    but since Delhi is so spread out thats not really a disadvantage A clear advantage is price having paid between US and US on my previous trip the Broadways US rate was quite welcome  
P => Great location Ive just spent a couple of days at the Broadway  Its on Asaf Ali Rd right next to Delhi gate and is ideally located for exploring Old DelhiJama Masjid and the Red Fort  All the drivers seem to know it so youll have no trouble with directions I had room    a single room which was windowless  It was however clean and the bathroom was well equipped with regular clean towels  Its a bit basic I suppose and you couldnt call it luxurious but the downstairs restaurant is excellent and always busy with Indians and foreigners alike  Staff were likeable enough and more than happy to arrange pick ups and suchlike Would I stay there again   mmmmm dunno  At that price range I dare say its fair value for Delhi but it was a wee bit characterless  
P => Cheap but not again I got a good price and didnt have that high expectations  If I had been staying for longer I would have asked for another room  I got a a windowless room which is the dirtiest hotel room Ive ever received  With a cockroach previous guests hair dust and so on  The bed was very hard  And the door had a huge gap under neath so all sounds in the corridor could be heard  There was also a call too prayer at sun rise  I slept very poorly the  nights in the hotel  But Ive also heard from the other guests that there is a big difference in the rooms  So be sure to check what you get  That said they were very helpful  They organized breakfast before opening hours for me and a tour group  I was slightly worried about eating in the Chor Bizzare restaurant given the cleaning level in my room  But it was excellent with very nice staff and good food  Try the saffron semolina desert  This was in the hight of turist season with a Indian Pakistan cricket match and a lot of fairs in Delhi so all the hotels where rather full  
P => Great little hotel Stayed at the Broadway hotel for two nights on arriving in Delhi after reading good reports about it in the Lonely Planet guide  Its very close to the Red Fort and Chandni Chowk  a maze of narrow streets and alleyways full of shops and Indian life  The rooms in the hotel are clean  with air con and very good bathrooms  Times of India delivered to your door every morning  The front desk changes money at a reasonable rate  The famous quotChore Bizarrequot restaurant lives up to its name excellent food wine and service Theres even an antique car on which breakfast is served from The quotThugsquot bar serves just about anything you can think of  It wasnt the Ritz but a very good value  star hotel  I paid about   for the room and a ent breakfast  All in all a great little hotel  
P =>   
P => a evit   
P => 
P => cheap nice enough      its not  star accomodation but its nicer than some of the others the shower roomstoliet isnt like a hotel one its more like what ud have in ur bathroom         I think the best thing about this hotel is the nice cheap currys the friendly staff the giantic beds and they offer cable which has a few english speaking channels  Location is not too bad either everything u need is reachable which a short walk its just round the cornor from a train station where u can catch trains too places all round india a good place too go from here thats not too far away is agra where u can see the Taj Mahal 
P => This so called hotel is awful I had to stay at Chand Palace in il  for  days before I left India after a  month stay in New Delhi  You will see a lot of dirtness all over Delhi but you should expect that at a place where you pay that much money  The room itself   with a window which was too small to see the wall on the otherside of the quotstreetquot   was some how clean but the bathroom was a disaster  The basin was broken the water was so strange that you couldnt use it for brushing your teeth   its the only place I have seen where you cant even use the tube water for that purpose   the only towel I got during the whole stay was dirty and had some stains from someone who was spitting pan in it you will have just one winter blanket which is useless for temperatures like  to  degrees during the night  Beside that you should take some earplugs with you otherwise you are not able to sleep because of all that noise The food was like the street food  Rps  which you can get everywhere in Delhi but here you will be at least  Rps  Furthermore we you check in the hotel and ask for the price of the stay then do that in a written form  I asked the desk manager before my check in and at the end it was nearly the double of the price  If you really want to enjoy that beautiful country and city than choose some of the other less expensive and pleasent and really nice hotels   I mean one of the houses that is worth calling it a hotel   in New Delhi  
P => It was terrible and dirty Dirty the staff is always spitting  Noisy  
P => One night no problems I stayed for one night here and found it fine  Nice staff good location my ride to the airport came quickly and was resonably priced the phone worked as did everything else in the room  There were a few creepy crawlies in the bathroom but they didnt bother me I would stay here again but next time I go to India I will be on a tighter budget and this will be a little over  
P => RUN from this place Terrible location  Very dirty  Broken toilet broken and filthy fridge and broken air conditioner  Rooms smelled like dead fish  Dont even think of a good nights rest here  
P => One of the best hotel Loved It I stayed three days in this hotel and found that this place was rekable with best staff  I recieved warm welcome at the airport with the pickup and the hotel was very nice and loved it so much  This hotel consulted me a tour which was great recomended by Raman who runs Akshat Tours and Travel I would recomed it to all my travel minded friends    
P => dirty building site This is not a nice hotel  It is basic but not at all clean  It is currently undergoing building work and together with hotel being built next door means there is constant drilling welding and hammering from early am til late at night  The room was damp and the carpet crawling literally  The food was okay and the staffwere nice enough but if you need some sleep forget it  Also room had no windows and broken AC unit  
P => Friendly Hotel I stayed in Hotel Chand Palace  nights and i was very happy to know this hotel where the employees are very kindly with guests and i will recommend this hotel to my friends Gerard Luzi 
P => Une s jour plaisant  
P => 
P => Lovely Place The hotel is amazing n i m impressed by d management of staff  Food quality is too good  the hotel is well built n neat amp clean place to hang out and for function purposes also 
P => Lovely hotel great service though not centrally located I stayed here for  nights with my family  The rooms are big and clean  The service is absolutely fantastic  One morning we left very early to travel to Agra and the staff made sure there was breakfast available even though the kitchen was meant to be open yet  We ordered room service one evening and the food was with us after  minutes and was deliciousThe buffet breakfast was included  It was pretty good   selection of hot and cold dishes Indian and Western  Also they russle up a great masala omletteI didnt use it but there is a ent looking outdoor swimming pool On the down side not much of a business centre  computer and a faxprinter and not centrally located  
P => Pretty Good Stayed here for the final  nights of my Delhi trip  The Modern hotel is a good distance out of the city but the Metro link nearby is good  The rooms were very nice  No problem with the mentioned pigeons room on th floor overlooking the park  The Cafe  restaurant was quite good and I found the breakfast very satisfactory  The Bar was quiet and nice for a quiet drink in the evening  There was not a lot to dislike bar the overpriced Internet Access which was also very unreliable  The area around the Hotel is not great with some very poor dwellings situated close by  Saying this there was no feeling of danger while walking the area  
P => Great Place To Stay The place is lovely the staf are great and the food fantastic but expensive The only other issue was the expensive internet connection 
P => Peaceful haven in Delhi City Park is a modern  storey hotel on the northern edge of Delhi  To get the negative out the way first it is a bit isolated but it is easy to order a tuctuc or taxi  However as the name suggests there is a park opposite so views from many rooms are quite relaxing which counts for a lot in somewhere as manic as Delhi and of course that also reduces the street noise  And it is easily accessible by the main routes in and around Delhi  This hotel is easily up to   European standards close to    Rooms are very large the beds soft the aircon quiet the bathrooms well equipped and clean  Welcome cake water and fruit a nice touch particularly after a long flight or drive  The Chilli restaurant food was really very good plentiful and reasonably priced at about    for a main dish but the beer very pricey  bottle   more than most restaurant prices and the service we received was a bit slow and staff seemed completely thrown because we changed the number of people on our reservation  Theres a pool in summer which is welcome  The extensive banquetting facilities also give an indication of the hotoles quality  Great for a stopover or a few days  
P => Poor Location But Clean Clean rooms seemed far from the city ent breakfast and good gym for India  Basic business hotel  We stayed there  times over  weeks and each time the Internet was down which was pretty annoying  
P => pleasant hotel in dubious area We stayed in this hotel twice one night at the start of our tour and then again just before we were due to fly out of Delhi  On our first visit we were put into rooms on a lower floor and the pigeon problem others have mentioned wasnt too obvious  However on our final night we were roomed on the th floor and they were a thorough nuisance   flying into the windows and constantly moving around during the night  The area around the hotel is not one that you would feel safe exploring though lots of people seemed to be socialising quite happily in the park across the road  The hotel is so far out of the city centre that it is difficult to use as a base for your own sightseeing  We got a map from reception and realised that we were almost off the map of central Delhi  Like us most of the guests seemed to be on tours and they only stay here briefly  A previous poster has mentioned dirty carpets   I think we must have stayed in the room after them as our carpets had obviously just been washed and were still a little damp  However   there are lots of pluses for this hotel  We found the staff pleasant and trying hard to be helpful  They did get overwhelmed at checkout time as all guests are being picked up together  The staff in the bar were really nice though we found the drinks pricey on Indian standards  The coffee shop downstairs was a pleasant place for breakfast plenty of choice though we didnt discover that eggs would be cooked to order on our first visit   just ask and the chef will appear  We enjoyed our stay at this hotel   as long as you are using it as a brief base you will find it quite adequate for you needs  
P => Rude Unfriendly Staff Bad Breakfast Annoying Pigeons on Balcony The tour company Hi Tours put us in this hotel for two nights  We had stayed at another budget hotel in Delhi on our own where we had a good experience Silver Ferns  The City Park is totally remote far from anything and the former mall next door is empty except for a cookie store and an optical shop  We did not feel safe when we walked in the neighborhood  Our room overlooked a rubble filled parking lot behind the mall and the balcony was full of loud pigeons cooing and pooping everywhere  Dogs barked tor hours in the night  The staff was rude and inefficient  I waited in line for  minutes to pay my bill on leaving because the person in front of me had questions about her bill  Six employees devoted all of their time to her and totally ignored me except to tell me to quothave a seat quot The breakfast was tourist oriented and the service was slow  The room was adequate but I cant recommend this place for anyone  
P => Great for a brief stopover This hotel was arranged for us as part of a tour so we didnt have any choice in where we stayed but we werent disappointed  We arrived in the evening having spent most of the day travelling up from Goa and the day had been a bit frht due to delayed flights and the possibility of missing our connection which we didnt thanks to tremendous efficiency by Kingfisher Airlines staff  The hotel was clean comfortable and had the best bed out of the  hotels we stayed in during our  week trip Because we arrived quite late we didnt bother to go out but just had a few drinks and a snack in the hotel bar  Food and drinks were okay On the down side there were pigeons on the railings outside our window and we were woken up at  am by what sounded like tap dancing   it was the pigeons being restless  The swimming pool looked nice although the water was a bit cloudy  Some people might also be put off by the fact that the pigeons were also sitting along the edge having a bath in the waterBreakfast was good although for a country known for its tea I wasnt impressed   far too weak and wishy washyThe one problem we encountered was a small visitor in our room  I saw something scuttling along the floor and thought it was an insect  My husband saw it and realised it was a small mouse   on the th floor The hotel staff were amazed when we reported this but hopefully they dealt with it as soon as we checked out  
P => Lovely Hoetl We stayed at City park as part of a tour around india  I have no idea how much it costs but it terms of or and space it was brilliant  The rooms were big with all modern ammenities  It is quite far from the very centre of delhi but you get taxis everywhere anyway  The manager was very friendly and made sure we had a good time  Just be aware that everyone wants a tip just say thank you and close the door  Nice hotel  
P => I recommend City Park I was booked at the Jaypee Siddarth however despite having a confirmed reservation I was rebooked at the City Park Hotel  I am glad  While it is not the most centrally located the rooms are clean and the customer service is exceptional  I will definitely stay here again and the prices are reasonable   a rarety in India where hotel prices are unreal  
P => pleasant oasis in the suberbs A little way out of the city centre and set amid tumble down houses and shops this hotel is an adequate stop over  It has two restaraunts and a spa  the aruvedic massages are cheaper then in Kerala with a one hour massage for  inr plus tax  The hotel derives its name from a city park directly opposite which provides a pleasant area to walk without the hassle of New Delhi streets  Unfortunately open public urinals line the side of the street and the smell can be over powering on a hot day  Rooms are well appointed and the beds are comfortable  
P => Great Hotel   Far Away This is an excellent hotel  The front desk staff were very good the food was good breakfast was fair but the dinners were excellent and the room was clean  Laundry service was prompt and very good as well  It is just not in a very good location  It is very far from the main part of the city   it took me   hours from the airport   hours to meet a friend at the Crowne Plaza Hotel and   hours to the Bahai Temple  I spent a lot of time in a car on the crazy roads of Delhi  There is wireless Internet access in the rooms but its is very slow and I had to sit near the door to get a signal  
P => Too Far from the Main Delhi Attractions Expensive If you are looking to do some sight seeing in Delhi do not stay here its in one end of Delhi extreme North far from the main attractions and you will get far better services and grandness with hotels in SouthCentral part of Delhi at lesser or comparable price  Its lobby and public areas are far smaller than most other  stars in Delhi and is located on a relatively smaller street in front  The distance of Delhis main attractions like Lodhi Gardens India Gate Bahai Temple Old Fort is atleast Kms from here and you can end up spending a   hours to travel in peak hours one way  The only place which is closeby relatively only is some of the Old Delhi attractions about  Kms from this place but then its the same from the hotels in CentralSouth Delhi as well  There is absolutely no attraction around this hotel This hotel also has mind boggling banquet business where riagesfamily functions are organized making it a nuisance for the residents because of the noise and people which frequent in s all on a single day  It has atleast   banquets halls This hotel is located in a North Delhi residential area while most of Delhis other good hotels are located in posh south delhi localities  
P => A sound hotel with an excellent restaurant We stayed in  hotels whilst in India and this was one of the best  It is very much a hotel catering for the business traveller however if you want to get into the centre of Delhi it will take around an hour due to the shear volume of traffic The rooms are clean are well orated and a good size  The restaurant was excellent and probably one of the best we ate at in IndiaThere is also the usual facilities at the hotel Gym swimming pool hr room service etc A previous review of the hotel commented on quottippingquot and staff holding out their cupped hands  We didnt experience this at this hotel however it is a very common trait in India No real complaints about the hotel  
P => Ottimo e bellissimo  
P => 
P => good value for money i was at Clark heights to meet my girl friend came from Dubai  First i was very hazy about where she is staying  after reaching there we have found that safe and nice place  in the main city off course nosiy like Delhi  Under one roof all the services available for the travelers  From Pick Up to Drop I would recommend to every one 
P => safe place We booked  rooms for the riage purpose for three nights stay  Hotel staff was very helpful speciall the lady at reservation helped us alot in arranging the batchlores party at the basement  This was very near to our house and the riage location  all aur family members came form different parts enjoyed and cherish the stay over there  
P => Good value and nice location We stayed for  nights  The hotel has a nice location   yes there is noise from the streets   but nothing you couldn t live with Friendly staff an ok restaurant with cheap food  
P => Love the hotel location I was there in months of tember with my father  I would like to share my views abouth clark heights  I personally feel this hotel is good for those people who visit first time in india bcoz here I found very helpful and caring people and they helped me in my further tour as well and very well organized by the hotel staff  The rooms are very nice and specious I love to give      star for this hotel  Only problem with our taxi driver that is he was to fast I like this hotel bcoz of the location of the hotel in on the main road and they have there own parking facilities plus ket is also very near to this place  Here Reception staff is extremely helpful and well behave    
P => Wrong Presentation I booked this hotel on a friend s recommendation and after looking the reviews on trip advisor  The hotel is not clean    of what it is displayed as  The staff is just eager to sell you tour to Agra and Jaipur  There ware small insects in the room the bathroom has a foul smell  The hotel is on a busy road so we had no sleep the whole night  Charge is quit high compared to the services  We do not recommend it to any traveler from USA or Europe  
P => Its completely of the type i would prefer       I enjoyed a great  days stay over there with my colleagues  The interior of the hotel is very impressive and I must give a special compliment  the hotel staff too because they managed it very well  The service is really upto the k and moreover what I liked the most is its location  I mean its too easy to get to other places from here which was our prime requirement during that trip  And getting all this at so reasonable price is none less than a pleasant surprise  Infact I am looking forward to more stays in CLARK HEIGHTS during my future trips to Delhi  I would definitely refer this hotels to all my friends     
P => Awesome simply Awesome I had been to hotel Clark Height in the month of E  I stayed their for  nights and  days  I must say its the best place have never been i mean the staff was excellent  specially ma fav place there the roof top restaurant such a pleasant place  hrs coffee shop service were at the best and delicious food too  Rooms were quite clean and Comfortable and a king size bed to relax urself  Infrastructure is beautifully designed internet facilities provided by the hotel was the best the speed was good and i can do my work without any interruption where else at other place i have to pay around  Rs  for the same really a helpful atmoshpere  In short will say its a Awesome place and next whenever i m gonna come Delhi my stay will be definetly der at Hotel Clark Height 
P => AWSOME HOTEL I went to india last month for a business trip and stayed at Hotel Clark Heights It was a wonderful experience Room was immaculately clean the bedding and pillows were heavenly  the bathroom and dressing area was very nice and a arate space for an office desk and chair   A lovely hotel  All staff went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant Enjoyed my visit  I would definitely go back  
P => Excellent hospitality and food We just returned from a  nights stay at Clark Heights hotel at New Delhi  Being from India I am much familiar to the issues which some hotels in India have and I must say both my wife and I were thoroughly pleased with the service and the room that this hotel provided us  It is in a crowded road but accessible to the mero which is about a km away in walking  The best part of this hotel was that it was very clean and the bathrooms were sparkling and fresh  The double delux room is a bit small but we found it quiet as it was the corner room for us  The room service and special requests were immediately taken care of  The other thing which we thoroughly enjoyed here was the food  Since we had a six year old son with us who we have not trained to eat spicy food we asked the cookchef to make sure that there is no spice  That was always complied with  The menu is mostly North Indian food with some Chinese and Continental options also  They even packed sandwiches for us in the early hoursam of the morning when we were to go to Agra  The food was so tasty that at times while sight seeing in Delhi we used to head back for lunch to the hotel just to have the food  There is a famous four start hotel in Connht place whose restaurant refused to make food with no spice so we had to walk out  The basement retsaurant is used for lunch and the roof is now made into a roof top restaurant and the open air was very pleasant  We can see the metro line and the moving trains from the roof restaurant something my son enjoyed  My only wishlist is that the hotel must tie up with a more reliable cab service we had some concerns with the car on one of the daysgot an inexperienced driver once   a bit dangerous for Delhi traffic so we stopped the car after couple of minutes and got another reliable driver whom we stuck to but otherwise pickups from airport and drops went on plan  Overall a good experience and if we visit Delhi again for this price it is a good stay  
P => cleancomfortable and friendly  First time in India and after a poor night in Mumbai I was pleasantly surprised by the Clark Heights hotel  Convenient to the Delhi Metro I found no difficulty getting around The hotel room was clean and well appointed with a flat panel TV  
P => 
P => In Delhi you often get less than what you pay for and at this hotel      much less I had a  hour layover in Delhi ugh and I wanted a hotel that was clean with WiFi where I could crash for the night  This hotel has wifi but it is not what the photos portray  The photos that the hotel uses for promotion totally fail to capture what you get at this hotel  Go to Tripadvisor for photos of those who actually stayed here  This hotel is very old and run down  In the room the ceiling fan is too loud to run and to turn off the lamp next to the bed you have to unscrew the bulb  There are stains on the sheets which show that cleanliness is not part of this managers mentality  The fuzzy TV works but the remote doesnt      I hope you are getting the picture  The words that come to mind are grimy tacky and overpriced for what you get  Finally outside where the hotel is located is blighted noisy and remote   Conclusion    there has to be better propertys for just a night than this  
P => Average The hotel is located in a very busy noisy and rowdy area  For those who love shopping it is ideal  However the staff are curteous and always at ones service  The rooms are neat the food is satisfactory  The Tour company Abyss Tours lived up to expectation  On my next trip God willing even if i dont stay in the hotel i will still employ the services of Abyss Tours  
P => Very Clean Comfortable and Firendly The hotel is well positioned the staff are very friendly and fell over themselves to organise trips for us Rafiq Khan who operates through the hotel for Indian Tribal Tours arranged for us to have a driver for the say to enable us to see all the sights in the safe knowledge of having a car waiting for us Lovely friendly people and I owuld recommend both the hotel and people higlhly to all  
P => DO NOT COME HERE  OVERPRICED  FOR ITS QUALITY A normal hotel which is on the road with lot of traffic noise allnight  They took  from me which is overpriced for the service andthe kind of room which was given to me  Why I am saying this becausewhen I went to a nearby hotelthis area is full of hotels  I got amuch better quality and service at  had they given me good andclean towel they took  minutes give me dirty towels probably Iwould have not checked out and came to know the difference  
P => More than you Expect Our travel agent booked this hotel for  night but we arrived very late at night there and ended up to book  more night directly at the front desk who were very politegentle and helpfull always   Next day mor ning after our breakfast we were planning to get around the city but had no idea what to do in an unfamilliar place at the same time Mr Chokerborthy introduced us with a man in the lobby named Mr Zargar who arranged some part of our trip around Rajasthan for  days amp got to see alot more in such a short time The service is ok amp most of the time we had our meals on the rooftop restaurant with quality dishes Breakfast in the morning could be better with some other choices but no complaint at all we got what we asked for I recommend this hotel for any travler bcoz they do care for others no matter how old you are  
P => Excellent Oasis in the heart of the New Delhi We had previously experienced a great rooftop meal here  and ided that we would stay here on this trip to Delhi  We werent disappointed We got a very good dealrate through Expedia to spend a week at this great hotel  The rooms were small but well presented and exceptionally clean  complete with comfortable bed wifi and complimentary toiletries  The rooftop restaurant served excellent breakfasts recommended the on demand omelettes and coffee and no fuss late evening mealsrefreshments were delicious All staff were attentive and helpful  any small niggles were dealt with efficiently with a smile The hotel is situated right in the heart of the Karol Bagh district of New Delhi  a fantastic place to get a feel for real street life  With a large local ket at the end of the street and the superb Suruchis thali restaurant only two streets way we were never stuck for places to discover by foot Highly recommended  We will be back  
P => good and clean i stay  nights and person of the hotel was very nice  and the rooms are very clean  food good too    The travel desk of the hotel very helpful amp friendly Mr  Rafiq amp Mr  Haroon  
P => Really helpful staff and central location The staff at the front desk were really helpful and gave great directions to the various places I wanted to go to  The room while not large was still well kept  I was also pleasantly surprised by the open rooftop breakfast arearestaurant  I got to Delhi by myself and the hotel provided a free pickup at the airport and I felt pretty comfortable in and around the area as a single female traveller and was only later joined by my friend  
P => The smells noise and heat of Delhi with the bliss and escapism of the hotel  Fab hotel   possibly a bit pricier than some in Delhi     a night but a lap of luxury when off the plane and trying to find your feet  Very comfortable great food but mostly excellent service and friendly 
P => Nice Hotel Grotty area My wife and I stayed here for  nights in ust  and were pretty pleased overall  The hotel is lovely inside the room was spacious the AC worked the restaurant was pleasant and the staff were more than helpful  The bathroom was somewhat grubby but that is a recurrent problem throughout India The only thing that lets the hotel down is its location  Karol Bagh isnt a clean Westernised area like the areas that house some of the  star hotels its dirty and congested and theres a good chance of stepping in something unpleasant as you leave the hotel The nearest Metro station is only  minutes walk away though and its only a couple of stops to Connht Place 
P => Great value hotel lovely rooms   peace in the hem of Delhi This is great little hotel which has great value  Breakfast is included in the price and is very good  We had food in the restaurant one evening and despite being the only ones there the food was very good The rooms were really comfortable and clean We booked to stay there again at the very end of our trip and we got the most gorgeous room with a bath and fabulous shower  Loved this hotel   location is not the best but would definitely stay here again  
P => Top value in a good location We are sat in the foyer as I write this review  We are only staying for two nights and booked on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews  It represents excellent value at around  pounds per night  The room isnt quite as spacious as the photos suggest and are well used  The room is clean and the aircon works a must in Delhi in y  If you are used to  star European hotels you  be a little disappointed with the first impression but things are different in IndiaThe staff are numerous and very helpful  The restaurant is very good  As the previous reviewer points out the breakfast is a little strange but they make a good omelette  For dinner we had an excellent mixed tandoori for two which with lashings of very strong beer came to around  pounds each  The best curry sauce Ive ever hadThe district is lively with miles of streets with small shops and street vendors  Its noisy all day as all drivers seem to beep constantly  Be prepared to have to haggle for just about everything Its assumed I think that tourists are very wealthy and will pay anythingIn sumy   this hotel provides an excellent base for exploring Delhi  
P => Would recommend for the price Stayed at the hotel with wife and  year old and got a king size bed as asked for  Room was a ent size and quality was ok without being extraordinary  Had breakfast at the hotel and the choice was a bit of a let down had spicy noodles and pasta amongst eggs and toast But for the price we paid you couldnt complain  The area around the hotel is very noisy and if your a light sleeper like me then that will be a problem my wife though was fine  The upside of this is that there is a good ket at night in the area for some shopping  For food we ate at Pizza Hut round the corner but beware of taxi drivers in the area as when we asked for directions he said its  miles away and a  ruppee ride  We happily lined  In short you could pay a lot more in Delhi for not much more  
P => Excellent Choice We were a bit concerned over the mixed reviews especially of those who booked their rooms via Expedia and subsequent problems they encountered  The Expedia rate is almost  the price of the published rack rates so it was hard to resistWe booked and prepaid via Expedia a premium room  Our international flight was due to arrive at AM but was over an hour late  I had reconfirmed our flight arrival details with the hotel along with our room reservations about a week before we were due to arrived We were very pleased and grateful that the hotel quotboyquot was smiling and waiting for us at the airport and whisked us away to the hotel  Check in was a snap with only a quick stop at the front desk so they could photocopy our passport info then off to the room We could not be have been more pleasantly surprised  The bed was awesomely comfortable the room on the rd floor was clean neat and modern  Plenty of hot water  The tiny window provided no view but hey who comes to Delhi for the viewBreakfast was included in the rate and was satisfactory  We also ate dinner there the first night and it was very good  Watch out for the high alcholic content of the Kingfisher beer however It is a real kick in the pants Its not in the polished area in Delhi but an interesting neighborhood with a colorful ket  Its only a couple blocks from the metro  The autorickshaw drivers in the area were a bit annoying but thats Delhi You will need earplugs  I think earplugs were invented specifically for India  Between the barking dogs and honking of horns its a wonder anyone gets any sleepIf you look for an good value hotel in Delhi and dont want to spend over   a night this is an excellent choice  The staff was polite and helpful but not effusive  We would definitely recommend this hotel and would return here  
P => Value for money I booked the Hotel for a stopover before my international flight  I was coming from Goa and got the Hotel details here in this site  After iding to go for it  I got a reservation through hotels co in for a Premium RoomAirport PickupInternet for US  That was pretty good I think   I although my flight from Goa was delay the boy from the Hotel was there waiting me and took me safely to the city  The place is busy but the hotel seemed nice at first  After I checked in the boy took me to my room and as soon as he opened the door I noticed it was a standard room  Immediatly upon calling the reception and explaining that my booking was for a premium room the moved me  The room was nice and clean but the bathroom although clean was a bit run down  The food at the restaurant was ok and the breakfast although simple was ok too  They charged me INR to take me to the airport the next day Anyway it was all right     and the price was ok so I think I can recommend the Hotel  
P => Centrally located Gud option if you are travelling on a tight budget 
P => A welcome sight after travelling We booked our stay her for the first few nights in Delhi and then wandered around looking at some of the other hotels in the loney planet but nothing was a patch on this one so we ended up returning two more times The staff were always welcoming and there was a real sense of safety  We booked through Expedia and then directly through the hotel for the other two stays  Expedia was half the price of the published price but the hotel happily gave us the same rate for our other stays  The rooms were clean with LCD TV and really comfortably pillows The rooms on the rd floow seemed a little more modern than those on the nd There were no windows in the cheaper rooms  Breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant and is included in the price  The hotel is situated in a busy shopping area with coffee shops Pizza Hut and McDonalds nearby just in case u get a case of Delhi Belly as we did There are also loads of other local choices  When booking travel use the agent across the road from the hotel he really looked after us and was nearly half the price of the guy hanging around the hotel lobby Theres an internet cafe nearby so everything you need Easy to catch a rickshaw a travel around  Would definitely recommend 
P => So So I had a few occasions to stay at the hotel once in t  and once more in    There are a few things that i liked about the hotel and few that probably in my opinion was a little bit of a let down  The things i really liked  room ambience room cleanliness hospitable staff top floor open air restaurant proximity to ket place and metro station foodtaste  the let downs room service   sometimes took ages food was little spicylack of variety in food choices AC  almost non functional room size tvstill CRT in some rooms  I noticed the lack of variety in food since i was staying for a longer period of time being on a business trip  for ppl staying overnight or just for a day or two it might not be bad at all  I could see lot of foreign tourists stayin there   If someone is looking for a ent acco in karolbagh area  would recommend to try this one  
P => Great modern and low cost with exceptional service My sister and I staye dat this hotel for a business purpose  The staff were amazingly friendly and very personable  They assisted us in all aspects of our business helping us with leads the hotel stay and anything we needed  We were two single women in Delih so they were very helpful and assisted us in travel In addition they have free WiFi and a conference room where we were abl eto use it all day for interviewing stayy  They never questioned the time in the conf room and were very helpful the rooms were clean very modern on the small side but perfect  Being british travellers we are always cautious in travelling to India and yet this was a good cost hotel with great cleanliness and quality The restaurant has a great breakfast incl but closes early at night  Theed in a great spot right close to the Coroba ket  We had also forgot one of our suitecases at the hotel and they immediately sent a driver with it to the airport   we did not have to worry about loss or theft A hard find in India 
P => A Home away from Home Will Stay Again  During my recent trip to India I amp my husband stayed at Hotel Clark International at the at the beginning middle and end of our trip at New Delhi  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel especially because of the very friendly accomodating amp warm behaviour of the Hotel Staff  I had choosen this Hotel based on all the online reviews good bad amp ugly and had ided to find out more on my own and I can say I am very happy that I selected this Hotel  I was especially happy because of the in  room Safe the mini bar amp the Complimentry TeaCoffee Breakfast amp airport pick ups amp drop of  The Room amp the Bath were very good and modern The Hotel restaurant on the fifth floor   roof top is excellent  The food is particularly good I was specially surprized amp touched to find out that on my Birthday the cake which my husband ordered was delivered complimentry from the Hotel amp the food that the restaurant catered was loved appreciated amp savored very much by my gathered friends amp family  I should also mention that  there is also a Travel service available at the Hotel Lobby amp also help with Money Changers I extend my thanks to Mr  Rajesh Patyal amp Mr  Chakraverty at the front desk Mr  Thakur amp Mr  Ram Singh Mr  Prem and the rest of the staff for taking such good care of us  I also like to mention Mr  Haroon of the Travel Agency amp his associate Mr  Rafiq Khanwho have been very helpful in setting up our comfortable site seeing trip from Delhi to Puri and back  I and my Husband really enjoyed our stay in this Hotel  I and my husband are going to be the guest again at Hotel Clark International for sure and I whole heartedly recommend to anybody amp everybody who wants to stay at Budget Hotel with all the aminities of a Pricy Hotel surrounded by friendly Staff to come and stay here they will not regret it  I particularly loved it    It was my home away from home during this visit looking forth to coming soon   Mrs  Bhattacharyya  hotmail comNew York 
P => Good location ok hotel My wife and I spent three nights im the Clark International in ruary   The hotel failed to pick us up at the airport when we arrived at   AM but claimed that the hotel boy had been there and that we just hadent spotted him  Might well be but our theory is that he was there to late as we were out of the airport allready  minutes after the plane arrived No problems though with a pre paid taxi from the airport to the hotel were we arrived arround   The reception fixed a room to us and we could sleep for a couple of hours before starting off for the city  The room was on the rd floor and held a lower standard than what we had expected  Later in the day   after complaining   we got another room on the nd floor which was more spacy and modern  Both rooms were clean and free of any kind of bugs The Clark International is located in the Karol Bagh area which is quite convinient as it is close to the new and rather impressing metro  The metro will be increasingly important in Delhi  Karol Bagh also hosts a street ket which is quite charming  The ket starts just a block or two away from the hotel entrance Karol Bagh is a busy area with a lot of small shops some hotels and the streets are crammed with cars rickshaws cows and street vendors  Quite as it should be in a Delhi neighbourhood  The hotel was definately the most expensive we stayed in during our  day India tour  Delhi has a lot of very expensive  star hotels and its not easy to find good options in the  star segment  Clark International turned out to be a good one  The only negative thing we can come up with is that there is some noise from the streets and the surroundings  This by the way occurs to all the hotels we stayed in in India  When we were there demolition works were going on in a building near by and that created a lot of noise starting quite early in the morning  
P => Satisfactory Hotel if a little over priced We spent  nights in total over  different periods at the hotel  We stayed in an Executive room though we were upgraded free of charge to a Premium room for one night We paid   per night for the Executive room  This includes airport pick up breakfast and complimentary wi fi  I think this is slightly expensive though hotels in Delhi do appear to be expensive The room was of reasonable size and very clean  It had a TV a mini bar the contents of which were expensive and tea and coffee making facilities The bathroom was clean  My only criticism of it would be that in the Premium Room the shower wasnt in a arate cubicle which meant the bathroom floor got very wet everytime we had a shower Breakfast was buffet style  It included cooked food of different types each day cereal toast juice and tea and coffee  We also tried the restaurant one night and one afternoon  There was a good selection of food on the menu and it was very reasonably priced  Indeed the food itself was very nice  Mind you the waiter isnt very friendly unlike the other staff in the hotelThe Hotel is situated in the Karol Bagh area and indeed is less than a  minute walk to the Karol Bagh metro station which is convenient for getting around the city  When walking to the metro station you pass through a very colourful ket which is present on certain days Unfortunately there was a lot of street noise at night whether it be vehicles or dogs barking  The noise was particularly noticeable in the executive room which was on the first floor the premium room was on the th floor and was a bit quieter  However I would imagine street noise would be a problem in many hotels in the city The area around the hotel is slightly rough  One thing which I didnt like was the hassle we got from touts the minute we stepped out of the hotel  However this was a problem no matter where we went in the city as was begging The hotel appear to work with a nieghbouring travel  tour company  The staff from this company appear to sit in the reception area and wait for guests  On my first morning in the hotel the minute I got out of the lift I was approached by such a person who gave me the whole selling routine  This person was very persistent to the extent he was travelling up and down in the lift clearly looking for us  In saying that we did book a guide for Agra through the company as well as a pick up and drop off to the train station  The guide was very good indeed and we were glad we did go ahead with the booking Overall we were pleased with the hotel  It is lovely inside though slightly expensive  
P => Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel on the th  for  nights and we had booked  rooms  We got complimentary airport pick up which was great  Upon arrival at the hotel we were advised we had got an upgrade on both the rooms which was nice to hear The location is great for all the tourist sights   thing i would say is dont book taxis from the hotel reception as it is a little bit more expensive than a normal taxi Considering this hotel is a  star budget hotel i would say it was very good  I stayed at a  star in Mumbai and it was awfulGood value for money and if i was to go back to Delhi i would stay here again  
P => Very Nice Hotel This hotel is really nice situated in one the best areas in Delhi which is Karol Bagh  You just come out of hotel then right and when you hit the main ket street turn right again and at the end of that street you have metro station Karol Bagh which it will take you to the main attractions or close enough to spend a fair amount on a auto rickshaw from there Hotel staff is very helpful and polite  We never used the pick up service from the airport because we always reached this hotel from the train stations  We raised this concern with hotel receptionist and he provided us with a courtesy drop off service to the airport instead  The food from the roof top restaurant is pretty ent and poison free  We never had meat as in the rest of India but saw lots of people eating meat and nobody complained or looked sick the days afterwards  This hotel is on the same area of others which look more economic like the Royal Holidays and the Hotel Classic but compare to these other doggy places this is far above in all aspects  You spend more but you receive quality in all senses while on these other places we stayed our first night in the Royal Holidays we never could sleep as there works in progress in front of the Hotel and since we arrived they were trying to push us to make deals to visit using their touts what you can visit on your own  They just think that people are stupid and have not read enough before going to India Here is all the opposite taxi prices if you request one are reasonable help is as much as they can advices internet free compare to others that try to charge you with  rupees for a crap connection there shops in the vicinity and there is the great ket on the street heading to the metro station Definitely If I get back to Delhi one of these days I will stay here again and can recommend it to any one  
P => ent enough hotel for a short stay Hotel is a bit dated and shows it in places  The hotel room we had was okish  Mostly clean  The one big negative point was the aircon unit just above our heads over the bed and I mean literally just above see picture  It was excessively noisy during the night and at one point spewed out a whole lot of built up black grime from the street The rooftop terrace would be nice if it werent for the heavy smog of Delhi  Otherwise the food and drinks are ent and reasonably priced Stayed there for a night just before flying back out of India so didnt get a chance to explore the area  It did look quite lively with street stalls at night  
P => good hotel in crazy delhi excellent quality accommodation for the value in delhi     karol bagh is a hustling area but nice to have a quiet hotel    very friendly and helpful staff 
P => Haven in New Delhi My husband and I stayed at the Clark Hotel in New Delhi both at the beginning and end of our trip to India  Overall our stay on both occasions was excellent  The hotel is well priced conveniently located near the Metro line Karol Bag stop provides airport pickup and drop off rooms are modern clean and spacious large comfortable beds in  room safe for valuables nice bathrooms front desk staff are helpful and friendly food in the restaurant is convenient and tasty a travel service is available in the lobby which can arrange a driver and tours of the city  The overall atmosphere is very friendly and staff are competent and readily provide assistance  New Delhi can be a daunting experience with so much traffic noise and confusion and so having a place to stay such as this makes the visit so much better  We found Pankaj Rajesh and Ekta to be especially helpful and hospitable and would readily return on another visit  Staff do their best to make you feel welcome and comfortable  Highly recommend this hotel for visitors to New Delhi  
P => Great We regularly stay at this hotel  On a budget this hotel is great value  The rooms are clean and modern  The staff is very accomodating in particular Rajesh and Ekta on the front desk  One of its main attractions is the location right at the heart of the maddness  Love it  Mrs Shah UK 
P => Well priced all that you need In Delhi you get what you pay for  When Im here on business I pay around   per night compared to Hotel Clarks   per night  It isnt the most luxurious hotel in town but it provides good facilities in a lively part of town  Well worth the money  Dinner and beer in the rooftop restaurant good and reasonably priced too  Breakfast is pretty boring though Hotel will normally include a pickup from the airport  I saw some negative comments elsewhere about Abyss Travel  They are the hotels quottravel agentquot for car hire etc   If you dont want to use them dont  Youre not under any pressure to 
P => Excellent Hotel in Crazy Delhi  Look its simple unless you want to pay   per night then you will struggle to find a quality hotel in any big city in India  So reviews about this hotel saying mediocre ieved or overpriced ignore these guys did not do there homework before getting here  The Hotel is located in Karol Bagh and is right in the heart of thingsclustered with back street kets and is extremely lively  Yes the area is not the cleanest but   of Delhi is like this  We based ourselves here for  nights the rooms are clean and well maintained  The food in the roof top resurant is excellent and the staff really friendly If you want to see feel and smell Delhi and thats probably why your are visisting this city then stay here  
P => Very good experience The rooms on the fourth floor are very nice  We had a so so room on the first night  and then we heard that the rooms on the fourth floor were better and so we moved up for the following night  It was great  Spotless crispy white sheets a clean modern bathroom  Breakfast is good the view outside is great  The hotel collaborates with a travel agent named Haroon who is excellent  He made various bookings for us and we found him friendly and reliable  
P => A winning combination My brother and I were returning to India after many many years to discover the origins of our parents  Our mother Tess was Indian and our father a British soldier  I was born in Devlali and left as a baby It was therefore important that we had good accommodation in Mumbai and Delhi  And certainly the Clark gave us this The staff at the hotel were very helpful the rooms were great and the breakfast second to none  Several times we also had lunch which was very nourishing  If we needed any help with minor things that can usually go wrong on holiday the staff acted quickly and efficiently  We found that they had a winning partnership with Abyss Tours which many other car operators must envy in Old Delhi  The pick up and drop off at the airport went smoothly and we negotiated very competitive rates from their able and competent manager Arif for a sightseeing tour and a trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal  Altogether a very satisfying stay  Congratulations to both teams at the Hotel and the Abyss Raymond RaineUniversity Senior Lecturer UK 
P => Dont ever use Abyss Travel Bed ok bathroom passable meals passable general staff attitude ok  The major problem this hotel has is their association with Abyss Travel   they are a joke so see through makes you lh  All the old tricks   obvious plants lies lies lies  Its a shame that a quotcould be good hotelquot has to associate its self with and promote Abyss Travel  Please dont take us for fools  
P => Great value in the heart of things This little gem is right in the quothorn honkingquot center of things  My room was small but clean and comfortable  The staff were all very kind  There was a bit of an internet snafu when I first arrived but the manager stayed with the problem until he got it fixed and I could get online  I could walk to all sorts of shopping and the hotel has easy access to taxis etc There were several tour groups staying in the hotel while I was there   so book early the secret is out about this one  
P => A great find and good value for your money After reading several reviews on line we booked the Clark International for  nights  We were very pleased with this hotel and believed we got very good value for our money  The front desk staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and were very happy to assist in arranging drivers tours or train travel at competitive prices They have a cute roof top restaurant  Good Indian Western and Chinese food and a quotbusiness centrequot where you can check your internet  We would definitely stay at this hotel again and we highly recommend it to others Any inconveniences of this hotel were very minor Like many of the places that we booked on line it said that our room included free airport pick up and we requested this through Expedia but it did not happen  So if you would like airport pick up double check that a driver will actually be there to pick you up  Hotel is located in a busy ket area  I was happy to not have to walk alone outside of the hotel at night  The street noise could definitely be heard in the hotel rooms as is the case throughout Delhi so bring earplugs Totally my own fault but I left my sandals in the hotel after I checked out and went back the next day to get them but was told that they had been quotthrown outquot  So triple check your room when you leave 
P => Great Hotel for the price Yes we had agreat time at the Clark after staying at a couple of similar hotels which were nasty Dont have any doubts about staying there the place is very clean and the food brilliantstaff couldnt be more helpful  You can arrange for a driver to take you around Delhi for a fixed price so no worries there  I recommend you pack ear plugs even at the top   hotels you can hear the road noise from your hotel room We had no problems with the water hot water all the time  Electric went out from time to time but that happened every where in Delhi We stayed there for  weeks and if I can remember it went out twice to come back on in mins or less  The outside of the hotel was dirty and would not liked to have walked outside on my own but that is the case all over Delhi  
P => Do not be eived Thanks to Photoshop theyve managed to delete all the electrical wires hovering over their shaded windows their neighboring buildings and whatever else that looks nasty in their surrounding  So when you look it up online you would think that the hotel is in a nice quiet area  We were on the nd floor and we could hear the vehicles passing by horns beeping peoples voices et al  Not very comfortable when all you need is a good nights sleep  We had a portable heater in our room and it wasnt working so we phoned the reception to replace it  They did   with another non working unit  Great  The room and bathroom is OK and the bed was clean  But we didnt really get value for our money  We think the hotel is overpriced especially with the location  
P => OK Hotel Great Breakfast Pros Good hotel in Delhi offered free airport pickup  Great breakfast included in room price  Room had a modern feel  
P => An amazing hotel in the middle of the chaos that is Dehli  Having booked through Hostelbookers com and read all the reviews my boyfriend and I were worried about the hotels condition  I called the hotel  days before departure to book the airport transfer the man was waiting ready for me  We arrived at the hotel at am way before check in time but they allowed us a room at  of the normal rate  The room was amazing all European amenities a huge double bed and a quot flat screen TV all you could ask for in a room  we booked deluxe  We were pleasantly surprised and would definitely stay there again  Please do not be put off by the surrounding area as you are in India you need to keep an open mind  Also the food in the restaurant on the roof is amazing we had a tandoori platter for rs enough for two people  If you stay at this hotel you wont be disappointed  
P => Best Night Manager and very fine rooms I am a teacher who went with a colleague and  students on a Trip to India We spend our very first night in the Clark and this was the best introduction to India  Although the hotel seems to be in the middle of hem it is a quiet spot and very western in all its amenities  The rooms were large with high ceilings and the latest in equipment and bathroom convenience    we had everything down to the bathroom slippers  The Night Duty manager quotChakrawortyquot could not have been nicer and fullfilled every wish of us spoiled Westerners  Of course we had wireless free internet which was another plus because I wanted to let the students parents know that we arrived safely Breakfast was also super and served on the roof top  One amazing experience  
P => Great ket area in Karol Bagh Great Hotel the staff were fantastic and helpful always  I was here with my wife st time to India and we started on a tour in Delhi first  After you get over the initial shock of the driving poverty and the streets you will grow to love this little gem of a hotel  The hotel is literally a  second walk from Karol Bagh ket which is great fun especially as we were there for Divali so the streets were lit and fireworks everywhere  You will get beggars in this area but you will find that throughout India which is a shame as there are so many homeless children  Change is a serious problem so try and get as much as possible as you wil get harrased  Travel agent name Arif is fantastic and i swear he works  hour days as he is always there  He arranged tours transports etc and we had no problems  The Hotel Dining area is brilliant situated on the roof and very open but with covering food is of a high standard and service excellent  Dont believe everyone who says that Delhi is expensive compared to say Agra or Jaipur that is only on certain items  My final comment is once you get over the shock of the streets leading to the hotel you will enjoy your stay when the driver said we are here i nearly fell out of the car but after my trip to Delhi Agra Jaipur amp Mumbai i enjoyed the experience of Delhi the most  
P => Oasis of calm We were in Delhi for the VIV India Exhibition at the Pragati Maidan cost was a consideration when I chose the Clark International but we felt we had excellent value for money  The location is rather challenging the noise and general grubbyness can be off putting but once you are inside the hotel everything changes  We reserved a suite this was still a good price compared to the  and  star hotel prices and it was great  A large canopied bed with beautiful clean linen and a bathroom with a ble floor The rooftop restaurant is very good the food is excellent and although the hotel does not have a bar you can get a beer with your meal  Breakfast is idedly Indian with not very much concession to European taste but we always found something suitable The staff are very helpful especially the travel agent after the show we had set aside time to visit Rajasthan and it was organised for us very efficiently by Abysss tours Overall I can recommend this hotel as being good value for money  
P => A Cozy Hotel in Delhi I stayed there ember    The hotel staff is very attentve the or is tasteful and the rooms are comfortable  Breakfast on the rooftop is very pleasant    ask for Chai thats delicious Indian spiced tea not the teabag option The hotel is located in Asias biggest shopping area Karol Bagh  The ultra modern Delhi Metro station is  minutes from the hotel  From there you can get to Delhis commercial and business center Connht Place in just a few minutes more  
P => ent Value We opted for the most expensive room on the property which was around US per night  We were favorably impressed the room was clean and very comfortable and the bed very nice  The hotel is located in a noisy and busy area and to be honest when we arrived at the hotel we were not terribly impressed with the exterior of the building  However the staff were very friendly and the other hotel guests we chatted with in the lobby loved the place so we gave it a shot  The food is rather good and the rooftop restaurant is charming  Overall good value for the money but probably wont stay there again simply because the neighborhood is incredibly busy and very congested  If that doesnt bother you try it out  Otherwise a good hotel  
P => a no go  I booked on expedia com choosing by price  thinking there are a slew of hotels in the  range and a slew in the  range and this would fit right in the middle  It did not  It is not near a  Star hotel but what in India would be called a  star  Rooms are noisy quotIndia Cleanquot sort of scruffy and not worth more than   It seems the hotel is advertising on places like Expedia looking for people shopping by price  and trusting that you get what you pay for  While this is true generally in India it is generally less true  Also they overbooked us and moved us on the nd day of our stay to a quot Starquot that was less than half the price although they attempted to keep the rate the same but was actually nicer  
P => Enjoyed our stay at Clark International We stayed at this hotel for two days and heres why I liked it   The staff is very courteous and helpful   The rooms are clean and when you request extra towels or sheets they are provided promptly   The food is very good and their breakfast buffet is impressive   the hotel is centrally located and one can easily access major tourist attractions  
P => Good Midrange Hotel After having considerable difficulty locating a midrange   hotel in Delhi for a personal visit we settled on the Clark Intl  based on reviews on TripAdvisor  We had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff   They showed up at the airport as promised for the complimentary pickup  They come in an Indica small car so if you are a large family with luggage cal them and let them know in advance  Our room was basic but both the room and the hotel inside was very clean  Folks who have written negative reviews are likely having inflated expectations of what   per night can get you in Delhi  The area around the hotel is not great in the middle of Karol Bagh   that did not bother me so I liked the hotel esp  the courteous staff  The complimentary breakfast and the attendants serving it are very professional  We had made our own taxi arrangements for Delhi and Agra sightseeing and there was no pressure put on us by hotel staff to use their services  They did organize airport dropoff for us when requested Overall very happy with the hotel   would definitely stay there again if going thru Delhi on personal visit  
P => Not a bad deal for the location and facilities The hotel is centrally located in the Karol bagh area and close to Metro station   The facilities are clean and maintained reasonaby well  The complementary breakfast is good   The negatives   the surrounding areas are not too good  but you cannot have a central location like Karol bagh and peace together  They provided complimentary pick up from airport because it was free the driver did not run AC and we did not particularly insist although it was hot   The reception staff was also helpful in arranging early morning taxi drop off to Nizammudin Rly station Overall a good value for money proposition and above average clean facilities in a central location  
P => Great buy off season I picked the Clark based on reviews on Trip Advisor  Got a good deal through hotels com and then hoped that I had made the right choice  It was  My pal and I had a terrific room in a not so full hotel for an off season price that made my friends jaws drop people always tell me Delhi doesnt have mid range hotels    apparently we found the only one  Our two bed room was very clean we had air conditioning a fridge ceiling fan cable TV nice bathroom and a very nice staff happy to help  It was as quiet as can be expected for  Delhi   The staff recommended a travel company nearby to rent a car amp driver for a day and the driver took us to a fantastic shop for clothes then to a beauty parlor near the hotel to get a very reasonably priced manicure and pedicure  The second day when we told the staff where we wanted to go they recommended we take the metro which isnt too far away by walking and is a terrific way to get around  There is some shopping not too far away from the hotel    shoe stores are good but the clothing stores werent so great  There arent really restaurants around so you will have to rent a cardriver for that room service is ent at the hotel  I found the hotel a great respite at the end of each day  Will definitely stay again  
P => Comparatively Impressive In general Delhi is a shaddy place full of touts and scammers  The Clark is relatively safe clean and a good deal for a budget hotel  Our room did not have any windows but the sheets were incredibly soft and clean the beds were comfortable and the airconditioning a blessing  The hotel is also near a local night ket and only five minutes from the Karol Bagh metro  Do not trust the hotel tour guide He brought us to his office and pretended to call the train station for tickets  He lied about the seat availabilty luring us to his expensive car rides  Rather check with ABC  travels which is on the corner of the hotel block  In all the hotel was a ent stay and I would definitely recommend it to a friend  
P => excellent hotel  you get very good service delicious food for a very reasonnab Francoise Wang Toutain  french nationality the location of the hotel is very convenient  Delhi metro station is a  minutes  be  walk and the metro goes directly to Connht place  The staff is very welcoming and help for finding places where you want to go  the restaurant on the fifth floor gives a view of this part of Delhi witha large and very clean terrasse The food is very clean and delicious I mean for a foreigner like me the room are comfortable though I had not the most comfortable one  The cleaning is done correctly everyday  the internet is free access  Also on the road to the metro station you have a nice ket selling indian clothes and also daily life things  It is opened until  oclock in the evening  Its a niceplace to spend some time  I stayed for ten days in this hotel for I was working In New Delhi  It was nice to come back every evening in a clean and friendly place  I would recommend the hotel for those who do not like the snobbish atmosphere of the great palaces of Delhi but still want good qualities rooms and services  
P => Acceptable two star hotel I stayed at that place twice with quick and friendly check in  Rooms on both occations were small but rather clean with surprisingly good bed linen  Bathrooms came with working but primitive showers and toilets  Good towels provided and they even had toiletries  Neighborhood is an extremly busy and loud bazaar area with traffic that drives you crazy  Since no taxi driver knows this hotel suggest you print our the location map from the hotels web side  Personally I prefered to eat at McDonalds just around the corner or a Pizza Hut  meters away not really finding the hotel restaurant appealing enough  For cheap internet access and even printers there is a place right next to the hotel  
P => New Delhi Great hotel   very basic but great service  The hotel was a bit noisy between am  pm because of the ket but you felt like you were in India and not a sterile   hotel My two children loved it and we had a great short stay in Delhi  
P => Good service  Nice Place  Great Value  Clark International is a fine hotel  Our rooms were clean  The room service was quick and food very good  All of the staff were very pleasant We took advantage of the pickup from airport as well as a trip to Agra and a tour of Delhi  The tours were good and the pickup is handy  The hotel took care of all our transportation and tour arrangements from the moment we landed to our departure  This is an extra cost on top of the room but well worth it  It made things very easy and enjoyable for us  We would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Delhi for a few days  There is a bit of street noise at night as the other reviewers have said but it is tolerable  
P => Safe Clean and Trying hard Clark International DelhiTrying to maintain a ent standard of budget hotel in a chaotic city  This is clean safe at least for us with services fittings and staff that work if all look rather tired and ent if not exciting food  Use a locker for your valuables  There is no free mineral water but its only about r from the minibar and there are superkets through narrow doors and sometimes in the basements in the major shopping street one short block from the hotel where sundries will cost next to nothing If you arrive on the early UK flight your room isnt likely to be ready until the guests check out and its serviced so youll need to hang around in the restaurant with an accumulating number of guests until it is  Pay for breakfast  r whilst you wait other breakfasts and transfers are normally included all explained on their website which seems accurate in text though the pictures are overly flattering and taken with an estate agents eye We could not discern any advantage of our presidential suite apart from being ginally higher up from the traffic so Id suggest booking based on ensuiteno ensuite and being done with it Be prepared for standard scary Indian driving practises on the pickup but the management will come to both the airport and the train station with a board whilst the driver waits including meeting you from your carriage in the later case which is very helpful if you take the all air con out early late back express thoroughly recommended to Agra for the day  There will probably be a couple of mini power outages or fluctuations during a day as well which will trip the TV and air conditioning but normally last lts The hotel is located in the odd shopping district of Delhi with small streets and shops be prepared for noise dust disorganised telephone lines stray dogs and dilapidated store fronts  It can be a bit of a shock if this is your first stop in India the rest of the city is much the same but there is a huge jump up in cost to the better hotels which have gardens and gates to sheild you from this There are two metro station within a short walk Karol Bagh is the one to head for the other requires negotiating a difficult ction  The hotel has a useful if slightly haphazardly scaled and street named map  Its well worth collecting this along with a business card in order to get back to the hotel via an Auto through the myriad streets  We couldnt find a prepaid auto stop nearby the hotel but there are plenty in the city centre to help you get back The restaurant is on a roof terrace which gives a good view of the urban roof top landscape for better and for worse   geckos on the whitewash palm squirrels scampering on parapets kites circling in the smog continual honking of horns inexplicable sirens horns or drums depending on the date and endless dust  Its done out in Bamboo with nightlights and waiter service and tries its best  The Indian style food is better than the western the breakfast is an odd mix of the two  
P => Clean safe and well staffed  Pity about the noise    Although Id concur with other reviewers comments regarding this being a clean well maintained and well staffed hotel I cant really go any further without mentioning the street noise which a light sleeper would really struggle with  Hard to blame the hotel for this but worth pointing out The pick up service was good and appreciated given our delayed arrival at Delhi Airport but I found the hard sell tactics from our pick up regarding procuring guides and further travel tickets a little tiresome when youve just arrived off a long flight  The hotel staff were however efficient at arranging taxis and giving advice on other transporttourist issues Also worth pointing out for the uninitiated that Karol Bagh the area in which the hotel is located is a long way from the tourist sights of Old and New Delhi although the hotel is just a five minute walk from Delhis crowded but otherwise excellent new Metro system Karol Bagh stop  So the airport pick up makes even more sense in that you can get a grip on the geography of the place before you venture out All in all just about worth the money but be careful if you are a light sleeper 
P => The Objective Truth First of all in order to provide readers with unbiased review it will be best to start with the general context  First timers in India especially travellers from Europe and the US should know that India is very different place from home not saying good bad beautiful or ugly the word different incorporates all those adjectives  My word for India would be spicy  When I arrived at the airport I felt a little disturbed it cannot be compared to the Munich airport that I left  The facilities looked much older it was dirty and the place was crowded with colorful people  OK I needed a coffee urgently first surpise was that there was no schwarz coffee available dont you even think of a good espresso so I had to go for a nescafe  On the way out of the customs a driver holding a sign with my name was waiting I requested from the hotel my complimentary pick up  The trip to the hotel was an adventure itself people cooking in cauldrons on the street small cars and motorbikes everywhere  The traffic is very busy all cars scratched and those people horn vigorously in fact due to the fact I guess that they drive on the right side on the buses you see the signs quotKeep distancequot and quotPlease hornquot  This habit of pressing the horn vigorously I did not like because in the Clark hotel I could easily hear those because of the ill fitted windows  Well the first night it bothered me a lot from the second night on I got used to it  A few words for the hotel   it is situated near Khan Road Ghaffar ket and honestly it is very busy area dirt small shops street vendors ugly buildings  The hotel itself is OK reasonably clean and the staff was friendly but I would expect more for   EUR a night  There was hot water during the first day then disappeared then came back  Breakfast was   OK     I had an omlett some toasts and butter    the rest I did not eat  I had troubles finding good quality food  My Indian hosts however brought me to a distant beutiful residential area to a restaurant called Chopsticks   excellent place I remember it was located in Asiad VillageThe hotel has a computer room with ppl who reply to e mails   of those young ppl I saw  Here I must mentioned that before picking up Clark international I had hard times finding a hotel in India and my travel agent could not help me much  Later speaking with my Indian hosts one of my suspicion was confirmed   mid range hotel in India is not what the European traveller expects  OK Clark Internation is really a mid range hotel for India some of the other hotels in the area those with fallen letters from their signs really scared me  So in New Delhi there are some very shitty hotels some that are OK like Clark International and good hotels which I later saw  The good hotels are located around Counnht place       beatiful gardens and luxury but available for a bit above   a night  Some names of those are   Hotel Imperial  Hotel Le Meridian The Park  Shangri La  Ashoka Palace  Taj MansinghIt is your choice some people like to walk in the dirt in those charming kets and bargain however I got sick from the food and water no ice only bottled water I had a three day diarreah when I came back home but this is because I was not cautious enough  I saw beautiful palces Huun Tomb Qutub Mnar Sagrafang Tomb Museum of Handicrafts India Gate      lovely gardens and everything is cheap  
P => Top class Infrastructure   excellent Room amp Toilet   Spic n span clean at the corners pleasant colors clean n comfortable bed clean linen and towels well stocked mini fridge Staff   Extremely friendly cooperative and supportive Restaurant   very good Travel support   very good with in house cars and drivers  Airport transfer is included Location   centrally located  good for shopping  metro station is close by Suggestion   Keep tissue boxes in the rooms Downside   not suitable if you are arriving by own car since there is no parking facility Overall rating   very suitable for travellers who are used to international quality hotels  
P => Excellent Service   good value We stayed at Clark for  days  Bookings were arranged directly with the hotel   we were picked up even though our plane was delayed and we were over an hour late and presented with roses a bit OTT but still a nice surprise  Staff very helpful and check inout was very smooth Rooms were fine   probably worth going for one up from the standard so you are higher up and away from the street noise  There is also a local ket one road down that starts  ish until late except Mondays   very useful for picking up nick naks and getting quick deep fried snacks from  The hotel is about  minutes tuk tuk ride to Connht Place and about  minutes in a taxi from the airport They organised a car and driver to take us on an Agra tour   much cheaper than the tour operators in the area I have a suspicion that the food is brought in from a kitchen out side the hotel   but room service was always prompt and good value for money  The rooftop restaurant lacks ambience but worth a visit so you can watch the eagles swoop for their dinner   you can also get very close up to them as they land on the roof The hotel doesnt have any alcohol listed on its menus   but can still be ordered off the bill 
P => value for money I had a nice stay in the hotel with my wife  a homly amp clean environment with prompt service was great   value for the money Staff was kind and helpful  We had a nice stay and sweet memories

P => Nice Clean Hotel Near Metro We travelled Delhi in group tour of India of Delhi Agra Jaipur Jaiselmer  Hotel Classic is nice clean hotel with good facilities  We were served well by smiling staff  Hotel is near metro station will lift which in useful for old person like us  
P => Could be cleaner great location for metro We arrived in the middle of the night having been picked up by taxi read two chaps in someones small car which unnerved us a little arranged by the hotel prior to our arrival which wasa lot less hassle than trying to deal with hem at the airport at midnight  We stayed for two nights and found the staff to be really helpful and the service great with room service at pretty much any time of night or day  The constant Bollywood blaring out of the reception TV was a little offputting at  oclock in the morning but nothing compared to the rest of the noise in Delhi  Our room was quite large and had table and chairs and a sofa as well  The bed was large and quite comfortable but the sheets werent the cleanest Ive ever seen and it didnt help that we didnt realise we were supposed to remove the wierd pillow cases before getting into bed  The bathroom was a bit grim but no grimmer than any of the other hotels we stayed at in India during the fortnight that we stayed  The major bonus about this hotel is that it is in the middle of a slightly quieter surburban district and it is only a  minute walk to the nearest metro station which for Westerners is the easiest cheapest least hassle method of getting round  The area was packed with shopsrestaurants and one of the only department stores I saw  The metro being so close was perfect  although being arated boys in one line girls in another for X Ray scanning prior to embarking everytime was certainly an interesting method of security that I doubt passengers would tolerate on the Tube  There are probably other better value perhaps slightly cleaner hotels out there but for first time visitors to India we found this easy hassle free OK value for money with good service good English communication and ideally situated for an initial foray into Delhi  
P => Loved the Hotel N Staff Good Clean Budget Hotel in ket Area Koral Bugh  We had beed reffered by friends who visited last year  It was very nice experience  Staff very friendly  
P => Bed bugs We stayed here for just one night prior to returning home      the whole appearance is shabby however we were not prepared for the rude awakening by the bed bugs   very large bed bugs  On complaining at the front desk we were told theyd move us the next day which was useless since we were leaving  They brought up a bug spray and clean bedding which in fact looked even dirtier No breakfast is included and to be honest Id really have my doubts on the standard of hygiene in food preperation   therefore we did not call for any room service Its not a cheap hotel and better can be found for the price in this area  
P => nice clean hotel at great location The location is very convenient for the metro   a  minute walk down a busy shopping street brings you to the hustle and bustle of the road where the metro station is and then its only  stops to Rajiv Chowk Connht Place  Theres an internet terminal in the lobby and wi fi  The staff is fabulous always eager to help and friendly I needed an Indian SIM card for my cell phone  The duty manager sent his assistant on foot at  pm to escort us with the necessary documents to get a card The pickup as promised was there and were taken to the hotel which took about  minutes  we were greeted at the reception nicely and were checked in   All facilities were there as written in Reviews  Must Try their Breakfast in Bed   
P => grungy hotel Really quite expensive for a grungy little hotel  The location is fairly central and close to the metro thats about it  The rooms look pretty tired tv had poor reception and no complimentary breakfast  On arrival after a long trip went to get into bed but found the sheets and duvet cover were really dirty and stained  We phoned to ask for clean sheets but the sheets the staff brought up were worse than the ones already on the bed  They went through several sets of sheets looking for clean ones but found them all in a similar state with blood stains greese spots andor holes  They gave up after looking through several sets amp up and opened a brand new set for us  For IRs  approximately US   we expect clean sheets  
P => Superbly Sited Classic As with most travellers we arrived in the middle of the night so we didnt see too much  As part of our stay we arranged for the hotel to pick us up from the airport saving a huge amount of time amp hassle  The next morning we found that we were in the very safe amp friendly Karol Bagh  The hotel itself was clean amp functional nothing flash  However what made the stay so memorable was the helpfulness of the staff and the hotels location  Go up the street amp turn right and theres a very good cheap vegetarian restaurant  Turn left amp theres a  hour ATM that accepts foreign cards very handy as it takes forever to change money in the bank  Go down the street amp youre in the thick of the Karol Bagh ket where you can buy anything amp everything very cheaply  Turn left and the metro station is at the end of the street  From here you can see a lot of the city easily and inexpensively  rupees to the Red Fort  
P => Does not offer WiFi in the way they advertise it One of the reasons I liked the sound of this hotel was because of the other reviews saying the WiFi access is good However when I arrived they said I could only access the internet from the lobby  The lobby is very small and the only seating area is next to the reception desk practically blocking the main thoroughfare of the hotel This is an inconvenience not a value add  Not at all comfortable and certainly not appropriate for any more than   min use  
P => Clean Affordable Hotel in Bustling Delhi Very Clean Hotel in Busting Delhi  Very Cheap and found same as given in reviws  Aport pup OK  Staff help to guide you for city vision and Jaipur  Provided hot Bfast in Room very early morning  Very happy to book this hotel  
P => GREAT START OF TRIP Great Great Great  Our Start of Tour has been Excellent  We booked this hotel by watching reviews of this hotel  I did not expected that organising Indian tour could be so much easy  I requested Airport pickup at midnight and hotel offered pickup for US instead of US as listed in website  They were prompted in replying and confirming  Maduu Hotel Pickup person was waiting for us in AC Car  Room was same as shown in website  No Carpets with Wifi at Lobby FREE  Now at Indore I called hotel and thanked  We will definately visit hotel again on my way back to US  
P => good hotel I spent  nights in this hotel Rooms were quite good clean and not noisy I would avoid room  and  on st floor since they are next to some ac machines and imagine are quite noisy Staff was nice spoke good english and helped me whenever i asked for Hotel is  min walking from metro station The hotel almost meets western standards and i would recommend it to a friend  
P => An acceptable Delhi hotel The Hotel Classic is an average mid range hotel in the bustling Karol Bagh district  The good   The hotel is very cheap  We paid  rupees per night for a private AC room   The room service menu including breakfast is very cheap for basic but tasty food  We had Indian food one night from there for dinner at it was delicious and extremely cheap   The hotel can arrange reasonably priced transfers and pick ups to the airport and train station but with issues see below  It is only a  minute walk to Delhi s excellent Metro system which can take you to Connht Place and Old Delhi without having to sit in traffic   The room and bathroom are clean   The Air Con is very effective   Laundry is reasonably priced The not so good  The view from the room is of another building and is not nice at all   The TV has only Indian channels    The location is so so  If you re a white person you stand out a bit in the very busy area of Karol Bagh   There is no in room safe   The bathroom is basic clean though and has no shower curtain   We had to check out of the hotel at am and get to the airport quickly  I had pre arranged a transfer with the hotel to pick us up at am but when we came to the lobby with our bags etc there was no record of any booking being made  They were able to get us a car in ten minutes though resplendent with totally shattered windscreen   Hot water is sporadic so expect a few cold showers I would not advise people against this hotel but I don t think I could recommend it either  I suspect there are better located nicer hotels in Delhi  It all comes down to how much you want to spend  
P => very helpful staff great location near the metro station  the room is clean and the hotel staff are very helpfulespecially the manager  trainflight reservation can be made thru this hotel and the most important thing u can chat and get informations online from the staff 
P => Clean generally acceptable room This is an inexpensive hotel in a very crowded neighborhood that will probably be very foreign and confusing to most westerners  I stayed here for two nights upon arriving in India and while the hotel itself is fine above average value by Indian standards I would advise staying at a Western hotel for a couple of days upon arrival to acclimate to India The good rooms are clean I though my room smelled bad but then I realized the problem was that my window did not shut completely and so was letting in the smell of Delhi  Furniture is acceptable the bed is quite comfortable and while nothing about the room is spectacular it is acceptable at the level of budget accommodation in the US and I was fine paying the posted price for the room  The airport pickup was smooth  The staff dealt with me honestly quoting me prices for cars and services that turned out to be quite reasonable and fair  I appreciate this  One desk worker made a call in Hindi for me which was very nice  They gave me a wakeup call  other places I stayed at in India forgot  There was a computer with a slow Internet connection right next to my room that I used several times without being charged  They routed several phone calls to my room for me  The bill was handled in a straightforward efficient manner The bad hot water was in and out this was true in all of India for me I couldnt get the cable TV to work the driver they found for me was a dishonest shyster as near as I could tell I was the only guest yet there was a staff of about  Indians milling around the lobby at all times which was intimidating and weird  The location in my view is less than ideal for a tourist it is hard to find at any rate I would recommend getting a driver for the whole day and not attempting to go on foot from here  The view out my window was of a filthy courtyard and the windows did not shut completely This is acceptable accommodation and while there are nicer hotels to be had for more money if this is what fits your budget I think you can feel good about staying there  
P => Always the Best We stayed here for  nights at the beginning of our holiday in India and for  nights at the endnow too hot to stay here the first part in a room and the second in a suite The suite was large clean and quiet The staff were courteous obliging and quietly efficient This was the one ent place we stayed in in India and it made a world of difference I asked to have breakfast served in my room  Once again no problem at all no extra charge for the brilliant and quick room service  All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Delhi  
P => Peacefull Hotel in Hectic Delhi This was the one ent place we stayed in in India and it made a world of difference  Very cool place peaceful and stylish  Good service and not that expensive though not sure how much we paid  Its not the best value for money we have had but worth spending up for  I have now few hours to linger at Delhi Airport so thought of posting review instead of crushing down in rush at counters Management owner was great help in arranging tours for us ket is just walking distance and location is Lively only drawback is traffic noice during day but as night crawls in all get smoothened up Theres a computer and desk provided in the passage area and the internet connection is good  The laundry service was also good and we had no problems with anything we got back and thought that we probably could have trusted it with more than we did We also hired the hotels driver amp car for a few hours for some sight seeing around Delhi and were pleased with the service  
P => Impressed with Service I am still staying in this hotel  Extreeeeemly clean    Loved thy are treating us  I must say I have travelled a lot in South East Asia this Season but the service facilities and management is uncoable to any   hotel anywhere  They kept person waiting at Airport even our flight was late almost hours and they didnt charge extra penny for such delay  We are here blessed with Free Wi Fi with compliments of management  Owner Boss  is wonderful guy assisting our local trips with detailed maps  that too complimentry  Staff here is attentive to our calls and swing into action whenever required  Location is wonderfull  in busy busy ket  Pollution  Key factor Govt should look into  Just two blocks away is metro station connecting to main city centre CP  
P => comfortable n best stay ideally locatedexcellent service warm staff and i always make my customers stay there and all appreciate the hotel  
P => It is OK I chose this hotel after reading a few comments here  They were mostly right  This hotel is really OK nothing exciting but clean and the stuff was very friendly and helpful  It is situated right in the centre which is good as well It is a bit old fashioned and you have a feeling that it looked good in s but it is a ent average hotel  No dining hall tho so you have to make sure you ask for your breakfast to delivered to your roomN F  London 
P => Old Fashioned But Not Bad for Price Warning   we booked online via a rd party site and were sold a quotroom  breakfastquot option  Although you can order room service they use a good local restaurant and dont have their own kitchen or dining room nor do they offer any kind of quotincludedquot breakfast with the room  So dont trust any other Web site that tells you they do The building is fairly old the elevator tiny the room old fashioned  I liked it as did my husband but I can see that an American unused to travel outside new US hotels might be a little let down  Its no worse than many places Ive stayed in NYC Rome and elsewhere of the same vintage  It was certainly clean and the location extremely convenient to the train station and local shopping ABSOLUTELY Do contact the hotel directly for their airport pick up service  Theyll overcharge you you pay about double what you would if youre a good bargainer with a taxi on site but its stioll not that much and well worth it if youve had a long flight and get in very late at night as so many Intl flights do  Having the taxi there with our names on a posterboard made a big difference in the insane crowd of meeters and hawkers that assault you when you walk out of the arrivals lounge  
P => DISASTER After reading positive reviews on this site Ive ided to book a  night stay at this hotel  What a mistake It seems that there is no logical explanation for the good reviews except    There is a big sign in the front lobby and in the elevator saying quotPost a good review about us on tripadvisor com and you can win  nights free stayquot  Yes those who stayed there know what Im talking about    I have personally seen  different rooms in the hotel and they all were horrible  But that will come later  Now Ill talk about everything as it unfolded  Nobody waited for us at the airport despite an arranged pickup  Fine we go out haggle our brains out with some taxi drivers get imho a great deal  INR for a nice AC car  We get to the hotel   they have no idea about our reservation  After lots of talking and etc they say fine well give you a room to freshen up and then well see  We go up to the room  I have been in many places in the world as work and a passion for travel takes me virtually everywhere  I have not seen a DISASTER like that anywhere in the world  Literally anywhere  The room is tiny  Dirty  Cramped  Smells like HELL  The bathroom is worse than a public toilet in a Moscow road underpass or the subway for that matter  And its really hard to beat a public toilet in a Moscow road underpass  I get upset and go downstairs to talk to the concierge  He says that he doesnt really understand what my problem is  An Australian fellow overhears our conversation and starts talking to me  Turns out to be my colleague in town for the same reason as we are with another colleague of his own  Theyve booked  rooms arrived late at night so they had no choice  They are shocked as well despite this being far from their first visit to India  Together we started looking for a new hotel  As we walk back upstairs I see a cleanup operation in progress for one of the rooms the door is open   guys with dirty rags are busy smearing dirt around the room instead of cleaning it  One guy whacking the headboard of a bed yes whacking with his dirty rag will remain etched in my memory for a long time  Long story short I got a second room  A higher end one  Yes it was bigger than my co workers  Smelled a little better still horrible  The washroom though   same story  Anyhow we had to stay there for  nights after which we moved to Sri Nanak Continental  Look it up if you care to read my review about it  Bottom line   STAY AWAY from this place and from Channa ket in general  If you can avoid Karol Bagh too  Not everyone can afford that though  A couple of additional points   One of our Indian colleagues went upstairs with us on the night of our first day  He told us that this hotel is considered to be oknice for an average middle class family in India  In other words I guess it seems bad only to westerners    I got to meet the owner of the hotel on the second day  He felt genuinely chagrined by my unhappiness  He spent a while talking to me gave us a duffel bag with the hotel logo as a gift didnt really want to take it but my colleague wanted it  He also forgave us some of the additional charges water and etc  I mean it was for a lhable amount of  INR but its the effort that counts  
P => Its New Delhi Above average compared to other New Delhi moderately priced hotels  If possible call direct to book  much cheaper  Everything worked AC TV fan hot water  Asked for and received fresh towels when necessary  Tip everyone that helped you during your stay on the way out  
P => Likely the best youll find    walk to shopping  This is a ent hotel in the heart of the shopping district walk  block from the hotel and youre on the main street  We stayed at this hotel for several days on two arate occassions and we did notice a big difference between the first floor and the third floor rooms    third floor is much nicer and quieter  For the price its about the best you can find in Delhi and the location is great for shopping  Also walking distance about  blocks to a GREAT restuarant    Udupi its clean cheap and great South Indian food  On the down side the doormen were the lasiest Ive seen anywhere but the management seemed very nice  
P => Hotel tr s symptahique  
P => 
P => Delhi Not a bad hotel in the national capital The rooms are more or less well maintained and well furnished Kitchen is also good Location is probably out of the way Food is good and enough choices In short good value for money  
P =>  A Home in Karol BaghDelhi away from your Home  Hi I am a business person from Bangalore and i am happy to share my experience of my stay in Hotel C Pak Inn   Past  year i am visiting Delhi atleast  days in a month for my business  I had searched for a ent hotel in karol Bagh and finally I got this C Park Inn throu my friend  Almost a year now this C park Inn became a Home for me in delhi away from my Home  After each days business meets i am so relaxed and i feels that I am at home in this hotel  The Manager Mr Udham Singh is very kind to help the guests and i was amazed to see the way he conducts him to the foreign tourists  I must tell their Staffs AshokPraveen and Ravi  all are pleasing guys and will assit you without any hesitation Staying here is a peaceful and pleasant experience for me it is simply a luxurious at a reasonably economical price I wish all the best and keep going C Park Inn 
P => Good Midrange Hotel In New Delhi Despite of several inconveniences during my stay here no toilet paper in my room no hot water in the evening unless you ask for it beforehand air condition in room  is noisy I had no bedsheets I still recommend other people to stay here  I stayed here for  days  It is located very well in Karol Bagh and the services you get from the managementstaff are good  They advise you in a very firm tone with travel advices etc   you dont feel that they are giving you that particular advice in order to make some rupees which is something I have often felt when talking to the hotel staff in India  
P => A great hotel I stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor  The rooms were really clean  The staff was real friendly and knowledgeable and helped arrange various tours and day trips throughout my stay  I would definitely stay here again no question  
P => will be back in the future A good budget hotel Very nice manager en staff Are very helpfull Shops are close and also the metro station You can book your trips in the hotel The manager can give you good advise  
P => Great Hotel There are many hotels in Karol Bagh Delhi India  The C Park Inn is one of the best The rooms are clean amp comfortable  The staff is very frienbdly amp helpful  And you cant beat the price  This is my SECOND stay here and I plan to stay here again when I return to India  I give the C Park Inn my very best recommendagtion 
P => Very comfortable and convenient stay This hotel is clean and comfortable with good facilities and helpful staff  I have been travelling in India visiting various cities and my experience of staying here was far better than in some other places  There were no hassles the staff were helpful and friendly and there was no issue with me checking in early  They made my business trip no less than a pleasure 
P => 
P => Trust the reviews  avoid this hotel  Myself and  other friends stayed at the Dee ks for  nights  We had booked  rooms through a travel agent and was told that it was a ent hotel We arrived late the first night   and were somewhat greeted warmly by the doorman  Hotel was dimly lit and seemed like no one was there  Room tiny single beds  Bathroom had basic features   strong water pressure but hardly any hot water  If lucky  water is lukewarm  Hotel employees were not well trained and would linger around expecting and wanting a tip from bringing us fresh towels to ice to room service  Breakfast was very dissapointing  Bread and fruit   and can order eggs through the waiter We checked out and returned to the hotel a night later as part of our tour package and the front desk male receptionist was grouchy and rude   and not helpful nor friendly  Doorman was hovering expecting a tip for opening the door  None of the facilities were open  Hotel is hidden just off the road in the middle of nowhere Would not recommend this hotel at all   there are many others to choose from and at the rate they are charging   US a night  its unbelievable Would rate it at a motel standard   a  star  
P => Good hotel let down by the staff I am day  into a  night stay at the Dee ks  It was booked for me by the company running my training course Overall the hotel is good the rooms are clean spacious value for money  They have individual air con a good TV and the bed is comfy But it is let down by petty things namely associated with the staff They have a big menu  Its just that for the first  nights in a row they dont have my first choice meal  Cut down on the menu if you cant support it I even ordered ice cream on the st night to be told the chef had melted it That was a bit worrying it left me wondering if the fridges worked or he just left it out They advertise Wi Fi but you find out you have to pay for it  I was staying in a Premium room  Perhaps in the super deluxe rooms its free  On the nd night I was on the Internet only for it to stop working half way through  I went down to complain was asked whether my time had run out it hadnt  It transpires one of the staff had pulled out the network connection so he could plug in his mobile or somethingThe shower was lukewarm  I skipped it on the second morning it was freezing With  degrees outside they wouldnt even need to electrically heat it just use solar panels but somehow the water was cold I did a foreign exchange  Only they didnt have a  ruppee note so they said theyd give it to me later  OK its worth hardly anything but Im principled on these things  On the nd day I asked again for it and they said theyd sent it to my room  I never got it and Im not going to ask again but things like that completely let down a hotel and make it look very unprofessional Overall I would say theres nothing wrong with Dee ks   its good value for money  If you want to keep it simple use it for a nights sleep and youre not fussy about what you can eat itll suit you perfectly  But it could be a really good hotel if they just sorted out all the silly things 
P => 
P => If it is not Ata its got to be Delhi City Centre I was in Hotel Ata the sister concern of this hotel for  days on work  I checked out made a trip to Agra and returned to this hotel  Very nice and comfortable rooms excellent service and a great location 
P => Filthy rip off  Do not stay here  The website is misleading and the place is disgusting  There was actual blood on the walls of the bathroom and the building is literally falling apart  The management will lie to you and rip you off  An absolutely disgusting experience  
P => Horrible hotel We arrived to be told that because we had arrived early we had to pay for almost an additional nights rate  As we were tired after our journey and in need of a shower we had no option  It would have been good to have been warned about this especially as we were in contact with the hotel prior to our visit as they were sending a car to pick us up  The hotel is nothing like the photos you see most of these are actually of the adjoining Ata Hotel which appears to have some kind of partnership going with the Delhi City Centre hotel  The room whilst cleaned was uncomfortable in that the sheets and towels were grey and so threadbare there were holes in them the air conditioning didnt work the fan very noisy so much so we thought it was going to fall off  Staff wanted money for just about everything so much so that one actually pushed his way into the room while we were undressing to ask for money for returning the passports they took off us on reception  The desk manager rang us at am waking us up to double check how long we were staying despite going over this and writing it down several times There are a number of hotels on this road that are far better for the same and less money  We stayed in one on our return to Delhi on the same street and it was   quieter and more relaxing Only thing going for this is its location     but then there are other hotels 
P => Cozy and comfortable good budget hotel I travelled with friends to India and stayed in new delhi at hotel delhi city center  I liked the room in the hotel  Nice and bright  My friends stayed in Ata Hotel and we would all walk to Connht Place to eat Indian spicy chat  thats what the dish is called  and go shopping to path  The staff helped me understand where to go and what to see  
P => Awful Hotel I was in this awful hotel and the staff would try to cheat you at every time  They charge things you havent consumed and for that price you can go to a REAL HOTEL thats a pathetic place with pathetic staff really  I hope the government would close it for obvious reasons they cheat everytime they can you will be robbed 
P => good for the location I stayed at this hotel  nights I think the location is great to go to Delhi station metro Connht place  Regarding the room it is simple   not good and not bad  I felt the price is a bit expensive with total And this area   Pahar Ganji Main bazar are very busy so if youd like to stay quiet and clean area I dont recommend this hotel  if not you will enjoy your staying  
P => Great place This is a super choice for the budget traveller close to Connht Place and Old Delhi  Much better than many other cheap places opposite the railway station 
P => great value Great place to stay in Delhi For the price I paid I got exactly what I wanted   clean comfortable and welcoming place to stay  The staff was extremely helpful and go out of their way to serve all your needs  The room was good size freshly painted with clean sheets etc   had a good sleep  Place is pretty quiet too stayed here for a few days enjoyed it  
P =>   
P => Hotel effrayant et pas en s curit   
P => 
P => Sweet Home I Booked through the website  made the most of the offers they have on it  stayed for  nights got one night free and also a agra trip free  paid  per night though  The hotel is very comfortable compared to the hotels in that locality seriously  This was my rd time in delhi and stayed in express  for the first time  excellent i must say  the rooms were clean the staff very friendly and helpful and in overall a very homely atmosphere they have maintained  the food in the hotel was also good The other hotels in the same locality are very very shady   i recommend everyone to say who are looking for excellent accommodation in a budget price p s also beautiful rooms thumbs up guys   
P => bad express We were so unhappy with this hotel When we saw mouse in our room we all are scared and all jerk staff start smiling  Slept there one night because we had no choice  Coughed most of the night because of the smoke embedded room  Eyes were on fire for a full  hours after checking out  Even the guy at the front desk thought it was horrible  I d call that false advertising of nce and clean rooms  
P => superb staygreat services                   We had serched for the hotel through internet We contacted the hotel people on telephoneand booked one executive room we reached Delhi by Rajdhani express in the evening from a hectic tour in calcutta  As said there was a hotel guy on the station waiting for us with a car  we were then taken to the hotel which was hardly  minutes drive from the station At the lobby we were offered welcome drink Coke After completing the formality we were taken to our room The ambiance of the room was very good as shown in the picture on their web site The services were good and the staff was very humble and polite and always ready to help The hotel people arrenged for a cab for local sight seeing and a trip to Agra at a very cheaper rate and the Taxi driver too was very friendly and polite  we stayed in the hotel for  days  In all we enjoyed the trip to Delhi I would always recomend the hotel to all my friends that whenever they visit Delhi they should stay in Hotel Express   
P => average one I travelled to delhi for business purpose and was looking for some hotel near to pahar ganj amp found Express   Hotel is quite ok with all the required infrastructure amp other facilities  wi fi also good only thing is the location  situated on narrow road with full of traffic amp bit difficult to find  staying there in small budget is a really worth 
P => A Small Paradise This hotel is a wonder in it self amp one of the most beautifully designed hotel from inside  The locaion is a bit crowded but being in the city center one could expect that much of crowd The hotel rooms are spacious amp elegantly designed  The best part is that everything in the room was in perfecty working condition which we didnt find in any other hotel in India  We spent three nights there without any complaints amp all the staff members are very friendly One of the cleanest hotels I have ever seen Total value for moneyExcellent Service High hygiene standardsFrom the airport pickup till the departure from the hotel It was a wonderful experience altogether quotDEFINITELY A COME BACK HOTELquot 
P => Very good The hotel location is not very good but the rooms are news comfortable and clean  The staff is very friendly and helpful  I have a great time in Express   
P => A Spotless Hotel in New Delhi My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Express   We reached Delhi very late at night on ch th and the hotel pickup service was at the airport on time awaiting our arrival  Honestly Express  is not in the best part of town but upon our entry into the hotel lobby we completely forgot the streets outside  Our check in was quick and efficient and we found the staff very willing to cater to our needs  In fact  I had been in touch with hotels MD several days prior to our arrival and he was extremely friendly and accommodating of our requests  The rooms were very reasonably priced something difficult to come by in Delhi clean and well kept  The MD has taken obvious care in maintaining the establishment thus far  A very creative and contemporary collection of art is also tastefully displayed throughout the hotel  My family and I also enjoyed several meals from the hotels kitchen and we agreed that the food was well prepared and tasty  I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who requires a clean and reasonably priced place to stay in New Delhi  You will certainly get more that what your money pays for  
P => Express is worth each penny I am from Canada   I stayed in Express not once but twiceand have reservation for the third time  The rooms and bathrooms are very clean  The manager and rest of staff are helpful and their service is excellent  After checking and comparing many hotels in the area  i ided on Express  
P => new and clean hotel The hotel is new and it is quite small there are only three floors with a few rooms per floor  The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are new  The staff is very friendly and helpful  They are very eager to assist customers in any ways possible  Our experience dealing with the staff was very pleasant and they made our stay quite comfortable  It can get a bit noisy at night if you have a room with a window towards the street which happens very often in hotels in Delhi unless you are in the more quite areas such as the Diplomatic Enclave  
P => 
P => Comfortable hotel to stay in Central Delhi The Florence Delhi is a small chain of moderately priced small and friendly hotels  The staff worked very hard to please  The hotel was clean and comfortable certainly a  star This hotel was very clean and comfotable the folks were very friendly and helpful with all of our needs  The street is quite busy and it isn t close to the airport but we wanted a clean and cool hotel and this was perfect  The dining roomrestaurant remains open until very late and the food is great  Food was good both western and Indian   They were happy to please  It is a relatively quite neighborhood in the WEA area with a quiet stroll in a residenital area and small park near by  
P => Truly a nice hotel Hotel Florence is truly a nice hotel to be in especially when you want a reasonable or mid range hotel This time I was here with my family and I needed few extra facilities like airport pick up I felt really happy when the staff told me that we provide picks up facility to our guest   reasonable price They received us at the airport and we were in hotel within  minutes We were provided a beautiful room with a comfortable bed Room services were also round the clock and I felt that all the staff members have very jolly and friendly nature We appreciate the services of the hotel at such reasonable rates  Over all the staff was very help full and i am glad that i stayed here  Good job keep it up 
P => Best Value for Money Florence is situated in the busy areas of Karol Bagh  Florence wins hands down in value for money  Mentioned below are why I recommend Florence Ideally Located Very Very Very Clean Good Service Bang in Middle of the shopping areas Good Food in Florence as well as the locality around Good Rates Only Drawback  Repetitive Breakfast  the same everyday  Go for it  
P => Excellent hotel in good location Hotel Florence provides precisely what you would expect from a Budget hotel in the category Good accommodation and absolutely first rate service The rooms are small but well appointed and well maintained with Mini Bars and excellent restaurant on the top floor In a city where quality and price do not always carry the relationship that one would anticipate the Hotel Florence is a very safe choice  
P => Did not like it very much This place is okay it is clean and the staff tries to be helpful  We were still quite disappointed because the place is anything but cheap for Indian standards  Most of all its location Karol Bagh is inconveniently located and an unattractive neighbourhood  It is both far from the train stations and Delhis tourist spots  During night time it looks like a slum We got one of the quieter rooms which are located in the core of the building  These rooms though have no window or only one leaing to a tiny dark light shaft  Our room was quite small the ones to the road side are much more spacious but the traffic din there is unbearable if you sleep longer than until dawn  The cleaning staff makes matters even worse when they start to roam the place in a most noisy manner from am on  It seems that it takes all day to clean one floor and they will not stop shouting and throwing things on the floor

P => ent inexpensive hotel After staying at terrible Godwin hotel selected by myself I was referred to this by Incredible India staff who were very helpful and went out of the way to help us This hotel is ok not great but something ent for those on budget  Location is in the shopping areas althought most of Delhi is like a shopping area    
P => Great place to stay to experience Delhi A nice hotel with new features and friendly staff ManagerOwner Daljeet Singh was very helpful in assiting me from the ever changing enquiry for my group to the payment and pick ups also  The hotel is nice and new in the centre of Karol Bagh with auto rickshaws and shops all around making it easy to get around Delhi from this great centre  Staff were great and will stay again next time we go Breakfast was included and choices were excellent    loved the chai ginger tea  
P => Clean and efficient with very cooperative staff Stayed for  nights on way to Mussoorie ans again a night on way back  The place looks to have been recently done up and done up pretty nicely  Room was clean spacious and with all basic amenities  Very good value for money  The room service is excellent and so is the cooperation we got from the reception staff who are really friendly and helpful  Location is ideally suited for shopping but rather conjested and noisy though very safe  On the negetive side   they should keep replacing the soapshampoo etc in the bath  Those looked reallly dated    The TV reception is poor  though the TV itself was an LCD flat  They should get DTH connection Overall a very nice place to stay on a budget  
P => good stay this is my th year at this hotel now upgraded to a good quality my  day stay was very good the owerners were very pleasant helpful and treated us like family the general manager ravi was excellant as usual nice excllent staff the food was excellant brilliantly cooked the bosses eat there so that should say it all so please GO there ra amp kiran chhabra gerrards crosss bucks 
P => A nice stay at the good palace Was pleasantly suprised I stayed in the Good Palace for  night before my tour and  nights after my tour and to be honest wasnt expecting it to be too great due to the low cost of the rooms and general lack of appeal on their website advertising  However I was wrong I enjoyed my stay they have helpful staff who at first  seem a bit standoffish but will do anything for you if needed they also have great room service some of the best food I tasted in India and their rooms are neat and nice  I would have given it an above average rating due to good value for money but they were refurbishing the lobby during my stay and it was a bit chaotic so it wouldnt of been fair to give a higher rating  For the low cost of the hotel I think it is a nice place to stay I would go back  
P => Basic but ent   you get what you pay for I stayed at Hotel Good Palace as part of a package deal with Namaste India Tours which turned out to be a fabulous bargain as a whole  Our room at Hotel Good Palace was clean and ent the walls and furniture were well maintained and the TV was functional with a basic selection of local channels  The AC was also fully functional  The bed chair and wardrobe were basic but in good condition and the bedding was clean and comfy The bathroom was a bit disappointing   the shower didnt work we had to make do with a bowl and bucket and the shower curtain was awfully mildewed  It was fairly clean and usable   there was running hot water thankfully but it certainly did not meet the standard of the room itself The staff were very polite and helpful and the laundry was fantastic   I still havent been able to find anyone who can iron a certain top of mine the way they did at the Good Palace Location wise you must bear in mind that this hotel is right in the middle of one of the busiest parts of Delhi  Therefore to expect peace and quiet is simply unrealistic  If you MUST have peace and quiet this is not the place for you All said and done you will get what you pay for with this hotel  Its a budget hotel for travellers looking for a ent place to stay at an affordable price  You wont pay premium rates to stay here so dont expect a premium hotel  
P => Noisy Stay ast the Good Palace First of all the hotel is located in a noisy part of the city central sales area  The rooms were small and poorly insulated  You could hear people talking in the hallway talking in the building next door and the noise from the vehicle horns  Second on the first night there was no hot water in the morning after  AM  Third the brakfast was a C  at best  On the good side the staff tried to be helpful  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they like noisy places 
P => Low end barely acceptable Used as part of and Intrepid Tours basic trip  It was a basic hotel  A little dirty languid staff few amenities  our air conditioner was ot connected unsure whether it would work if needed  However it was quiet and had the basics necessary for a stay  We had breakfast there and had no problems  
P => 
P => Great Hotel for the price  Been in India for over a month hubbing in and out of Delhi  Stayed at the Grand Park  differnt times  This hotel is a great base for exploring Delhi and Northern India  For the price you will not find a cleaner or larger hotel room  The sheets are spotless AND the blankets are freshly washed  AC unit worked great hot water was good hotel is safe and the area is fine  Breakfast is included as if tasted good nothing spectacular but no complaints  Its only a  rupie taxi to the train station   blocks west of the hotel is a huge ket street with loads of restaurants and shops including McDonalds    The actual street the hotel is on is not the nicest place to look at    but its fine and safe  My wife walked around at night and didnt feel uncomfortable The owner Mr Madan is a wealth of info and will book tours and help you book train and flights  As a travel agency they of course take commession on trips but for trains and flights he does it at cost using Indian online travel companies  His advice and help has made our trip extremely easy and has been really helpful  Internet is availble using their computer  No wireless internet in the hotel though Listen at the end of the day heres why we stayed and continued to come back Its very clean its in good shape its safe and they provide good advice and will help you out with any questions or problems  If youre coming to Delhi give this place a look  
P => Clean affordable hotel to get away from the Delhi chaos After having a bad experience in another hotel we checked into the Hotel Grand Park Inn  All the staff were very friendly and accommodating  Even though on the ground floor the hotel entrance was sandwiched inbetween shops dont let that deter you  Once inside it is a quiet atmosphere ok as quiet as Delhi can get  Our room faced an alley way so it was fairly quiet  The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and in good condition  We were given a bottle of water per day per person  This was a great benefit Other hotels we stayed in we had to buy water  Breakfast was either an Indian breakfast or American breakfast  Basically Chai and Parantha or eggs and toast  We ate in the breakfast room upstairs but you could also have it delivered to your room  A couple of times we had dinner and lunch  The food was fairly inexpensive for a hotel and tasty  I also had laundry done which was done on the same day and delivered to my room  My friend who was travelling with us used the owners computer a couple of times to check her email  According to a couple of the reviews it was far away from the train station etc  We had a car and driver so I did not have a problem with this  Also someone mentioned that the rickshaw driver didnt know where the hotel was well Delhi has millions of hotels the rickshaw drivers dont know every one Make sure you keep the address with you tell the driver the area first then the street name if anything the driver or you can call the hotel and they will give directions  
P => Only For One Day Very isolated   long walk to train station  Taxirickshaws tell youthey know where it is but dont  filthy street even by Delhi sstandards  Grim breakfast  Redeeming feature   flashy showers   ifthey worked properly 
P => Excellent value for the money Grand Park Inn is certainly one of the best hotels I have stayed at in India  The rooms are simple but large and clean  The room service and hotel staff are very friendly and helpful  The area is centrally located busy at daytime but very quite during the nights  I have tried other hotels in Delhi but keep returning to Grand Park Inn  
P => basic rooms with great service What this hotel lacks in luxury features it sure makes up for in friendly and helpful staff This is a very basic but very clean Hotel with some of the friendliest staff members I have ever met during my years of travels No request was too big and everything we asked for got promt attention They have a small room for breakfast and it turned out that the mornign get together there was quite entertaining as we met fellow travellers from all over the world It is located in the outskirts of the Karol Bargh ket close to Metro and shopping  We asked the staff for pointer to a few restaurants and ended up having some of the best Indian food we had on the trip  Dinner for two for    left out of the hotel then first right and a few blocks down the street you will find Santos  It felt safe at all times to walk around the neighborhood They arranged pick up as well as transportation back to the airport for a very resonable price as well as a driver for one day worth of sight seeing  even though the driver wanted to take us shopping a few times but a firm no got us back on track    I guess the drivers still get a comission for bringing in tourists to the bazaars  I exchanged money here as well and got a better rate than at the exchange office in the airport We asked for a nearby internet cafe    the owner let us use his computer for our needsAll in all a basic but good place to stay 
P => Great little safe haven I stay here one two occasions once at the a start of the holiday and once at the end  One both occasions the rooms where immaculate  The food was good  The service while not warm is very efficient and trust worthy   no pressure to book tours etc  And they reliably booked taxis for us to go to the train station and the airport The location was initially daunting  but after afew days in India I realised this was the norm   the Karol Bagh area is actually quite good not touristy so you dont get too much bother  
P => O K for price  Good resturant nearby  This hotel is okay  The area is fine not the best but safe to walk around  Lots of kets and shops to go to  There is the most awesome resturant as you follow the hotels directions to the nearby resturants  Ask at the desk where there are resturants  Generally it is turn left out of the hotel to the end of the road take a right and walk straight down that road  Its on the right hand side and is called Sandoz  It was a receommendation to us and we are so glad we went  Get the malai kofta only nice one I actually found during my stay in India and dal makhini  We didnt get chicken as its always a bit risky in unknown resturnats in India but my partner ended up wishing he had got the butter chicken as the food was superbThere were ants in the room but they stayed to thier section far away from the bed  They had obviously made a route across the room that they followed each night  They werent too much of a bother and were the really tiny ones  Only thing I would say is seal all bags  I came out of the shower to find they had all disappeared and were in my handbag after a sweet wrapper  I didnt like the fact they were there too much as not too keen on insects myself but like I said  They generally werent a problem aside from me leaving sweet wrappers in thier path Room is spacious as is the bed and bathroom  Good powerful shower with plenty of hot water  It was clean and I was overal impressed with it for the price   for the night with expedia  Breakfast is included and is fine  I asked simply for toast and they made me  pieces of toast an omelette and a bannana  I think they give you that whether or not you want it The breakfast room is small and has one long table for all guests to sit  It is a bit like a hostel in that sense but its not too bad really Im not sure if I would recommend or not to my own friends  Backpackers or travellers will find it luxury  Those used to hotels might not find it the best  I usually stay in hotels and thought it was okay but the location is a little difficult to walk around  Very busy traffic down the roads as with all india which if its your first time can be a little scary to walk around  All in all  It is okay  Didnt try the room service menu dont think they have a resturant but the prices were good the sevice charge cheap as chips in fact cheaper and there was quite a large variety of food on offer It is okay for just a night  I probably wouldnt stay more than   
P => Great place to stay in the madness of Delhi Staff were so helpful My friend and I stayed here for  nights  Staff were extremely helpful and looked out for us as we were unprepared for the craziness of the city of Delhi  They were flexible with dates also as we went to stay in Agra for one night during our scheduled stay and came back  Staff could not have been more helpful or friendly the location was quite central food was great and they provided us with assistance with taxis prices of taxis etc  and surrounding places to eat  The rooms were spotless the beds were very comfortable and we had no complaints whatsoever  By the end of our trip to Delhi we felt that it was a safe place to stay and a refuge away from madness on the streets I would highly recommend it  
P => Comfortable reasonably central hotel with great staff   nights in Delhi as a single girl in town can be an exhausting business You need somewhere where you can excape the dust dirt and noise and with feeling terrible with the flu and no way of changing the flight home this was a cosy enough place to hole up with some lemsip The staff really looked after me well  The only improvement Id suggest is a more western menu for room service and a no smoking policy in the hotel The hot water was not reliable but was there   of the time  Air conditioning likewise Staff could not be more helpful  
P => Great place to start your trip The hotel was very clean hotel staff pleasant and helpfull and the travel desk within the hotel is great Location is OK although not many rickshaw drivers knew it fortunately the business card of the hotel had a route description  Room is not that cosy but very clean and therefore a great place to start our trip 
P => Very attentive and respectful staff to female travellers My dhter and i stayed at the hotel Grand Park Inn during our stay in Delhi  We found the hotel staff and management to be exptremely courteous and helpful  Although the hotel is not located exactly in the centre of Delhi its only a short trip away by autorickshaw or taxi and a welcome relief after being in Central Delhi  The street itself is not great as it is in the centre of the quotautomotivequot trade but the management Mr Madan Pai and his staff have many suggestions and travel services   We found the pick up from the airport and train station very reliable and safe The rooms were more than adequate with clean bathrooms air conditioning that works clean and the food and room service were prompt and delicious  The only thing to mention is that the pillows were really hard and uncomfortable   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Delhi and wanting a safe and friendly place to stay  
P => A Safe Haven in the Midst of Motorcyle hem Arriving at the Hotel Grand Park Inn I was warmly greeted by the staff and graciously assisted to my room on the rd floor thankfully way above the hustle and bustle of the street below  This was very comforting as getting there was a crazy ride    Diwali was only days away so the traffic was more frenetic then usual  In addition to this the taxi driver had difficulty finding it I recommend printing out a map to assist your driver  I took a Police Registered taxi from the International airport and it only cost  IND rupees    a real bagainThe hotel is surrounded by auto shops priily for motorcyles  It is a real treat to see how the locals pimped out their bikes and hatchbacks  Day and night there are men everywhere however I was never harassed or felt unsafe The metro is not that far away however getting across the busy road to access it is a real adrenaline rush    not for the faint hearted Also in close proximity is the Karol Barg kets  Here you can get some excellent bargains    local and international products of all kinds  You can hire a driver through the hotel for  IND rupees for up to  hours giving you time and security to access the many wonderful sights of Old and New Delhi negotiate where you want to go with the assisitance of the hotel staff before departing as not all drivers are fluent in English My room had a fan and air conditioner so the heat didnt bother me  There was also plenty of hot water  hours a day    yippee The food for dinner was delicious  Breakfast was simple however tasty The staff managed by the charismatic Madan were very friendly and always asked that I was happy Overall I had a very positive experience and never felt unsafe as a female solo traveller  
P => Very clean hotel with helpfull staff We have started and ended our India trip in this hotel  In total we spent  nights there and we can only recommend the place  Rooms we had booked standard room are very clean comfortable and with reazonable size  Staff is very helpfull  The manager makes everything possible to satisfy his guests  Pick up amp drop off service fromto the airport is also reliable  We have also booked a taxi driver for a day through the hotel  Make sure that you preset your route with him before setting off  Otherwise you will be brought to several kets  After we complained about it the manager made sure we get a different driver for the next day and we had no more problems  For our next stay in New Delhi we will definetely stay there again  
P => A gem of a hotel During my recent stay   Grand Park Hotel Inn I was more than impressed with the high level of service experienced Nothing appeared to be too much trouble and all requests were carried out efficiently and most importantly with a smile The rooms were very comfortable clean spacious and well appointed  The location was perfect with easy access to kets bazaars and sightseeing areas Transport was pre arranged with the hotel The driver was always punctual courteous and very patient His driving skills were exceptional along with his intimate knowledge of the city  I would have no hesitation in recommending anyone who wants to experience the real Delhi its wonderful people and high level of friendly service to stay in this gem of a hotel 
P => Id definitely book this hotel if youre on a budget and are looking for a good base to explore Delhi  The facilities are great as it is very near to Karol Bagh ket and an auto rickshaw ride away from Connought place  The hotel located in the heart of city near biggest main shopping centre  Comfortable well equipped big and clean rooms  The staff are great and very efficient both in the hotel and restaurant  Perfect and helpful hotel employees and services  
P => Affordabe and Pin Neat I have stayed at the Grand Park Inn for the past  years and have been impressed by the clean and neat and comfortable rooms as well as the efficient staff and the GM  Mr Madan Pai who has his finger on the pulse I can recommend this Hotel to international tourists without hesitation Well done and keep it up 
P => Nice Hotel Neat and Clean hotel  Worth for the price  I recommend this hotel  The lunch and the complementary break fast were very tasty  It had most of the things that you look in a hotel  
P => the best place to stay good value for money excellent service  i had stayed in many hotels in delhi but grand park is extremely nice and comfortable hotel staff is great very freindly abd specially owners are there themselves to check all our requirements very clean place to live in     harry 
P => very good hotel staff friendly near city center  breakfast ok good value for money  
P => A wondrfull and stresfree time  We stayed at the Grand Park Inn for the first time last year and we could not fault it so when we went to Delhi again this year we had no hesitation as to witch hotel to ring  Nothing is to much trouble fo the staff or managment  We left the organising of the sightseeing and shopping trips to the managment and we wernt disapointed  The staff are all excelent they were the same boys as last year and they all rememberd us  The servis and clenliness is second to none and the organisation was excelent  Although the hotel is only part of any holiday with the Grand Park Inn the hotel is one part of the holiday we know we dont have to worry about  We intend going to Delhi again next year and because of the way we are treated by everyone concerned we will be staying at the Grand Park Inn yet again  
P => Excellent Service Excellent hotel service  Staff was very accommodating and very helpful  Safe for American travelers 
P => Good experience It was average hotel but I am still satisfied with my stay  The only thing I did not like much was its location which is a very busy and congested lane  
P => Excellent Value Excellent customer service  Very clean and centrally located  Complimentary HOT breakfast with choice of continental or Indian menu  Friendly staff  Provision for left baggage for returning guests away on short excursions  Complimentary toiletries  Email response within one day  
P => Bellow average Hotel     Location is not so good and price is too much  Unnecessary huge rooms but not at all professional behaviour      and staff are terriblly poor knowledged Stay here if you do not have a better option          
P => A modest hotel value for money ent Hotel good for an overnight stay  One could be put off by the location but the food should compensate for it  The complimentary breakfast is a simple parantha type of thing but tasty nevertheless  If you are looking for a ent stay without the frills of a good hotel this is not a bad place at all  
P => simple economy service stayed there for  nights with  female members of my family  This is an economy hotel we paid  rp per night for a triple room  The location of the hotel was not ideal for lone female travellers   the area is made up of car repair companies   therefore there are very few females to be seen within the area  The area is very noisy    The hotel manager was grumpy the first few days but cheered up on the third day  A few recommendations for the rooms teacoffee making facilities a spy hole on the doors there is no iron available in the hotel  We booked a carguide via the hotel   the driver insisted on taking us to specific shops on route   im sure he was on commission as these shops were definately in the business of ripping off tourists  He even insisted on taking us to a restaurant despite our repeated requests to go to another restaurant  The location is ok if on a shopping trip to karol bagh  The hotel restaurant was more like a small dining room   not comfortable especially during busy periods  Breakfast selection was limited  
P => Object lesson in customer care I cannot speak too highly of the manager and staff at the Grand Park Inn who were unfailingly polite helpful and friendly  I must single out the manager Madan Pai who put together a  week tour of Rajasthan Agra and Varanasi for us gently adjusting our planned route and expectations  The driver Malkit Singh was also very attentive to our needs and safety and was always there on time to pick us up at the airport we used the hotel on  arate occasions  However most of all I would praise them for the way they looked after us especially my partner in the wake of the heart attack I suffered one night ensuring that everything was comfortable for her at the hotel and providing personal accompaniment on her visits to the hospital with no charge  Similarly the necessary travel rearrangements after this were made gratis and with great concern for my health The hotel is quiet though situated in a non tourist ket area and provides good food at very reasonable prices in the spotless rooms  The staff will cater for your every whim  This is not a modern soulless hotel but has a quaint charm  
P => An oasis of calm in frantic city Stayed at the Hotel Grand Park Inn in uary this year  The staff and the ownermanager were lovely   especially the manager who allowed us to use his computer for free to do an on line check in at the airport He arranged for us to be taken to restaurants and collected later but did not charge   we just tipped the driver The rooms were very clean breakfast adequate although the toast comes already buttered and wrapped in foil which makes it extremely soggy I requested mine to be left unwrapped which was much better The Hotel is in a strange part of Delhi   lots of motor shops motor bikes etc not forgetting our omnipresent bovine friends Tuk tuks into the centre of Delhi or to the extremely spotlessly clean metro were inexpensive  The kets are wonderful people very kind and friendly everywhere it seemed and at no time did we feel threatened when in Delhi Once you get over the initial culture shock India is a lovely place to visit and this hotel is great as an escape from the frantic hussle and bussle of the city   extremely cheap too     for four nights BampB for two of us including transport to the airport about minutes drive away 
P => great place to stay The Grand Park Inn is a good clean hotel with great staff you can ask the manager to arrange a tour for you he does this with clean comfortable hotels with your own driver at a very reasonable price The hotel is quite near the centre of Delhi in a safe area you can ask the hotel to arrange a pick up and drop off for you at the airport The hotel is very good value for money I can recommend this hotel 
P => Not a Great Experience I honestly view myself as a low maintenance visitor and Im amenable to most circumstances  The Grand Park Inn is a very reasonably priced hotel in Delhi and generally clean with good morning breakfast  But its location   Karol Bagh the automotorcycle district on Delhi is a less than nice location despite its proximity to the subway  And the management is awful  My key complaints a no driver from the airport although scheduled plane was  hour delayed so driver left b after day  of  they move me to a sister hotel despite my request to stay c they give me a room in the new hotel that has no out facing window and is immediately adjacent to the kitchen which is active and  really  loud for all hours except   am so those are the hours I slept and d they tell me in the morning I dont have a complementary breakfast although I did at the first place requiring me to speak to the manager who has me get the phone number for the manager at the other hotel he actualy told me to go over there to talk to the manager at the other hotel rather than worry about it himself  Theres more  And all this might seem a bit petty but the frequent level of dishonest and disrespectful treatment really added up  I was very unhappy with the ongoing lies from the management  Overall Id rather have paid more for better treatment elsewhere  
P => Pluses and negatives The room rate is cheap by Delhi standards and the hotel is clean  Hot water can be problematic  On our first night we were shifted to a nearby hotel Blue Bell because the Grand Park Inn was full  The elevator at the Blue Bell got stuck between two floors after a power outage and we were in there for  mins with lots of people shouting outside and making my mother quite nervous  If you get shifted to other hotels please do not use the elevators for your safety The area around the Grand Park Inn is not good  We got conned by a nearby optician store Punjab Opticians that the Grand Park Inn owner Mr  Madan Pai recommended and the whole area seems unsafe for women at night for sure  A taxi driver nearby also tried to con us  Someone later told us that this area is shady I also recommend NOT purchasing the tour to Agra and Haridwar that Mr  Pai offers  Besides the high price in comparison to hiring private taxis our driver arranged for us by Mr  Pai forcibly took us to a restaurant called the Maharajah Palace where he gets commission and other perks  We told him not to take us there on the way back from Agra but he still went there and drove on the wrong side of the road in order to get there other motorists were all staring at us incredulously which rarely happens in India where the driving is crazy as it is Food at the Maharajah palace costs five times what is typical in Delhi  The driver also took us to a place called Little Taj in Agra which is entirely useless so that he could get a commission on our purchases  On top of all this the driver asked us if we wanted to hire a pandit priest from him for our trip to Haridwar on the next day The guide at the Taj who was also arranged by Mr  Pai kept pressuring us to have a professional take our photos Also on the following days tour to Haridwar that we purchased from Mr  Pai if you can not tolerate cold do not stay at the Khanna Palace also owned by Mr  Pai  They have nonexistent or terrible heating and do not provide a personal room heater if needed  We ordered an extra bedsheet and got a wet one Overall the cleanliness and the relatively low cost of the hotel is a plus that is negated by all the negatives I listed above  
P => Great stay in Grand Park Inn We just returned from our first trip as a family parents  boys to India  It is not easy or cheap to book a two rooms in at least reliable hotels  To book the hotels I relied heavily on the reviews of other travellers and found them all very helpful  The Grand Park Inn was our in our first destination New Delhi and also our fourth stop en route to Kolkata  It was a very pleasant and reliable experience  The hotel is really central located just go out and take a taxi it only takes you about  minutes to Connht Place  What Iliked most is that you actually feel you are in India when you walk outside the atmosphere is still a bit laid back with even the occassional cow walking by  It is central to most kets and there are very nice and clean restaurants nearby  The rooms were sparkling clean and service is immaculate including some personal tourplanning  We will definitely stay there again  
P => Hotel ist nur etwas f r Packpacker oder Hartgesottene  
P => Lo de Grand le pega mejor por el excelente servicio que por el tama o   
P => bad service hotel My stay in this hotel is not good because hotel is not clean and bad service   Very dirty smell in the hotel because outside of the hotel is a big dustbin where all the hotel waste integrated but no manage it   Rates of the hotel is very high compare to quality and service  
P => Excellent Stay This was second stay at Grand Peepal  I visited Delhi in  also and the service was excellent then too  The front desk staff was very attentive to my needs and safety especially as a single woman traveling alone  I found the staff to be courteous and helpful  The Hotel is in a very convenient location near a great ket  It s just off the main street so it is quite  The rooms are clean and the air condition worked well  The bathrooms are modern and clean  The refrigerator in the room was a pleasant convenience to have food and water in my room  The roof top restaurant was very good  WIFI both in my room and in the lobby worked well  For the price this is a great value  Especially for first time visitors to India  I am returning in  and will be staying at Grand Peepal again for a rd visit  
P => nd Name of Home is Grand Peepal I booked this Hotel Through a Travel Agent Incredible Heritage Tours my stay here was for great  the staff was helpfull and the reception always warm welcomingI was here on bussiness but also Travelled abit I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ALL TRAVELLER AND ALSO THE BUSSINESS PEOPLE  
P => Hotel correcto  
P => 
P => Nice Location The only thing good about this hotel is location  It located in Connht place which is the heart of Delhi  The rooms are very big amp spacious but not well maintained  The room service is okay amp food definitely not very palatable  Only thing is that you can just walk around amp have good joints within  min walking distance  
P => Average Stay Hotel path location is good and close to connht Place Service is slow  Front desk response is average 
P => Good Restaurant with live Ghajals program The hotel is okay but we liked the restaurant more because of its good food and live ghajals program  its good to be there with family and friends and enjoy the party  
P => loved the way they treat guests i loved the way of their welcome to the guest      the facilities were good         there is slight problem of room adjustment but it cant be mind       overall its a good experience 
P => Grim Stalinist and depressing I booked into the path for a couple of weeks because I was going to be in Delhi for work  Big mistake  I had wanted a ent serviceable comfortable hotel with good business facilities and an OK restaurant  Unfortunately the path was really none of these things  I knew I wasnt going anywhere as posh as the Imperial or the Oberoi but I could have paid far less than I did at the path for the facilities I got  It had nothing no email access a grotty bar a restaurant I didnt really try the in room breakfast was bad enough a terrible dysfunctional TV with about  channels and poor reception the worlds loudest air conditioning sleeping at night was a problem windows that didnt shut properly and faulty electrics that constantly threw out sparks  In its defence I would say that my room was quite large and quite clean  It was not comfortable but it would have been acceptable at a   price  Unfortunately it came at a   price  I would also say that the staff were very pleasant to me  The laundry service was efficient and well done too  And the location is obviously very good  I became almost affectionate towards the place by the end of my stay but it was a bit galling being next door to the Imperial I would certainly not consider the path if you are visiting Delhi If you want a cheap basic hotel there are plenty cheaper than this one of the same standard  If you want a comfortable but good value hotel like a   should be there are dozens of better options   The Claridges for instance or any of the international chains Despite a few redeeming features you really will be better off elsewhere  
P => What a rip off The path would be lucky to receive two stars in any other country  The location is good but the prices are ridiculous and the rooms are very basic  I had no hot water for the three days   the airconditoner sounded like a truck engine   and they had the nerve to charge me a quotluxury taxquot on checkout Three nights cost me nearly six hundred Australian dollars  Do not stay at this hotel 
P => very clean rathole the hotel path located on path road just south of connht circle between the Imperial and the Shangriila is a government run hotel part of the ashok group  the location is fantastic  The rooms were surprisingly clean including the sheets however be mindful that this hotel is pretty much a rathole and would be a two star hotel in the US  that being said I had hot water and a very large roomand TV with many English channels probably cable or a satellite system  the bathroom was clean the towels were grungy   best to bring your own and the room didnt smell bad  The price was about  with taxes which seems to be about average for this class of hotel  Sure the hotel was run down and dingy  The paint on the walls was peeling and the furniture was very basic  However it was a large hotel many storeys with shops and two restaurants  I ordered room service and the food came quickly it was good and I didnt get sick  I wish the room had cost  and not  and then it would be good value  However the location was great it was clean  and I got a good nights sleep there

P => Dont stay here OK it looked nicer on the pics Ive seen on the hotel website  And yes I admit that this hotel is the best locationwise as its in the center of Connht place  However when I first stepped in the hotel the smell instantly made me sick  When I got there my room was not ready but they let me have a look at the room anyway  Whoever stayed before me that person is absolutely disgusting  Cigarette butts were all over the floor and the bed sheets were stained    and the bathroom OMG I dont even want to talk about it  refer to the pics I posted They made me wait outside until they finish cleaning and guess what It took less than  minutes to clean that messy room  They didnt change the sheets   ahhh   Be aware of the travel agency theyd introduce to you  They charged me Rs  for the bus trip to Agra but it turns out everyone else on the bus paid Rs  or less  They said it would be a new large and air conditioned bus and most tourinsts would be from European countries  Oh well   I was the only non Indian on the bus and it surely sucked  Do not stay at this hotel  You dont want to waste  night for this crap  I stayed at the Intercontinental Grand before this hotel  You can get good deals from Asianrooms com  so try  This hotel is not the best Intercontinental   but since its really hard to find ent hotels in Delhi i think this hotel is really nice  
P => ent hotel in connht place a few points this is NOT Jukaso Inn it is Hotel Jukaso Inn   these are  different hotels   yes it is confusing i gave this hotel  quotabove averagequot as for delhi it is above average  i would probably give it   if i couldok basically delhi is really hard to get a ent hotel that isnt ridiculously expensive  well this is an exception  it is a ent hotel in a very handy place connht place  it isnt beautiful but it is ent and clean with a good size room bed tv and showerbathroom  the AC was so so as you couldnt choose a personal setting it was basically a grill in the wall with cool air coming in  but the room was nice and cool so i didnt mind  there was a fan that could be controlled too the breakfast was pretty good i thought though my girlfriend didnt like her eggs no problem i ate hers too  it had  computer for internet use and at Rs why  per hour wasnt very cheap  other than that this hotel was grand  they were helpful with storing our bags all day as we had a late flight  and they helped organise a taxi for us so in short booking hotels in delhi is a nighte cos all the reviews seem to be so bad or else they are ridiculously expensive  well if i was ever staying in delhi again id stay here and i would recommend it to a friend

P => ok clean and friendly staff Although the sorrounding is a bit low standard and the hotel from outside could be more friendly we found the rooms very clean and comfortabel  The staff was friendly  We had problems to find the place as the location on google maps was wrong but that should be corrected in the meantime  Reception guys were very helpful  Room  is sometimes very loud as the Kitchen of the rooftop restaurant is right above it otherwise the area was quiet during nighttime All in all pretty good hotel for that price  
P => A very good hotel in Paharganj We stayed here for  nights at the beginning of our trip around India  The area of Paharganj is not the most touristy of areas and a pretty rundown however it gives you quite a good india experience as this is what a lot of India is like  People remain kind and if you can put up with the staring of the locals then its cheap and close to the train station The hotel is down a bustlig side street  It is clean and the rooms are well apointed nice double bed TV and clean bathroom  AC and room fan available  Good selection of room service and upstairs restaurant is clean and has lovely views over the busy area  I did not find any cockroaches   always reassuringThe staff are extremely freindly  Happy to help sort things out and are always on hand for assistance  I cant speak Hindi and so there were some communication difficulties but nothing big  The brother of the owner offered some tourist travelling deals but we had already organised ours prior to coming  He was not pushy and offerred help if anything else we needed One downside is that they do provide a pick up service even though extremely useful is more expensive than the taxis you can pick up at the airport  The other being if you want to get a rickshaw from the train station to here and you are not Indianlook touristy in what should cost   rupees they will try and charge   rupees  We ended up getting quite angry with them and walking at pmonly a  minute walk though but not the safest area to walk in when dark   a risky ventureIn sumy   if you are up for the challenge of staying in Paharganj cheap accomodation authentic Indian experience and proximity to train station then I would recommend this hotel to you  Clean and friendly 
P => Finding an Oasis in Delhi I stayed at Lals Haveli for one week in tember  at the end of a  month trip around the world  I booked through hostelworld com  When I first saw the outside I wondered if I had been droped off at the correct hotel but when I went inside I was met by very friendly and welcoming staff  The room was not the biggest I had stayed in but was clean nicely orated and had everything I was promised  They provided room service which was very nice  The food was traditional Indian food not westernised but excelent quality  The hotel is located just off a main road down a bussling side street about M from New Delhi Railway station and about  Mile from Connht Place and the nearest subway sation  The room I stayed in was very quiet and the other guests were respectfull and quiet at night  
P => feeling of home from home I stayed at Lals Haveli at the start and end of my recent trip to India  I was given a warm welcome and a clean room  Throughout my stay nothing was too much trouble for the management and staff  The rooftop restaurant provides great food at cheap prices  Dont be put off by the area  give this place a chance and I am sure you will find the same wonderful hospitality  I booked a trip through the connected travel agency and again found value for money safety as a woman alone and I had a great holiday Jean Hadfield 
P => Good value for money but you can find better Good location  right near pahar ganj so very busy and dirty area  Fab sweet shop just outside  Place is very clean and safe but desperately needs a refurb  There is lots of choice in the area and you can def get better for your money if you shop about  No internet or wi fi in the hotel   it is around the corner  Room has all amenities you need  The staff are lovely and helpful  Would recommend but dont expect luxury when you pay peanuts  
P => Best value for money hotel in New Delhi Rooms are much better than what the reception promise  Spacy and cozy with clean bathrooms  The staff are polite and willing to serve  As the area has many hotels it will be difficult to find a better value Makis 
P => Great Place To Stay Great hospitality with good priced rooms  Very simple design which is comfortable and spacious  Bathrooms are spacious and very clean which is usually a hard thing to find in Delhi particularly for a hotel at this price The area is great to wander around and so close to Connht Place and I recieved an airport pick up with a nice driver who spoke good English  Staff are courteous and friendly and the food on the roof top terrace is amazing Make sure you get some photos of the Delhi skyline particularly at sunset 
P => Poor Query Resolution at Reception I gave a call to the hotel I was given two rates for Deluxe amp Semi Deluxe rooms and when I asked what is the difference between them the receptionist was very curt and said you can come and see the difference  When I said I have to book the room and I am outside Delhi how can I come and see it he said how can I tell you what is the difference  They badly need to train their staff for a ent behaviorhelloneoo yahoo com 
P => excellent hotel amazing locationnice and clean new roomsvery good value for moneycourteous staffwould give it  outta  
P => hospitality and cleanliness This hotel was much more than I expected for the price I arranged a late night pickup and they were there and waiting  The staff was plentiful and courteous  The room was large and very clean  My only problem is that Delhi is cold at this time but when I requested a second blanket it came think and fast  The room service was reasonable and fast  The location was very good to check out the center of Delhi  I was a first time visitor to India traveling as a woman alone and this Hotel made me feel very comfortable  
P => Somewhat dirty room spotless bathroom good staff I spent a few days in and around the Paharganj area in New Delhi where this hotel is located  Its unfortunately not on the main bazaar itself but rather north a few blocks it was about  mins walk from the New Delhi train station so its a bit difficult getting back there especially since most rickshaw drivers hadnt heard of it or know where it was  All in all the hotel wasnt so bad it was in a lot of ways a welcome respite from the hell that is Paharganj to any traveller going to India for the first time I highly HIGHLY advise against staying in the Paharganj area during your first stay it is quite frankly chaotic hell stay somewhere like connht place which is more relaxed there are tons of rickshaws available anywhere in the city anytime of day that will get you to the old city and main bazaar for around  Rupees      The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful they even let me keep my luggage there free for a week as I left and travelled west into Rajhastan  One thing youll soon learn about India is that the hotel staff tend to sleep in the hotel itself on the floors in the lobby so if you have a  am train departure like I did dont feel bad to wake them up the staff here were friendly even then  The room itself was fairly well furnished  I paid about  rupees a night   for a single room it had a TV and bathroom with western toilets and a shower that gave warm but not hot water which is still a plus in India considering  hotels I stayed at had only cold water  The bathroom itself was truly spotless which was the biggest saving grace of this hotel otherwise I would give it a   The room itself was clean but the sheets and pillow covers werent quite washed and frankly I killed  cockroaches while I was there which should put things into perspective  The room was also a bit musty and lacked a proper window There were two other great things about this hotel  First there was an internet cafe right behind it for  rupeeshour  Second almost right across from it was an awesome sweets shop called Bikaner Sweets very very clean and western in setup and upstairs of the sweet shop was a great vegetarian family restaurant also very clean and cheap highly recommended All in all the good sides of this hotel are balanced with its bad sides  The location isnt so great and the room is somewhat dirty but the staff are friendly the bathroom was clean and the internet cafe and nearby restaurant were the bomb  If it wasnt for the cockroaches and dirty bedsheets Id give it a

P => Good value for money good location I stayed here on three occasions during the summer with my girlfriend and members of my extended family who were in India for a wedding  Its in a great central location right next to New Delhi train station which is helpful for internal travel  The Metro also stops here so its good for getting around the city  Some of my lesser travelled family members found the area a bit rough and ready but we found it safe enough once you take the usual precautions  Its only a  minute stroll to the Main Bazaar in Pahar Ganj and about a   minute walk to Connht Place  The communication from management before our arrival was good and they were helpful overall  Rooms are clean with big comfortable beds  Some rooms have fridges and others dont  They are not very roomy as other reviews here have mentioned but as we spent the majority of our time out and about exploring Delhi we found them perfectly adequate  The AC worked well in any room we stayed in  Staff are very too attentive at times and are plentiful  One thing that we would have liked was a restaurant or lounge of some sort as we had to eat in our room all the time if we stayed in the hotel  They were talking of opening a roof top restaurant when we were leaving which would be a good addition  There wasnt too much noise from outside but this depends on where your room is located also  There were staff telephones which were located on the half landing ringing from early morning which was a bit irritating but the volume can be turned down  This is worst when you stay in any of the rooms ending in        I brought it up with the management and they said they would try to rectify matters so hopefully it might be sorted for future guests The only real negative aspect of our stay was the behaviour of the Travel Agent in the lobby  He was very pushy unpleasant to deal with and over charged members of our group a significant amount on a few occasions  The service he provided was also sub standard when we travelled in a car organised by him to Jaipur  We left an hour late were charged more than others in the same car were dumped out a few miles from the city centre in Jaipur and had to pay to get another TukTuk into town  There is no shortage of travel guys in Delhi so shop around Apart from this we found out stay at the hotel to be positive overall  Very good value for money clean central and comfortable  
P => funky design in an amazing neighbourhood eat on the roof Our first night in India arriving at am after a bus crew couldnt locate hotel  TIP Print off own map of your hotels Friendly staff especially on the rooftop resturant very pleasant rooms and great location and value  Its not luxury but clean and some of our group found the area a bit intimidating  It is a vibrant hectic place with a tourist road right amoungst the locals  Everybody we met smiled and wanted to talk with transport around very easy  We had great meals up on the roof with the staff so accomodating and enjoyable  A briiliant start to our visit to India  
P => great service strange location    If you are willing to be a taxi ride away from the action this hotel was really quite good They had a large service staff who were welcoming and smiling at every opportunity be this was because we were a large group or that we were nice and appreciative towards everything they did for us  I had a single room on the ground floor right next to the computers and travel desk  The room was quite large and even had a double sized bed  The bathroom was great too but as with everywhere in India so far teh bathrooms tend to get hot during the day so remember to close it as you leave There are two computers available for free internet access one wasnt working when I was there and they actually let me use theirs in their little office Theresa lift which is always a bonus and a rooftop restaurant  The food was wonderful for any meal of the day and none of the  of us got sick One night we had bought too many beers and shared some with some of the service guys  they thought we were fantastic If I could give any negatives they would be that you arent really close too much and that it was really tricky to find initially  It was also pretty noisy with street noises but earplugs are a fantastic invention 
P => Good value for money    and good location Stayed there for two nights    Excellent location  close to New Delhi Train Station  NOT NIZMUDDIN AS I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT and Connht Place The hotel lobby was inviting and clean and the room we had was clean although small   Made smaller by furniture that was too large for the room The bathroom was large and clean  bring your own shampoo  Towels were small but I asked for some bigger ones the sheets on the bed were stained so I asked forand recieved clean sheets  Breakfast is included but is NOT buffet style  you order it from the menu and eat in your room That struck me as kind of weird  but was fine  Be careful though the servers simply knocked THEN WALKED IN   to prevent this always lock your door  The room was cheap    per night  and overall a really good budget hotel  DOWNSIDES  there were always many loiterers in the lobby and on the stairs    I didnt understand that  Also there were loiterers in hte hallsoutside our room   ready for our beck and call  Tipping is appreciated  and can go a long way to better serviceOverall   a  for a budget hotel 
P => In such a busy city this hotel was just what we needed Although the rooms were quite small they are no smaller than those in hotels in other cities elsewherein the world Delhi is such a crazy place that after a busy day walking the room was much appreciated  The rooms were very clean  The staff were very helpful  I would recommend this hotel  
P => Good i stayed in the property for  days and the stay and service was good 
P => Good location but not value for money For us the location was great as it was a five minute walk to the new dehli train station but the hotel room was dark air con didnt work and constant noise throughout the day and night     and no hot water Very hard sale by the in hous travel agent was annoying and worth avoiding at all costs For what we paid it really wasnt value for money  
P => Good Value near New Delhi train station This hotel was comfortable and very easy on my budget  It is located a short walk from the New Delhi train station and Metro stop  The street it is located on is somewhat lively so you  hear some noise but I was not disturbed by it  The online booking process was easy and accurate  I opted for the airport pickup through the hotel the driver was on time and friendly  
P => Probably not the Best Hotel in the Area  Probably  Theres nothing really wrong with this place   the staff are ok the room was acceptable and the bathroom although prone to get absolutely soaked when using the shower remove all clothing and toilet roll before using is fine  That said we struggled with the hot water and the place is very very noisy at night  We did arrange for the hotel to pick us up from the airport which they confirmed twice but then didnt do as they wrote down the wrong date  This was a good thing though   we got a prepaid taxi for R while the hotel was charging R  They made up for it by giving us free toilet paper when we left though be aware if you buy bottled water from them they seem to make up the price each time   it can cost anything from R to R  Its a great location for a number of things   New Delhi train station is  mins walk away and they have an excellent facility for travellers to book train tickets   go to the st floor and follow the signs and do not listen to ANYONE who tells you otherwise  Youre also mins by rickshaw from Connht Place and not much further from chaotic Old Delhi  When you arrive a walk down the nearby Old Bazarr should get you into the spirit of things The hotel gives home to a rather sleazy looking fellow who will almost as soon as you get in try to sell you all sorts of tours viewing experiences train tickets and assorted malarky  Its rather frustrating when you want to just check in and take a shower even more frustrating when he badgers you every morning noon and night   I believe he actually lives on the sofa by his desk  Take him with a pinch of salt lh at his outrageously inflated  fluctuating prices and then ignore him   hes harmless  
P => Good News  Bad News We chose Hotel legend among other similar quotbudgetquot properties in the neighborhood partly based on the comments by the manager here in these reviews  The rooms were pretty much as expected although ours had no windows and service was acceptable  We had some items stolen from our luggage there which included a small amount of cash I miss the money clip more than the dollars  Part of the problem is that everyone in the lobby knows your plans  The travel agent is a loud mouth and all employees knew our travel plans for the day which gave almost everyone within earshot the opportunity to know when we were away  There seems to be a number of employees lingering about with nothing to do and we got a feeling of unease about them watching us  Since we cant prove anything we can only say use an extra amount of caution at The Legend The complimentary breakfast was as expected and sufficient  However unless you eat in your room the other option is on the rooftop which has the atmosphere of an industrial air conditioner  The tables are located under a green piece of plexiglass which gives your eggs and toast a nice greenish tint  The internet only worked half of the time  
P => Nothing special but it does the job This hotel could be freshened up a bit as the pictures look much nicer than what you actually get it is really noisy both the city and the staff are extremely noisy and it feels a bit overpriced  Besides this and considering itd Delhi the rooms are big and relatively clean  Its also  minutes away from the train station so the location is great especially if youre getting an early flight  
P => Good location if you want to see Phaharganj The Paharganj ket district is one of Indias must see attractions that was my main reason for staying here  However the Hotel is satisfactory in every way clean rooms and good service  A good budget hotel  
P => Great clean hotel good value for money We always make it a point to head straight for this hotel whenever we are in New Delhi  Its so close to the charming shops of Paharganj all the services are nearby the rail station is so close and Connht Place is just a short rickshaw ride away  When we first stayed here in  the security guard used to come and take our toddler from the vehicle to the door I love the left luggage facility it means that we can use New Delhi as a base and not haul our  suitcases all over India It can be a bit noisy with all the room service buzzers going off but its clean inexpensive and the service is great  Wed recommend this hotel to anyone 
P => good value for money Stayed at the hotel in the first week of ch with my wife and  yr old dhter  Good clean rooms with ent food average hospitality  Happy with their luggage storage facility when we twice left the hotel for different tours  Did not use the tour operator in the hotel lobby for the st tour based on previous reviews on this website  The tour operator was distrht and immediately gave me a very good rate for the nd tour as well as the return trip to the airport better than the tour operator across the road  
P => Good hotel in great location A good clean and safe hotel in a fantastic part of Delhi  Very close to the railway station and only a  minute auto ride from Connht Place  The staff were helpful although sometimes pestered a little and although there is no restaurant as such the food is very good   we used the roof terrace several times to eat  The rooms are clean and spacious with comfortable beds tv and some have a fridge Look out for a wonderful staff member called Ramu   a very lovely and helpful chap   tip him well I would certainly stay here again and would definitely recommend it to anyone  
P => Safe clean comfortable hotel in Paharganj  As other reviewers I liked Legend and stayed a total of  nights  I would also recommend it to others  Compared to others in this price range   Rs the rooms are well furnished very good mattresses clean and safe sturdy doors with good locks Room service is efficient free internet in lobby staff are friendly and the food is good and tasty rooftop seating available As per other reviewers I would warn against using the travel agent who is seated in the lobby  hours His services are all overpriced and he hassled me continuously whenever I was in the lobby area  You need to fight him off To book train tickets there is a good place across the road which only charges  Rs commission Overall this place really feels like home from home and is warmly recommended  
P => Good value for the price My first night I stayed at Ata hotel and was quite dissatisfied because for  rs you can find better place in that area  The international legend is a good choice because  I paid about  rs for room with TV and  for room with LCD TV    Internet is free   The hotel was almost empty when others were full   The cleaning is very good  After cleaning the room smells good   I liked the doors  The rest of the hotels in that area have doors that looked really bad Minuses  Tiped waiter  rs and then every morning he knocked the door at am trying to clean something or do something for me  Really annoying  Especially if you usually get up at    i do not know why people say that location is good  it is true that hotel is very close to railway station but the area looks like Berlin after WWII  Many people very dirty streets   Do not buy tours from travel agency in the hotel  They are really overpriced and guy who sells these tour is not nice at all  Hot water is woring only in the morning time  At the evening you have to bakshesh waiters to turn on boiler Anyway place is good value choice  
P => good location average value booked the hotel through email  rate of rs incl tax and breakfast for a super deluxe  the room itself dont quite feel like super deluxe  the window was tiny and gave no view at all  i specifically asked what difference there existed between a deluxe and a super deluxe and the hotel replied that the super deluxe provided a fridge a TV and more space  well    to the contrary as advertised the fridge seemed non functioning for quite some time  it wasnt switched on at all  and the room didnt feel very spacious  the TV was the only thing that worked as promised and was a inch sony LCD on the plus side the room was rather clean with the exception that there were a couple of cockroaches that got killed as soon as sighted and bed was comfy  breakfast was cooked to standard  but to have hot shower h as advertised i actually needed to phone frontdesk so that some ppl got the heater switched on centrally controlled  when i first called at pm after whole day of sightseeing the frontdesk person told me to have hot shower next morning only when i clearly told them that was unacceptable did they switch it on  and a further mins wait before hot water was available the location itself is quite good  being  min walk from new delhi train station in PG  and internet that worked was provided free   which is always a plus esp when it was at a time around the mumbai terror attack never get talked into deal by the hotel travel agency ppl   they overcharge  for a taxi trip to qutb minar and then to airport the man quoted us rs and refused to negotiate  we went out and greeted by a driver and got it rs without much negotiation  the frontdesk ppl were ent in providing price index though and didnt try talk you into some deal of theirs a BampB south of CP  offer better hospitality and personality  but they typically charged in the range of rs upwards  so given this comparison i give this hotel a  star rating mainly for its location and average priceperformance ratio  
P => Perfect Stay We stayed at this hotel from rd ober for  nights and I have to say it was an oasis of calm in mad DelhiWe originally were to stay in the Rama Deluxe but one look at the bathroom and I demanded to move to the Legend after reading about it on Trip Advisor The hotel is very clean the staff are very polite and nothing is too much trouble  the main point is that it is quiet despite being in the middle of Delhi The bedsheets were a little worn but this was not really a major problem we also had to wait for  minutes for the water to heat up in the shower but this is a problem all over India We also tried the breakfast and was very pleased with that too If you are looking for a reasonably priced clean hotel for a few nights in Delhi then this is the perfect place  Frankly this hotel deserves a better ranking on Tripadvisor that  it should be in the top  Well done Hotel Legend International  
P => Wonderful I and my wife stayed at Hotel Legend New Delhi for  nights in tember The room given to us was on rd floor  It was a nice big room with good furniture  The room was clean and comfy The Interiors of the hotel is real goodspecially their st floor lobby and service is also good I would highly recommend this hotel for all Only  problem they have internet in the lobby no Wifi net  
P => Good hotel Clean and resonable price  Ive been to Delhi many times for bussiness  The hotel price in Delhi is very expensive according to their level  I found this hotel by tripadvisor and tried its a surprise to have such a good hotel at this price  Its clean with big room  The service is very good  The only problem is Wifi there is no wifi I have to go to the lobby to use Internet Linong Guo from China 
P => Muss nicht sein

P => Comfortable Hotel in New Delhi This is my first time to New Delhi  Before coming to Delhi I was looking several  stars hotel through internet and got some places that can give enjoy time during stay in Delhi  Gotcha   I ided one hotel named Le Roi Hotel and check in the hotel that very clean and nice service from the front office until the room boy  Although it located in the crowded area but it very closed to the Metro station that can connected to Rajiv Chock  the central of India in the next station  A lot of restaurant and money changer surrounding the hotel but if you wanna eat in the restaurant of hotel   its also really delicious food that made by the cooker in the hotel and the price was reasonable price  The other one that make me feel at home when the GM and GRO explained me about Delhi    they are very warm and give me opportunity to kept my bagage and browsing free internet until midnight before check out at midnight  Thank you Le Roi Hotel if someday I am coming to Delhi   absolutely I would like to stay there  
P => Very nice hotel kind stuff We visited hotel Le Roi with friends in ember  we felt very nice and comfortable stuff were very kind and helpful we enjoyed our staying very much  I can recommend this hotel to every one who stays in Delhi  
P => Great stay We stayed in Le Roi late ober  and had a fantastic stay  It is a new hotel  It is very clean and spacious the room does have little greatness the air con was very quiet and all in all it is a very good apartment   As far as the room is concerned it is luxurious room if you want a clean place to store your clothes rest your head and get ready for a working day or night out then it does the job more than adequately   What gives the hotel such great review is the service you receive  I can quite honestly say I have never received such excellent service before  The staff was all extremely friendly and couldnt do enough for us  When we felt a bit poorly one evening they suggested we have some feni the local spirit to settle our stomachs  I must admit I was apprehensive and as strong as it was it did the trick All the staff say hello everyone makes you feel welcome and everyone always has a smile on their face  I definitely know people will go back there year after year for sure we will We went for a relaxing  days break and we certainly got it mostly thanks to the fantastic service we received in Le Roi  
P => Nice and Comfortable Accomodation I was on a Business Trip earlier this month and got a chance to Stay in Hotel Le Roi I was very glad with the level of service and Facillities this hotel provides Besides A one Services this hostel is located in very comfortable locationI would ensure that for my next visit which is Due in uaryI will like to again put up in this Hotel Thanks Guys for Excellent Service 
P => Vibrancy  Luxury Unlimited Enjoyment   Hotel Le Roi This Hotel is situated in a very comfortable locationIt is Less than  minutes walking Distance from New Delhi Railway Station Hotel Rooms Speaks of Quality and Elegance Thus Redefining Luxury and that too at Surprisingly Affordable Price Le Roi provides the feel of a private Residence yet provides the service and Facillity of Modern Hospital In Short Hotel Le Roi is dedicated to delighting the senses of every Guest Promising extravagancy every Day 
P => Very good perfect location friendly staff Le Roi is a brandnew hotel t  in the middle of the crowded noisy touristic Paharganj area  It is an oasis The best hotel in this area  It is quiet modern has the best soft beds we have had in India and a perfect warm shower  The rooms are very very good  And it is not too expensive good value for money Since it is a new hotel not everything is perfect yet  The swimmingpool is not ready yet parts of the hotel are stil under constuction and the staff is sometimes a little bit clumsy  toiletpaper was removed several times they forgot to clean the room the key was blocked every day breakfast buffet was almost empty  No problem for us but we hope for future visitors that they improve these things the next months  If they do this hotel will become very very popular 
P => Great hotel great price great service Found Hotel Le Roi on TripAdvisor and am very thankful so I shall share my thoughts and experience Stopping in for the night I came in late on an international flight and driving towards the place I instantly started to think I  have made a booking mistake because the Pahar ganj at am is a pretty seedy place  However Le Roi stands out like a gem the facility is very modern and hip all the amenities a foreign traveler could want and expect  Only problem I faced was a slight connection error from my room to the internet  However the excellent customer friendly staff worked out my internet connectivity issue amp has gone above and beyond to help accommodate some of my last minute travel planning  All in all great price great hotel amp exceptional service  
P => good place to go there I ve been recently to new delhi and i found this new hotel quot le roi quot its a very good hotel  with exccelent accomodation  good services and an exquissite cusine  My standards are quit high but i was excited by the services that they offer  The prices are good and also its located in a nice area So if you stop in New Delhi i highly recomand you to go there   
P => excellent I had an excellent stay at hotel le roi it was a clean and nice place rooms were comfortables and the staff helpfull and nice everything was very good there  The hotel has a very central location  I really recommend this hotel for any stay business or holidays Ps  the pool will be soon finished in this hotel so if you come there youll have it probably 
P => Newly openned Newly opened in central Pahar Ganj  Which is right by the central railway station ask for the imperial cinema and youll walk past Le Roi and in the main backbacker area  Until now Im not aware of any other quotentquot hotels around here  Which is a shame as its the ideal area to stay in central Delhi  The Le Roi will probably be the first of many that follow suit  The area has the everything you need and excellent access to the main attractions in the city  The hotel itself stands out for the others in the area being larger although still relatively smallit would be classed boutique size in the UK   You enter an impressive ble entrance hall  With its bar to the left and restaurant behind  The staff are excellent and show much eagerness to assist you with any problem  The rooms see no fall in standards from the entrance and are very modern with plenty of ble and dark wood with a slight eurooriental theme  My room was large had a new flat screen tv I had to take the wrapper off the remote safe internet fridge etc  The bathroom was spacious clean and modern  Their was next to no noise despite its central location and I had no problem getting a good nights sleep  As its new some of the facilites arent yet working fully but the management were more happy to advertise this fact before I took a room  Overall an excellent hotel in the ideal location  Id recommend highly for anyone visiting Delhi

P => Find another place The hotel is not very clean  Staff is ok  Near airport  Dining room ok  But I would suggest finding a  star hotel  An Indian friend made the reservation for our departure next am  Wished he would have gone for a better place  
P => Good if you have an early morning flight This hotel is very practically situated near the airports so if you have an early flight domestic or international you wont have too much trouble  In fact they will organize a taxi to the airport for you  The rooms are quite spacious and fairly well equipped  One negative point is that it can be quite noisy at night due to the traffic on the highway just outside the hotel  
P => Great service I booked this hotel through Makemytrip  It was a nice hotel and specially recommended for people who are travelling through airlines because it is close to both airportsDomestic amp International  It is also value for money and staff was cooperative and helpful  Condition of room was excellentneat clean amp tidy  
P => Nearby the airport If you want a base near the airport and don t mind sleeping in filthy sheet s this hotel be will be a good choice  The hotel is pretty good located if you have an early morning flight  It s only a few minutes with taxi to the International and National Airport  The rooms are well sized the beds ok but staying their in the winter is extremely cold and drhty no heater  Indeed it is a budget  star hotel but still you expect it to be clean and tidy  The hotel is simply not well managedThe good thing was that the staff was very friendly and helpful  
P => Good value  Great airport location  Wonderful staff  I felt the Lohias represented a good value  Adequate air conditioning clean hot water shower accommodating and pleasant staff that went out of its way to help me Its a budget hotel so I wasnt expecting luxury and was not disappointed ent restaurant but dont expect meat w your breakfast Same for other nearby restaurants The hotel is on a highway that runs along the airport but is about an  minute ride fromto the terminal  Lohias is located amongst a strip of mostly budget hotels along a major road with an intriguing neighborhood behind it through which I enjoyed strolling Admittedly there were problems with the hotel  The first room didnt have the hot water it was supposed to have but staff promptly upgraded me from a Deluxe to a Suite for no extra charge The suite was quite spacious  I experienced a hot water problem but staff quickly fixed it  Great AC and overhead fan actually made the room COLD until I adjusted it Yes I would absolutely stay there again if I were looking for a reasonably priced hotel near the airport  
P => Reasonably priced and convenient for the airport  The Lohias has seen better days but in a city full of grubby and overpriced flea pits it is a pretty good choice for an overnight if you are arriving or departing from the airport at an inconvenient hour  The room was quite big clean by Indian standards and there was hot water in the shower although the quotinclusive breakfastquot was so pathetic it was barely worth eating  The reception staff were friendly and welcoming even in the middle of the night when we arrived but beware of their pre paid taxi fares   a taxi to Central New Delhi should only cost about  rupees from here  You can make a credit card reservation for it on www travelguru com

P => Excellent triporganizer Me and my husband stayed here by a coincidence for two nights in ust   The hotel is situated on a good location not far from anything if you have a driver we had one through the hotel or if you use the three wheelers  The staff was very helpful and friendly We also got to know the hotel owner mr  Naresh Pintoo when we wanted to book train tickets for Agra  The whole thing ended with him advising and organize a  day trip through Rajasthan with car driver hotels and guides in some of the cities  We got to see much more of India then we would have expected to see which we are very grateful for  Our driver Kashmira was an excellent driver and a good and helpful friend through our journey  We would absolutely recommend this hotel and triporganizer to everyone who wants to see more of India 
P => Trip was great The hotel Madonna as well a the other tours and services offered were fantastic  I travelled with my mother who is a very nervous and picky travellor and even she liked it  The hotel is clean the staff is somewhat efficiant and they all want to make your stay as happy as possible  It is highly recommended for a comfortable and easy stay in New Dehli 
P => Perfect week good service and very friendly picp up from the airport by an excellent driver directly to the hotel  Very good welcome in a nice hotel  Direct communication with the owner wich can tell you a lot about india  If wanted he can arrange for fixed prices day trips and youll be treated like his guest all the way  For people that do not like to arrange to much from home you can trust this hotel to arrange reliable transport best driver DEEPAK hotel stayings and sightseeing  Me and one other friend that really did not have any expectations in advance are very happy to have booked this hotel almost randomly  It turned out to be one of the best choices we could have made  We have visited india for just one short week and we have seen so much Delhi Jaipur and Agra really are incredible 
P => Modest rooms great staff My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Madonna on three arate occasions while traveling between other cities in India  We really liked the night manager Tripathi and our taxi driver Kashmira  They were fantastic and generous and made our stay a very nice one  I must say that the hotel is a modest one and we chose it because I thought it was close to the airport but it is at least  minutes away  They do offer a free pick up from the airport and free breakfast which is made to order and delivered to the room The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff could not be nicer  They became our friends  
P => Excellent stay with affordable rates Found staff and owner Mr Naresh to be very helpful and really enjoyed the tour organised by the hotel to Agra and Jaipur  Will definitely recommend  
P => Affordable honest and friendly We had a wonderful time here thanks to Mr  Naresh who provided us excellent services being very professional and a nice human being making us feel like at home George amp Helene Lazar 
P => Cheap Clean and central hotel This hotel was a good clean hotel right in good location to the main attractions of Dehli  The staff were brilliant and very helpful and polite  The price was very reasonable  I would stay here again on my return to Dehli  
P => Naresh owner gets rave review The hotel car and driver complimentary was waiting for us at the airport complete with sign  Naresh also arranged the same car and driver for our tours of Delhi and Agra over the next two days  Puri the driver is probably the best driver in all of India plus he also was very knowlegeable and professional  Puri on his own time at the end of a long day chauffeured us to a great restaurant We also appreciated Nareshs friendship in offering his office and computer to us at anytime so we could try to find our missing luggage as well as track our cruise ship which could no longer come into Mumbai because of the attacks We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful  The beds are king size and the room was clean  We always had hot water and air conditioning Thanks again Naresh and Puri Teddy and Ed from Edmonton Alberta Canada 
P => Smashed it   Had a brilliant stay the hotel was comfortable and clean and provided everything we needed including a brilliant sightseeing tour of Dehli and then the key highlights of Rajasthan  The staff were the best and had a warm personnality Again this was awesome so much so we stayed there once we returned from our Rajasthan tour  The location is spot on in the right part of town close to the sights and the conveinence of the ATMs Banks Shops     thoroughly recommend this hotel when staying in Delhi  
P => Great Place to Stay We where referred to the hotel by the tourist desk on arrival in Delhi Airport  At the hotel we warmly welcomed by the staff and interacted directly with the owners  This personal touch led us to plan trips to the mountains in the North and the desert area South  We obviously use the hotel as our base stay for all the travelling done and really enjoyed coming quothomequot after the long trips away  The hotel is rkable in its hospitality and caring attitude of all staff and management especially that we do not speak or understand any local languages  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable  Being fussy about ablution facilities we felt very at home in the neat and superb facilties  The hotel is ideally situated to travel in and around Delhi as well as a good departure point that does not get too involved in the hustle and bustle of the traffic congestions  I would definitely refer this hotel to travellers in Delhi and as a planning point for all tours  The hotel also operates a tour company with well mannered drivers who know the routes adn advise about places to visit and purchase gifts etc  I would definitely use this hotel in the future it is also competitively priced  
P => Highly Recommended My wife and I just returned from a trip to India which started and ended at Hotel Madonna  The hotel especially our rooms were clean and fairly quiet but what we liked the most about the place was the staff who were not only helpful but genuinely friendly  The owner Mr  Naresh Bhattia was also able to provide advice and services for travel in his part of the country which for us meant Agra Jaipur and Pushkar  He set us up with a superb and resourceful driver who also turned out to be a great traveling companion and a kind of bridge to the India we otherwise might never have seen and the hotels he booked were at least on a par with Madonna and in the case of Pushkar a real gem  All the foregoing at reasonable rates  So we dont hesitate to recommend Hotel Madonna and its wonderful cast of characters starting with Mr  Bhattia through Mr  Singh at the night desk and Protap Singh our driver and friend  Mr  Bhattia also booked our flight from Delhi to Kerala which turned out cheaper than booking it directly from the US  
P => Loved it The Hotel was nice and clean  The services were excellent  People were very helpful when you need something the were always there The only thing need to be upgraded is the shower  Otherwise we were very happy to stay at this Hotel  The train is nearby the hotel and very nice to ride in  The Hotel had tour trip if you want to see other part of New Delhi  The Hotel provided us the tour pkg  which included the car and the driver to Jaipur and Agra to Taj Mahal  The Hotel on the way was excellent  We had no problem at all everything were arranged very well  The own of the Hotel was very helpful  We didnt have to do anything even when were were in the city he gave us the car to tour the city  Tourist from Canada  
P => Hotel Madonna a good choice The Hotel Madonna for a mid range Delhi hotel is in my experience a good choice with very helpful and friendly staff This is the second time I have stayed here  I was again picked up from the airport free of charge at  in the morning   very efficient My previous complaint about having no wireless internet is no more as this is now also a free of charge feature of the hotel  The manager even has a spare GSM card for emergency guest use should the connection fail which it did not do during my six day stay Importantly the hotel is just  minutes walk from the metro and  stops from the station Rajiv ChowkConnht Place which means that one can get around easily Frank 
P => Lucky to know I am a customer since last three years for the hotel madonna the first time I visted india I was not familiar with india  I was along with my wife and were in India for her treatment purpose  i was worry how the hotel will be and how it could treat usRealy the hotel owner Mr  Narish was a very open mind and nice person  Apart from the hotel was clean and all the people were working were so polite the owner was alwayse asking if we need his help in travel inside India and was arranging the trip outside Delhi on very comportable price After we visited Delhi for four time and it became for us like our own house or house for our friend  
P => Great hospitality We stayed in Hotel Madonna for the major part of our stay in India  In between we made a trip to Jaipur and Agra organised by the hotel  It was a great trip very friendly driver and very good guidesThe hotel looks very good nice clean rooms and good facilities  Breakfast at any time and close to the metro and central places in Delhi The owner is very friendly and really made us feel at home here arranging whatever we wanted in no time  Thank you for the great time we had in India 
P => Excellent inexpensive clean and friendly I was coming to India on a business trip it was my first time in India  Before the trip I started to look for the accommodation in New Delhi and discovered that the choice was basically between very expensive five star hotels and one star hostelshotels  Nothing in between  I could not find anything that would match European   star standard and price range  Additionally I planned to take couple of days off in India and see the country  So I needed a private tourist programme arranged by the hotel  I almost gave up on finding something for reasonable money when a colleague recommended me Hotel Madonna  I staid in Hotel Madonna and was very happy with the choice  I also sent there couple of my colleagues from Brussels who were equaly happy with the price quality service  We all had a very good experience with Hotel Madonna  The hotel arranged the accommodation airport transfer I was arriving in the middle of the night to New Delhi from Europe and the flight had a  hour delay nevertheless someone was still waiting for me at the airport to bring to the hotel the hotel also arranged my tour programme with the personal driver and a tour guide  I had most of my meals in the hotel  The accommodation was of good European   star standard  All the above was provided for very reasonable money  I would certainly recommend Hotel Madonna and will be back there again 
P => Great hotel in ideal location  Hotel Madonna in Delhi was very convenient to all Delhi landks  The hotel staff were great literally waited on us hand and foot and arranged all our trips which included Agra and Delhi sights  We made a comment about the great biscuits we found in our room each evening after returning and the evening prior to our departure the owner send us two boxes of biscuits each that was six boxes for three people i was impressed 
P => Great friends there The staying was nice it was a clean place  But especially Naresh the owner is a greatly wonderfull friend that made our days in Delhi a safe really nice trip  
P => no way overpriced  trip advisor no help with Delhi no no no  boo true this hotel is adequate kind of   but at  a night youre paying  x what you would for similar quality in Paharganj  staying here means you burn cash for a ent hotel in a pretty rotten neighborhood Delhi is tricky    ive stayed in  hotels here at the budget level and TripAdvisor which was invaluable in Kyoto and saved my life in Beijing was useless  LonelyPlanet came a lot closer to helping You can get a ent room with some work for  a night in Paharganj which is more central than the madonna  The madonna staff wasnt particularly friendly    and when they gave travel advice you couldnt help feeling like they were scamming you a pretty constant feeling in delhi where everything is barter    it gets old  The madonna staff was always trying to discourage you from talking to others about your travel needsDelhi on a budget is tricky    but it can be done    and location is pretty important you wont be spending much time in your hotel room anyway    Noise and smell are the two things to be wary of in a delhi hotel room    the madonna had both  a sweage smell not as bad as some others ive stayed in   and the constant din from the street  ive stayed in worse though for a fifth of the cost  a night    and ive stayed in places where the doors are thin and you can hear the staff talking all night oddly common experience in DelhiBut buyer beware    just because TripAd has no reasonable options for delhi isnt india supposed to be cheap doesnt mean they dont exist  Look elsewhere for the deal and the inside info  LonelyPlanets a good bet  
P => Clean  Stayed at the Hotel Madonna ideal location to see the real Delhi  It is a clean and safe hotel by Delhi standards and the food was acceptable  The hotel is located near the the metro which is a great service and at a very low cost about  mins walk from the hotel  Regarding the hotel clean sheets and towels provided every day  Try the sala omelette which is very tasty also the beer is chilled and very welcome after a day saying no to helpful people who approach you in connht place   Helpful staff but please have small change when you first arrive as my friend and  both got cht out  a tip of less than  rupees is probably more than enough for carrying your bags to the room Noise is a major factor please bring ear plugs or you will get no sleep  Certainly not a tourist hotel  
P => Nothing to write home about We recently stayed at this hotel for  erate nights having made the reservations in advance The hotel room itself seemed clean and bug free although the sheets were very stained  The bathroom smelt rather musty although again itdid look quite clean  Both toilet paper and towels were both in shortsupply with just one handtowel supplied on one occassion this clearly hadnt been changed as it was dirty and wetOn the upside the owner or manager I didnt quite catch which was very helpful and provided us with a map of Delhi ran through some ofthe key attractions and directed us to the nearby subway  Other staffwere also attentive ringing to ask if you needed any drinks bringingetc  On the downside the constant attempts to overcharge room service etcwas very wearing and the cost of taxis booked through the hotel was extortionate at about  times the cost of getting one directlly off the street without any bartering  If you do stay here check your bills very carefully and use either the nearby subway or taxi rank at the end of the road out of the hotel and turn left and walk straight to the end of the street for transport  
P => A very god place to stay in Delhi A very good hotel in Delhi with clean roomsexcellent service friendly and helpful staff  The hotel manager Mr  Bathia was so friendly top arrange for usn a wonderful trip to Agra Pushkar and Jaipur offering us for the best price hoytels of good standards and also helping us with the transport along all my stay  i can only recomand this hotel to all who will need a stay in Delhi  
P => A wonderful place to stay in Delhi One year ago I was taled about the hotel last year I came to Delhi and stayed in this hotle  The hotel hostility was really wonderful and I ided to come back with my wife  So this time I came with my wife and Mr  Pitoo arrange a womderful trip to Jaipur and Agra and really my wife and I enjoyed our stay  The hotle is led colesed to the ket place and suitable to go for site seeing  The evey important thing about this hotle is that its very clean and the staff are so kind to the guests Thank you so much for evey thing India will be our second home after Ethiopia  
P => Not bad Delhi is a pretty hard place to get accomodations under  that are reasonable  Considering this Hotel Madonna is not so bad at  including taxes and breakfast  They were honest with us and the manager Naresh was very good at making reasonably priced car and travel arrangements for us  The area is also nice as there arent many tourists around to attract touts amp beggars and there are plenty of ATMs and shops bottled water cell phone SIM cards etc     They picked us up from the airport as arranged even though our flight was delayed by  hours and arrived at  AM The downsides Not the cleanest hotel we ever stayed in  Street noise can be very loud Indian street noise is a whole different level than the west     We had to call reception every day for towels and more toilet paper  Restaurant is best avoided  
P => Good value modern hotel Having read a number of reviews of Delhi hotels all had some negative aspect be it dated rooms moody staff poor location or poor value  The tripadvisor reviews for this hotel seemed okay so we booked this for  nights via internet Other than being an autorickshaw ride away from the centre  km and with no real restaurant alternative in the imediate vicinity we were very pleased with the hotel the rooms were clean and well equiped with modern matching furniture everything worked including the tv reception which was a first for India in several weeks of traveling  The hotel has a small restaurant and the food is okay and reasonably priced  Also the hotel was R cheaper than poorer sounding alternatives in Connht Place Overall we were happy with the hotel the money saved more than covered the costs of autorickshaws into town  Also Karol Bagh ket area wih indian and western restaurants is only  minutes walk as is the metro station that provides a pleasant alternative to bargaining fares with rickshaw drivers and gives direct access to Red Fort New Delhi Station and Connht Place  
P => Very good mid range option Service was excellent and the owner Naresh was very helpful  Very good in this rare mid range category in Delhi  The location is by Karol Bagh station which is convenient to get to various places Old Delhi Connht Pl  etc   Room was very clean but if you can you should try and get a room in the back as there is noise on the rooms facing the street also I was on the first floor  
P => ent mid range option There is a lack of mid range hotels in India there seems to be only   hotels and   hotels  The Madonna is a fair attempt at a mid range option  Pleasant enough rooms free but slooow Internet complementary breakfast and the possibility of walking to a metro station are all positives  The hotel is under the same ownership as one m away which has a Sheraton type name but is not part of the Intl group  The staff were friendly and helpful when I was unable to print out my Expedia voucher as I had made an error entering my email address  You get the same rather hard bed that I found elsewhere around Delhi  I was there in a cold spell in early uary and the room was cold the lack of a heater the drht from the windows and intermittent hot water in the shower meant something of a cold welcome  However heat rather than cold would be the issue for most of the year  
P => Sale bruyant et tres cher

P => Thumbs up I was fortunate to be the very first customer of a new hotel wing associated with the Mehar Castle Hotel same owner and overlapping management just starting to operate as the JP Bed amp Breakfast Hotel in mid   web page yet to come  The location is just adjacent to the Mehar Castle on a side street near Ghaffar ket of Amjal Khan Road in Karol Bagh  I can only recommend this hotel which is all new with relatively generous classy ensuite rooms tiled flooring and modern style furniture with latest appliances ac TV ceiling fan fridge safety lockers etc  neat bathrooms etc  It also features a small dining room for customer use and is a very quiet hotel away from street noise  I would rate the room comfort as    stars with reasonable cost Rs  range inc  pick up and breakfast  The down sides No power point by the desk eg  for computer no outside windows the price of a quiet room  and small lobby space  Room oration was also yet to come  The new hotel staff have been very helpful and efficient being proud of inurating their small new  room hotel wing   the food so far so very good  So thumbs up from me  
P => an excellent location for stay   Hotel provides good hospitality  we were provided with a family room which had two double beds  which was perfect for my wife and my two children  Good servicegood food   
P => 
P => excellent stay in good price I have stayed in many hotels in India Metro Heights was the best of the hotel especially in karol bagh area The staff is friendly the rooms were clean and well oated with a big L C D  Bathrooms were neat and hot water in the showers is available I have no hasseles in the hotel every time i have stayed here The price they take is also not exorbitant  
P => just about ok We stayed at the Metro Heights as a part of an organised tour so we had little info on the hotel beforehand  I wouldnt have booked the hotel if I had had any choice  On the other hand the hotel wasnt the worst one we stayed in India but that is not a lot  The room itself was reasonably clean including the bathroom and there was enough hottish water although the bathtub was cracked so that only showering was possible  However the room  if I remember correctly was quite basic and there was some noise from the street  There were no insects and the linen was clean but I was also woken up in the middle of the night by an earbreaking buzzing noise when someone pressed the room doorbell for no reason What I disliked the most was the staff  They were either absolutely indifferent to the needs and requests of their clients to the point of being rude or grovelingly polite in order to get a tip  No real service anywhere you get things done if you ask but no effort is made without you asking  The breakfast was a tired looking buffet and the evening meal that we had there was not special in any way The Karol Bagh area offers little for the tourist all the sights and wonders of Delhi are at least a taxi ride away  In Karol Bagh there is a bazaar and some shops but overall nothing really interesting  It takes about  minutes in a moped rickshaw to the Red Fort and slightly less to New Delhi Connht place  
P => avoid at all cost even when in packagedeal  This hotel which offers room for  usd but books through agents for only  we found to be a filthy dump  Any basic idea of hygiene is alien to them and on top of that not one staffmember is interested in the guest  Most rooms are mere cupboards with a bed with no windows  Our first room  was grimy to the hilt  Imagine a fan black with soot which splatters the fat dirt around your bathroom when turning  After a row and an intervention from our agent we moved to  which they cleaned beforehand  Hot water is mostly off  Linen is dirty the breakfastroom is disgusting as is the breakfast  We met groups of complaining people at all times of day  No sleep before pm for the hotel is situated in the midst of the wholesale autotrade hotelstaff starts banging around at   Staff sideentrance is open at all times so no security at all on all floors  
P => If you can afford book another hotel Metro Heights is sort of best you can get in the lower price range up to   in Delhi  It is simple has dark rooms the one we had did not even have windows and especially on the ground floor you hear a lot of noise from the reception  Beds are ok but short bathroom is clean but nothing fancy  This is a hotel for just sleeping not to spent time there  Breakfast consist of a number of hot Indian dishes toast and coffeetea  A number of Dutch travel groups use the hotel I think because they cant find anything better in that price range too  
P => Good place to stay in Karol Bagh The hotel is ently priced and closer to the main shopping strip in Karol Bagh however being a few blocks away ensures that the road noise is minimal The Suites are around  including breakfast and are quite large  The service has been better than other hotels and when the internet access was not working they called someone in on a Sunday to check it out I would stay here again  
P => Dunkelkammer  
P => Buen hotel para una corta estancia  
P => 
P => Clean but Basic Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Mohan International this month for one night and although the room was very basic it was clean  As other people mentioned in their reviews there were stains on the sheets and the fact that my friends had a man sleeping on the floor outside of their room was very weird  I would recommend this hotel for travellers on a budget as it was cheap and it was a good location  I wouldnt recommend the hotel to women travellers as we were as there were times when we felt quite uncomfortable  
P => Not a very good hotel at all Stayed here for  days having booked on Expedia  It must have been ades since this hotel was last refurbished  The underside of the basin was covered in rust  Though the bedsheet you sleep on had been washed it still had old ks and stains on it  There are no bedsheetsto sleep under just these rugs   not sure if theyre washed regularlytoo If you get a ground floor room dont expect to sleep until late Noiseof buzzers for people calling from their room and voices through thelate evening and early the next morning make it very difficult Oh and they give the hard sell on getting you to visit their travel agent  We did and ended up getting a package but only after refusing some of the hotels he offered as Tripadvisor had some shocking reviewsfor one or two  The other hotels were good and having a driver for a week which they offered as well as having everything organised for you was actually really convenient so glad we did it  If your driver is a man called Mahender youre lucky   hes really really lovely man  always cheery and got great advice 
P => Worst hotel were we stayed First of all the airport pickup didnt show up  After calling several times he eventually did but  hours late  Rooms in the hotel are reasonable but the staff is horrible  The quotmanagerquot kept stalking me on the hotelroom phone about tours he wanted to sell they staff didnt let me out of the hotel alone but were almost agressively pushy about arranging a city tour  Even at  oclock in the morning they were banging on the door and calling on the phone about tours  Very much noise at night  Left one night early because i couldnt stand it anymore  Im used to budget travel the rooms were OK but the rest made me want to run away There are much better hotels in this area sometimes even cheaper    
P => Total Scam Stay Away What a scam  There are atleast  other similar hotels around this one and you dont need to book this online  If you are looking for this price range simply get off the train at the main station walk around ask to look at the room and the bed sheets before you select one BUT DONquotT GO WITH HOTEL MOHAN  Its dirty noisy expensive and not worth the hassle  Front desk is not helpful  I got this hotel from another site and based on the listing I figured it would be a reasonable place  But what a mistake  Like I said if you are looking for that price range simply walk around the area and check out the room before you buy I asked for a driver and they gave me one that got us into an accident the same day  I asked for internet and they had me driven to their sister location  minutes away when infact there were several places right down the road  
P => Shame on Hotel Club I spent five weeks in India from Mid ember till the end of uary  Unfortunately my first two nights were spent at this ridiculous excuse for a hotel  First of all Hotel Club is absolutely LYING about their location indicating that they are located at Connht Place where several five star hotels are located including the famous Imperial Hotel  In fact this place is located at the MAIN TRAIN STATION area which is a full  minutes by TAXI and quite a dangerous area even in the daytime  I am a solo woman traveler in her s and did not appreciate this eption  Secondly the price charged by Hotel Club  euros night is OUTRAGEOUS for Delhi for a hotel of this type and shameful considering the condition  I checked other accomodation around this place and their prices for a single room with hot water private toilette etc was in the   range  Thirdly the cleanliness factor was overlooked as the sheets were SMEARED with some dark substance I chose not to closely investigate and requested new sheets  The floor attendant graciously brought some but after I opened them I discovered that they too were dirty and never cleaned prior to being pressed  Thank goodness I had a sleep sheet packed and used that Fourthly the man who collects the dirty sheets in the morning would smoke ajuana every day and the elevator was full of the smoke  I am asthmatic so this was not amusing  Lastly there was not even any heating in ember and it was freezing and no hot water in the shower in ember  I stay in simple accomodation sometimes but they are usually clean and pleasant  I sent Hotel Club a prompt review of this hotel and am shocked to see this HORRIFIC Place is still on offer to unsuspecting guests  
P => Un h tel minable mais bien situ

P => Budget stay at Namaskar The airport pickup worked perfectly for the price of quite expensive Rps and the driver wanted a big tipThe rooms were budget no hot water accordingly not perfectly clean rooms The biggest issue was the extremely loud AC it was as loud as a lawnmower The staff was friendly and we stay for the booked  nights The location is ideal and you get what you pay budget rooms for a budget price  
P => For Rs this is what you get Good location close to New Delhi train station friendly staff  hot shower available if you ask very basic rooms bit run down  Personally I would pay extra Rs for a room with private bathroom hot showers new clean amp comfortable at Hotel Gush or Rak International neighbours  
P => Very cheap in the heart of Paharganj We booked the hotel for its price and reccomendation of guidebooks  The area of Paharganj is not the best in Delhi so if you want anything remotely fancy dont stay here  The hotel looked like one of many in the area which is packed but we didnt have any hassle in our stay at all The room is clean enough and very big with some weird cables hanging from the wall and a not very nice toilet with not very warm wather They can arrange the pick up from the airport which saves you lots of hassle if you are not used to the india taxi way of life Also they can organise tours around Delhi and Rajastan though they take a fairly big commission and if you have the chance you would do best booking straight from a driver Our stay was not memorable but it served perfectly its purpose of having a cheap place to sleep in Delhi  
P => Very cheap you get what you pay for Found this through Lonely Planet one of the few places that was very responsive to my email inquiry  Their airport pick up service was on time and waiting for me but I did not feel safe in the minivan they drove which was very old has poor shock absorbers and no seatbelt  At one point the car hit a speedbump too fast and I flung forward knocking the front passenger seat out of place  The reception and staff are friendly and helpful but they are always a bit too eager to book tours for you The hotel is located in the Paharganj in an alley just off the main ket street  This is a very active loud and dusty area and there is a public urinal at the entrance of the alley  It is walking distance to the metro Rama Krishna Ashram g station and one metro stop away from Connht Place My room quotdoublequot room was very spartan there were two twin beds pushed together and just enough space to walk around it and a small table in the corner  Walls were pink as warned in Lonely Planet  The windows were blacked out but I could hear the street noise and the heavily polluted street air made its way into the room  There was also a ceiling fan and ac  The bathroom was small and there is no aration between the shower and the toilet this is standard for most hotels in India  No hot showers as there was no hot water in the room   they provide you with a large bucket and you retrieve hot water from a tap down the hall  Also the only available electrical outlet in my room had been taped onto the wall The room appeared clean enough but as with most hotels in India the room does not get serviced daily  Bathroom looked kind of disgusting with a lot of water stains and water damagede door  Toilet paper is not provided  The sheets were clean some more threadbare than others all had some stubborn stains or cigarette burns  I stayed for  nights and got very sick from the poor air quality this is clearly evident when you blow your nose at the end of the day  Essentially you get what you pay for  Many locals avoid the Paharganj area because it is even too chaotic for them to endure but it does have lots of shops tourists internet cafes and cheap eateries  As a tourist you can also expect and get used to being hassled a lot  
P => Basic in the Bazaar Basic hotel in the Main Bazaar area  Rooms are cheap relatively clean but very basic  The staff and especially the two brothers are extremely helpful and can arrange for tours at very reasonable prices both in Delhi and wider India  It is this that is the main attraction Up a small alley off the main bazaar you have to pass an open urinal at the start of the alley  The location is not for the faint hearted as you are pitched into the noise and squalour of Old Dehli on your doorstep although personal safety was never an issue  
P => cheap clean noisy I spent  nights in Namaskar hotel  The people of the hotel can take you from the airport even during the night for  rupies  euros  They can book a taxi for you and many other things  They can keep some of your luggage even a computer a few weeks until you come back  It is really near main bazar street We spent  nights in a room for oo rupies  euros for  people  Their was too much noise because of the fan and the corridor too much light during the night some problems with the water there was no more water during one hour be  The room was clean We spent another night in a  rupies room  euros  It was really bigger with  bathrooms but as much noise and light  However I dont know if it is possible to have better hotels for less than  rupies a night in Delhi where so many hotels are quotexpensvequot for India and of bad quality If you want to sleep in this hotel it is better to phone them to book the nights you want before you come to Delhi  If you arrive from the airport it is better to ask them to send you a taxi to avoid a lot of problems the first day a french tourist

P => Omni hotel did not honor reservation I reserved a superior room for one night through the Venere travel agency They had all my credit card information When I arrived at the hotel at A M after the  hour trip from New York City I was told the hotel was filled and could not stay there I was offered a room at another hotel which I lined  My voucher for the room for the night was deemed meaningless  An Iranian Tour operator was also having a problem with arrangements that had been made months before  A reservation at the hotel might be honored if no one else takes your room before you arrive I would warn you against staying at a hotel run by such shabby people  
P => Not a hotel but a hole Im working in India for a couple of weeks and ided to visit Delhi  BCDTravel from India booked the hotel  The place is just terrible  The area in where it is is awful you feel like youre going to get killed the moment you put a feet outside the hotel I know in general the zones in India dont look good but really this is one of the worst areas there  The rooms are very dirty smells i even found  empty bottles of beer in front of my room when i arrived no one worried to at least throw them at that moment and also when o left the next day  Dont follow the tramp of the pictures they must be edited because its not like the pictures at all  The rate for a hotel like this should be less than US not more  
P => value for money i booked my hotel from the website and i made the payment from ther and i wa scared that the hotel is good enough or not but when i reached the airport i was welcomed like a person of my family has came to recive me and it was of a different class and when i reached the hotel it was like i have paid nothing for the hotel ppl say that that it is value for money but i will say it was more than value for money one difficulty i experienced that was i was that tv cabel was not working for  hour or so but later it was corrected so i will recamend each and everybody to visit this hotel and the hotel website is

P => Good Place to Stay This hotel is fairly small but well sited in the middle of Delhi in Connht Place  Rooms are variable in size but well appointed for us Staff areexcellent and very helpful whilst the attached restaurant has excellent food and service Connht Place itself is undergoing extensive restoration so there is quite a bit of mess in the area Only trouble with the hotel is that is no lounge area for friends to meet but you can use the restaurant for this purpose without difficulty  
P => Centrally located clean and with a good restaurant As with other reviews the driver was unsure exactly where this hotel was on Connht Circus  I recognised it as It looked exactly like the pictures on tripadvisor  Greeting was pleasant room was small but clean and well appointed  Restaurant was excellent  Location was so central for that part of Delhi with plenty of shops clubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk There was some noise perhaps from the cinema but it wasnt unbearable  Id definitely stay here again By the way dont think about visiting the fairly nearby Indian Coffee House   what a dump 
P => Excellent Value I stayed at this hotel for one night in ember  It was difficult for my taxi driver to find the hotel and from the outside it doesnt look that great but the rooms inside are great with a modern and clean or flat panel TV and a lovely bathroom  Theyre not huge rooms but theyre very comfortable  The location is perfectly central there are loads of shops restaurants and ATMs when you step out of the hotel  All the staff from reception to housekeeping are very courteous and helpful  The food in the restaurant Zaffran is wonderful and the service in there is also exemplary  There is also complimentary water fruit and internet and a welcome juice  I would rate this as higher than a  star  Also just a note    I ate all the fresh fruit provided in the room and got more when i finished  It was good to eat fruit that i could trust  
P => Nice Place for touristsnight stay  I visited Delhi as a tourist with my spouse and young kids  I didnt want to pay a very high price just for the few nights stay in a typical  star hotels so I chose this hotel based on other reviews  All we needed a night stay in a safe clean and comfortable place  Although little higher on the price side for what it offers not very big but ok size rooms  Location is perfect and rooms were very clean and comfortable  Bathroom was immaculate  Most site seeing locations are closer to this place and central park Metro station is right there  Restaurant is also fabulous  Overall very nice experience and would recommend with high ratings  Free wireless Internet service  For vehicles Parking on the streets free of charge but not very difficult to find  
P => very comfortable and excellent restaurant The Hotel is very central  The room we had was clean and we were able to sleep  in the room  it is an expensive hotel but worth it for the restaurant and its central position  The staff were extremely helpful even to the extent of accompnaying us to find an ATM which worked  
P => Excellent Good Value Down Town Hotel Great location right in the heart of Connht Place and close to the metro station  Beware though that because the hotel is quite small and with no street frontage to speak of taxi drivers  not know where it is The two best things about this hotel were the restaurant   great at both breakfast and dinner some of the best food Ive ever had in India   and the enthusiasm of the staff and their willingness to help with everything Rooms are well appointed and confortable  althougha bit on the small side  The AC can be a bit aggressive and in our room we were forced to turning it off during the night so as to avoid being too cold  However thats a minor niggle Internet worked fine and was reasonably fast The only negative aspect was that having booked another couple of nights for the following week we were informed the evening before we left that they were unable to honour these extra nights  Had I not gone to the desk to book a taxi for the following morning I suspect that I wouldnt have found this out until too late Good value for Delhi  Overall recommended  
P => perfect service I stayed end of ust    in this hotel in Delhi   and it was simply perfect You cant ask for a nicer welcoming service  Everybody from the staff was very friendly and tried to help in every way   from access to internet to phoning at the agency where Ive had booked an ac cab for a sight seeing tour that didnt show up  The receptionist made it come in less than  minutes after Ive waited half an hour in vain  M  Wasim at the reception desk was extremely kind and also his colleague who was on duty after his shift I only can recommend this hotel  Connht place is in the very heart of Delhi the rooms are comfortable have European standard what a pleasure to find a nice and clean bathroom after a travel through the Himalayas  a welcome drink juice of course its India after all was offered as well as a fruit basket  It was simply perfect  
P => Definitively my favorite place in Norther India I stayed in India three weeks visiting Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh West Bengal and Mumbay  I spent two nights at Palace Heights at the beginning of my trip and two at the end  The staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and efficient making you feeling at home if not even better  The service is professional discrete and very efficient  They arrange perfect tours and transfers fromto the airport  The hotel is a quiet oasis in the heart of Delhi with clean rooms furnished in a contemporary design style  The restaurant is one of the best I tried in India cozy and relaxing  You buy a five star quality hotel at the price of a three star A modern and confortable hotel with a strong personality 
P => Nice but expensive hotel We stayed two nights at Hotel Palace Height  The hotel is expensive for the size of the room amp bathroom we had  The view from the hotel room is not great   On our first night we had no hot water but the hotel staff fixed that problem very quickly  However the hotel staff are courteous and provided a good service If you are in Delhi for a couple of days and want to be in a good location to the attraction this hotel will be fine  
P => Excellent service Ive stayed at this hotel a number of times so far   always for business   and the one thing that stands out is the customer service and he staffs desire to please The hotel is small but very well kept and clean  The wireless internet used to be problem but they have fixed it  The food in Zaffran is excellent    the breakfast is to order and always prepared very well  They cater to a lot of foreign tourists The location of the hotel is superb  Right above the Metro station which makes traveling around Delhi a breeze  Its also in the heart of Connht Place CP with plenty of options in shopping restaurants entertainment and great to walk around in the evenings when traffic is a lighter Ive always had a pleasant experience at the hotel and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a clean safe and good place to stay  It is a little pricey and I think would be better valued at about   below its current rates  
P => A good staritng point The service here was excellent particularly in the restaurant  The rooms are very modern and the bathroom had a good shower  Rooms are a bit small with no view but are kept very clean with clean linen every day  Complimentary fruit water and snacks are provided It was relatively expensive compared to the rest of India but worth it for Delhi  Breakfast is included with the rate and has a good choice and a ent buffet  The food in the restaurant was one of the best Indian restaurants we visited and very good value 
P => Good hotel conveniently located on Connht Place Well located on Connht Place and for getting a tuk tuk to the varying sites of Delhi  The hotel is better than an average   rating but not good enough for a  very good   rating  The service was good and the rooms are clean if a little on the small side  However if you are only in Delhi for a day and a night which we were then it does exactly what you want  The restaurant attached to the hotel called Zaffran was very good  
P => Excellent and well priced hotel right in the thick of it This was the third hotel we stayed in during our to ing and fro ing to Delhi  It was the cheapest   per room per night inc breakfast the nicest and the best placed hotel of the lotThe staff were great and very helpful  The room was lovely clean and well equipped  Best of all was the restaurant and the central position  The breakfast was excellent and we ate at the restaurant too on our last night in India which was reasonably priced and one of the best meals we had during our trip  The location couldnt be better   walk out of the door and youre right in the middle of the intensity that is Connht place But inside its calm and a haven  If youve only got a few nights in Delhi   stay here  
P => Perfect Boutique Hotel If you are lookin for a hotel in Delhi which is centrally located affordable convinient then Palace Heights is the place to stay  The hotel is located on the inner circle of connht place and is on the second floor  The approach kind of looks eptive but once you enter the premises i bet you are heading for a good experience  Its a small property having   rooms only  There is a restaurant called Zafran which serves great Indian food and is also a popular among the locals  Complimentry morning breakfast is served here too  Being a small property you can be assured of personalised service  The staff right from the doorman at the entrance to the hotel manager are friendly and ever welcoming  The rooms are small but cant expect anything grand at that price rs     in that part of the city  The room or is modern and the bathrooms are done up well too  Its a great place for tourists who are lookin out for affordable accomodation central location not looking for aminities just wanting to sleep the night in good rooms eat good breakfat and get out to spend the day  Applies for business travellers as well  
P => An individual hotel with personal service We stayed for two nights at the palace heights and would definately recommend it  The room we stayed in was clean and with all the amenities you would expect if a little small  The location is great for getting a feel for Dehli although I would warn you not to stray too far off the beaten track but this goes for everywhere in Dehli  The restaurant is excellent at a reasonable price  I know we could have eaten cheaper but for under ten pounds for more than the two of us could eat seemed a good deal to us especially as it was so good  The staff were friendly and helpful and we would go back again in fact we did go back to the restaurant on our last night in India having unfortunately booked another hotel which wasnt nearly as good  
P => Great in all respects The well located Hotel Palace Heights is a Delhi oasis   The rooms are exceptionally clean and well thought out   They are well deocrated and all the things that you would expect from a good hotel have been considered such as good room service  wireless and various complimentary touches   The staff are exceptional and the service was excellent and attentive in all respects  The restaurant is also great and serves fanatastic food from North India  once again the service was great and the restaurant manager was particularly helpful in recommending dishes  Highly recommended 
P => Fantastic hotel in a central location The hotel is small but great in a very central location in Delhi  The rooms were fantastic I cant fault anything wrong with the rooms  The hotel restaurant was also great   I highly recommend it  
P => Dont judge a book by its cover Arriving at Connht Place Delhi is an experience in itself  Oh my goodness the driving is like nothing on earth I have ever seen before  Cars people bicycles tuk tuks and anything goes From outside the hotel looks small and unassuming but once inside its cool air conditioned loveliness all your travel stresses disappear  The Reception staff are very helpful and their english is excellent  We had arrived in India with only  of our  nights with a hotel booking the hotel staff recommended a travel agent   Perfect Holidays and a very helpful man Javid organised the next  nights for us including internal flights accommodation and a driver The room was a little on the small side but very clean as was the bathroom with all the usual trimmings   extra loo roll shower cap etc The hotel is in a great location smack bang in the middle of the shopping area and close to the underground Palika ket  Breakfast in the Restaurant was lovely   choice of indian continental or english  This was one of the better hotels we stayed in on our trip  
P => Fab fab fab fab This was my second stay at palace heights and it was just as great as the first one This is definitely one hotel I would recommend people stay at everytime you visit delhi  They have an excellent restaurant attached and althou living in the UAE gives you access to great indian food this is truly authentic  Their room service is even more fab with meals reaching in mins The rooms althou small are immaculately maintained and any troubles you  have are dealt with immediately  The staff right from their manager to the various service attendants are so polite its ridiculous  I have stayed at various hotels all over India and none have been this wonderful an experience  Literally one can make no complaints  Its the perfect Boutique hotel  Only thing missing is possibly a spa just to wrap the dealWill definitely keep staying at Palace heights everytime I do visit Delhi  
P => Great service location breakfast and value for money We only booked a day room at the Palace Heights at the end of our trip after arriving by sleeper train at  am and before flying home that night but we would have no hesitation in using it for our entire stay in Delhi on our next visit  We had a smooth and speedy check in and being ravenous as we had not eaten on the train that morning went straight into breakfast which was delicious especially the pancakes and capuccino Our room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable with a kettle and teacoffee the shower gave ample hot water and there were lovely toiletries  The hotel is on the first floor there is a lift which means the rooms are quiet and its location on Connht Square is excellent   we loved the great bookshop  blocks away  Best of all however is the service from the doorman downstairs who loaded our luggage into the lift and whisked us up to reception to the smiling receptionist and waiters in the restaurant   nothing was too much trouble and every member of staff was eager to please  I can highly recommend the Palace Heights as great value for money  
P => The Best Ever  Will be back for more Im so glad that I had chance to stay in Palace Heights I was traveling alone to Delhi for architecture conference  Im a woman and Delhis first timer I did my research on tripadvisor and ided to choose  hotels for my stays Ginger Hotel Hans Hotel and Palace Heights I had a good hunch with Palace Heights since my first email conversation with their general manager Mr  Joh  He responded to my email and made me sure that my reservation is secured  Palace Heights is such a high demand hotel among travelers and I can see why during my stay I loved the building and its settings  Palace Heights is an example of successful adaptive re used building  The location is just perfect in the center of CP and just a minute walk to fabIndia I loved the hotel room   minimalist simple and very clean  I loved the window which facing to CP and you can witness the bustling busy experience downstairs  And the goof thing is the room is very quite   you cant hear anything from outside But the thing I loved more is the superb service and warm greetings  From receptionist to restaurant from housekeeper to general manager They are doing their best to help me and make sure my stay is incredible  And they did Im really impressed when I asked their help whether I can print my essays for my presentation at the conference  They dont have business center  So what they did was they take me to hotels main office which located couple blocks from the hotel  And they insist to take me by hotels car  After I print everything the car drove me back to hotel The porter always accompanied me when I want to take a tuk tuk and made sure that the driver know where I want to go and bargain the price for me  And for the bonus   they have a free wifi Im so blessed with all kindness I accepted during my stay and I will be back for more Palace heights experience  
P => High Standards at a reasonable price Arrived from London our pick up arranged through the hotel was waiting for us  The hotel is located in a good part of New Delhi a short walk from shops and parks and the Metro is very close by  The hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly rooms are very clean and modern  The restaurant is excellent  The only negative points were   We specifically booked twin beds travelling with my dhter and when we arrived this was not available  The first night they found us another room on the second a week later they provided a Collapsible bed but this was quite uncomfortable  Unfortunately the same problem occurred wherever we stayed during the trip    The second minor problem was the surging shower with fluctuating water temperature not extreme so merely annoying  
P => A great respite from the bustle of New Delhi The location is fantastic the Palace Heights give you an oasis of calm right in the middle of Connht Place The staff is extremely friendly and helpful with good recommendations for restaurants in the area since no matter how the the hotel restaurant is and it it good    you cant eat there every night The included fruits water and breakfast help you get your day off to a good start easily with no hassle I had also arranged airport pickup through the hotel and everything went very smoothly driver was there on time very professional etc   
P => Good location tidy and professional staff We stayed at the hotel various nights in ember  and used the hotel as our hub for a number of trips throughout India The hotel has been reated recently and now offers business style clean and tidy rooms with spacious beds and a fine bathroom the best one we had during our trip always enjoyed coming back there     From the hotel you have easy acces to various shops incl  Western shops with sometimes attractive proces at Connht Place restuarants included  From the hotel its only a few meters to the new subway that brings you e g  directly to the railway stations for hardly any money  We used it several times and always enjoyed the ride The hotel staff is professional and also takes take of the guests needs  We used both airport pick ups and drop offs The restaurant at the hotel offers very good food the elevated prices compared to other options outside the hotel are worth it and the staff is great and friendly There might be cheaper place to stay in Delhi but Palace Heights benefits from its central location professional staff and proper rooms  Wed go back there if we return to Delhi  
P => Fantastic Stayed at the hotel for a business trip the rooms were lovely and the staff extremely helpful  Will definitely be staying there for my next trip to Delhi Highly recommended  
P => Great Stay We stayed here for two nights after arriving in Delhi from the US  We went ahead and arranged for transport to the hotel RS   to avoid having to deal with prepaid taxis upon arrival  The hotel is about  minutes away from the airport  Check in was smooth and though our room was a bit small it was very comfortable  We were provided with complementary fruit and bottled water daily  I especially appreciated how quiet it got at night  We had a minor issue with the hot water but it was rectified very quickly  Breakfast in the hotel was good and very convenient  We had dinner at Bukhara at the Maurya  The food was fabulousThe hotel arranged for a day tour of Delhi using their car and also for early morning transport to the Delhi railway station  Although we found the tariff to be a little overpriced we would definitely stay here again for the amenities and the convenience  
P => Definately a good place to stay Service is the best After reading the revieiws we booked the hotel  I was hoping for a clean place and they defnately met that requirement  The room we had was a bit small as others had pointed out but it was clean well equipped comfortable and right in the middle of the city close to most everything The real standout was the service at the hotel  They carried our bags arranged for transportation had excellent room service and met any extra request we had  One of our travelers in the groups was sick  They went out and got her medication we requested made special meals for her and kept an eye on her when we went out exploring the city  I couldnt have asked for anything more for my little sister when she was sick Definately eat in the hotels restaurant  It is great food  I was really worried when we arrived because from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall and I would never have booked it but it is completely different from the inside  Dont let the outside picture worry you Because it is located in the heart of the city Connht Place it is a bit expensive but you are paying for the location  It is definately cheaper than other hotels around the area when we were looking  
P => Great choice in this price range  The Palace Heights is probably one of the best hotels in Delhi in the moderate price range  The location rooms service are great and the restaurant is fantastic  The staff were especially helpful and welcoming  Highly recommended  
P => Its ok   but come for the food Good points  No noise from street  Central location  Cheap  good value  Good facilities in room plasma TV large bathroom minibar  EXCELLENT restaurant with  hour room service  Come here like the locals to eat fantastic North Indian food  Very reliable airport transfers cars were right on time  Helpful staff who rectified issues immediately see belowBad points   Noise from other peoples rooms slamming doors voices in the corridor etc  Bed sheets and towels were dirty when I arrived   but this was quickly rectified   Surfaces also dirty   reception didnt apologise but immediately sent a cleaner   Expensive minibar   but what do you expect   The sink drain was very smelly and some flies congregated around itIts a good choice but expect some noise from other guests and question the reception if you dont feel things are that clean  
P => Fantastic A true gem  Hotel Palace Heights is a superb boutique hotel in the heart of Delhi  Exceptional service and friendly staff had us staying at this quiet hotel twice this summer  Spotless rooms and central location the hotels Saffron Restaurant is also a treat Staying there was truly heaven  Our thanks to the wonderful staff who made our stay in Delhi memorable  
P => Clean great staff   a little gem While a lot less ostentatious and pricey than the big international hotels in ND this little place really deserves its high rating Stayed here for a few days arriving in India and then again one night before shipping back to Europe  The staff is extraordinarily friendly and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds and have good modern amenities plasma TV every room with international news channels for those of us that still like to stay in touch  While located smack in the middle of Connht Place with plenty of restaurants around the hotel restaurant is also worth a visit  Well priced and delicate food looked after and managed by a very helpful manager and really nice staff The only drawback is the lack of pool  SPA  For that you have to go to the bigger hotels in the outskirts of town well so so so its up to you if you want to make that trade off  All in all a place we can warmly recommend 
P => Clean safe and comfortable hotel in Dehli Arrived in New Delhi and our transfer was waiting as promised  Check in was easy and the staff were great  The room was modern but small and the view was less than spectacular  If you plan to be in Delhi for a short stay and will be on the go most of the time this place is great  If you are planning to spend nights in it could feel a bit tight  That said everything else was amazing  The room itself is has a flat screen TV snacks of fruit and bottled water at no extra charge  Room service is great and its offered  hours a day  The linens were very nice and very clean  The pillows were lovely  The bathroom had beautiful floor to ceiling ble the shower was large and there was a good supply of hot water  I think the power  have been an issue once but not bad  The towels were clean and all the toiletries offered were nice  The complimentary breakfast was huge For the low price this is a winner clean great service and a central location make this hotel hard to beat 
P => comfortable stay I stayed in the hotel for two nights amp had both the dinners here  The hotel is a contemporary one with all the style elegance amp modern amenities  The food in the restaurant  Zaffran was really blessings to the tastebuds  
P => Stay away for the love of God We just completed a  days stay at the hotel  two days prior to our arrival we asked for airport pickup  That didnt happen and not much of an apology was provided We arrive at the hotel  and it takes them  minutes to check us in even though we are the only ones there  Funny thing about that the hotel claim to have  rooms actually they only have   and the lies continue  They also claim to have free internet access  what they mean is if you have a good internet subscription for your phone it will also work within their hotel  They still tried to convince me they actually did have a wireless network I said show me then they said they dont know how and they cant call anyone The room is so small you feel clostrophobic  And the aircondition only has icy cold or really hot  The quotfancyquot flatscreen is the oldest LCD samsung available and the picture quality is awful  All the furniture is cheap plastic Someone below has mentioned they give complementary fruits water and cookies  but dont eat the cookies otherwise you dont get any new ones and if you dont eat the fruit they just leave it  see the tasty picture of the moldy fruit  and even the bottled water is expired  are you kidding me The building is a completely delapidated building doesnt matchwebsite pictures the quotwonderful restaurant and breakfastquot that someone mentioned  There are two fruits cut last night some cereal and then you can order and omelet or pancakes  Dont do the last it gave us a little brown present for two days   if you know what I mean Location connht place is really dirty shopping is very good but you just feel disgusted with the dirt and flies  If you are Indian no problem but if you are white there are  conmen ready to approach you in a very aggresive way  Our Indian friend also advised us not to go outside after   yes I said  Now to the masterpiece  The reception  They are  years old and have the combined intelligence of a  year old  They cannot answer any questions like airport question shopping question internet question etc etc  When we were checking out the boy spent  minutes counting the minibar and when we went back to the room he actually checked one more time before we could leave just to make sure we didnt take a  Rupee cola  keep in mind we just spent  rupees for the room All in All do yourself a big favour  Do not budget travel in Delhi  We have been to a few hotels in India and this one takes the price  WOW  
P => fine for a short stay Arrived at this hotel located on the second floor of a period building overlooking Connht Place just before midnight and the staff were expecting us  The room is clean functional and modern with mock wooden floors and minimalist furniture orations and bathroom  Linen was spotless and towels plentiful and there were chocolate biscuits for an evening snack along with complimentary bottled water  But the room felt small and if there was any more than one of you it would not be somewhere you could relax at the end of a long days sightseeing or really get comfortable if you just wanted a day off  There s something a bit clinical and cold about the d cor  We stayed there in transit arrived midnight departed  the next morning and it was fine as it would be if you were on business and in meetings all day  Breakfast was included in the room rate and you can have it either in the restaurant or delivered to your room no extra charge  The breakfast was fine without being memorable  The hotel gets an above average rating because it was clean the staff helpful and the cost spot on  
P => very nice hotel We stayed  nights in this nice hotel very welll located clean  staff is very nice and helpfull at the reception and in the hotel restaurant The Saffran In a previous review one person mention that the only bad thing he could say was that the towel were old well they replace it for new one The beds are very confortable   They give you every day  bottles of water and fruits  newspaper in the morning and on arrival they serve you juice  We tried near the hotel the Zen restaurant which was very good  it is about  minutes by walk from the hotel on your right side when you get out of the hotel  Do not be surprise but when you arrive the building do not announce what is inside the hotel is on the seconf floor of an old buiding the hotel was reated  year ago  It is not expensive for New Delhi do not hesitate to book   
P => Great Just great  Very well located in Connht Place great rooms nice furnished and modern oration flat screen tv nice bathrooms nice restaurant very friendly staff affordable    Definitely this is the kind of hotels you want to find  Ill be back  
P => Very good hotel I went to India on il the rd and stay at Palace Heights for  days after going to Jaipur and stayed there in the last night in India on il the th  This is a very nice hotel good rooms not very large but OK with LCD TV and they offer each day mineral water and a fruit basket  The bathroom was very good too The dinner and breakfast room was nice and the staff very friendly  And I must say this is an hotel in the center of Delhi near the Indian and international shops  I recommend this hotel  
P => Cute little hotel Very small room  The staff were friendly and helpful   Its very good for the price and location and running around in Delhi The restaraunt Zaffron is the best thing about this hotel  The menu is great and the prices are about  per meal I recommend this hotel when you are in Delhi  
P => Refreshingly good   a must stay on your visit to Delhi Location at the heart of the city  you can never ask for a better location  This is considered to be the finest location in New Delhi Rooms Staff Service Reception ExcellentBreakfast Complimentry and excellent choice of menu Very good or and so peaceful  
P => A Hidden Gem Excellent management amp staff This place has an unassuming front and is fairly new  Small with  rooms but excellently managed  Well staffed and no pressure to tip whatsoever  Your every wish is their command and they make you feel special  Asked for hair dryer iron extra towels etc  and all supplied within minutes  Forgot to switch off the quotdo not disturb signquot outside the door on one occasion  Hence found rooms not made on return in evening  Called reception  No problem  Room made up in  minutes  Seldom does one see such service No queues for check in or check out as there are only  rooms  hour room service   no extra charge  Safe deposit amp Minibar Good air con  heating  Thick fabric window blinds keep the blazing sunlight out and let you have a late morning sleep Plasma TV on wallComfortable super king size bed with nice pillowsLarge interior illuminated wardrobe with plenty of space   full length dressing mirrors on wall  Complimentary breakfast   cereal fruit juiceegg bacon sausage toast Indian poori with potato masala  Egg served many ways  Try the masala omlette which is like a spanish omlette amp is lovely  Coffee expresso cappucino or simply black Free newspaper and a call for breakfast before they close at  am in case you forgetToiletExtremely clean amp shiny toilet with a brilliant shower  Plenty of hot water  Shampoo body lotion and soaps all provided  This the only hotel toilet I have ever seen where the mirrors do not get misted after a shower thanks to the excellent ventilator fan which also removes any odours instantly  Plenty of thick clean towels Airport pick up by hotel worked well RestaurantChecked in at pm after a late flight and although it was closing time for the attached Zaffiran restaurant they still let me order from the menu Their food is very good   Tandoori chicken cooked to perfection  Also try their lamb dish cant remember the name which is a whole leg of lamb prepared with exquisite spices  The hyderabadi mutton biriyani is also recommended  Plenty of locals eat here  For   people can have a three course meal Nice or and ambience as well And all this for GBP  per night in Connht place  What more can you ask for Interestingly when I tried to book rooms via trip advisor all the booking agents said quotroom not availablequot and offered rooms at other places but when I emailed the hotel directly they had vacanciesOn the other hand if you want window views and gardens look elsewhere but for the price this place cant be beaten Certainly recommended and will stay here again Good management always counts 
P => Smashing hotel  Clean tidy and central  star  This hotel is lovely  its clean tidy and very well positioned  it bang in the heart of everything  I would rate it as  star The staff are friendly and alway willing to help you There is also a lovey restaurante in the hotel The rooms are fitted with a plasma screen tv and mini bar There is also a railway near by  we went to agra for the day to see the taj mahal  its  hours on the express train or  hours on the normal locals train  we went on the express train to agra and returned on the locals train just for the experience  i would reccomend this  
P => Pleasantly surprised When I first started searching the net for a Delhi hotel I was horrified at the cost of accommodation  We definitely wanted to stay in or close to Connht Place because it is so central and position is very important   I realised I would have to pay a bit more than usual but searched for medium hotels  The Palace Heights looked ok and the photos on the hotel website were good  It said that the hotel had recently been re furbished  I realise now that this refurbishment is in preparation for the  Commonwealth Games  Took the plunge and booked  My husband and I were travellling with another couple and none of us were strangers to India so we were prepared for disappointment  Arrived at the airport and took a pre paid taxi  Remember to have the printed full address on hand to show the driver  Connht Place is divided into sections and its important for the driver to have the full address  We arrived and took the lift to reception  Looked allright clean and modern  Yes they were expecting us relief and we were shown to our rooms  Airconditioned modern and clean with flat screen television on the wall  The bathroom was compact ble and clean  There was no view from the window but yes the hotel passed our test  We ate at the restaurant and it was excellent  It was packed with locals which is always a huge recommendation  We stayed three nights and had no complaints  Then we left our heavy luggage there while we travelled in Rajasthan for a week  We returned for a final night luggage was safe and sound restaurant still great the staff always obliging  Breakfast was served in the restaurant and was ordered from the menu   nothing flash but certainly good  This is a good hotel and certainly fits the bill for those not wanting to pay  star Delhi prices but wanting pleasant surroundings cleanliness and a safe place to rest and of course position  
P => Great Hotel in the heart of New Delhi Hotel Palace Heights in New Delhi is a great hotel  We stayed there on two erate occasions during our trip to India and were pleased with both experiences  The hotel has been reated relatively recently  The rooms are very modern and sleek and most importantly clean  The room we got on our first night in Delhi was small but comfortable  The bathroom was clean and new and the water hot  On our second time around the room was bigger which was nice and equally clean and comfortable  It seems in Delhi that there are few options in the mid range budget   everything is either ridiculously expensive and luxurious or ridiculously cheap and disgusting  Hotel Palace Heights is right in the middle in terms of price and a wonderful bargain  It is in the heart of Connht Place too which is an excellent location  The attached restaurant Zaffran is delicious  The food is safe and clean and really excellent  The service matches the food and or  Like many places in India the menu shows no liquor or beer but it is available which you will no doubt be glad to know after any amount of time in India  The staff were kind and helpful  Highly recommended  
P => Lovely small hotel This is a very small and charming hotel situated very centrally in the buzz of Connht Place about  mins drive from the airport  It has been very recently refurbished to a high standard with modern and tasteful or  The staff were very friendly courteous and attentive throughout my  night stay  The room was not particularly large but had a big bed flat screen tv and immaculate ble bathroom with large shower  There is no view to speak of but that didnt bother me  The restaurant is also excellent serving very tasty and good value Indian food in pleasant surroundings with a good choice for breakfast not buffet  I found it very difficult to find a reasonably priced hotel in Delhi which looked any good and did not want to stay in the big chain hotels  This hotel fitted the bill perfectly   I can thoroughly recommend it to anyone  
P => Excellent hotel Palace heights is an excellent hotel at a great location  Close to the metro from where you can explore the whole city  Rooms are clean and everything works  Very nice and helpful staff  Really a great place to stay for peoplpe who want a save haven in a crazy city  Close to all the shops at Cannt place  
P => toll   aber     
P => Absoluter Geheimtipp  
P => 
P => Very friendly staff Convenient Location Stayed here with friends as a hub in and out of New Delhi  The hotel arranged car service tofrom the intl airport and tofrom the Taj Mahal the next morning  I definitely recommend this hotel as a stress free way of traveling around and intoout of Delhi   they took care of everything and were happy to assist  
P => Wonderful service clean rooms and well connected with local drivers This place is perfect if you are interested in keeping the costs down while also enjoying a clean and safe room  The frinedly and pleasant staff fulfilled all our requests and they arranged drivers and guides who took us to the Taj M  as well as to and from both the airport and the train station  The wokers at the hotel even gave us early morning warm Nescafe mocha drinks  If I ever make it back to Delhi I would for sure stay at the Hotel Pearl Plaza  
P => Great hotel   Clean  My boyfriend two friends and I stayed at this hotel for two nights  Prior to our trip I was emailing with a number of hotels in this neighborhood near the train station  Vishal from the Pearl Plaza was by far the most responsive  In advance he arranged for  A car to pick us up at the airport at am when our flight arrived  A car driver and guide for a day trip to Agra   Clean hotel rooms with plenty of bottled water We had a great experience  The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful  The prices for the hotel and all the additional services they arranged for us were also very reasonable  Happy travels 
P => Nice place reality of India will hit you in this neighbourhood We stayed at this hotel a few times  The rooms are OK  The linens are not spotless definitely had not been changed but this is normal for Indian hotelshostals unless you go to upscale places so bring your own if you wish  Also if you use the AC there is no blanket and it gets pretty cold  I had my sleeping bad  The first time we stayed the AC worked the whole time and the room was freezing  The next time the AC was turned off through the main switch downstairs so it got stuffy and hot  Complain and ask for a discount if this happens  Everything is negotiable in IndiaRickshaws and taxis are easily accessible the staff will even fetch you one if needed  Friendly safe hot water good price Located in Paharganj metro station Rama Krishna is min walk plenty of dirt and beggars so if your first time and day in India be prepared to be shocked  New Delhi railway station is super close and a ride with a rickshaw should be no more than   rupees  Nizamuddin is farther away  
P => Clean hotel reasonable prices We stayed at Pearl Plaza in Paharganj Delhi for  nights in the middle of    We got lost in Paharganj which is a big ket on our way there on the first day but on the second day we had no problems finding it anymore even at night Here is a sumy of our impressions from the Pearl Plaza positive  email communication with the hotel was very fast we made a reservation in advance  In Delhi making a reservation in advance is strongly reccomended as there are not so many good hotels and prices are quite high  very good price for double AC room no breakfast but breakfast could be booked extra for  Rs  p P     Rs including taxes   reasonable price for airport pick up    Rs for AC car  The Airport is quite far away from the city ca min drive  Prepaid taxis from the eirport are cheaper however   friendly staff  nice modern furniture  warm water  comfortable beds  clean linen  laundry and dry  cleaners service which was quite cheap Rs  p  piece of clothing and returns the laundry on the same day  free tea around the clock  TV and fridge  a lot of restaurants internet cafes and shopping possibilities all around negative  no internet  many rooms have no windows  ACs temperature is being controlled centrally by the reception staff  Thatswhy our room was quite cold when the AC was on  We even could not switch it off ourselves   no wardrobe in the room 
P => buona sistemazione e buon prezzo  
P => 
P => Ok if youre not expecting too much This place is ok but dont expect it to be perfect  Location is good  Its quite close to the metro and its very close to a nice shopping street  Its a bit in a building area so when we first arrived in the middle of the night it kind of scared me out  In the daylight it was a bit better though  Rooms are ok make sure you have one with windows the ones at the back are the most quiet  Place is quite clean for Delhi standards didnt see any bugs at least  Rooftop restaurant is nice they serve food thats quite ok breakfast is ok too  
P => Not a bad place to stay    After reading previous reviews of this property I was a little bit sceptical about how comfortable my stay would be  I stayed at the hotel twice during my first trip to India and found it to be good  The location is good close to a lot of shopping and the metro station and restaurants are not far away if you ask the hotel staff  The staff were extremely helpful the porters and reception staff were able to help us with any of our questions and booked taxis for us  As for the rooms they were clean and comfortable  Yes there is a wet bathroom   which is common in any part of Asia  We also ordered room service and the food was prompt fresh and tasty   the porters always rang the doorbell and waited for us to answer the door  It is a standard budget hotel in India and it was better than I expected   especially after reading other postings  
P => 
P => no complaints It was perfect  nice room cheap price and especially the staffs  we will definitely stay in this Hotel Prince International again  
P => Truly a great place Comfortable well priced and very clean  Nice staff and a good internet connection  They even pickup from the airport  Would stay here again  
P => A Real Bargain in Delhi This was my first time in India so I really didnt know quite what to expect  When my taxi pulled up in front of the hotel at  am I was exhausted and more than a little unsure of myself  As soon as I stepped inside the lobby the staffs attitudes immediately put me at ease  While the hotel is very close to the Karol Bagh ket it was surprisingly quiet and close to several nice restaurants like Alpha Spice Raffles great thali and Crossroads and about  minutes away from a Metro station   My room was clean and had hot and cold running water  Room service was very quick and the food basic and good  All in all I would heartily recommend Hotel Prince International 
P => 
P => I thought the Prince Polonia was an excellent hotel for the money I stayed at the hotel on two ends of a trip to Nepal and India in ust to early tember  I found the staff to be most accomodating and helpful  Ok some were obviously looking for tips but were in no way pushy about it  I was surprised at how good the breakfast was and I was even offered to have it delivered to my room  I found the room clean and comfortable and as a single woman traveler felt very safe there  I have stayed at various grades of hotels all over Delhi and plan to stay there on my next trip  Its location off the main street meant it wasnt as noisy as some  And I had a room right on the street  
P => Great location rooms and food  Delhi is a hard place to find good accommodation but Prince Polonia held its own for us  It is on a quiet street quiet by India standards but only seconds from all the hustle and bustle you need  The rooms are clean large and quiet worth paying a little extra for the deluxe try room  on the roof top  We didnt use the pool but nice to have the option and the rooftop restaurant was surprisingly good and a quiet retreat  No beer on sale but I think they will let you buy it and drink it on the roof  The hotel arranged a pick up from the airport for us at am which was a relief  
P => A good choice for central Delhi The hotel is central and the staff are helpful  We used the onsite travel service to organise a car and driver for a weeks trip to Agra and Jaipur   very good service and excellent drvier  The room we had was OK only but the rooftop restaurant was a bonus  The street was not quiet when we stayed there so Id pack earplugs just in case Would I stay here again Yes there are many many places that are a lot worse 
P => Mixed Bag Having stayed at the Prince Polonia on three erate occasions in the last two years and in three erate rooms I feel uniquely qualified to comment on the place The first time we stayed there around  months ago we had a good stay  The rooms were clean the location central the majority of the staff helpful and the food palatable Around a month ago we stayed and had a similar experience although it has to be said that the manager the son of the owner I believe is a miserable git to the extreme and has a habit of speaking to his staff as though they are scum At the end of our trip about a week ago we stayed again We had erate rooms this time because my partner wouldnt stop coughing  This time her room was terrible  It was very dirty and she found a cockroach running about  Whats more there was large rodent poo in the bathroom sink and on the bathroom floor  When I phoned reception they sent someone up who cleared it up and then claimed that the rat wouldnt be back   hmm  I insisted that she get another room and after some grumbling and shouting from the boss to his staff she made the switch  My room by contrast was very nice and only about US more had a big clean bathroom and good aircon and no rat poo or roaches In conclusion if youre going to stay here make sure you spend a little more and get a better room  Ignore the miserable manager wholl do his best to spoil your stay and instead talk to the nice older man his father and owner and the younger guy in the travel agency in reception who are friendly and helpful and booked us train tickets over the phone from the UK Oh and dont guarantee that the pool will have water in it it seems to change on a daily basis PPS visit the little family run shop over the road the kids are the greatest salesmen and youll walk away with stuff you didnt even know you wanted     
P => A good introduction to india This place was clean and the staff were helpful  Rooms are basic biut comfy with a tv and air con we had organised a pick up from the airport after arriving in Delhi quite late the staff on reception were great getting us fresh water and food on arrival we got locked out of the bathroom on the first morning but they quickly got a handy chap in to fix that The rooftop Restaurant is lovely breakfast is included in the price and there is a choice of indian or continental  The hotel is located near to the main bazaar and the train station you can get a rickshaw to connht place   beware though they will take you to emporiums unless you give them an exact location the travel person attached to the hotel was really helpful and arranged a trip to agra for us very quickly  free internet access is also a plus in this place  
P => Good one in a convenient area Had a super deluxe room which was comfortable and quiet enough for a good sleep and its pretty spacious  The staff were mostly helpful except for one missing wake up call so as the attached travel agent  Could help book train ticket which is much appreciated since it managed to get me one from Agra back to Delhi even the booking site I checked said its full A minor complaint is that the porter is constantly looking for help so as to get tips  
P => Good value in Parharganj Delhi hotels are generally pretty expensive and Parharganj is about the cheapest area to stay in   its also very handy for New Delhi railway station when you want to move on  My wife and I stayed here in ember  and paid rps about  USD for a double AC room with shower room and balcony overlooking street  Breakfast included  They provided airport pickup for rps Good clean room friendly helpful staff good rooftop restaurant  There are much cheaper plays to stay in Parharganj   but youd have to be on a very tight budget or desperate to want to stay in some of them  
P => A ne pas recommander  
P => 
P => Loved the Staffs I loved this hotel  it was perfect  nice room cheap price and especially the staffs  they were all very nice and very helpful  if i go back to new delhi i will definetely stay in this hotel again  its just the best hotel for the backpackers and for everyone  
P => Good location for New Delhi station  We only saw one room since it was the last one available  The room was pleasant enough although it was right next to reception and the front door and thus noisy  Delhi is a noisy city so always inspect a few rooms first  In this hotel the bathroom was dirty which prompted us to move down the road to Hotel Vivek check the reviewThe main reason you will end up on the Main bazaar in a hotel like this is because it s close to the New Delhi train station where you can catch the all important trains to Agra to see the Taj Mahal and Jaipur  Both trains leave early morning and this hotel is literally minutes away from the station  Incidentally go straight to the international ticket office on the st floor to buy these tickets  It opens am pm pm on Sundays and ignore the people that tell you it s closed downbeing reated and direct you to their friend sbrother s travel agent Staff were friendly enough and not that bothered when we told them we were moving outWe paid  rupees for a double room with AC and en suite bathroom  There was no breakfast included  
P => Budget but nice    stayed at hotel rak international twice recently whilst in delhi and liked it very much  its basic as are most budget hotels in the area but i love paharganj and its bussle and my room was quiet and clean  hotel itself is nothing special and youre not allowed to have guests in your room but think this makes for a peaceful stay which after a days walking around the madness of delhi is very welcome  
P => El personal es muy gracioso  
P => 
P => Perfect Hotel I had a nice stay in the hotel with my wife  A homely amp clean environment with prompt service was great  Staff was kind and helpful  People are friendly and helpful the area is quite centrally located with easy transportations  We had a nice stay and sweet memories  
P => Educated and Good Staff We stayed in two hotels in Delhi before picking up this hotel  Theworst about those hotels was the uneducated and useless staff  Here isthis hotel I found people with great knowledge  The Boss has travelledto  countries so far  Everybody was great  
P => Great service  Raunak Hotel is definitely one of the best hotels we have stayed at in new delhi India  The rooms is simple but large and clean  The room service and hotel staff is very friendly and helpful  The travel desk within the hotel is great  Location is OK 
P => Awesome and enjoyable trip The hotel is good positioned the staff is very friendly  Housekeeping Manager is really helpful all the staff members are really nice and helping  Even there travel desk is very helpful for they organized our trips  
P => Best Hotel and Good Service I stayed at the Raunak hotel in new delhi The property is beautiful  The rooms are modern and sleek  The flat screen TV is great although they could have probably invested in some satellite TV to give us more channels  I mentioned this and they gave me extra with no charge  The lobby bar is very nice I really enjoyed this hotel If they get the internet situation sorted out I would definitely stay there again  
P =>  Worth Recommending  If you don t want to spend more and want value for your money this hotel is worth staying  Best point is the location and informative staff 
P =>  luxury at budget price  We booked the hotel dirctlily via email  They did not charge any money for advance booking as ided and promised we were picked up from the airpot the reception boy welcome us with a smile we were give good room  The bed is really comfortable matress are so soft and good  We had a nice sleep  Room is big and clean  Breakfast were served nicely  I liked parta  There is a small travel desk here near restaurant which we approached to get information about city  We were impressed with there hospitality and booked our entire  month with them  It was an amazing holiday with a mix of train bus and car  This review is to thank them for their services  I recommend to everybody who want great travel at normal price  
P =>  Comfortable Trip  We booked from malasiya directly with the hotel on our friend s recommendation  We got a good rate  They sent a good taxi for pick up and same nice taxi to show us Agra and Jaipore  Rooms are clean laundry is sparking white  Staff is polite and helpful  We had a comfortable trip in india becouse of them  
P => Best of the Best Hotel Raunak We booked five rooms in hotel Raunak International in delhi  When they came to know riage anniversary  They organized our party for us and presented us with a beautiful chocolate cake  We enjoyed very much  Such a good hotel  We were feeling great  This place is lovely  This place is lovely rooms have everything you could desire and are very nicely orated and as clean as possible  The warm welcome from Staff adds a great touch and breakfast cooked to order was spot on  This place is faultless and having stayed there first time I wouldnt stay anywhere else when we are in delhi again  
P => Cheap Hotel Near New Delhi City Center We stayed Raunak International for four nights and it was our refuge from the busy streets of Kowloon  Despite being in a shopping restaurant and pub area our room was cozy and quiet  We had a room on the back side and had no street noise  We found the staff to be very attentive and pleasant always quick to open the door and greet our arrival and departure  The glass bathroom door is a bit odd but we were reading the newspaper and a real estate story profiled a luxury suite with all glass bathroom walls   be its more common in Delhi than we think The hotel is close to the New Delhi City Center to be an excellent base for our exploration 
P => St Service We stayed at the raunak hotel with my family during our recent visit to india  The hotel is very good location close to karol bagh metro station  Staff was always very friendly amp helpful and the rooms were clean good and a nice restaurant provides the best curry  We loved this hotel  The hotel is impressive with high ceiling and modern furnishings and very modern with a beautiful lobby it was our home for a total of  nights during our  week trip to India this winter

P => EXECELLENT AND REASONABLE HOTEL  CENTRALLY LOCATED very gud hotel  the owner of the hotel is friendly and helpful i loved my stay in india and specially in this hotel as it is very clean and serves good exotic indian food  it is located centrally so my time was not wasted and i booked my trip to agra and jaipur from this hotel itself  it turned out to be reasonable and the staff here was very helpful  I thank mr  singh for making my trip memorable 
P => nice hotel with friendly staff had an overall positive experience staying at this hotel  even though the bathrooms could use some reorating the rooms themselves were tidy and clean  staff was very helpful and friendly  we booked a tour through them to agra and jaipur and it everything was arranged perfectly  located in a vibrant neighbourhood near the metro station  
P => it was good one i had good service in raunak hotel all employment were very intelligent and helpful rooms were very clean they cleaned it every dayrestaurant was good with indian spicy food  i could have many choicesthe atmosphere there is relaxing and it was with good prices  
P => Specification Of Raunak Internatinal hotel By Farhad Hameed India is historical Place and good for enjoyment sightseeing and shopping  i have visited india before also but after i found raunak international hotel my coming to india and my trip is more enjoyable and easy for me  followings are positive points of the hotel Save and secure location  Near to Metro Station  Near to shopping centers  Beautiful and clean Rooms  Friendly Environment  Clean Restaurant with Delicious local and international foods  Highspeed Wifi Internet  Airport Packup and drop Wakeup services Prompt Room Service  Criedet Card service  Tour Services 
P => hotel from hell i email contact to stay with this hotel during   e with my partners as i look from the photos from the hotel website and its look not so bad but the first day i arrived the hotel it was nighte i wish i can show you a photo but i didnt take any photo from the hotel  the hotel stay in a seriously bad environment with construction dusty and noise pollution  when i arrive the hotel they got only  guests in the hotel and when i see the room  i was shock coz the hotel is actually under reating and its dusty everywhere you can put your finger on counter or floor they never clean it  the bedsheet got stain on it and its really dirty  teh floor never wipe with water and its dusty everywhere  they show me another room and its still the same  they call house keeping to clean the room and the house keeping guy wipe the floor by using his legs drag the wet towel on floor they doesnt have the view at all  when the guy try to open the curtain for me the whole curtain fell down i was really upset and tired and i tell the them that i can accept this and i want to move the hotel  they charge me  night for RS  even i didnt stay and its all because of they try to fake people and lie to sell dirty hotel that under reating in constraction area  they also charge me taxi pick up from airport for RS  which at the front of their website said provide free pick up from airport and they charge us another RS  to get our from their hotel to somewhere else i seriously upset and speechless from this hotel  i been travel many countries and never see anything like this before  it was nighte and disgusting  you will never ever see anything worst than this  
P => I feel cheated As other reviewers have said the website photos are a lie  Our room was tiny and had no windows  I paid  a night for the quotexecutive roomquot a big discount of their published rates and got what is worth more like night in Delhi  The staff lied about our train tickets being confirmed then finally said there was no reservation possible so they could try to force us into renting their car tour to Agra  The price for local sightseeing is also apparently dependent on how much they think they can get out of you  Each staff member we asked had a different answer  Staffs English is poor  Several times during our stay there was no water and so the toilet wouldnt flush  The location of this hotel is OK better atmosphere than Paharganj but still lots of touts and insistent beggars  
P => Great Place I had a great time staying at this hotel  Started my travels through India with ease and I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends 
P => A home away from home We stayed in this hotel for  days  We enjoyed very much  The staff is friendly and very helpful  The manager and his team are great always working with the intent of making our stay a very pleasant one  Very well organized  A very good place to stay  A home away from home  
P => The best Hotel in Delhi very clean  hot water  Tanks definitive the best  The best Hotel in Delhi very clean  hot water TV in English The food and the service was very goodFor sure if i recomended Raunak International if yoyu need excelent hote and good price Absolutely the best hotel in Delhi TanksAdriana Mexico 
P => Exceptional service with friendly helpful staff   good place to return The hotel is located in Karol Bagh close to the Metro station Rs  to Counht Place Rs  to Central Secretariat  The hotel is clean with friendly staff and an owner Mr Singh that really takes care of a personal interest in the needs of his guests  We met many fellow travellers from the USA England and other places in the world For a budget hotel the price is reasonable the room we stayed in was clean with a shower and hot water just let the reception know about an hour you get in the shower  The linen and towels are changed everyday when the room is cleaned  The staff are really helpful in everyway and all speak English very well all with qualifications in Hotel Management  Karol Bagh is a good shopping location busy day and night  We booked for  nights and Im glad we did  There is a McDonalds located on the main street and a Pizza hut down the same road   I would recommend Vishals on the same road if you cannot manage to bargain with the vendorsTips  Make sure you have lower denomination Rupees Rs s Rs s Rs s in your  pursewallet   If you stay longer than  days in the hotel buy the five litre water Rs  with a Rs   deposit returned to you when you return the bottle  The fridge in the hotel cools it and  often makes ice  Transfer this water into you litre water bottle   in the long run it works  out cheaper  
P => good hotel for indian standard According to the price we paid the hotel was very good  At first we booked a room in raunak plaza which was near a construction site and very noise  The hotel manager offered us a new room at the raunak international hotel  streets further  The room was very nice not small and clean  The hotel stuff was friendly and especially the managers assistant helped us a lot with booking travelling plans shopping and other useful hints The area is close to the center with a metro station and lots of shops nearby  It doesnt look like areas in western cities but it is a good place to stay in delhi 
P => The ideal place to relax after the journey  We felt like at home threre  The owner is very friendly and hospitable  We were pleseantly surprised when he offered us showers and a place to rest before going to the airoport  we checked out few hours ago  The hotel is located in a lively neighbourhood with a lot of good restaurants kets and all a backpacker needs  The hotel has got the Internet hot spot 
P => Avoid this hotel  The pictures you see on the web are misleading  They appear to be dored by a computer  They failed to pick me up at the airport leaving me stranded after midnight  When I called them they claimed quotthe car broke down on the wayquot which was a lie  The staff spoke very bad English and had great difficulty understanding me  Hot water was only available for a few hours in the morning and had to be requested if they can understand you at other times  Most of the electrical outlets in my room did not work  Their solution was to bring me a powerstrip to plug into the one working outlet  The exhaust fan didnt work in the bathroom and the armoire smelled of mold  There is no hotel safe you must trust the staff with you valuables  The staff demands tips and will inflate the price  There is no true money exchange at the hotel  They were unable to make change for small bills  I couldnt get them to call me a taxi instead they offered their quothotel taxiquot for double the price of an ordinary taxi  I had to go walking and find a taxi on the street  The hotel is located in a dirty alley  Even the taxi drivers have trouble finding it  The area is full of beggars and touts  This is not a  star hotel  
P => El trato lo peor  
P => d cue  
P => Super geweldig  
P => Excelente hotel con excelentes servicios  
P => m daille dor de la salet   
P => nice place    my frnds booked this place for me as i hv been living in Petersburg since last  yrs  took time off to meet my frnds here  stayed here for  nights before shifting to my frnds place  i zstayed all alone here but found it very comfortable  everything the t v  gyser nd ac  all worked fine  the breakfast buffet was grand and offered me many options  overall a nice place the ket around is pretty good  nice place to shop  the staff bell boy and rest too were ever smiling    keep it up people   nice and quiet place in the lively ket     
P => made my function memorable    i had my engagement on th of   and the arrangements were made by regent continental in their hall  this is just to thank the hotel on a whole on this public wall    most of our guestsrelatives arrived from punjab and canada so we all booked this hotel for  nights and their banquet for the functn    they made excellent arrangements for everything at the function  we even changed the colour theme of the oration a night before to match it with my dress and expected the staff to show reluctance but they all took it very sportingly  we enjoyed alot a night before and all thanks to these people they made sitting arrangement for all of our extended family and us to play games in the night in their banquet hall and that too complimentary  whole night we all kept odering snacks  tea and all and the service throughout was excellent thanks to all 
P => really very poor value stayed here on our tour of northen india by far the worst hotel rooms were very small and dated  I dont know where the room photoswere taken but our rooms were nothing like those in the photos service and food were very poor and breakfast was worrying as food was keptwell warm  overall we were very disappionted with both rooms and location  
P => Clean and well located The Hotel is well maintaines with clean hygenic rooms  Located in the centre of Karol Bagh close to the Delhi Metro station which makes moving about easier and fast  
P =>  We were impressed   I travelled with my partner and dhter in ch  We toured Northern India during ch and as we arrived in Delhi and stayed at theRegent Continental Hotel located in Karol Bagh area of the city  As we were travelling South eg AgraMaturaGwalior and Orchha and then returning to travel north to Mussourie in Himalayas  we used Regent Continental Hotel as transit base for our travels  We ended up staying  nights at the Hotel Hotel offers three types rooms SilverGold or Platinum  We were shown all types of rooms but we were allocated Platinum class room    amp The room was spacious and accomodated  of us very easily  The furnshing was of avery high quality  The lighting was well co ordinated and everything worked egAC TV satalite Fridge Safe etcThe room was very clean and room service provided was of   standard andComplementary bottles of Mineral water for guests and various free  bees were providedin Bathroom incase one forgets pack the basics eg tooth brushpastecombshaving gear shampoos etc  These were replaced each dayThe hotel is located in a very narrow street in Karol Bagh area of Delhi  An area known forits its Shopping and maze of conjested lanes with s of small hotels  If one is travelling to India or Karol Bagh for the first time then the street leading toHotel will appear dirty unpleasing and not so welcoming but once you get into theHotel you will be won over by the welcoming staff  I do not mention names of individuals when I do a review but I was hightly impressedby  individuals   Those were Mr  Anshu Bhatia Reservations Manager for hisproffesional service and prompt responses to our requests Mr  Shakhar Chandre Reception Manager for all his dealing with us eg unlocking the safe when we forgot our personal codes  safekeeping of our luggage in storage when travellinfg South to Northand finally Mr Yashdev Malhotra  Room Services  It is worth contacting them if you have any problems The Hotel in our view was of good value and it gives likes of YWCAs and YMCA International House in Delhi run for its money as it can be cheaper and room quality and service is much better Hotel has an independent Tour and Travel organisers on site and it seems thatprices charged by them are bit expensive and one has to be careful and it is easier to shop around for best deals with other agents in Karol Bagh area  You will have no problem in finding oneThe restaurant in the hotel is ok  The furnishing and lighting is pleasing but themenu can be improved  The breakfast is provided in a Buffet form and bothContinental and local dishes are available  The hotel restaurant is busy the mornings when large tour company clients are often staying there The Karol Bagh area does have several eateries within walking distance from HotelThose of us who get fed up after some time with curries and one can walk down few street to MacDonalds or Pizza Hut for a respite  I have stayed in several hotels in Delhi during my travels and i think this is one of the better ones It is a    hotel with   service  Our experience was postive and we would definately stay there again and I would recommend it to friendscolleaguesfellow travellers 
P => Better than expected I stayed in this hotel with  colleagues for a week in tember  I had read the reviews before hand and I was dreading the experience We arrived after midnight and the neighbourhood was scattered with garbage and wandering cows  We had a voucher and after just signing the hotel book no other formalities we were shown to our rooms on st floor  We each had standard single room which appeared to have been remodelled not long ago  White ble floors ceiling fan two beds pushed together desk with a tv small sitting area and very loud AC stuck to the wall  The room looked nice but lacked finishing  The bathroom had a shower with no curtain and modern looking wash basin with too small fauset  No real amenities except a shower cap  bars of soap and shampoo  Though the bathroom was quotnewquot there were small gaps in the grouting and everything looked worn and done in haste The bed was very hard but the pillows were new and soft as well as the pillow covers  Other linen were greyish and many times washed  No duvet but a woollen blanket The room had a window facing inner courtyard and noises from other houses were heard quite easily  As mentioned in other reviews the hotel is quite noisy because of ble flooring in corridoors and distant phone ringing every night  There is gap under the room door so every sound can be heard inside the room  Also other guests vere talking loudly when returning in the middle of the night  The AC unit is very loud but it does cover other noises if you can stand the humming Second night when returning to the hotel and turning the lights on cockroaches were running around  Same happenend couple of times during the week but the roaches were not disturbing and only a few  When talking to others the roaches were not seen in every room  There was lot of personel in the hotel and young boys cleaning the corridoors and carrying the luggage  And waiting for tips of course  The hotel has a desk where to hire a car for a day or for trips but be aware of high prices and be ready to bargain hard Breakfast was not very good  Instant coffee sometimes toast red jam couple of Indian dishes omeletssweetened mango juice if you were lucky  All the food was lukewarm so be quick to grab the hot omelets when brought in or the hot toast  Two bottles of water were supplied to the room every day and not charged extra The hotel is situated in the middle of Karol Bagh ket district which means little quotshopsquot for locals lot of garbage noice and people  Beggars will spot you right on when you walk out of the hotel  Easiest way to move is to hire a car or get a tuk tuk to the city center or riksha to the Karol Bagh metro station  When raining the streets are filled with muddy holes and floating garbage  All in all not as bad as expected  
P => Low Average beware of the limitations I visited the hotel to meet someone who was there I had also read the reviews posted here previously on the same hotel when I was looking for a place The Lobby Area looks empty  As indicated by another visitor on this site they  advise visitors to take theirquot taxi service  The Taxi Service is run by a arate unit In the lobby and the hotel staff do not coordinate with this unit in a satisfactory manner  i e  telling the tourists to go and speak to them and totally disallowing responsibility for that aspect  I also noticed that their drivers  not Speak Any English too  So make sure you check that before you get them for a hire  For anyone with a limited budget and looking for a budget hotel this be ok and the staff are helpful all right  Note that the area around the hotel can be a bit crowded  The area around outside the hotel is poorly illuminated  
P => So so Its not a   for certain  Breakfast is a typical indian breakfast  we got food poisoning whilst here but that could have been what we ate out  you never know when we came ill the stafF were very helpful and friendly with great service  the rooms are spacious with airt con but this is very noisey  in a ent location very bustling would not go again  
P => Disgraceful Checked in stayed for an hour then checked out again  This hotel was worse than my dog kennel  Check in staff were rude  The whole reception area had an uncomfortable feel about it  The bathroom had no running water there was scum mould and anything else which was vile growing on the bath and tiles  The coridoors were dark and dingy  It was truely appaling  Sleep in a cardboard box on the street instead of staying here it will be cleaner 
P => It is what it is    My wife and I stayed here last month for  nights  The rooms are not great the bathrooms are awful but we spent minimal time in our room and only stayed in our room to sleep  There are much better options in New Delhi however they are way more expensive  I probably would not stay there again and it definately is not a  star hotel  
P => Loved the Regent My room was large open and spacious with a balcony refrigerator large beds and a nice large bath room  The hotel staff went out of their way to be accommodating and all were so kind and friendly  There is a travel desk in the lobby and Mr  Ahmed will do everything from make your plane or train reservations to arrange tours or just get a car and driver to take you shopping  There is a lovely gift shop in the large white ble lobby  The restaurant serves a good complimentary breakfast and has a nice menu of Chinese and Indian foods  Mineral water is available there also  There was never a problem of running out of hot water for showers at any time of the day or night and the hotel has a good back up system for the frequent power failures  Their laundry service is fast and efficient  Room service is available  hours a day and food is reasonably priced  This was my first trip to Delhi but if I have an opportunity to return it will definitely be to the same place  I spent  days there and would recommend the Hotel Regent Continental to anyone  I would also like to thank each member of the staff for making my stay in India so very enjoyable  
P => Pesimo Tanto En Habitaciones Como En El Personal  
P => Entt uschend  
P => F r indische Verh ltnisse nicht schlecht  
P => moyenement propre mais cher  
P => Demi tour  
P => 
P => Good value for money First impression wasnt good as the ac tv  gyser and bathroom lights of the room i was given wasnt working  however when i complained about that the staff at the front desk acknowledged it and told me that they were aware of it and offered another room to me as soon as one was available  However they fixed it within an hour  Apart from that there was no problem  we booked taxis and delhi sight seeing through the hotels tarvel desk which was fantastic  The room was very spacious and clean and was made every day by the house keeping staffs  Very friendly staff who would always be there to attend to your needs  Very handy location  Would love to stay there again  
P => excellent service with very polite staff If requiring any services please ask the staff as they can point you in any direction whether it be leather fabric they will help you  Transport to where ever organized efficiently and on time  
P => good hotel good service lokality ok taking well care about guest coming carrying luggage  not begging for tipBreakfast could become better with some fruit as well  Mr Chauhan at the frontdesk is ok helpfull and organizing whats needed  
P => So so but location is good I booked this via hotels com for rs a night inclusive of tax  reception was very dowdy felt like a step back to late s  check in was prompt and they had their own scanner so they can take copies of my passport straightaway room itself was fairly small just about fit the double bed  it had a kettle and some mugs but i didnt use them  AC was clunky but worked  bathroom had a vent in it which was fairly noisy  linen felt clean and bed was comfortable  overall nothing to shout about but it will do given the location and the price  the basement restaurant served breakfast boiled eggs toast with butter and jam cornflakes tea and coffee  there was also chapati  i would suggest having breakfast to go as the restaurant is quite dismal with a leaky pipe and general air of tiredness there is a lift in the building and it works fine  There is a restaurant opposite which does good quality indian fare at a reasonable price all in air conditioned and dim light ambience  
P => Very pleasant environment with excellent service and accommodation This hotel was a good fit for my son and I  We arrived at  am after being picked up at the airport  Excellent breakfast  Kind and skilled staff  Manager helped us chart our trip  Clean and large quiet room  I recommend this hotel for your next trip to Dehli  
P => Good Location I stayed at Hotel Royal Holidays for three nights and i found the hotel very nice  the hotel has excellent staff who takes good care of you and they make sure that you get everything on time  the most significant thing about the hotel is its close proximity to the metro station and the restaurant is just opposite to the hotel   and the karol bagh ket is just  mins walk from the hotel     
P => paradise for japanse tourist in new delhi cheap and best this hotel is good hotelbathtoiletbed clean good sleeping very safety hotel staff very honest i recomend to all japanase tourist student or family visit here very cheap and good hotel my name is Kenichi Hisae email address japanboy yahoo com 
P => Excellent hello my name Fermin and I am resident of England I am retired Physician  I came India for holidays and stayed in Hotel Royal Holidays  It is very close to the centre and the main thing the ket is very close to the hotel  I am passing some holidays in new Delhi and i want to say something have been very pleasant and the company that myself this representing and the hotel where I lodge of the same signs they are excellent and very dependable the parts where there I am visited they provided me a wonderful service  All the personnel as the chauffeurs administration and employees in general are of first That they grasp that the stay be but of armonia and pleasant in the personal thing them bearing a grudge because not alone came visited but also the same country and every world satisfied by its services  The company of the one that I mention is ABYSS TOURS AND My representative is Mr ARIF  I can recommend this to everyone because they are trust worthy and generous  
P => love staff people I stayed in this hotel in the month of e with my wife well i booked online and use there free pickup services in the begining i was not sure about my booking and free pickup but defeintly everything works very well and really ended up to stay there four nights i lov ethe people there services staff and more everybody is very honest and sinceralso i use there travel services was really pleased for everythingi wouldl receomnd thsi hotel for any type of Tourist 
P => Do not choose this hotel I agree with bad responses  Besides eive with payment  Have reserved and have paid for other hotel and have lodged in this and have forced to pay the second time  Do not contact siativ com and a travel agent Arif who works with this hotel  
P => Great staff great location We had a really nice stay at Hotel Royal Holidays  The hotel staff there was very kind   especially the front desk and housekeeping staff  We just asked for anything we needed   towels extra pillows toilet paper   and they were quick to attend to our requests There is a great restaurant directly across the street   Dana Choga  I highly recommend this place  Great food and service and the prices were reasonable   rupees for  The hotel is just a block away from tons of shopping in Karol Bagh  Youre also a short taxi or metro ride from Connht Place many restaurants and shops there The room was clean and the bed was comfortable  
P => A good deal I booked this hotel through the Thank You Points website after reading some posiitive reviews in Trip Advisor  A couple of weeks before I went to Delhi I read some negative reviews and was very concerned  When my family and I arrived there late in in the night I was pleasantly surprised of the location and cleanliness of the Hotel  The staff were very courteous and the room was clean and sufficiently equiped  The following morning we were served with a good breakfast in our room  Our stay of  nights was very comfortable and as we were interested in shopping the shopping area was down the street from the Hotel  Karol Bagh is the best place for bargain hunters  I will most certainly recomend this hotel to anyone looking for a ently priced hotel with breakfast located in a central area in Delhi  
P => Comfrotable and Clean Hotel Royal Holidays is a clean and very confortable hotel  It has spacious rooms and clean bathrooms  The service here is excellent   For the price we paid we got a really good deal as in running hot water clean bathrooms and excellent services compared to some overpriced hotels  The rooms include tv and fridge which are handy  overall we are very hapy with the hotel as the staff put our comfort first  
P => Dump Hotel Useless staff This Hotel is a fake we booked here because it was th on the ranking and when I think about the horrible night we passed there I cannot understand how can has that score  I even thought that they have written the reviews themselves or using friends  But at the end of the day   for a couple one night you get what you pay a dump place  The staff is completely useless with no manners at all and since you step into the hotel no matter about your long flight they start trying to con you with all sort of crap deals    Our room was facing to the street and there are works in progress in front of the hotel  hours and I mean  hours the whole night listening to hammers saws people shouting etc    The air con when you look at it you turn it off as you think you are going to die if you breath that air coming through that dirt and mud equipment  The painting of the walls coming off the shower well better to say the water drops coming out of it there is no pressure   We checked out early next morning as we had to take a train to Jaipur and there were people sleeping on the stairs the guy of the reception on the sofa at the entrance we had to wake him up to check out     Rest of food on the corridors     to be honest for a few quid more get to somewhere else and save your self that sort of entry to India The good things are the area which is excellent with a ket full of bargains the metro station which is just around the corner plenty of agencies plenty of auto rickshaws cycle rickshaws etc    Karol Bagh is a very safe area to walk at day or night although at night in India there is not much to do  So I would not hang around too much   There is a free airport pick up service but this is standard now in most hotels if you book trough expedia etc I recommend contact the hotel directy trough their web site for this service  But as I said this is provided by any Hotel  After our first night in this dumped place we ided that our next hotel in delhi was the clarck international which is more expensive but is on the same area the food is excellent the staff is very professional and helpful and it is worth it after the busy days on the city the crowded metros the kets etc     
P => Nice Stay excellent service Was in Delhi just a week ago  Stayed at Royal Holidays Hotel in Karol Bagh New Delhi  The Hotel is neat tidy and clean and theservice was excellent  The staff are very friendly and very helpful  was met with eager smiling faces and immediate attention was given to all my requests  Tour company recommended the hotel and was very helpful in arranging my very short trip at a very short notice  The hotel is central to Delhi and the shopping is just within walking distance  There is a medical centre just next door and lots of restaurants nearby  Rooms are big and affordable even for a budget traveller  Internet is also available so I did not have to go out looking for internet cafe I would stay there again if I go back to Delhi  
P => Great Option for Delhi We stayed in this hotel on our way out of Delhi after having had a bad experience at a place in the Pahar Ganj area of Delhi  I am so glad we found this place This hotel is located in a quiet section of the city a   auto rickshaw ride from everywhere  There is also a metro station about  blocks away  There are many restaurants and shops within a block or two  The service is quite good and the staff is very helpful and accommodating  I realize that there are not many good mid range options in Delhi but this place is great  I seriously have no complaints about this place  I would recommend the Hotel Royal Holidays to anyone who does not want to stay in a rock bottom backpacker type place  
P => Friendly comfortable hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Royal Holidays a total of  nights  at the beginning of our trip and  near the end and we had no problems there whatsoever  The rooms are clean with huge beds private bathroom with shower and television including towels and sheets  We paid  Dollars per night with breakfast and airport pick up included  Also they have Internet available for guests in lobby extra charge but very cheap  The staff are very friendly and help with any queries  They helped us organise the first part of our trip they have links with a travel agency just down the road from the hotel which was reasonable priced  The staff even let us leave our luggage at the hotel on our last day when we hadnt even stayed there our last night so they are just really helpful and friendly people The area where the hotel is located Karol Bagh can be a bit of a shock at first old buildings crowded but that is just Delhi Also there is a really good ket just round the corner from the hotel which is great for buying souvenirs and pretty much anything There are caf s and restaurants nearby too just  min walk away The metro station is just a  min walk from the hotel Karol Bagh stop which is  stops from Connht Place so its very conveniently located I have no bad things to say about this hotel as overall it was a great place to stayNicola M amp David C 
P => Our first experience in New Delhi We are two girls from sweden that has stayed in the royal holidays hotel in new delhi  We first stayed for  night and then a week later we stayed for another  nights  Our experience so far has been very good  The room is comfortable and the service is really nice  The reception has helped us with what we need  Tack for en trevlig vistelse och en intressant forsta natt Thank you best regards Frida Tortela amp Elena Grahn moller

P => Loved The Rooms This Hotel is always my choice when ever I have to stay very near to the Airport  The Rooms are so well managed that I love to stay in them  the working staff is alsr really good and so good is the food there  I would recommend you all that if you are looking for a budget hotel then do visit this place  This is worth everything and you will also get good amount of corporate discounts  
P => Grear Hotel If you want to have a meeting close to airport Hotel Shanti palace is the right choice  Its has nice big rooms and tasty restaurent Though its a bit expensive but its worth to sat there I stayed there for  nights it was a pleasent stay for me  
P => Average for the price This is an OK place to stay if you need to be near the airport but that is probably the only positive thing to say about its location  The hotel overlooks a busy flyover route into Delhi and the area around the hotel is particularly grotty and nondescript should you be thinking of taking an evening stroll  We would not recommend staying here for any other reason than to be close to the airport  The hotel is st and nicely orated  Our room was clean and well furnished and we had a bath as well as a shower  On pulling back the curtains we found a wall about ft away from the window so no panorama  Hotels in Delhi seem not to see windows as a priority so we werent particularly surprised  On balance we would recommend stay here for the airport but not for any other reason  Its a long way from the centre of Delhi and the general area is not particularly nice  Once inside the Hotel is is quite nice and has a ent barrestaurant with albeit far more waiters and floor managers than are actually needed  This hotel cost us Rs per night about    This is about three or four times the cost of hotels in the Paharganj area and although the rooms were a lot better we couldnt really say it was great value  There dont seem to be any mid range hotels in Delhi though and if you want something of a ent standard and dont want to pay  a night then this is not a bad option  
P => Shanti Palace    Surprisingly Nice Shanti Palace is a great hotel if you just need a place to sleep for a night or two  With my husband being from India we were shocked to see hotel prices in Delhi between  and  USD a Night This place was recommended to us by family member and for about  USD per night we were pleasantly surprised  It is located less than  minutes from the airport with optional driver pick up service for about  rupees one way not including a tip  The room was incredibly clean and comfortable for  people and we had the option between twin beds or a king  The room was completely granite including the floors bathroom and counter tops and it came equipt with a mini fridge as well as a flat screen TV  There is also a high speed fan in the room as well as AC  Breakfast is included at the Tripti Restaurant amp Bar downstairs and lunch is affordable  Beware if you want to purchase alcohol you must be over the age of   There is also travel agent located in the lobby who can help you arrange transportation back to the airport if need be  The only complaint we would have had was that the only view your window in the room might have is of pipes or an enclosed stairway  However after more than  hours of traveling we didnt care about a view  All we wanted was a nice hot shower and a place to lay our heads  
P => Outstanding experience with the Shanti Palace A delayed connecting flight made us miss a  AM flight from the Delhi Airport  We stayed in the Shanti Palace for  nights and were very pleased with the hotel  Our room seems to have been recently reated and was extremely clean and well appointed  Beautiful bathroom excellent room service and the entire staff was very helpful  Breakfast is included in the room price and the buffet was acceptable  At  per night we thought we received good value for our money  
P => A Good Place for Business Travellers I cannot agree with some bad comments made on this Hotel  Although the Hotel is located in quotmiddle of nowherequot the facilities offered are reasonable for Business travellers  The views out of the window  not be a worry for such travellers  I surly cannot agree with the comment regarding the rudeness of the staff who in my opinion were very courteous  I would have wished for few more choices in the breakfast menu  
P => Below average hotel I stayed a single night at the Shanti Palace and found the hotel to be a very poor hotel  First and foremost the hotel is outdated  To register for a room you must sign a registration book that is straight out of the th century  Second the doors lock with a latch that you find on your outdoor fence  The single beds are extremely small  If your over  feet m then youre probably too big for the beds  The rooms are not clean at all  I would never return to this hotel 
P => Unbelievable rude  Food poisoning  Tiny very dirty rooms  Avoid This is a hotel in the middle of nowhere next to the airportabout   kms   miles  The staff is extremely rude  Therooms are very small and are facing a wall  Literally theresa wall about m in front of ALL the rooms windows  Thereception staff is not only rude but also over price each andevery item they can   e g  hotel airport ride they charged usUSD the street price was about USD  The restaurant in thehotel is extremely expensive roughly  times the normal New Delhi prices  Some people with us got food poisoningfrom that food the second day  They stayed inside for  daysjust to recover  There is literally NOTHING close to this hotel Just avoid it please if you have a chance  On the other handI am not sure if you can get much better in Delhi in general However for about USD  roughly USD  more than Shanti Palace if you want to fork out that much the hyatt isok has free wireless etc  A friend of ours stayed there  
P => 
P => Not bad The best thing about hotel Singh Sahib is its location very near to the Karol Bagh main ket and metro station  This was my only criteria to book this hotel Apart from location this place has nothing much to offer  The staff was untrained and sounded a bit fishy  The rooms were small and bathroom even smaller  Its located in a semi residential area and initially I had problems in locating the place  This place is only recommended for individual stay for   days in Delhi  
P => Ideal location in KarolBagh with posh Interiors About the Hotel  I got to know about this hotel through my freinds who had stayed there before  I was looking for an ideal place to stay thats not too expensive within K INR per double room and at the same time nearby shopping areas of Delhi  Rooms with good interirors are always my choice when it comes to staying with family  This hotel excelled my expectations interms of interiors Location  This is very near to the famous Karol Bagh ket  Its a five minute walk to the shopping area  The hotel is located in a nearby side lane thats not too posh  The metro station is about  minute walk or rs  by auto  Food  The room service did take sometime but the food was of good quality  There is NO complimentary breakfast in this hotel  Service  The room boys had a smile on them when they attended to us and the reception desk was always ready to offer help  I would say that overall they were very helpful and courteous In a nutshell If you travelling with family or on business and looking for a hotel with excellant interiors and a convenient location  then this hotel will be one of my recommendations    
P => Stay somewhere else By the second night we were calling this the quotHotel Suck Sahib quot Its dirty its noisy and its located in a crappy area with nothing interesting to do and a long tuk tuk ride between you and anything worthwhile  After every excursion we had trouble getting back to the hotel because none of the tuk tuk drivers could find it even with the hotels card and map  It took an average of four stops for directions to actually find the place If you absolutely must stay here at all costs avoid room T   Its on the top floor and shares a wall with the kitchen which means you will hear chopping clanging and crashing all night long in addition to the loud voices and radio of the kitchen staff  Its ginally quieter on other floors unless the staff starts moving furniture at  am which happened during our stay but the rooms are still dirty and uncomfortable  If youre going to stay in a crummy budget hotel at least make it somewhere more conveniently located than this dump  
P => Not bad could be better We stayed in the hotel for  nights in ember  The hotel is a midrange hotel  paid Rs    Our room was clean and spacious enough to accomodate our family of two adults and one child on the bed although we thought the bed could have been a bit longer to accomodate our feet as well     and had room for an extra bed  The bathroom was clean and had running hot water a necessity during this part of the year in Delhi  They were willing to provide in room service for the items on their menu while the in house restaurant was being planned  We had breakfast in the Bikanerwala Angan restaurant nearby and ate a very reasonably priced fresh local Indian meal   There was also a good travel agent in the neighborhood from whom we hired a taxi for local Delhi sightseeing for a day Pros Courteous staff good location clean room and bathroom Cons Very poor noise insulation from our hotel rooms on the first and second floor could hear noise in the corridor and the reception which is why I am rating this hotel average 
P => 
P => Cold Delhi Stayed for  days very cold outside  degress and inside  could not pay with creditcards  only cash bad exchangerates  very noisy at the room from the other guest and staff  
P => Good hotel fo Delhi I stayed here at the start and end of a tour  I was expecting the worst after reading some of the reviews but gladly I had a pleasant stay  The hotel is clean and quiet and the staff are professional  The buffet breakfast is not bad by Indian standards  The location is good you can walk to Karol Bagh main street and Metro station in  mins  I stayed in another hotel in Karol Bagh and had a terrible experience so I would recommend Singh Sons  
P => Good midrange option in good location Singh Sons is tucked down as side street in a quiter part of Karol Bagh  The lobby is airy cool and clean with lots of ble and the staff welcoming  The room was a reasonable size and the bathroom was clean and tidy  No window views but this is Delhi One reviewer complained about the short beds   well Id agree but I am  m and the beds are probably m wide so there are ways round the problem  Mattress was definitely firm  Breakfast room was bearable but really needs some money spending on it  Breakfast was OK  Being in Karol Bagh the main ket is only a few minutes walk away and is a great place to shop   real shops many with fixed prices as well as the street traders  Certainly not as intimidating for Western tourists asthe local street kets  
P => Rooms are ok Attitudeservice is horrendous I stayed here as part of an organized tour  The rooms themselves are fine by Indian standards   the hot water problems and electricity issues described by other travelers are typical for the country  The attitude of the front desk staff however is not fine by any standard  The staff is rude at best  After speaking with the other members of my group a very relaxed and flexible bunch nearly all of us had been barked at or scammed during our stay They pulled the credit card machine deal with me as well forcing me to pay in cash for my first night before the organized tour at a rate by the way that was almost triple what others were paying  Do NOT email the hotel for a room quote they will not give you an accurate price I had organized a hotel transfer through the hotel  I arrived at nearly midnight to the Delhi airport and after waiting for over  mins and being unable to find my transfer I found another cab  When I arrived at the hotel the staff quotwelcomedquot me by yelling at me saying that my cab was at the airport and I would have to pay for it  I politely refused  After showing me to my room a hotel manager called at  AM to tell me AGAIN that I would have to pay for the cab  I refused  Upon check out the staff AGAIN tried to charge me for the unused transfer and I refused again As I said while the rooms are acceptable I cannot recommend a hotel that treats tourists like walking dollar signs  Go elsewhere there are better options 
P => Basic cityhotel with an annoying breakfast policy Basic city hotel  Stayed here three times with two rooms as Delhi was the returning point of our trip  Rooms are fairly clean and quiet but theres almost everytime a problem with the facilities even for Indian standards Non flushing toilets broken airco etc  They have an impossible breakfast policy  You get an unsollicited wakeup call at  Great We arrived at  AM after a late flight At  the breakfast buffet attempt stops  The breakfast is lousy  Toast and flakes Indian ommelette and bananas  Thats it  After the third day we ided to take a Tuk tuk to the Costa Coffee at Connhts  A bit adent but a great treatAvoid the internet service  It has the speed of a snail at a stiff rate and as the printer is also used for copying your PC will hang up half way your email Location Karol Bagh is great Nice ket and huge variety of shops at only  metres 
P => ok but could do a lot better My wife and I stayed at Singh Sons as part of a tailor made tour with On The Go India  The hotel is in the Karol Bagh suburb of New Delhi  There are quite a few mid range tourist type hotels in the area with Singh Sons being the stest looking of the  or  I spotted  We were told by a tour guide that the area grew from a refugee colony but im not sure how true this is  Other reviewers have commented that they did not feel safe in the area  I did not notice this some parts of Karol Bagh are scruffy but for central Delhi a lot of it is fairly st  I would have been a bit wary of walking anywhere at night though  For some reason no taxi or auto rickshaw drivers were willing to take us to Connht Place from here  We never worked out why this was but it didn t matter too much as Karol Bagh Station is a ten minute walk or  minute rickshaw ride away and from there you can get the new and very efficient metro  When you venture out do make sure you have the hotels exact address and preferably a ent map as we found that no drivers had heard of it and had a lot of difficulty working out how to get back at night The hotel itself seems quite modern from the outside and the reception area is very st all in ble  The bedrooms are not so st though  We were first given a standard double room which was clean but shabby and very gloomy  the windows in all of the rooms are small and mostly covered up by air conditioning units  We asked to look at bigger rooms and ended up paying extra for a suite which was well worth it for the extra space and a bigger bed  I think the hotel is in the process of re orating the rooms so hopefully this will brighten the place up a bit  The air con worked well which was very welcome and the shower was ok although you had to call reception to request hot water  minutes before you used it  Free wi fi was very useful As with most places in Delhi traffic noise is horrendous so pack some earplugs if you are a light sleeper  there was a lot of noise late at night as well   what sounded like somebody panel beating at  on the morning every night Breakfast was very basic buffet   toast cereals but only with hot milk and a small selection of hot indian food   breads pakoras potatoes etc  The eating area in the basement is also a bit weird with disco lights all over the celing and american wrestling permanently on the TV on the corner The staff in the hotel were mixed   the bellboys were friendly and helpful perhaps thanks to tips but reception staff were indifferent bordering on rude  Our most significant issue was when we returned for a second stay after a week away   the toilet had clearly not been cleaned and was really really disgusting   it looked like the seat was covered in diarrhoea  it was thoroughly cleaned as soon as we spoke to a member of staff but that doesn t change the fact that it should not have happened in the first place  if we d known the city better and didnt have transport arangements from the hotel the next morning we probably would have walked out Overall Singh Sons was ok for a short stay but the location isnt the best the rooms are very gloomy and we were left with a very soured opinion by the toilet incident  Delhi is renowned for hotels being expensive but we would not want to stay at Singh Sons or anywhere like it again   I d rather pay a lot more money for an upket place  
P => Rubbish hotel We stayed here on our last night after a fantastic holiday  It was an appaling ending to a great trip The room was clean but thats the only positive thing to say  There was a lot of street noise and the water pump for thehotel was directly outside are room and burst into life in the middle of the night  It took several phonecalls and a walk to reception before anything was done about it The hotel was in general fairly dingy and uninspiring At best adequate  Avoid if possible  
P => You can do much better     Traveller reviews of this hotel praising its cleanliness etc are accurate however it is indeed absolutely spartan and if travelling in the late fall and winter the rooms can be cold  Hot water is just warm and must be requested  minutes prior to use  Bedding is threadbare  Packing your own toilet paper is key as the hotel provides very little  Avoid rooms on the main street side as its extremely noisy  Staff and restaurant food are OK The area in which the hotel is located is not the safest nor the most interesting in Delhi   this is however a hotel used by many tour companies as a first or last night in Delhi   if you have the choice opt for a higher grade hotel particularly if its your first night after a long flight and want even some minimal comfort  This is a tough first night in Delhi and this hotel offers little to soften the experience    
P => Done the job What do you expect from a Hotel in a developing I accept that the hotel was not   or even   in terms of presentation amenities etc but for being located in the peripheral of the city centre allows for good access to transport eateries etc   it really couldn t be better situated  I stayed there for  weeks whilst conducting research for my MSc dissertation so I got to know the place rather well  A hairy experience around the corner with some of the locals knocked my nerves but that was the only bad note in terms of the neighbour hood  For me favoured most and by far exciting mode of transport are the local tuk tuks which cost very little  but do remember to barter and agree a price for your journey BEFORE you set off as some try to rip you off and don t let them take you to a bazaar or anything  totally overpriced  Also remember that the majority of the cycle rickshaw ridersdrivers are poorer than the motorised tuk tuk drivers so try to experience that and leave a small tip Best thing for me in the hotel was the TV  allowed me to catch up on the cricket world cup as well as the footy back home and its always exciting to grab some snacks from the small nearby shop and watch a Bollywood movieI would certainly recommend this hotel there are far worse places you could be staying 
P => Very Bad Hotel in Delhi We booked the hotel through an agent for one room for  persons  Though the room looked very nice we have hard time getting other things  No provision for making coffee  For hot water you have to call the reception and wait for half an hour  Not many hanger to hang your clothes  Most importantly the reception people are not trust worthy  They tend to cheat if you are not aware of what is happening  They claim four star facilties and rates are expensive for the facility they have  Should be avioded  
P => Value for money In India its difficult to find a mid range hotel   this is just that  For the price the hotel is nice en suite bathroom with hot water and western flushing toilet AC and clean rooms  There is internet in the lobby and the staff are helpful  The location is fine there is a local ket nearby at night and its relatively close to Connht Place  You can there in an auto for Rs  If you do go to Connht Place then look out for Lido which is a very nice restaurant with AC 
P => Wonderful for Delhi Stayed with my teen travel group for a couple nights Showers were nice hot and cold water the staff were eager to please and the AC was lovely and necessary This is India its a third world country and this must be considered when a rating is given  You shouldnt come to Delhi expecting a US experience because it wont happen and you shouldnt want it to  
P => Clean accommodation  We arrived in the early hours of the morning and the pick up was excellent and welcome  No getting hassled  We were pleased to arrive at a clean large hotel with reasonable facilities and ac  The bathroom was big and there was a shower and western toilet but no bath  We stayed for  nights Positives clean sheets clean floors cool rooms no insects efficient services taxi pick up Negatives basic very breakfast our room was on the road so you could hear the noise coldwarm showers Location a rickshaw ride from the main centre connht place so not a problem nice restaurannt near by called alpha spice Overall for approx  uk pounds  night seems reasonable our main priority was a clean hotel having read other reviews and horror stories of other hotels it met our needs  The area is not the best but to be fair none of Delhi is particuarly much different  I would use common sense and ask for directions from your hotel   they are helpful  
P => Singh Sons   A ent Budget Hotel I stayed at Singh Sons for about three days in late ruaryearly ch with my family and my wifes family  Here is our collective review  Pros   Singh Sons is a nice new hotel with a lot of nice ble everywhere including all the lobbies and the stairs  The rooms are small and basic but very clean as are the bathrooms which have Western style toilet seats  Some of the middle rooms do not have windows but all rooms have air conditioning  Also the breakfast is quite nice   with pastries and eggsomelettes in addition to teajuices  The omelettes at Singh Sons are particular tasty The room service is cheap and available around the clock  The location is central enough   with both the old part and new part of Delhi reachable on tempos tuk tuks   Cons   I personally like the hustle and bustle of Karol Bagh where the hotel is situated but some people seem to have issues with this setting however I think you get more of a Delhi experience here although Singh Sons tends to be in a quieter part of Karol Bagh  Safety wise you should feel safe here since there are lot of other tourists who stay here  My main issue with the hotel is that because of the ble hallways it can get noisy as people walk about at night    Overall   this is a fairly good budget hotel overall for Delhi outside Delhi you can get a better hotel for the same price  And I would go with tour operators since they can get you the room about   cheaper than you can on your own  I used this reasonably priced one called Safe Voyages Tours run by a very honest Rajasthani guy   they have a website as well you can google it  
P => Bad Hotel in Bad Location The tour group I took had our accomodations at Hotel Singh Sons  Everyone of us hated the hotel and disliked the people there  I read the other review that said it was  months old   Im shocked as it seemed much older  I had both the quotdeluxequot sweet and a normal room  The bathtub was coming out of one of the rooms such that I couldnt open the door  The people working the hotel also dont care about the guests   I think they get too much business from tour operators  Also the location was awful  If you are travelling alone as a woman or even two women   I would avoid staying in Karol Bagh   I tried walking alone in the morning and I turned back after  minutes  My India friends were suprised I stayed in the neighborhood as it is know for thievery and its not safe I can say the beds seemed clean enough  Avoid having a room near the lobby   its very noisy  I loved India but Singh Sons was the low light

P => Feedback to Southern Hotels Delhi While booking a room online the pictures showed a different image than what i was faced with when i was allotted a room in the hotel The room was shabby with cracked walls and missing soft finish patches and the Bathroom was also stinking definitely not a room worth Rs    Also the Travel desk said that the car i had asked for in the night would be ready in the morning and when i called in the morning to double check i got a blunt answer that there are no vehicles available The billing was also done incorrectly and had i not noticed that the clerk at the billing desk had charged me for a day where in i had already paid for a day while booking the room online i would have ended up paying double the price and that too for such a bad experience  
P =>  I feel its a good and safe place for families  i saw the review of Hotel Southern from one of the review sites  our stay was comfortable  The rooms were good  and they also provided the complientary transfer from the airport  overall i appreciate the services of the hotel  
P => liked the place services  you can definetely try this place for value for money I stayed in this hotel last week while on a business trip  room are good  they had transfered me from Airport to hotel which is a great service in Delhi city  i liked the place and highly recommed it to the fellow travrellers  yeh the tour department and the restaurants are a must try in case you are planning a weekend trip to Agra to see the great TAJ MAHALhern Travels  We highly recommend this place to our fellow travelers  
P => loved the room A very nice place and perfect for tourist  Very close to airport centre of city with lot of options for shopping close to metro and sights  rooms and service is nice but only issue was that food was south indian so more preferred to them  
P => The best accomodation and will not empty your pocket This was the best hotel  Not only is this the opinion of only mine but I have brought a number of guests to this hotel foreign and Indian nationals and they have loved this place  Their hospitability and the cleanliness of this place is worth seeing and experiencing  If you need cleanliness as well as a hotel with economic tariff do check in this hotel  Well if you are going there for the first time do allow the hotel guys to get adjusted with you  And book in advance for the best service Hotel Southern is a wonderful place to stay  Its a safe and secure place  I have never had regrets for staying or suggesting others to stay  You  never believe that at least  to  guests of mine have stayed in this hotel from time to time throughout the year  They never had regrets John 
P => Excellent Budget Hotel We have reached this hotel on    they have arranged complimentray Pickup from airport  Hotel Rooms are very good with very good furniture Food is very good and  hours reception  The location is very good nearer to Karol Bagh ket there is a biggest shopping mall in this area This is biggest shopping mall in ASIA  New building new furniture  Totally Its very good expirence in New delhi  
P => THE BEST HOSPITALITY A very comfortable stay with perfect staffs   one can go even alone and stay even if ur a lady   very much safety in all aspects   pakka friendly staffs from reception to bell boys  
P => Good value rooms for New Delhi     but the breakfast is pretty basic with little western options Make sure you get booking confirmation via email as you  have problems we had at check in as we booked via email with the hotel    but they upgraded us to compensate  Have good travel agency next door so can book New Delhi tours or other trips around Delhi and trains nationally Rooms are good value and have good facilities for the price providing you book the super deluxe and above tariffs    
P => Not recommended  dirty and scary My husband and I had booked three nights at this hotel and left after one  We arrived in Delhi in the middle of the night and got to the hotel at around am  Next to the check in desk there was a doorway covered in a sheet  behind it several people were sleeping on the floor  Our room was shabby and cramped nothing like the pictures on the website  There were no towels and no toilet paper  The sheets didnt look clean and there was dirt in all of the corners  Random people were hanging around walking up and down the hall all night and talking loudly  Worst was the foot wide hole in the wall of the bathroom that opened into an airshaft  The sounds of other peoples bathroom activities came in all night  We lay awake trying to get some sleep until am when we started calling other hotels  Thank goodness we found another hotel and got out of Hotel Southern by am  
P => If you whant go in New Delhi you must stay in HoI if you whant go to new delhi you must stay in hotel southern this is very indian verry nise and very clin hotel  moust profesional and good staff verry intresting food  there is verry reasonable price  in southern you are at home  be sure you arn in the best area in new delhi when you live in southern bakur from tbilisi georgia

P => France love India This was my first visit to India  One of my friend suggested me to take a stay in this hotel I booked the suit room through internet  Hotel arranged complimentary airport pickup for me  They gave me a very classy servicethe room was very neat and cleanmini bar had all the things which i neededthe restaurant was good and the food was awesome  The interior of the room was really very good and it gave me a positive attitude  The staff of the hotel was well trained and gave me a good service  I also enjoyed the internet service but the only drawback was the location of the hotel i e  karol bagh area was very crowded  Despite of all the drawbacks about the area i really enjoyed my stay I would like to thank the hotel staff for cooperating with me and giving me the good service and my special thanks goes especially to the front office of the hotel for not charging for the printouts which i had taken from the hotel computer  
P => I Love Delhi I enjoyed my stay at Sri Nanak in Delhi   Many thanks to owners Sandeep amp Karan who took personal care of us   I arrived early and I was given room  The service is excellent but the food is average  Will definately stay at the hotel when I visit Delhi   Also I will recommend my friends to book through hotel directly   Hotel has a nice website and can book online directly  
P => godloveshuman A Perfect hotel for the business traveler and located in an ideal central area accessible from anywhere in the city any hour   Overall set up is excellent and counter staff courteous and helpful  so much so that at times you feel you are unnecessarily taking advantage of their nature just because you want to experience the Royal feeling which the staff wants you to experience  It was a perfect stay Kamal Bhagat 
P => What you see and what you get are both good As a female travelling alone I found the neighborhood a little destitute but the hotel was perfect for the price and just around the corner from bustling activity shops traffic and typical Delhi hustle and bustle  The staff was eager to help and very warm and friendly  The room was very spacious the only drawback is that the shower is not in a arate stall so water sprays over the floor of the bathroom  All in all a good value very clean lots of little packages of necessities  I would recommend this as a ent budget hotel  
P => The Hospitality and service was the best  A Perfect hotel for the business traveler and located in an ideal central area accessible from anywhere in the city any hour   Overall set up is excellent and counter staff courteous and helpful  so much so that at times you feel you are unnecessarily taking advantage of their nature just because you want to experience the Royal feeling which the staff wants you to experience  It was a perfect stay

P => we were quite happy Hotel is centrally located in the main city  Our room was wonderful the room service managed the things well  The food quality too was up to the k  This is definitely a good choice  
P => Loved the hospitality I was at this hotel with my parents from          We had travelled from Fiji Islands The most fantastic thing about this hotel is the hospitality  The staff even the management were so helpful  We ran into some emergency and I was amazed at the way we were helped out especially by the management  Another great thing we liked about this hotel was the location  It is right in the middle of Karol Bagh and accessible to the main shopping areas  We really enjoyed our stay here  
P => we enjoyed it Sri Nanak is definitely one of the best  star properties in Delhi  The hotel room amp the food was excellent  It was a perfect stay  
P => small but convenient Small hotel but neat   good for stay if you going for shopping in that area of delhi 
P => brilliant service we had a short stay at this hotel and would fully recommend it to anyone  The train station is very near and in the middle of a vibrant area  The service was very good Bunty the taxi driver was great and very helpful   Food was very good and will definately stay again  For a good quality cheap hotel i would stay here  
P => nice family run hotel I being a business traveler very often come to new delhi   I booked this hotel via a travel agent and it turned out to be a very ent choice   They had nice  clean rooms with all facilities   Also rooftof restaurant serves delicious chicken items   The travel desk amp staff were also very prompt   
P => We enjoyed this Hotel very much We enjoyed this hotel very much   Its a nice family run hotel by Sandeep amp Karan  The hotel is nice amp Clean   Very near to connht places which is heart of Delhi   We stayed  night and really liked our stay at this hotel  
P => No problems but overpriced I stayed here three nights and had absolutely no problems but the price of  rupees is simply too high for this kind of accommodation  You can get a similar room at Cottage Yes Please for night and I would have done so except Yes Please was full at that time  The only real difference in service and quality that I can think of was that Sri Nanak left a newspaper outside my door every morning The location is a bit noisy  There is a Gurudwara down the street and they broadcast prayers quite loudly at certain times during the day and evening  All around the hotel there are automotive type shops with lots of motorbikes and the place is really grimy especially the air  You can see the haze in the air just looking down the street The main reason I paid this much was for the free WiFi which I needed for my work  But there are probably other cheaper options available  
P => Mixed Feelings Staying at the Sri Nanak Continental for two nights on my first trip to Delhi I cannot compare it to other accomodations   but you get the impression that the prices of all mid range hotels are somehow inflated  The good thing about the Hotel is the rather quiet location at least for the Karol Bagh district  Most taxi drivers will have to ask a couple of times and  not be able to read the hotel sign or the address on your reservation     The room was more less clean but a strange selection of new and old well used furniture  The rooms seem to differ very much some with new flat screen TVs and bathrooms some with quite old installations The rooftop restaurant produced surprisingly good dishes though the ordering process revealed some communication problems now and then The check in took quite long Minibar and Taxi had to be paid in cash  The service was efficient however and wakeup call and ordered taxi were on time  The hotel also offers to store some luggage e g  if you leave for a round trip for a couple of days  
P => Not impressed Im afraid I have to say I was not at all impressed with having paid nearly  for  nights in this hotel When I arrived my room was not clean there were gecko droppings in the bathroom the sheets were dusty half a bottle of the previous occupants shampoo was in the room the kettle did not work and there were the remnants of the previous sachets of coffee from the last occupant but no replacement sachets  The milk powder sachets were also  months past the best before date and it is recommended not to drink them after this date The following day today I had to make many requests   for replacement sachets of coffee for a new kettle and when no one had come to clean my room by the afternoon I requested it was cleaned  This was done quite reluctantly  I still received no replacement coffee sachets The staff were very polite and have good manners and the reception desk were very helpful in providing me with maps information re shops and other matters However there does need to be some improvement in the management of the hotel domestic standards  They are not what I would expect from a  star Hotel If I had paid  per night and this hotel was either a  or  star I would have been happy as it comes under the no frills budget category  However it is far far removed from the advert on the site and not worth the amount of money I spent on it  
P => A Nice Budget Alternative First of all it should be clear to visitors that we are talking about budget alternative not a property in luxury segment  Thus it would be unreasonable and irrational to expect everything at its best  Taking the rates in account I would say     Hotel rooms are adequately clean    Toiletbathroom   above average  Maharaja suit could be a nice option for families travelling with young kids and tight budget  Location is not the ideal one   but not that bad either  Conclusion Honestly speaking Sri Nanak deserves better rating than the one it currently holds   
P => Cosy Little Hotel The Sri Nanak is a cozy place in a busy Delhi location  Its not within walking distance of much but youll feel like youre in real Delhi We stayed here twice and had a different room each time  The two rooms we had were both comfortable and clean but one room was definitely more recently reated in than the other On Christmas Day we were treated to a free simple dinner in the restaurant upstairs PracticalitiesFree internet access from a computer terminal  There are small grocery shops pharmacies and restaurants nearby  The hotel staff is courteous and responsive to needs  The hotel also felt safe  Get detailed instructions on how to get to the hotel because taxi drivers seem to have difficulty finding it  Overall great for the price  
P => Comfortable Stay Though I stayed at the hotel just for a night I found the hotel very comfortable and peaceful  The interior of the hotel room was very good  The hotel is located in the heart of the city Karol Bagh  The staff was very co operative and helpful  I would certainly recommend this hotel to my relatives and friends  
P => clean cheap free wi fi The hotel offered to pick me up from the airport for  Rupees  I arranged a taxi at the airport for  Rupees but took the driver a long time to find the hotel  I would recommend you have a map and give the driver directions The location is a few minutes walk from several lively street kets and the metro station is within  minutes walk The room was small basically furnished and reasonably clean  The staff are very helpful A good value hotel for Delhi  
P => Excellent location grat staff I chose Sri Nanak hotel for  reasons the location it is nearby the place I needed to go to for business and the reviews about the staff  When in a new city it is always best to have reliable local information  My expections were infact exceeded The hotel is clean and provides a more than average service for the Indian standards of a  star  But the people at the reception were outstanding  They helped me organize my days in such a way that I managed to perfectly combine busines and tourism  Transport was just perfect including the pick up at the airport But a special note is for the restaurant I had the most enjoyable indian food not the usual tourist stuff but authentic indian cuisine in a very friendly environment I will for sure come back the next times I will be in Delhi  
P => Great hotel great family I had an excellent stay at Hotel Sri Nanak  I was in India for one month doing volunteer work and stayed at the hotel the entire time  The family that owns the hotel was very helpful and even gave us a deal because we stayed for such a long time  Anything we needed they tried their best to get  The power went off about once a day but luckily the hotel had a generator that kicked on and kept the air conditioning and lights running  All the staff was very friendly and helped us out with what we needed in terms of directions  Really this is a comfortable friendly Indian run place  They do what they can to make their guests happy and comfortable  
P => overpriced for location My partner and I arrived early in the morning  We had given them details of our flight by email couple of days before but nobody picked us up  Wasnt such a big deal as the pre paid taxi was handy at the airport When we arrived they didnt have any room for us and we believed it might have been some communication problem  We were totally exhausted so we took their suggestion of staying in their staffs room for a few hours until one of their guests checked out later that morning  Reception guy was very polite helpful and friendly Anyway we believe that for the location and the quality of the suite we stayed it was overpriced  We stayed our next nights at another hotel in Paharganj half their price and a little higher qualityI would recommend travellers to stay in Paharganj area which is very close to metro station much cheaper and more interesting 
P => Very Average Beware of Noise Picked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews  To sum it up we got what we paid for  The restaurant on top had very average food  The hotel rooms were very average  After reading the reviews I expected the hotel to be noisy  and it was VERY noisy  I must have woken up  or  times in the nightearly morning  The noise from the street is just insane  Its almost as if there is no glass  As for the staff they were very helpful and courteous  As for the location I would not recommend any single women travellers to stay in this hotel  The area isnt bad but it sure as heck aint safe  As the manager said this is the oldest part of New Delhi In the end if you want average this is it  
P => Great Presidential room The presidential suite is amazing great service and accommodation 
P => Friendly  I booked this hotel through internet  We were there for our first business trip  Upon arrival I was surprised that the check in was still traditional way of recording but with security camera in place  The food is fantastic and the staff is always smiling  The room is clean too  What is important is I have free broadband internet  Its a nice place to rest at the heart of busy shop houses Alvin Singapore 
P => I didnt like it After extensive research on the web Sri Nanak seemed to be the best bet but I was really disappointed  My biggest problem was that the rooms were really dusty I was constantly sneezing and wiping my nose  My nd gripe was that the bathroom was a disaster  I cant understand why they dont use a arator between the shower and toilet  So the end effect is that after a shower the entire bathroom is wet   Its a pity    this could be a really ent place if only they took the time to clean it On the plus side the staff were helpful although did raise your suspicions sometime  However overall they did help me with train ticket bookings and taxi service  Another plus is that they pick you up from the airport which is a real help since you will inevitably get ripped off by a local taxi driver  As for location its a bit run down but then thats India for you  Another plus is that its close to the Delhi Metro which is excellent and there are some shopping arcades in walking distance  
P => This is Not a Luxury Hotel Its similar to a Motel  in the US I picked this hotel based on the reviews and the price but of all of the hotels I stayed at during my month long India trip I thought this one was the one that I like least  I stayed in the best room they had and did not think that it was worth the price I paid  Ill update my review with pictures when I can get the pics uploaded  The bed was not comfortable and though the linens looked clean  The bathroom was an average hotel in India bathroom no bathtub shower with a bucket and a sink and toilet  The location of the hotel was not good  There was constant noise from the street cats fighting dogs fighting cars honking engines roaring   the pics I have of the street show how unideal the location really is    If the hotel was priced for the best room at  USDper night I think it would be a fair price  This hotel should definitely not be charging over   On a positive note the staff seemed helpful and the elevator works  Unfortunately since I didnt stay in other Delhi hotels I cant recommend others  I did stay in many hotels on the Golden Triangle Route and can recommend those for the review in the those areas  
P => basic accomodation good service The hotel is ent if youve been to Delhi you know how hard can it be to find a ent midrange hotel  The location is very chaotic and there is a is a large Sikh temple that starts chanting at about  am and this can wake you up but I found it quite entertaining so I recommend staying in Connht Place area if you can afford it The rooms are clean but old although some are updated the breakfast is average compared with other hotels in India  On the positive side this hotel offers like any other the service of a driver we ided to hire a driver to take us to Jaipur to avoid the crowed trains and it was the best idea  They gave us an excellent driver very friendly and experienced in a great SUV  After we arrived to Jaipur we negotiated with the hotel and ided to keep him for the rest of our stay in India  It was fantastic for that part along I recommend this hotel  
P => Basic accomodation in frenetic Karol Bagh area With all of the poorly reviewed properties in Delhi even the very expensive ones we chose Hotel Sri Nanak based on the photos on their website and the fact that they offer suites with  beds suitable for our  person family  In terms of the room itself we stayed in their night Presidential Suite was spacious and of a basic  star level  Despite the name it was certainly nothing fancy furnishings were not particularly new nor did the room seem that clean  The staff was friendly and eager to help out  Id call this hotel simply quotbasic accomodationsquot and not a great value all together even for the  standard rooms The big negative for most people will be the location  Karol Bagh is India in all of its noisy smelly crowded and frenetic glory  If you want to stay in the midst of a busy ket area then perhaps this is a positive but it was nerve wracking for us to take our kids anywhere on the street to catch a cab etc  Also note that there is a large Sikh temple  block away that starts chanting at about  am and this can wake you up  For most travelers especially for your first time to India pay the extra  to stay in Connht Place  
P => Clean and Comfortable with Nice staff and Organized great trips BOTTOM LINE A nice clean and comfortable hotel that had nice staff and a great reservations department who arranged a good and affordable trip for usPROS Nice amenities conscientious staff eg  allowed us to use a room free of charge to change in before we left for airport reservations department arranged excellent and affordable private vehicle for Golden Triangle trip free WiFi and internet access w computerCONS A little out of the way in Karol Bagh   worth keeping the hotels card for directions for autorickshaw drivers average restaurantEXCEPTIONAL ITEMS We booked a trip through the hotel which was affordable and enjoyable  They booked  nights in Agra and Jaipur and provided a driver who was very courteous and provided local guides as needed in each stop  
P => Excellent IF you know how bad can other places be After reading all the bad reviews here Ive ided NOT to stay in this hotel  Interestingly enough while it was a mistake it was worth while  Instead Ive stayed at a terrible place called Hotel Classic in Channa ket for  nights before getting a room at Sri Nanak  For those interested in the Classic story look it up   my review is there Had I come to Sri Nanak in the first place I would probably have had some bad things to say about it same as the other reviewers  However sometimes things can be seen only in comparison  You have to experience India before rushing to conclusions  Its DIFFERENT India that is The front desk staff were great  The hotel owner himself Mr  Nanak was there   an extremely likeable and chatty fellow The rooms are well orated with a flat screen plasma on the wall  You get slippers to wear while in the room  Guess what thats a nice touch  Ive spent  days hopping around a different hotel on towels because I did not want to step on the disgusting floor over there  Here the floors are clean  The slippers are a nice added touch  The bed is comfortable albeit too short Im quot  cm  Ive mentioned this to Mr  Nanak the following day   he said that he already had similar complaints and was thinking about replacing the beds Yes there are some bugs in the bathroom  They come through the ventilation grating where the exhaust fan is  Ive mentioned this to Mr  Nanak as well saying he should put a steel mesh grating over it on the outside  He liked the idea  My colleague who Ive stayed in the hotel with thinks that if we were to return there within a year wed see the grating in place The upstairs restaurant is excellent with its own chef  A fairly large selection of Indian cuisine  Now I dont really like Indian food however Ive enjoyed a few interesting dishes  The breakfast is sub par but its so cheap I see no reason to complain On the second night we had dinner with Mr  Nanak who was very entertaining and offered some refreshing views on business and the future of India as well as his efforts to improve the hotel Anyhow Im sure a few of you will think this review is shill   I dont really care  Read my other review about Hotel Classic and be you will understand As we were checking out  British fellows just arrived  Theyve asked me how is the hotel  I said   is this your first time in India They said yes  I said in this case I dont think youre going to like it  Everything can be known only through comparison  
P => Excellent service impeccable rooms great prices I am a Yoga teacher leading tours of India and frequently bring people who are coming to India for their first time to this hotel  We are always so happy to stay at Sri Nanak because the staff are so responsible always pick up from the airport and train stations on time and are very helpful and respectful  The restaurant is healthy and has great food There is an excellent balcony on the roof with plants to enjoy views of the eagles circling around Delhi  The rooms are excellent modern appliances and beautiful or  This hotel has gone out of its way to provide all comforts and thoughfulness towards its guests  
P => amazing stay it is no less than any of the U K  hotelsand that to at very comparitive prices have wireless facilties for free in U K  u have to pay for them food is awesome with nice transport facilties and free breakfast  
P => Overpromised and greatly underdelivered Overpromised and greatly underdelivered My husband and I have stayed at many hotels worldwide and this is most definitely the WORST hotel that we have come across despite the fact that we only stayed for  nights  We had read several positive reviews before booking our stay at Sri Nanak but on arrival we were thoroughly disappointed  My husband and I arrived at pm from Bangalore  On arrival we were greeted by a young man at reception with quotOh   so you are Mr Quayumquot  I  have an Indian surname with an English accent but this hardly conveys confidence for a hotel meant for international tourists  Our stay as listed   The bed covers were dirty complimentary with long black hairs and small dead flies in the folds  We had to request for clean sheets    The air conditioning a large machine was noisy and positioned directly by the bed at arms length    The hotels website states running hot and cold water   hot water was only available on running the hot tap for over  minutes when we informed reception that there was no hot water we were told to keep running it until it became hot   The bathroom fan exploded yes   sparks and smoke and then black out I called reception somebody came up and told me that they would have an electrician see to it the next day   this did not happen   surprisingly    At am we were woken up by someone banging on our door the doors were flimsy and the staff kept trying to open the door from the outside at other times There were no door signs to state Do not disturb or Please clean my room    These rooms are not sound proofed   we could hear guests chatting loudly and their children running up and down the corridor outside our room at am    The wardrobe door was broken dirty and had a strong odour so we ided against keeping anything in there    There was a safe in the wardrobe however it was not bolted down or attached to anything   so anyone could walk off with it All in all a miserable stay that we had to make do with as there was no time to search for other hotels during our  night stay in Delhi  Think very carefully before staying here   you have been warned 
P => Great Hotel Was very apprehensive about booking a hotel in Karol Bagh as I was travelling with a girly party my  month dhter mum mother in law and sister  However this hotel was fab   we booked the presidential suite which was ideal for a family as we had two arate rooms within one room and allowed privacy and peace for my dhter to sleep The hotel location is fantastic with the Gurudwara McDonalds and Pizza Hut ATM and the great shops all in walking distance The hotel restaurant is OK food is nice and room service is handy too but you can order takeaway to your room which is an added bonus The water is a bit temperamental but you only have to leave it running for mins and it s hot   not a problem The hotel is very clean and well kept Staff are good and manager very nice If staying in Karol Bagh   go here 
P => Sri Nanak  great if you can get a cab to find it  Having read various reviews of Sri Nanak we a party of  booked directly for  nights and requested the presidential suite We were generally pleased with the room more likely to impress a president from a small nation than quot ol Wquot of the US Survey  but there were various things that could have been cleaner the bath took for ever to run away but as a mid range hotel it served its purpose well  The room was large and has a fridge and table and chairs as well as a sofa and a chaise long      A real bonus is the roof top restaurant serving breakfast lunch and evening meals  Its good value and the food is generally very tasty  Nice to sit in at night and sup a beer or two providing they dont run out One other point to bear in mind is that Sri Nanak is a way out from the centre of Delhi Karol Bagh is a area of town that not a lot of cab drivers from Connht Place seem to know very well  one night whilst coming back the driver got lost and was asking a local for the hotel  showing him a card with the address on The man disclaimed any knowledge of the hotel or road At that point we realised that we were actually no more than a hundred yards from it and actually in the right street All in all a good bet if your not too fussy  
P => Not for everyone The hotel did send a driver to pick us up from Delhi airport which was a god send and all the staff were very polite and helpful  I am surprised that no one seems to have mentioned how hard the beds were though  I asked for extra blankets to put under me as it was like sleeping on a rock I think it might be a suitable hotel for backpackers or seasoned travellers but not for first time visitors to India as Delhi is a bit of a shock in itself  The hotel is not in a great area and we were woken up the first morning at am by a parade going by that we actually thought was a riot and the second morning at   by someone with REALLY LOUD speakers in the middle of the road  Very bizarre  The hotel is also quite noisy   but so is India Overall we had a great holiday but even though the staff and restaurant were very good I would recommend spending a bit more and staying in a good hotel in Delhi in a central area  Of all the areas we toured Delhi is the probably the biggest shock and a good hotel is a must  
P => A good hotel when travelling with children   esp the presidential suite We stayed at this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and overall I would say it was good place to stay We were picked up from the airport which we were grateful for  We were travelling with children and stayed in the Maharaja suite which was quite good  We had a problem with the TV  they fixed it promptly  The staff were polite and happy and the manager Sandeep was friendly and takes a lot pf pride in his hotel The taxi to the station in the early morning was a nighte and so was the pick up the following week end  I dont rate their taxi service  There was a mix up with our rooms the following week end  we had pre booked and confirmed for the following week end but we were offered an quotalternative quot maharaja suite which did not have the bunk beds for the kids  After a bit of protest and disatisfaction we were offered the presidential suite at the same price   which is very good  It can sleep up to   I would say not all the staff are conscientious as the manager We had breakfast in our room and also ate once upstairs in the roof top hotel  The food is reasonable and I would eat again The back of the hotel is not noisy Karol Bagh is not one of the best area but there is a metro station nearby and a gurud wara  from where we heard lovely melodic hyms once The rooms are what you see on their web sites  I would suggest you look at the room first before accepting it  
P => fantastic management average  start hotel situated in a busy commerical area  not your above average hotel this will cost you an arm and leg in Delhi but staff and management go out of their way to make your stay stress free and relaxing as possiblemy dhter got sick one nite and i foned reception at  am   they got a taxi for me and manager himself came with us to hospital   a fantastic gesture i thoughtinternet massage chair newspapers airport pick up and drop off one whole day sighseeeing tour half day shopping tour and fruit bowel were all given free of charge together with  key ring holdersFor the price definitely woth the value 
P => Very good hotel We thought this was a lovely small well run hotel in the Karol Bagh area of Delhi  The staff were fantastic and incredibly helpful  We chose the presidential suite which is ideal for a family as it can easily sleep up to     people with  bathrooms  The hotel had some nice touches including free internet access a daily paper pushed under the door and a fresh bowl of fruit served every day  The restaurant offered a good range of dishes it got a bit chilly in the evening in uary its on the roof so we opted to have meals served in our room  The Karol Bagh area is busy in the day with plenty of shops but it does get quiet enough in the evening and we had no problems sleeping  We tended to use the taxi service from the hotel which was great and reasonably priced   the drivers really took care of us and cut out the hassle  It took about  minutes to get to Connht Circus  All in all a great stay  
P => ok I stayed in this hotel in uary  It was clean inexpensive and the staff were generally helpful  The wireless internet was very useful and there were no problems with the hot water once we got used to the taps  However this hotel is definitely not a luxury option and the location in Karol Bagh is not great  I agree with the comment that this hotel is a bit like a cheap s US motel or one of the two star hotels you find in the Pigalle area of Paris  If I stayed in Delhi again I would probably stay in a five star hotel as there is a dearth of high quality mid range options in that city  
P => Average The hotel was average nothing special at all  The area is not the best at night  Our particular room had no windows and the mattress was very thin The staff at the front desk did really care about anything and were always on the phone  I would try and find something closer  Dont trust the photos  
P => All over nice The executive room was clean and quite modern with a nice bathroom with shower  All in all a nice tourist class hotel giving you great value for your money The hotel is placed quite sentral in New Dehli a short ride from the railwaystation  Try to avoid eating in the resturant as it was nothing special  It looked old dirty and beeing at the top floor of the hotel you would expect a viewwell there is not The sourrundings of the hotel is not much at night with the only lights coming from ATMs and jevellers shops  If you need a place just for the night i would recomend Sri Nanak continental  The staff was friendly and serviceminded during the two days stay   of desember  
P => Surprisingly good Obviously the Sri Nanak is not the Hyatt or the Sheraton  However once you get over your initial doubts for instance about the area the hotel is located in then its not a bad hotel at all  In fact as it turns out Karol Bagh the area where the hotel is located offers some of the busiest and most authentic street kets of Delhi  It is a GREAT place for doing shopping dining etc  once you get used to the huge amounts of people on the street the cars the noise etc  The hotel itself is simple but clean and the staff is quite friendly  They also have on the roof of the hotel a restaurant which offers a rather unattractive breakfast for westeners but quite delicious Indian cuisine  Also Karol Bagh is a very lively area so there is a fair amount of noise during the day but at night it quietens down  Then the only thing noticable is the barking of the street dogs   I would definitely go there again although I can see that the Sri Nanak is not for everyone  A big plus should also be mentioned they offer free WiFi in all rooms Very very handy when you are in India  
P => not bad for a first time visitor to delhi we found the surrounding location pretty scary it looked even more run down and destitute than i imagined its right on the edge of the biggest ket in asia and the hussle and bustle was a bit intimidating on the first day after a day or so we got into it and thought it was pretty cool if your looking for budget prices then stay away i think we paid over the odds compared with other places we stayed the hotel itself was clean and tidy the staff helpful and the food was ok  would i stay again   yes i think i would  
P => Clean safe and excellent value for money Being a lone female arriving in Delhi at am I was very pleased to take advantage of the free hotel transfer  I think I might have been a little stressed otherwise given the things you see at the airport The staff were excellant and went out of their way to help  The hotel was very clean  The bathroom was fine and certainly better than a lot of places in Delhi at this price thats for sure  There was a complimentary bottle of water and basket of fruit in my room  The beds were reasonably comfortable but not sprung  I found it a little noisy at times  For instance there was a family on my floor who insisted on having a conversation at am in the corridor and they werent exactly using hushed tones  One thing I would suggest is that they introduce quotDo not disturbquot signs that can be posted outside the door so the staff dont keep disturbing you when all you want to do is sleep off your travelling and jet lag I didnt actually venture out of the hotel as the area doesnt look that enticing but I didnt think is was unsafe either  
P => Not for the faint of heart  Adventurers ony  If you are looking at this hotel and are used to the good stuff Sofitels Hiltons etc  you SHOULD STOP NOW  The whole Delhi experience is a jarring one for westerners and frankly while going to a hotel like this is safe it will make the experience that much more trying  If you are looking at it because no other rooms are available in the entire city which is what happened to me go ahead and cancel your trip to Delhi or head on over to Mumbai which is a city that actually has a good airport roads and enough good hotels to hold everyone I should note though that the staff was VERY friendly  
P => Unbeatable value for the budget friendly  I am an American and Ive stayed at this hotel twice in the past  days each time for a few nights  Think s Best Western or Days Inn goes masala and youll get a sense of or and premesis condition  I came back to the hotel because the staff really is friendly and gives  star worth of helpful service  I did not eat there so I cant comment on that  Yes the neighborhood is noisy from  am til pm  But I slept like a rock  Yes the mattress was thin but thats the style here  Like I said I slept like a rock  I read the review by someone who was not expecting an Indian style bathroom hes in India   what did he expect  Theres a toilet toilet paper shower head but no tub  It was no problem for me just dont put your toiletries bag on the floor while you shower  The place is cleanish some of the hardware is old but nothing is dusty or moldy just worn  That goes for the sheets and towels too but I had no problem with using them  If you have your laundry done be sure to specifically identify what you dont want ironed The default is to iron it what ever the material  A couple of polyester shirts came out shiny from too hot an iron  The second time Id learned my lesson pointed out what not to iron and there were no problems  When I come back to Delhi I will defintely stay here because the folks are friendly and the value is unbeatable One piece of advice consider either retaining whatever driver you pick up from in front of the hotel or learn how to walk to the hotel from the gurdwara because taxi drivers cant find this place  I suspect many taxi walas cant read so the map on the back of the hotels business card is useless to drivers who will drive two blocks stop ask for directions advance two more blocks repeat  The gurdwara however is easy to find  
P => I would stay there again We chose this hotel based on the positive reviews which I pretty much agree with  The place is very clean not luxury level but for the price its a bargain  The restaurant and staff are outstanding and the free internet is a bonus  The only down side is that the neighborhood is nothing special  Its not bad or unsafe just nothing to interest a tourist  Dont expect a four star resort just expect a nice clean room and a hard working staff who aims to please  We didnt use the hotels travel arrangements but others who did seemed pleased  The hotel did provide free pickup at the airport which was also a good feature  
P => Good hotel good value    I got the quotpresidential suitequot for about USD during late    Very large room with   baths  Other rooms are probably half this cost  Great for our family of four and it could easily sleep six with its one king one full and two twin bunkbeds  It was clean and service was very good  Ordered room service and food was good as well  Free internet  I would easily recommend staying here  Located near Connht Place  About  mins to the airport in Delhi traffic but it took us exactly  minutes at AM since there was no traffic that early  
P => Good overall hotel The hotel is located in Karol Bagh which is a very busy and tight area in the centre of Delhi  Although quite noisy it does quieten down during the night  Karol Bagh is good for shopping and it is easy to grab an Auto  wheeled taxi to Connht Place As promised I was provided with complimentary pickup from the airport which is   mins away from the hotel  The hotel looks quite small from the outside and reception is also small  The rooms however are fairly spacious and tastefully orated spread over  floors  The most important thing is that the rooms are all clean and air conditioned  Free internet access is also provided in the hotels basement The hotel staff including its drivers are all very polite and friendly  Sightseeing tours are available in comfortable air conditioned vehicles I was delighted with the quality of the food at the hotels rooftop restaurant  The menu contained an assortment of dishes at very resonable prices all cooked traditionally  I highly recommend the quotAfghani ChickenquotOverall I was happy with my  nights stay at the hotel  If youre looking for a good  star hotel at a reasonable rate located in the centre of Delhi then this hotel is definitely worth considering  
P => excellent value for money Tidy and inexpensive hotel with good service ac friendly staff and a rooftop restaurant with good dahl  The neighbourhood can be crazy during ket days but metro is near

P => DONT GO HERE I read the reviews and I understand how somle people  have been fooled by the owners smile  But dont let the friendliness fool you this hotel is a complete scam unless you already know India and are Indian yourself  The hotel owner lied to us several times when we asked him travel questions including telling us that the only way to travel was by train or car and that we would have to wait   days for a train ticket a complete lie when we finally found the REAL international tourist office at the New Delhi rail we got a ticket for the next day at HALF the price he told us  Every time we asked the staff a simple travel question such as where the regional trains left from they refered us to the owner who would proceed to lie  He offered us a car too as a ridiculous price and tried showing us pictures of happy customers  While he searched through instead sketchy pictures of women posing for him in bedrooms came up which he quickly hid  Eventually he realized we werent game for his information  The moment we solidly said no to his travel car was the moment the smiles stopped from him  Some of the staff of his is friendly but this guy is a pure scam artist  DONT GIVE HIM BUSINESS  Please for the sake of those who lost money got ripped off got stuck in broken down cars miles away DONT GO HERE O ya and it does have WIFI but it doesnt reach your room  Also the area is scam central as number one business around isnt the ket its scamming travel agencies running the same bit he is  And on one last note the interior of the hotel is a weak escape from delhi polluted air as the staff constantly cleans the floor with toxic smelling cleaning products that were long ago banned from the west  
P => Very clean friendly family type hotel in the REAL India I stayed at Sunrise for  days last month   over the Diwali period and can recommend it  I am about to return there in ember  It is a newly and completely restored small hotel new bathrooms furniture and a nice new mattress etc and kept very clean   While some of the staff are not highly trained professionals this adds to the charm   it is like a family run hotel and any minor flaws are fixed up swiftly and cheerfully    The front desk staff are some of the friendliest and nicest people i have met in India  Ms Leena is a gem with the biggest welcoming smile in Delhi   I grew to love Karol Bagh  It is a REAL Indian bazarr with great character and not much touristy stuff however It can be a little confronting at first but stick with it because all the shops you could ever need and great kets and stalls hundreds of them are just a walk away  Yes there are several small quiet parks in Karol Bagh and an amazing wood carving studio and gallery just next door but one to the hotel   And the efficient and clean KAROL BAGH Metro Station is just a few minutes away  three stops to Connht Place   called Rajiv Chowk Station  You dont want to be relying on driving everywhere in Delhi  No way The crowds dont start till noon so get going early if you want to miss them in Karol Baghs wonderful narrow streets    Sure the breakfast is basic  but it breaks your fast and its free I usually added a great fresh cut fruit salad for a modest sum and was very happy  If you want a REALLY good coffee in Delhi avoid the trendy coffee palaces at Connht Place and go to Religare   Arts i Gallery Its on the corner Connht Circus and Kasturba Ghandi g  st floor  best coffee and good food with great art   Sunrise is a new hotel so to find it ask to be taken to the Regal Continental Hotel  The entrance is in a clean lane and Sunrise is RIGHT NEXT DOOR set back from the lane so it can be hard to see  Alternatively when driving down Saraswati g the CLARK HOTEL sign is easy to spot   its a good hotel too   The Regal and Sunrise are in the same unnamed lane on the other side of Saraswati g as the CLARK  Remember those tips and Sunrise is easy for you and your driver to find  be I will see you there in ember  An Oz traveller  
P => Sunrise hotel is very nice We met ownhis hoter of Sunrise Hotel in Tokyo Japan with friend of mine and he introduce his hotel us and show us broucher and pictures  and unfortunetly we got holidays vacation and we book this hotel through hotels com and got very good price  Hotel people pick up us up from airport because it was include in the price  Hotel was very nice and room was specious with hot shower which we Japanese people like very much  We feel very comfortable becuase we got very personal service because of we are kind of hotel owner friend and he speak Japanese very very well  We realy thanks to Hotel Owner and other staff Arigatou gozai masu Mata iki masu  
P => OK but     My wife and I stayed at this hotel for  night in ober   The room was fine although we had to ask for a top sheet on the bed  The ac worked ok but was somewhat noisy with a rapping sound  The breakfast was very good although the coffee seemed to be instant Nescafe  The neighborhood however is a drawback  The streets are terribly crowded noisy and dirty and there are touts every step of the way  The best aspect of this hotel is the rekably low price    around  per night  
P => Best hotel in budget price Hotel Sunrise is the best hotel in budget price  Hotel location is good for shopping  Me and my wife stayed in this hotel we feel very comfortable  Food was good Hotel staff was kind and friendly and help us about shopping near by hotel and they help us for bargaining in the price because we are from Chennai  This is good for new traveler in Delhi  We will send our friends to this hotel We will recommend this hotel to all the travelers who come to Delhi first time  Thank you very much all the staff for taking care of us Thanks and regardsLakhey 
P => Home away from home Hotel Sunrise is the hotel clean and comfortable  Its create as a Home away from home  They are take care of the matteress bedsheet curtains wall colours linen and the cleanliness of the whole hotel  I also took few pictures of Hotel by phone  They dont provide you just a service but they give you an experience  all staff are very Friendly  The one place where you can be sure that your trip will always be a pleasure  You will get everything near by Hotel  so come and enjoy your holidays  
P => Hotel Sunrise and Its owner Mr  Singh were great  I am a NRI non resident Indian and live in the US  I was in Delhi with my American extended family members as a tourist  I stayed in Hotel Sunrise for  nights in late tember   We rented  rooms  Our rooms were spacious and clean  House keeping was excellent  Hotel mangement was very friendly and helpful and almost every one in the hotel staff spoke English  The hotel owner Mr  Singh arranged taxi with a guide for us to go to Taj Mahal and surroundings and also for sightseeing in Delhi  He also had the taxi take us to the airport at  AM to catch an early flight  Mr  Singh did a fantastic job and all with a joke and a broad smile Both the hotel rates and the taxi charges were extremely reasonable for Delhi  I would recommend this hotel without any reservation to anybody planning a trip to Delhi and I will be a repeat customer here next time I visit Delhi Mr  Singh Thank you and take care Raj Natara Texas USA 
P => Good clean and safe hotel for family Hotel Sunrise is a good clean and safe hotel for family  Friendly and good staff and always ready for help  We have booked Delhi Agra Jaipur and Haridwar trip with this Hotel in a package and we realy enjoyed our trip  Driver was very good he showed us all most all the sight seeing places some times problem but this is normal when we travel in different city  But we all are very satisfied and happy with Hotel Sunrise services  Thank you so much Hotel Sunrise Staff OM 
P => STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE FROM EUROPE OR THE WEST Very disappointing hotel and people running the place  This is definitely not a  star hotel  We made reservations online  When we got there they didnt even have our reservations  The room they gave us didnt have any windows and the bathroom was below standard   much different from the description given online  After my wife and I settled in bed we got a call in the middle of the night and the receptionist said that we had to change the room since the room was already reserved for someone else  This was very inconvenient  The last night we stayed there we were woken up in the middle of the night by the people from the reception and their friends making a lot of noise and talking very loud down the hallway  On check out we left with a bad feeling  We found out later that the receptionist charged us  times the normal taxi fare to the train station  In addition we were ripped off when the director of the hotel purchased train tickets for us  He lied about the ticket price  Unfortunately because of him we ended up paying almost   more for the tickets than they were worth  Stay away from this place  They run it like an indian mafia  Very disappointing and very unprofessional  
P => undisovered gem of a place in Delhi As I write this I am still a guest at this Hotel  We wanted to book this hotel from Bangalore itself but did not have suffecient info to do that  We booked at another popular hotel and arrived at Delhi  One night at the Popular quot south indian quot hotel  and we beat a hasty retreat  We had the address of Hotel Sunrise but NOT thier telephone number       Hence the next day we made it a point to SEARCH for the hotel and finally found it  Next to Regent Hotel Opp Clark Hotel Road Saraswathyg Karol Bagh New Delhi  The Hotel is brand new and it shows  Rooms are small but neat and clean  The staff is very courteous and though the restaurant is not yet open the Room service more than adequately makes up for it  The location is excellent and the room service is good Since we are going to be staying in delhi for six days it suits our budjet and serves our purpose  I would recommed this to all budjet travellers who are looking for a cozy nook in the centre of the city  
P => Nice Clean and Cozy Hotel   
P => Hotel b sico para pasar poco tiempo en Delhi

P => Okay though a nice respite from hectic Delhi We stayed here as part of an Intrepid Tour North India Highlights  The hotel was a good area with lots of shops and was very close to the Metro  Both times at the beginning of the trip and at the end we were placed in rooms that faced the street  While we had windows the street noise was pretty bad though it was generally quiet from about midnight to  am or so  The bed was comfortable the bathroom was large and there was plenty of hot water  The staff was nice though sometimes pushy  We did eat at the restaurant once on the rooftop and the food was actually pretty good  
P => Great location clean and comfortable rooms  We stayed here as part of our Intrepid Northern India Highlights tour  It is in a great location with some excellent shopsrestaurants and the metro within walking distance  The rooms and clean and comfortable with snacks and a minibar  The bathrooms are pretty good with big corner baths and a powerful hot shower  The staff are friendly and helpful  
P => Good Economical Hotel Nice hotel close to the city  Fairy noisy at night time but noise level just enough to get some sleep  Room and bathroom were very clean modern and spacious  Staff friendly and helpful  Overall a good hotel at a very reasonable price  Ideal for short stays  
P => quite good and clean We stayed in this hotel twice whilst on a group tour of Northern India  Once at the beginning of the tour and then at the end of  days  I had looked at photos on the internet and was pleasantly surprised that our room was better than we expected  It was a good size  located at the back and had a window and good sized bathroom  It had ble floors cable TV tea and coffee making facilities which was good and the or was a bit kitsch but okay  It was very clean and the linen was white and fresh and the bed fairly comfortable for India  so many are like concrete  It was very cold in Dehli in uary so we had to ask for extra blankets as the room was freezing  On our final visit our room had a lovely warm heater  It was a bit noisy and we could hear all the goings on at reception  we were on the ground floor and also hear people arriving at strange times in the night  The breakfast area is a bit like a dungeon below with no ambience and we were served white toast jam hard boiled eggs and there was a choice of a few Indian dishes  The food in the hotel was ordinary compared to what we ate at other restuarants  The location is okay but not really near anything much   the ket was closed on a Monday when we were there  It is cheap to catch an auto rickshaw to Connht Place though and the metro is nearby which is cheap and clean  
P => Kitsch or pushy staff small rooms   but ok for a couple of nights or is kitsch but new modern and not unpleasant  Theyve tried to achieve a Swiss chalet style effect leading to some strange features such as wood panel print ceramic tiles in the bathroom  There is a tight ble staircase running down the middle of the hotel and a very slow but spacious elevator  Rooms are small and the bathrooms are very small On the plus side the fittings are all new and the room is comfortable  Cable TV  Demand a room with a window otherwise you will probably be assigned my room   which was windowless  I pulled back the curtain to find a window built into a ventilation shaft  Breakast buffet is good  The food is delicious  The buffet is served downstairs in the pool sauna steam room area Ambience Noisy  The rooms seem to have little soundproofing between them leading to some embarassment about using the bathroom when ones neighbour is in residence BEWARE of ridiculous add on charges when you leave  Suddenly there is a charge for use of the steam room downstairs or the internet in the lobby  These are nonsense charges   if you didnt sign an invoice agreeing to pay it at the time   as you would with a room service bill for example   then you dont pay it  I stood there saying Im not paying for it as each one of these silly charges came up  I had the feeling that it was a self ennrichment measure run off the books for the benefit of the front desk staff and bell boys  Threaten to go to the Tourist Police if they continue to talk at you the staff rely on your sense of politeness and dislike of confrontation to hassle you into paying more  The staff quickly backed down when challenged on these charges and when they heard me say definitively that I would not pay it The check out experience really soured me on the hotel  
P => Get the right room We stayed there twice  The first time we got a small room one side of the bed was against the wall so you could only get in it from the other side with NO window and a shower room  The second time the room was bigger had a bathroom and windows   In both cases the rooms were clean  You can take a look at the hotel website which shows pictures of various rooms  Breakfast was included and in winter is served in an unattractive room in the basement with white neon lights and sort of shower curtains to divide it in two  We were also not impressed by the dirty plastic box with dirty crockery which had been put on the floor by the entrance  We didnt eat much but other people seemed to enjoy their breakfast The street is relatively quiet and not too noisy  Beware of beggars who  try their first approach as soon as you get out of your car Check also reviews of Sunstar Residency as some reviewers might have confused the two hotels  
P => 
P => Nice location clean hotel I was pretty impressed with this hotel after I read other reviews  If you are looking for a comfortable place to rest your head there is nothing wrong with this hotel  The rooms are very comfortable with great airconditioning and clean sheets and towels  The bathroom was clean and there was always hot water which wasnt the case in many hotels Ive stayed in India  The restaurant was closed when I was there and you could only have room service which wasnt brilliant but there are so many great places to eat who cares  Although it was a little expensive I felt very safe there being on my own and the staff were very helpful  Finally the hotel is not on a very busy street therefore it wasnt noisy at night  
P => 
P => average ent place I stayed in this hotel for  nights  The rooms were clean  The ac was not working properly  when I told the management they sorted that out quickly The area karol bh where this is situated  was noisy   and crowded However there was a shopping area close to the hotel There is a good eating place called Raffles If someone is looking for a ent place but without spending too much I think this is good value for money  
P => Great place I stayed here several times while having to transit through Delhi and found it to be pretty good with minimal problems  The food was great the service was prompt and the rooms were good  Its not for people desiring five star or even a good four star experience but it is a great choice for those looking for a nice three star place  The only downside is the neighborhood Karol Bagh is quite chaotic and noisy    but then again all of Delhi is that way 
P => Not sure this is the same as Sunstar Grand I have been at Sunstar Grand  To comment on the previous review I am not sure that Sunstar Grand and Residency are the same hotel  Looking at Sunstar Grands website it seems that Grand and Residency are two different hotels  They must be under the same ownership and close to each other thats why it gets a bit confusing I will post my review under Sunstar Grand  
P => great value for the money Also known as the quotHotel Sunstar Grandquot  ble floors and staircase  Nice older style with good furnishings and bed for this medium price range  Clean but worn linens good service  Plenty of water pressure  Great rooftop terrace for breakfast if you get up early only one shady table for the latecomers thankfully breakfast is also cheerfully delivered to your room     We paid USnight large double with AC  Have a local friend call and reserve the room in Hindi   youll pay less  
P => Very good value for money This place is a good surprise especially if you have tried the terrible Ata hotel before Our room was large clean confortable the bathroom huge with an amazing bathtub    The food was also excellent and service above average  I am going back there in few days and definitely recommend it  
P => Horrible Place We stayed in Hotel Sunstar for  days in ember and the experience was horrible  The room looked like a dungeom  Being in the busy Karol Bagh area there is constant noice all night and several bugs allover the room  We were changed to a different room but it was only slightly better  Having paid an exhorbitant amont of money for COX and KINGS travel agency for out Delhi Agra Jaipur trip we felt cheated  On requesting a different hotel they told us to pay by ourselves which we agreed  The travel agent called back witha hotel for  saying thats the only hotel available in Delhi as it was a busy season  We checked on the Internet and got a great deal at the Grand for  and there were tons of other hotels available COX and Kings is an unreliable travel agent set to cheat unsuspecting foreigners as we saw many Japanese staying in Hotel Sunstar DONOT STAY THERE  DO YOUR RESEARCH  LOOK FOR DEALS  and dont become a walking ATM machine 
P => 
P => KoolYaar I was with a riage party and we had booked our rooms in this hotel  We reached the hotel in the morning after a exhaustive journey by train from Chennai  But the service was good  And the tariff is an added attraction really less  Considering the area Karol B the price is affordable  Service cannot be said Excellent but considering its tariff service provided is good Proximity of Metro Rail is an added advantage  
P => Beware Must keep Copy of Reservation Confirmation to Avoid Extra Charges We stayed at Hotel Swati in y for two nights  It is centrally located and moderately priced  Included vegetarian breakfast is good too  Wi Fi internet access is included in the room rate and worked on our floor without problem  I must warn about the underhanded practice by management We had booked a quotSUITEquot with a king bed for two adults and two children with one additional bed included in the price  When we checked out we were charged for the extra bed  The manager on duty will not remove the charge until I went on the web thankfully they had web access in the lobby and showed him the confirmation email mentioning no additional charge for the roll away bed  I believe they also cheated us by giving a standard room for a price of suite since the room was very small and the roll away bed had to be quotrolled awayquot in morning because there would be no room to move about with the extra bed in there  I recommend inspecting all available room types upon check in to avoid the scam      
P => Great Family Hotel We reached the hotel late at night after  hour drive from FatehpurRajasthan  But were stumped by the hospitality of the staff even at that odd hour  Check In was quick late night menu exhaustive and service commendable The hotel is neat and clean with internet access facility and a well informed travel desk  
P => Good City Hotel It is good city hotel tucked in the shopping area of karol bagh  I Stayed in the executive room  was ent spacious and clean although air conditioner was the only ventilator for the room  It is a very professionally managed hotel  staff very friendly and helpful  Restaurant is   vegetarian but good buffet breakfast is good and safe  The hotel is close to all basic necessities and the metro rail station which is a great boon getting around delhi  Final result  good for tourist business  in city hotel   
P => nice hotel booked the hotel online after reading tripadvisor reviewsIts cheap and you get what you pay for i stayed for two saysin uary Had a very comfortable stay at this hotel Good roomlaundry service Execllent restuarant Excellent service through out the stay 
P => Good for shopping and sights We ended our  week trip in Delhi having started our trip there  We had seen most of the highlight sights on our first visit so we wanted to shop and fit in the ones we had missed  This was probably the most money we had spent on a room and choose Karol Bagh over the Connht area as prices there were a little higher and reviews not that great  This wasn t from the Lonely Planet like most of our other choices but was a good option  We d stayed in Paharaganj for the first visit and this is a good place as a base for sites but Karol Bagh is a little nicer if you want a bit more of a calm location  The hotel is on a street just off the main street in Karol Bagh and perfect for the Metro  It s about  mins walk to the station and it s really easy to use  Only  stops to Connht Place for the shops and western restaurants and a few more to New Delhi train station  Would recommend staying in Paharaganj though if travelling from New Delhi train station next day if early morning  We got a friendly rickshaw driver to take us to some of the shopping highlights from the Lonely Planet and of course we got persuaded into visiting some carpet shops on the way  Although this be many people s choice of holiday gift it was definitely not ours and if you re like us to be avoided  All the Government Emporiums and Government run places have very traditional and expensive saris ornaments and never ending carpets  Delhi apart from Paharaganj has kets bazaars and western shops too so perhaps go there first without the emporiums  The main street in Karol Bagh has lots of ket stalls and some western clothes shops worth a visit  There s not loads of restaurants but a few that you can go in after a hectic day in the city  Rooms as small but clean and have everything you need  The staff are helpful and no problems with anything there  
P => Love the Swati experience Ok so its not a Taj or an Oberoi or an Intercontinental  Its a ent hotel in the middle of a busy and accessible shopping area  For around  a night you get very good food helpful service and above adequate clean room facilities  The reason I started staying here is purely because I frequnted the hotels GujaratiRajastani restaurant so often when I was in Delhi it just made sense to stay in the hotel itself  The only problem I have is that because the hotel is located of Ajmel Khan rd one of the main shopping areas in Delhi I always end up spending so much on clothes that itll probably be cheaper for me to stay at the Hilton But if you can show some self restraint its definitely worth it Seriously I would stay anywhere else in Delhi 
P => Comfortable stay and nice professional staff  Had a very comfortable stay at this hotel  AC large bathroom amp shower cable TV refrigerator and a sitting area in the room  Staff was very accomodating and arranged a cab for us to the airport at  am  The restaurant Suruchi was excellent  Good vegetarian food and complimentary buffet breakfast  
P => Great Hotel for The Area I booked an Executive room in this hotel as a comfortable retreat at the end of a holiday in India   the rate was about  INR   USD by the time taxes etc were added   however I was very impressed Rooms   Cable TV free wi fi in room safe very rare for India aircon balcony albeit onto a noisy side street reliable hot water complimentary bottled water with the seals intact tea amp coffee making kit nibbles an evening turn down service comfortable bed complimentary morning newspaper and free breakfast  Whilst certainly not the Sheraton or Hilton I would genuinely say that this is on a par if not better than many mid range hotel rooms that I have stayed at in Western cities and was utter bliss compared to other hotels that I have stayed at in India  Location   Situated down a side street in the middle of Karol Bagh a large bustling ket and shopping precinct which as a auto rickshaw driver explained to me quotis where middle class Indians go shoppingquot   plenty of bargains to find if youre willing to be adventurous and try the non Western brands  Theres western food outlets McDonalds Pizza Hut nearby for those a bit short of willpower and ATMs complete with security guard a short walk away  Delhis fantastic Metro it puts most other world metros to shame is only a ten minute walk is very easy to use and most fares are about INR     USD  The neighbourhood is very chaotic and crowded on ket days so be not a great choice for your first night in India if youre likely to feel culture shocked   but ideal for someone who has been in the country a few days  Noise   As its on a side street and not on the main ket itself the hotel is spared much of the noise and bustle  I didnt really notice much noise at all unless I went onto the balcony   absolutely fine  A great nights peaceful sleep Service   To be honest I had very little dealings with the staff but check in was very efficient  All major cards are accepted and no mysterious charges appeared on my card statement The hotel arranged a taxi to the airport for me which was on time although the agreed price was INR    INR  more than a taxi from booked from a Delhi Police booth   although there are only a handful in the city so probably a premium worth paying for conveniences sake  Conclusion   highly recommended definitely go for one of the executive rooms if you can   the service and standard of accommodation is superlative for its location and price point  
P => Worse than Fawlty Towers I stayed here at the beginning and end of an adventure travel type tour down the Ganges  It cost about US a night  First room I stayed in had blood on the sheets and when I removed the sheets couldsee the mattress was crawling with bed bugs  Went to have a shower but shower head blew off into the side of my face  On way back in a different room the air conditioner cht fire  Actually were flames shooting out of it Took  to  minutes to get any of the staff to come and then they send the boy  No fire alarms and no evacuation of course although they did give us another room 
P => V llig  berteuert und laut  
P => Chambre toute petite et sans fen tre  
P => 
P => Very Average Service and room OK butVery much noise   rooms are not isolated from internal noise   staff begin work at am opening and closing doors taking linen from nearby cabinets talking dragging chairs and tables etc    all with much noise  Nearby room had its bathroom just behind our heads   heard every opening of water shower etc  Very annoying  Complaints did not help Hotel breakfast at nearby restaurantvery very poor   even didnt have eggs    
P => Great Staff  i had booked over the net into a another hotel that did not meet my expectations so i walked around Karol Bagh and came across Swathi   immediately got my attention clean lobby profesional staff and very helpfull  I had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff  Good manager front desk staff    infact all the staff were polite helpfull and well trained   Kuddos to them   made my stay greattt  i found the room spacious and very clean Iread about the negative reviews but i think its not fair on the staff as they go out of their way to make you comfortable an example they  the manager on duty at the restaurant even wake you up to check if you are gonna give breakfast a miss and were prepared to wait a few mins even though the time was almost up     very personalised Breakfast is unlimited in a veggeterian restaurant and its attendants right down to the doorman are very professional  Plus they have another hotel around the corner with fantastic Rajistani food  Location   Its in the middle of Karol Bagh   close to shops food outlets metro station  a must try In addition to that the nternet Wifi is free and working  Plus a computer near the front desk which helped me serach abt whr to go eat etc whilst waiting for transport  Overall very happy with the hotel   would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone who wants a safe place to stay  
P => Swati Deluxe   basic hotel with great vegetarian foodcourt We stayed at the Swati Deluxe at both the start and end of an Intrepid tour  We found the location to be very good   close a metro station  The shops around were very interesting to us   a great sweet shop nearby and the Karol Bagh kets clothes belts bags etc a block away  The rooms were basic  star  On our first stay one of the rooms had a broken chain the door could be locked but I like to have a security chain  On our second stay we were kindly allocated rooms with an interconnecting door  The rooms also seemed to have been updated which I understand was happening progressively throughout the hotel  The staff at the hotel were efficient and seemed very busy  Some staff were quite friendly  There was quite a deal of noise at night although the second stay was quieter due to location of rooms The highlight for us was the vegetarian food court next door  We loved the food and ate several meals there because there was a great variety  
P => Good Hotel With all  Star Aminites After having considerable difficulty locating a business   hotel in Delhi for a personal visit we settled on the Swati Deluxe Hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor We had a delightful stay and were very pleased with the hotel staff  They showed up at the airport as promised for the complimentary pickup  They come in an Logancomfortable car so if you are a large family with luggage cal them and let them know in advance  Our room was basic but both the room and the hotel inside was very clean  Folks who have written negative reviews are likely having inflated expectations of what   per night can get you in Delhi  The area around the hotel is great in the middle of Karol Bagh   that did not bother me so I liked the hotel esp  the courteous staff Car parking is and bus parking facility is also their  The complimentary breakfast and the attendants serving it are very professional  We had made taxi arrangements for Delhi and Agra sightseeing from hotel    Best part is internet Wifi is freeand also business center is also free  They a good vegetarian food court in the name of quotShudhquot and also they have specialty restaurant in the name was quotSuruchiquot Overall very happy with the hotel   would definitely stay there again if going thru Delhi on personal visit or Business visit  
P => Good Location Average Service I liked the location  Close to the Metro Station Restaurants  But the hotel can get its act together for Cleanliness and Service   not stay again as there are better places  
P => Above average price for a below average hotel  This hotel is located near to a metro and there are alot of similar hotel with same pricing nearby  Please bear in mind that the hotel will charges    of taxes for the price shown on the pamphlet  Remember to ask for a discount if you arrive late at night  Ovearall it is a below average hotel  
P => ent stay There are a multitude of mid range hotels in Delhi and the Swati Deluxe is a good choice  One piece of advice regarding hotels in India    bear in mind that their idea of  star  not be what you expect  The hotels are clean and the staff are usually friendly but its not going to be in line with what you would expect in the States or in Europe  I would say that the mid range hotels in India are about on par with economy motels in the States  After the athon flight the staff at Swati Deluxe were welcoming  The hotel is a little difficult to find so be sure you have specific directionsinformation to provide to your driver  The rooms are clean and they provided towels each day  The attached restaurant has very good selections for breakfast lunch and dinner  We found it very convenient and enjoyable  
P => A RAT ate my apple Our first night in India the hotel gave us a fruit basket which consisted of an apple and a banana  We left it on our TV stand and during the night I could hear gnawing sounds I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me but in the morning we saw that the apple was half eaten BEWARE Small  occupancy rooms and no working shower heads  The only positive is the buffet breakfast at the hotels restaurant  
P => Great place to stay Myself and three friends stayed in the Swati Deluxe on three erate occasions during the months of ember  to uary   We originally found this hotel through our travel group Intrepid though we returned to it when we were travelling independently The rooms are clean and comfortable with ent hot water though you will need to switch on a erate hot water tap before the main hot water tap has hot water this is India after all  Room service and a telephone capable of international calls is available in all rooms I can highly recommend this hotel because of its very helpful staff  We left literally mounds of luggage with them for weeks on end and they were only too happy to keep it for us They unfailingly organised endless taxis tours and so on for us and told us what we should expect to pay  The friendly staff were only to eager to go the extra mile and carry our luggage and so forth Just behind the hotel is the wonderful Karol Bagh ket which is lively at night and has great shopping by day including a Levis outlet and Spycar jeans  They will take up the hems for free  The two males travelling with us had extremely high quality suits tailored at Sethis for a fairly low price  for my partner for full suit and  tailor made suits in high quality wool from Scotland The foyer has free reasonable speed internet available  The only downside is that the one quotinternet cafequot nearby has a group of lazy teenagers working there who never want to switch on the computers for you and so tell you they are quotclosedquot this happened three times  We had to catch a rickshaw across town for internet The hotel is a hub for Intrepid tours and so is a good place to meet like minded travellers  
P => Swati Deluxe Karol Bagh For the ones who want to have a nice stay in Delhi the Swati Deluxe is a very well located hotel in the ket center of Karol Bagh  Its not very expensive and the rooms are okay clean at least with western facilities  You find very good and inexpensive restaurants in the area but dont go to the restaurant just beside the hotel the hotel will send you to that place for breakfast but its not good and its very expensive  Better go to the restaurant Crossroad of Bengals sweets     You can make arrangements for transportation with the hotel directly but there is a subway station close  Swati Deluxe is a safe place and you can book online directly on their website  
P => Un lujo con encanto en la ciudad de los contrastes

P => Great escape from old delhi Very good service big clean rooms food ok free breakfast  The only downside is the price but Delhi is expensive anyway  
P => Good location for a good price As mentioned in other reviews the hotel is located down a dark and dirty alley off the cycle ket in Old Delhi  There is a full time security guard at the door though we didnt feel unsafe if I were on my own that  have been different You get what you pay for   the rooms are basic dark and small  But they are clean cheap and the hotel is ideally situated for visiting the fort mosque and bazaars of Old Delhi  The hotel is also quite noisy  Our room had a shaft outside the window that must have gone up to the kitchen so we were able to hear people for most of the night  early morning  Also there is a window above the door that lets light in throughout the night  We ate in the restaurant during our stay  The hotel does not serve alcohol but they will send someone out to get beers for you at Rs  each  The food was ent and reasonably priced  Breakfast was included in the cost and although not very substantial it was fresh and sufficient Id recommend this hotel to anyone looking for reasonable accommodation in Old Delhi  It is not spectacular but it was good enough for one night  
P => location is bad This place is like only for backpakers  not for family with young teenage children  The people in the street near hotel pass bad comment on women and girls  Bad area hotel though 
P => Not bad if you want to visit Mosque and Fort Hotel is situated in the old Delhi meaning if you like to be in a quiet neighborhoud forget about it  However the hotel is in a small street and rooms are quiet Old Delhi is really messy and it can be a little harsh on your first day  However it is ideally situated if you want to visit Delhi fort and Mosque Hotel is clean and bed is comfortable and hard at the same time  We slept ok The restaurant is not good so dont go Service was nice enough not amazing though  
P => SECOND STAY IN HOTEL TARA PALACE  LOVE IT I visit Delhi every year to help with a small charity called Butterflieschildrights and have stayed in several hotels  This is by far the very best place I have ever stayed in  It is clean friendly and the food is really good  I am a female of  years and feel really safe  I have been made to feel so welcome and the staff are really caring  You dont need to stay in really posh hotels as there is no guarantee you will get the cleanliness or service you would pay for Whilst I agree that the passage way can feel a little daunting if you smile and say namastar to every one they are fine  I will be staying here every time I come to Delhi and know it will be like coming home  What more can you want  
P => Clean and tidy hotel Had booked this hotel on the internet  We were a bit doubtful when we arrived in the dark  The area is alive and very busy and the alleyway to the hotel a bit daunting  But once inside we found a very helpfu staff and travel bureau  The bedrooms are spacious very clean and the bedding was changed daily  The bathrooms were spotless  The restaurant served a very good selection of food  I would recommend this hotel to anyone  It is an interesting if lively area to wander around during the daytime  
P => The place in Old Delhi This hotel is a real find  And in the middle of the noise and madness of old Delhi It has a very helpful staff who immediately put your fears to rest when you find yourself in a Charles Dickens like neighborhood  Some fine restaurants in the area were recommended Karimquots with Mughal food is a Delhi institution since   The attached travel agency was oneof the best I have found in a long time  The agent Rameez sorted out all my problems in no time flat and made sure that I was not taken by any taxis or touts  I will stay here again in uary and get Rameez to help with all my travel plans for another month in India  He is fast at getting everything right  Better than I ma with the bookings in one spot   Just wish they had wifi in the rooms   
P => Amazing place right in the middle of old Delhi Has a free pick up from the airportkamikaze driver from the paradise of India Kashmir who drove wildly through the night streets of early morning Delhi  In the middle of an old quarter of Delhi which is run down is a modern hotel   extremely clean and cheap with a lot of helpful staff  Breakfast a bit poor but the view from the terrace of Red Fort Jama MAsjid and a Jain temple as well the life in the old quarter is delightful and priceless  A must for anyone wanting to expereince the real India at first hand  
P => A Bright Star Indeed Spent one day with my family here on arrival to India  They had a driver waiting at the airport  Very efficient personable service great rooms  You can take your valuables like laptop to the front desk for security  Tremendous views of the old city from the rooftop  Nice clean rooms with good bathroom and prompt room service First time visitors might find the approach to the hotel a bit disconcerting being in a side alley near the fort but your fears will dissolve once you enter the lobby  Took away one star on account of the ordinary food served in the restaurant  Otherwise its just awesome and highly recommended for anyone visiting old Delhi or catching a train from there  
P => Fab Place to Stay in Delhi We arrived in Delhi as our first stop for our tour of India although the taxi that we had arranged to pick us up was   hours late when you see he traffic its quite understandable and dont let it put you off  The alley to the hotel is off putting but again once you get to the hotel it is well worth it The hotel was clean and the staff very welcoming  The restaurant food is good if you dont want to venture out in the evening looking for places to stay The roof top is a must and if you like a beer the staff will bring you a table and chair to sit and admire the view peace and quiet from the hustle and bustle A fab place to stay in Delhi   dont miss it the best bit is the wonderful welcoming staff 
P => Noisy  Stayed for  nights with my girl friend and surrounding place is very crowded and noisy  Lot of poor people baggers in the area and irritate you to heights  
P => A gem in the hectic chaos that is Old Delhi This was our first stop in Delhi and whist arriving to it is a culture shock Old Delhi is chaos the hotel is a clean and tidy oasis  The alley to the hotel is not the most welcoming approach but once inside it is soon forgotten The room was well air conditioned and clean and the bathroom was a rather dated wet room but clean and served its purpose  The shower did not always have hot water seems to be available more in the morning than at any other time The rooms are basic but adequate but ours lacked a window which meant it was very quiet but certainly not a room you would want to spend alot of time in  To be honest it was ideal room to get over a long journey   it was so quiet we slept uninterupted for over  hours The AC worked very well The hotel has a  hr restaurant at good prices  The food is good homemade cooking the sort your mum would make if you have a Punjabi mum very tasty The breakfast is complimentary if you have Indian breakfast then all is good continental style is a little more confused but does the job The staff are excellent  The hotel has a roof terrace  You can eat and drink up here and its a great place too see Old Delhi at roof top height  The location of the hotel is excellent for the Red Fort the Mosque Chandi Chowk and shopping and the Sikh Temple The hotel has a travel desk and will book train tickets for a small fee but well worth it Would stay here again   certainly appeared to be one of the better hotels in Old Delhi  
P => Highly Recomended Hotel Tara Place It was my first time in india and i ided to go Old Delhi myself and i chose this Hotel Tara Palce and i don t regret my ision as i was a single girl they gave me a family atmosphere and i felt so comfortable and safe   my room was very clean and food was delicious and the location was beautiful with view of Red Fort and Jama Masjid  Staff great Special RAMEEZ helped me with some other travel isues  Deffinatly will be back again Highly recomended for female travelers  Thanks you Rammez for all what you did for me and i will come back soon      
P => Be wary We chose this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor especially the review on the travel agent Rameez that plans and books tours of the North   Firstly we were suppose to be picked up from the airport and there was no one to meet us we called  times and waited   hrs for a pick up The location of the hotel is down an alley way and it beats me as to how they managed to get the photos of the hotel that they have on their website as it looks nothing like it  I did not like the area in Old Delhi and didnt like leaving the room i found the men in the area looked at me as a western woman like i was scum even though i was with my husband i was still shoved on the street  I found the area to be very disgusting and dirty We booked a trip with Rameez and he was very helpful but i would suggest to anyone to make sure you confirm everythinhg with him and ask lots of questions  We have found that these travel agents are very quick to say no problem Madam  We did a tour of Varinassi Agra and Rajastan i would recommend to take your time on the trip we found alot of the time in the mornings was driving to the next destination you get there in the early afternoon do your sight seeing rather rushed in the late afternoon sleep the night and you are off again the next morning  We were assured that we can change the itinery at any time which we did as we got too tired moving on every day but the hotels werent confirmed and we would arrive in places like Jodhpur and the hotel had no booking for us and we ended up having to chase this up with Rameez and got a horrid room in the end with no TV and AC that we had paid for  They tend to make lots of excuses and pass the buck so confirm confirm confirmThe hotel that was booked in Varinassi was too far away from the Ghats because you were out of the town you were at the mercy of the travel agent who works for this company i would recommend to ask for a guest house closer to the Ghats so you can be a part of everything that is going on and not have to pay for taxis to go everywhere As for the hotel the rooms are very spacious hot water in the shower good room service Just be wary booking a trip and check all details thoroughly  
P => Wonderful hotel in old Delhi The Tara Palace is a great little hotel The staff is friendly and helpful the rooms are clean and large and the food is good  Breakfast is included and I recommend the Indian breakfast of parrathas  The airport pick up worked flawlessly which was great since we arrive at PM  The location is in the middle of Old Delhi not on the normal tourist traili which can be intimidating for newcomers  But I walked by myself as late as PM and had no trouble at all  It is only blocks from the Chandni Chowk ket a classic old style Delhi ket full of wonderful surprises down the many side alleys  It is THE place to buy a sari if you are looking or lots of other things and is awesome to walk around  The Red Fort is also just a few blocks away and is a must see  If you stay here be sure and check out the roof  It is a great place to check out another view of the city and the hotel staff will bring you tea or even your whole meal up here  For the price and if you want to see the real Delhi this is a great hotel and nxt time in Delhi I am staying here again  BTW I am a  year old white American  
P => A Special Place to see the real Delhi If you want to see real Delhi this is the place  It is a clean comfortable well presented hotel with pleasant and helpful staff  Room pleasant but no view aircon ok and not too noisy Location down a little side street  seem quite intmidating but I found this was not the case at no time did I feel at risk  What is special is that not only can you see Red Fort and other sites from roof but the atmosphere of the area  During the day hotel located iin bicycle ket which is lively  At night it becomes a fruit and vegetable ket with sellers setting up pitches on the road side with camping lights to display their products  The area just comes to life and you can see the real Delhi in one place  
P => Nice and safe place Nice and cheap hotel  The rooms are clean and youre just in the middle of old town not so far from metro line  We stayed there  nights avoid the room near the kitchen because theyre always at work  
P => A nice place to stay in the heart of Old Delhi  We booked the first night of our tour in India and the pick up at the International Airport they were there to wait for us which was a good start indeed  The hotel is clean the staff efficient and helpful  The location of the hotel could appear at the first glance not very safe as the place is very crowed but we felt safer wondering on foot there than in Paharganj  
P => In the heart of the old city Very clean rooms confortable after a crazy day on the streets of old Delhi very quiet nice and allways available staff to help you with anything you need  The location couldnt be better  Great food we could say it was one of the best food we ate in India Great value for price  
P => Old Delhi Palace We chose this hotel because it looked quite nice for its price and the location was quite interesting for a first contact with India the hotel itself on a alley in the middle of old Delhi in walking distance to the Red fort the big mosque and the NDLS and DLI railway stations  The rooms are clean and tidy the neighborhood is quiet and the staff is nice and helpfull the restaurant has excellent food be the best food we ate in India available h a day 
P => Tara Palace   good clean hotel in Old Delhi I booked  nights at Tara Palace based on the recommendations from TripAdvisor and other sites  I was to arrive in the late evening and this was my first time in India so I asked them to send a car to pick me up at the airport and sure enough there was the guy with the sign ny name just recognisable at the exit which was reassuring  We drove through the Delhi night and arrived at the entrance to the alleyway where Tara Palace is located   the alley looks unwelcoming if not actually dangerous but the hotel is there  The staff were polite spoke good English and got me to my room with a minimum of fuss   this was about am by now  The room was clean and quiet   no complaints  The window opened into a small gap between buildings so theres no view to look out on but the aircon worked and theres a roof patio which offers a great view of Old Delhi Breakfast is included   Western style or Indian as you prefer   and was perfectly OK  Tara Palace is very close to the Jama Masjid mosque and the Red Fort   there are great views of both from the roof  Old Delhi is what Id imagined it to be   bustling crowded full of stimulating sights and sounds and happily almost entirely devoid of the tourist oriented commercial hassle that spoils so many popular destinations  I met a few other guests while I was at the hotel and the locals in the area were generally polite and helpful although you need to keep your eyes open when walking on the street because the traffic especially the cycle rickshaws doesnt follow the rules of the road that you might expect in a Western cityI used the internet PC thats located in the reception area of the hotel to check e mail etc although I found I couldnt upload from my USB device   a very minor drawback  On my last day at Tara Palace I arranged to leave my luggage while I wandered around Old Delhi and at the end of the day the hotel called a taxi to take me on to the airport The hotel was reasonably priced and clean the staff were helpful the food was good and I had no cause to complain about anything  If you plan to stay there you might do well to get taken there by cartaxicoach rather than try to make your own way as its a little way off the main road through and you could walk right past the alleyway and not see the hotel sign  All in all I would be happy to stay at Tara Palace again  
P => An oasis of calm in Old Delhi I stayed here twice the first time was planned and the second was because I wanted to see more of Old Delhi  If you want to get to know Delhi properly it is your best choice   you will get up close and personal with itI can see that the location could be a bit intimidating on first sight but the bicycle ket is a fabulous place and the people are brilliant The hotel was excellent  Its clean and comfortable the staff are fabulous   they want to help and dont try to sell at all costs  The food was as good as any I tasted on my trip and the waiters were great guys The front of house team were also first class   you can trust their travel desk to do the best for you and to give advice without expecting a sale Ill be back its high on my list favourites 
P => What a sweet clean deal loved the rooftop view First time to Delhi so many surprises upon arrival The last thing we wanted was a dirty scary hotel  Dont worry when you pull up and have to walk down a dark narrow street  it is back there  We LOVED Hotel Tara Clean quiet good breakfast included nice shower great rooftop view We   women woke up and walked around Old Delhi for an hour taking in the sights and ALL the people  Perfect hotel especially for the price 
P => Budget hotel for those who dont mind that sort of thing  Were a family of five   and  and we booked this hotel based on the reviews here  Heres our takeThis was our first trip to India and we ided to skip the tour groups and set it up ourselves  We booked Tara Palace online off of their website and the room was immediately charged in full on my credit card We paid  per night per room  We booked  nights the first  nights of our trip and the last night when we returned to Delhi  We booked a car and driver who picked us up from the airport but wasnt familiar with Tara Palace  After a phone call to a friend we headed the hour drive from Indira Gandhi airport to the hotel  The hotel was called en route and porters helped us take our bags from the car and down the dark alley  OK  Lets talk about this alley a bit more  The hotel is situated in the quotold cycle ketquot where vendors are selling their wares and tires hang from shopkeepers hooks  Tara Palace has a large neon sign from their roof which can be seen from a mile away but when closer to the hotel theres just a x sign at the alleys entrance  Into the alley and youll see closed shop doors and an old bar entrance called quotKing Kongquot no longer in business  The alley then does a quick left and right turn and after another  feet youll get to the hotels door  A friendly security guard opens the door for you and youre then into the tiny lobby The lobby had a couch a tv usually turned to the local cricket game reception desk and a free internet connected computer this can be used in  minute increments and was always available which was nice as the hotel didnt have wifi  Check in didnt take long and we were soon off to our rooms numbers  and   The hotel has an elevator but usually we opted for the stairs as it was as quick  Now for the rooms  The first thing I noticed when I entered was the smell  The hotel must mitigate an insect problem with moth balls as the bathrooms sink and floor drain had a couple a piece  At first keeping the bathroom door closed was fine enough unless we wanted to use the bathroom but after a while I did something that I cautiously recommend  I flushed the moth balls down the toilet which got rid of the smell  Sorry Tara Palace that was me  Speaking of which western toilets and TP were there and there was the ubiquitous spigot and bucket as well as a built in toilet bidet thingy which never worked in any of the rooms  The shower needs to be run a couple minutes before getting hot and didnt have the best of water pressure  The floor is pretty much flat in the bathroom so expect to get most of the floor wet including area around the toilet  There was also the bucket system available but since I was too embarrassed to ask the clerk how to do that I dealt with wet floors  The beds were adequate  The basic white sheets with a scratchy fiber sheet on top  They were relatively clean although one room had a visible stain set in on it they were washed at least  The mattresses are firm but we found that to be on par with the rest of the hotels we stayed in in India from low end to high end hotels  There are no extra sheets or pillows supplied in the room either  The rooms had functioning air conditioners and ceiling fans which only work with the key inserted in the wall  We were in three rooms altogether  and  and  instead of  on our return visit  If you get these rooms dont expect a view from your window  To be more specific dont book this hotel if you want a window to look out onto anything  One had a window in the bathroom which if opened would look into the hallway the other looked into a small x hole that went up to the roof  Also the rooms have a dormer window over the rooms door  In  this wasnt a problem for me as the room was L shaped and the bed didnt have a view of the door  The other  rooms were square shaped and as such the hall lights shone through the frosted glass and lit up the room  A free breakfast comes with the room up to  per room since we had  people we were charged  rupees for the extra  Order the american breakfast which included a one egg omelet toast with jelly a small bowl of corn flakes with hot milk and mango juice  Why with all of these negatives am I giving this hotel a high rating The first is the price  Delhis hotel prices are a bit higher than other cities and this was a good price for a clean hotel  The other part is its location  The morning after arriving in Delhi and spending a night in Tara Palace we woke up around am and took a long walk around the area  We discovered that we were very close to Chandni Chowk about  blocks away  The entrance to the Red Fort is about  blocks away  Jama Masjid was also within walking distance as well as countless other shops as well  Once we learned how close we were to Red Fort autorickshaw drivers who werent familiar with Tara palace had no problem taking us to Red Fort and then we would walk the short distance back to the hotel Close restaurants within relative walking distance were Karims McDonalds and Moti Mahal The last is recommended as it was a nice clean place that served delicious fare at reasonable prices On our return to Delhi we stayed one night at Tara Palace but our flight wasnt until am  We talked to reception and were allowed to stay in our room for half price until pm  
P => Old Delhi is a shock to the senses We stayed at the Hotel Tara Palace on the first night of our  week holiday touring India Old Delhi was a real shock to the senses for me    perhaps I was a little naive  The noise is deafening constant hooting animals all over the place no pavements and a great deal of rubbish all around It would be fair to say that my heart dropped when I saw that our hotel was down a dark alleyway      what had I doneThe hotel however was very clean  The staff were helpful and courtious and our room was large Due to a cancelled flight we had to alter our booking at short notice they were very willing to assist care for our bags and advise us on travel plans As we stayed in uary when it was quite cold in the evening they supplied a fan heater  We had tv will plenty of channels a large bathroom a comfortable bed and I would say it was very good value for money The walls were quite thin so if you are a light sleeper I would recommend ear plugsBreakfast was nice and we also had supper on one night which was excellent  No alcohol served here I didnt enjoy wandering around in the evening and there werent really any nice restaurants around McDonalds around the cornerThere is free internet for guests in the lobby I would recommend this for people of a budget but if you are not I would prefer to stay in Connht Place as it is cleaner and quite nice to wander around in the evening Total nights staying at the hotel   
P => great value near red fort probably as good as you will find in the chaotic centre of old delhi  Iquotve been to india a few times so know what to expect and this hotel was certainly better than my hopes  Yes it is located in a run down area but this is truly the centre of old delhi   and the streets are buzzing with indian daily life All the facilities are cleanthe rooms bright with adequate facilities the restaurant is fine the staff helpful  the price is a bargain for this standard of accom all in all a no brainer  I will recommend this to friends without hesitation 
P => Great value for money This has to be the best quotvalue for moneyquot hotel in Delhi  The location is great for the Red Fort and in the midst of Old Delhi  Take advantage of the complimentary airport pickup   its good to have a driver who knows how to find the hotel as it is down an alleyway  We stayed at the hotel on two occasions and both rooms were clean and functional  The complimentary breakfast was basic but given the price that you pay for the room which included breakfast it was fine We would definately recommend this hotel to travellers to Delhi Dont be put off by the entrance to the alley way   theres a gem of a hotel at the end 
P => nice place   location is tough This place was very nice    clean with good serivces warm shower etc    the price is a bit high  The location is tough in general old Delhi but the hotel certainly stands out as an oasis  Its a bit tricky to find so I would try to arrange a pick up at the train or bus station or airport  Pretty close to the subway and Red Fort    might want try to avoid walking around in the early morning though before sunrise    depends what youre looking for but you will certainly see the old delhi side of India 
P => Basic stay at the Tara Well we needed a place for a quick overnight after flying nearly  hours and then having a flight the next morning  The hotel was pretty average and the walls were pretty thin  The bed was relatively stiff but we were so tired after all that flying that it didnt really matter  For the price it was not too bad  The alleyway was a little scary coming in late at night but was much less so in the day light  The area where the hotel is located is a bit dirty but you wont really escape that if you spend any time in Delhi The breakfast that was included wasnt bad either 
P => Noisy as hell Clean and an interesting location in the middle of a ket but it is impossible to sleep They have the tv blasting  hours a day downstairs at reception and you can hear it in the rooms The other annoying thing is the lift buzzer I went for breakfast on the first day and they had jugs of water  I said mineral water and pointed at the jug  The waiter said quotYesquot  Then ten minutes later after I had drunk two glasses of water a bottle of mineral water turned up Avoid unless desperate They did arrange an airport pickup which was good  
P => Best in Old Delhi I stayed here for a week in ober   Pre paid airport pickup was prompt and as promised  The hotel is wonderfully located if Old Delhi is what you want  It sits at the end of a small alley that looks scary at first but once you get used to the ebb and flo of the area you see that it is busy but safe  The hotel room was very clean  The included breakfasts were solid  The desk staff was excellent  Two negatives both avoidable you WILL get pressed for trips etc  by hotel people  If you want to take them up on it Im sure theyll do a ent job  I wasnt interested made that clear and they very quickly left me alone  Second I had to leave a day early and the hotel refused to refund my last days pre paid payment  Suggestion dont prepay except the first night  All in a all a great very attractively priced clean and safe hotel in Old Delhi    one of the few  
P => Great hotel best choice in Delhi For our first night in Delhi we chose this hotel after reading reviews and comparing different sites we were very happy with our choice very good and clean room very good pricegreat location in Old Delhi nice and helpful staff never tried to sell us anything which is much appreciated in India    lovely breakftast internet We were so happy that we chose it again later on our journey I do recomment to stay here  it is a pity that is not recommended on the guides I had the Rough GuideOf course Old Delhi streets are a bit shocking if it is your first time in India but we loved it and preferred to stay there and visit around and get lost in the alleys and the bazaar 
P => Great place the other glowing reviews were accurate  ProsPerfectly Clean and they seem to clean your room everyday a plus in India it seemsGreat Location    minute walk to Red Fort subway station McDonalds and ATMsVery helpful front deskQuiet insideNice construction for the price white ble floors etc Good free breakfast included proper breakfast not muffins and juice boxesConsNeighborhood is very very dirty and very very poor  Its really a bit horrible your first time  Much of Delhi is that way though  ConclusionOur favorite of  hotels we used in India and ironically the cheapest  Aside from the disgusting neighborhood everything about it is great  
P => Clean hotel spotty service The hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff are lovely  Its located in a small alley in the back of Old Delhi which  be a bit overwhelmng for a first time visitor but I found it to be one of the more interesting neighborhoods in Delhi The service was inconsistent which was a real let down  I waited an hour at the airport for the prepaid pickup and when nobody arrived set out on my own   hours one taxi and one rickshaw later I finally located the hotel  Note that their booking confirmation forms have no address or phone number on them so write them down aratelyThe hotel solicited information about my plans then recommended a travel agent who turned out to offer very poor value  The first day he sent a driver in a non AC car that rattled all over Delhi  Id asked for hotels like Tara Palace and although I was charged similar rates got some substandard hotels in Agra and Jaipur and a replacement driver who insisted on taking me to commissioned quotcrafts shopsquot despite the owners insistence that they wouldnt  If Tara Palace is going to quiz their guests about plans then send them to a recommended travel agent they should make sure the agent is delivering what he promised and value for money  
P => Good clean and friendly hotel in Delhi This hotel is new with spotlessly clean spacious rooms and comfortable beds  The staff were exceptionally friendly they bent over backwards to assist and the restaurant food was OK  Internet is available in rooms if you have a PC and the room and laundry service was good There were insufficient blankets on the bed on arrival but more were secured from reception after a phone call  This seems to be common in India in that you are given one single top sheet and one single blanket for a queen sized bed  This happened several times in various places  The location was good and central as long as you didn t mind going down an alley probably better for groups or couples than solos  The Red Fort and metro only a short walk away A very good hotel for the price and a great find in Delhi where many of the hotels are a disgrace even if you pay much more We would definitely stay there again  
P => Service with a Smile I arrived at by myself at night  and as a female was a little apprehensive  I was a little put off at first as it is tucked away down a lane in a not so welcoming part of Delhi  But upon entering I was given excellent friendly warm service  The rest of our party of  arrvived over the next day and all received the same treatment  The rooms were clean and neat  The restaurant served tasty food and nothing was too much trouble  The rooftop terrace provide excellent views over the Red Fort  Perhaps if you were travelling solofemale or first time to India it is not idealbut for couples or groups it is fantastic  Would recommend  Internet access in the rooms plus cable TV prompt  hour room service  Nearby is busy Chandi Chowk which in day is colourful and you can buy fresh fruit at kets  Nearby is Haldirans  great clean Indian fast food plus fantastic sweets And if you must there is also a Mcdonalds nearby 
P => So So Hotel If what you are looking for is a clean room then you will get what you are looking for here  This can be a difficult thing to find in many hotels in Delhi  Unfortunately it is in a really bad neighborhood  But then again unless you want to stay in a really expensive hotel in Delhi it is going to be in a bad neighborhood  The location is good for some of the sightseeing  It is right across from the Red Fort and very close to some of the other sights but dont expect to be able to wander around past sundown  The key thing for us was that it was clean  If your taxi driver insists on calling ahead to quotconfirmquot your reservations it is a scam  He will pretend to call and then tell you your room is double booked and try to divert you to another hotel where he gets a hefty commission  Insist on going to the hotel  Your room is still available  This is a common scam 
P => Budget Hotel TaraPalace  Nice Interior Helping staff great nearby Historical Hotel was clean with an impressive lobbyalthough the room was smallish but had all the facilities there The historic places near the hotel like Red Fort Raj Ghat Gurudwara Sheesh Ganj and many other places of Old Delhi are at walking distance form the hotel Hotel staff was very friendly and supportive but the thing which was most useful for me was the internet connection the my room as I am a techie   so cant live without it I would like to visit this hotel again soon

P => Hotel Vikram Hotel Vikram offers all the facilites you want  They are though a ona littl eexpensive side I guess for the tariff that they charge you could easily tak eosme other luxurious hotel  Theer isnt anythign special   Teh locations doe not have any major scenic locale no views etc  The place aslo is hoem to a lot of unwanted people read Prositutes etc  You might run into some drunk men also The good thing is the breakfast that they give  its a buffet amp really lavish   N really yummy 
P => good value clean hotel but    I had stayed there for one night and had some good sleep  It costs me around USD include breakfast so quite good value  Very clean but it has no air con in the washroom and it is very hot this time round C  The control over the air con in the room is not function but luckily it has a very pleasant ceiling fan  Happy with its size and cleaniness However very unprofessional receptionist with dirty hands and uniform no smile and it seems bothering her when checking in  Usually they will let you get out of the lift first and they will follow when showing you to the room but this receptionist pushed me a bit and she get out first this is rude Dont eat western food like carbonara as it never looks like one although it is a simple crusine asian food looks and taste better  Be careful they charge you  rupees for an hour internet usae which I think is outragoues  
P => A hotel in Delhi A ent and reasonably priced hotel in Delhi  Value for the money and the hotel is kept clean and maintained well  The staff are very cooperative and helpful  Very close to many business establishments and would suggest for people who do not want to spend more money on accommodation and want a good quality and comfortable stay in Delhi 
P => Good facility Had travelled to Delhi with a group of about  people on a business trip and was in charge of all the logistics arrangements  Hotel Vikram was recommended by the travel agent and visited it before confirming the booking  The rooms are very clean freshly done up and comfortable  Specifically choose a carpeted room especially in winters as the rates are the sameStayed there for  days with the entire group and didnt face a single complaint from the guests  The food at the in house restaurant is good and so is the room service  Just that the swimming pool was under maintainance during our stay Location is very accessible and at walkable distance from the popular Lajpat Nagar ket All in all a good choice and fair value for money  
P => Best Location in Delhi My friend told me about this hotel it is value for money in everyway ie foodalcholroom etc so overall you dont end up spending much in the hotel Quality of food is also vey good infact I had the best Indian food here Staff is very helpful and best part is location its right next to all the bars shopping and also work places        
P => Budget hotel for  nights This is one of those hotels with the archetypal Indian doorman complete with giant moustache and turban  A nice touch when you first arrive but that elty wears off  Metal detectors were installed at the entrance but don t work  This set the standard for what was to come  The room was adequate though the immovable shower head was annoyingly weak and being ft tall I had to bend me knees in order to get under it  Being in the city I can accept it being noisy in the night but with the bathroom vent woefully covered with plastic from the outside and pigeons coming and going it wasn t pleasant  The bed was saggy and the sheets had seen better days  The restaurant was orated well which made it pleasing to the eye  The food on the a la carte menu was one of the hotel s stronger points with a fair selection at reasonable prices  The breakfast buffet was in contrast sparse and so could have done with more continental choices like pastries There is no gym and the outdoor pool was closed in the winter season  For the  night stay we had it was average but I would be reluctant to stay there again especially if it was any longer than  nights  
P => Brown shower water honking horns The hotel is located near the hospital I was intending to visit near Nehru Place  The hotel has a small restaurant there are taxis available and the hotel itself is no beter or worse than your average US economy hotel  They have a little garden out front and the restaurant is clean  I did not like the noise of the cars honking all night long the hotel is near a major street  The hotel itself is quiet but apparently doesnt have double hung windows or soundproofing  There was a jalousie window in the bathroom that opened directly out onto the street which also made the bathroom hot and noisy compared to the room  The water ran brown in the bathroom the last day and the water temperature was tempramental during my visit  I used the dry cleaning service and they  washed  my wool business dress ruining it  I would stay this is a fine hotel for a budget tourist trip but I wouldnt stay here on business  If you stay here bring ear plugs  
P =>  stars at best do not recommend My Background I am a frequent international business traveller US Europe China amp India and when on personal vacation an adventure traveller Europe South America Africa APAC Hotel Vikram ReviewI would stay here if  you are on a tight budget looking for a below average hotel to stay  you are a local Indian business man with non western expectationsI wouldnt stay here if  personal vacation in Delhi  business travel with western hotel expectations  with familyIn a nut shell this hotel is  stars at best  Its safe has AC if it doesnt fail clean bathroom and a comfortable bed  Its a very basic hotel  I recently travelled to Delhi for a trade show and stayed here because my local sales manager had booked us here  I had reserved a Luxury room which is loosely defined  When I checked in I asked for a non smoking room and was led to a room with a single bed i e  prison size bed  Apparently all their non smoking rooms have single beds   which is tucked away beside a wall that was fairly stained  I had immediately asked for another room with a double or queen size bed but was told all rooms with larger beds are quotsmokingquot  Since I was staying here for almost  nights I wanted a ent size bed to sleep in so I braved the smoking room  It turned out to be ok with no distinct smoking smell  The carpets in the room are quite old and worn and not overly clean  The bed is comfortable but the clean staff for some reason always wrap the comforter the covering that never gets changed around the pillows which makes the pillows not very appealing to sleep on  The sheets are well worn and have stains that cannot be washed out  The rooms do not have ironing boards or an iron so you have to dial room service to get one every morning   which usually takes   minutes to arrive i think they must only have one and its shared among all the guests every morning  When it does arrive the iron is from the s and is basically a piece of metal with a handle and an electric cord  It does not steam etc  like a modern iron  The ironing board is heavily yellow stained like someone urinated on it  The bathroom is quite small but usable  My room in particular did not have running cold water in the sink  The shower has good water pressure  Half way through my stay the motor of my rooms AC died in the middle of the night so I had to change room again  times in total within  days  Every room has wireless Internet but the connection is quite slow  A weeks worth of Internet is  Rs but if you put it from the front desk instead of online its a bit cheaper  The staff is generally friendly  The restaurant downstairs is not bad although the breakfast is quite basic  By default they serve you instant coffee so you need to ask for quotblack espressoquot in which case they brew it from a machine  The Indian food in the restaurant is pretty good as I ate there a few evenings after long days  Room service is efficient and quick  The hotel has a Tourist desk that can arrange tours to Taj Mahal  Itll cost you  Rs to hire a private car and driver  A guide will cost another  Rs which you paid to the guide directly  The drive to AgraTaj Mahal is about   hours so leave early am  Would I go back again No  However my expectations might be different than others so if you are looking for a  star quality hotel than Hotel Vikram is fine  But if you are a westerner travelling on company business I would recommend you stick to a western chain hotel  The location of hotel is irrelevant as you have to take a cab everywhere anyway in Delhi generally  The noise level outside the hotel is pretty loud   I can always hear frequent car honks and dogs barking in my room so if you are a light sleeper you might have trouble sleeping I hope this helps the next person make their choice  I paid  Rs for my room  Hotels in Delhi are generally expensive due to lack of rooms and high demand  Bare in mind that price of a hotel room does not necessary reflect its quality like it normally does in North America or Europe  
P => Reasonable value   we would go again My family  Adults and  Children stayed at the Vikram at the end of ober  for  days  Having previously been in India in  and at the time for what was then called the riott Hotel its name has changed now  cant remember what we paid   room only we were now alarmed to find that an average room in a   hotel was   per night  We therefore ided to go for a cheaper option bearing in mind we could run into problems with this isionHowever we were pleased to find that the Vikram is a clean and friendly hotel  It is about a  minute taxi ride from the centre of Delhi depending on traffic conditions  We negotiated Rs  per night for a luxury room including  extra beds and breakfast  In all honesty we have to say it equalled the   hotel we previously stayed in if you are a tourist  In fact the luxury room was larger than the room we stayed at in the riott If you are looking for a clean hotel in Delhi at a reasonable cost then the Vikram is fine  In the UK it easily exceeds Travelodge Premier Lodge etc  However   for room service the alcohol was expensive   especially wineThe swimming pool was dry in ober and we are not sure when it will be refilled  If you are looking for a reasonable price then we would have no hesitation in recommending the Vikram  Remember   in the UK isnt necessarily   in India   it is perfectly adequate  
P => Could do a lot worse We spend a bit of time in Delhi on business and have stayed in a number of hotels  Whilst I agree that there are some problems with the hotel yes the staff arent very friendly it feels much more homely than all others in the City  The snacks in the bar are terrific try the chili chicken and its a great place for a quiet beer after a full on day in the hustle and bustle that is Delhi  There are some interesting walks around the hotel into what I presume to be fairly up ket areas with their own common gardens and the ket is mightily impressive if youre into shopping  
P => great for this price range In Delhi you can either spend  plus for a luxury hotel or take a risk at the lower ranges and hope for the best  We wanted the Ambassador which is very centrally located but they were booked so we tried Hotel Alka  bad choice  dont stay thereIn the morning we packed our bags and went searching for something better and ended up at Hotel Vikram in Lajpat Nagar  Its about  min or so from Connht etc but close to the Lotus Temple and other sites and Greater Kailash which has great shopping and restaurants as well as the Lajpat Nagar ket which is very good much better prices then downtown The hotel has recently been refurbished so the carpets and rooms are new and very nice and the bathroom was small but nicely done even better than the Taj Mahal bathrooms  The staff was very kind and helpful and we were thrilled to find it after our terrible experience at Alka Not good for wondering around outside but good for a safe haven after an intense day in the city  Its clean nice and friendly and not too far from the airport always depending on traffic 
P => Pristine refuge in the heart of Delhi We recently spent three nights at the Hotel Vikram and had a wonderful time  Rooms were spotless and comfortable an ideal refuge after a day of sightseeing    furnishings were new and tasteful shower and bathroom extraordinarily clean and traffic noise minimal  Service was impeccable from the front desk to the travel desk and hotel drivers to the very efficient room service  Breakfast was also quite good with a good selection of continental and Indian specialities  Convenient location too  Great value excellent hotel 
P => 
P => Pathetic Hotel Hotel WELCOME PALACE IS A PATHETIC HOTEL  mR miglani owner of this hotel is a cheat  All commitments are false Beware of this hotel they are fraud 
P => Disliked the attitude of the employees the most We have just returned from a trip to new delhi  We stayed in this hotel for most of the time and had the worst experience there When we first checked in we asked for the exact pricing of the rooms and cabs etc    so that we dont get conned later on  We then arranged for a cab to take us to the train station the next day and a wake up call at  am  The next day we wake up at  because there was no wake up call When we finish pack up our things and go downstairs at the reception we find that no taxi has been arranged When we ask the manager he tells us nothing has been written in the books He then arranges a taxi for us and bills us Rs  for it instead of the Rs  that he told us before and says that he is giving the big cabWhen we returned from our trip from kanpur we waited at the platform  of the train station for a person with a board with our names this also was arranged earlier with the hotel After waiting for  minutes and seeing that no one is coming we ided to arrange for the cab ourselves and return to the hotel  Now on the day that we are returning  i e  checking out the bill contains  taxi for the day at the train station together with parking costs etc    when we were not even provided this service from them Then for the cab to go to the airport he charges more than he agreed upon beforehand Then another thing i did not like at all in this hotel is the fact that the waiters keeps pestering us for giving them tips  When we first checked in being all guys we carried our luggage to our rooms ourselves however the waiters would just come to our rooms with towels and i dont know for what reasons and stay there for long time waiting for their tips One of them even asked me directly if we are going to give them something before going That shocked me the most A tip is given if you think that the service was good and it shows that we liked it but these guys make it seem as if that the tip is compulsory whatever the type of service you getFinally i would not recommend anyone to go and stay in this hotel unless you like to be ripped off and conned This place has its location as its only good point the attitude of the people over there are just disgusting The rooms are very badly maintained with no hot showers and badly done electrical installation 
P => The worst you could get Dont be fooled by the name of the Hotel    You would neither be welcomed properly    nor it is a Palace whatsoever    In fact its the total opposite   I dont know if the owner ever says anything true in his words    Everything you ask is quotOKquot but without any concrete actions    No wake up calls that has been confirmed on the eve by him   Cabs    lol I could write a book about this part    Well in brief    Cabs scheduled on the eve are nowhere to be found at the said time Tadaaaaaa The owner didnt write it in whatever book And the price    once he knows you got no other choice than taking the cab he would propose because of time constraint the price keeps on rising   The rooms are among the worsts Ive ever seen    Ive been to many hotels with the same budget or even less    but this one is one of a kind    The electric wiring seems so dangerous just mere connections between wires    Beware you could be electrified The hot showers were never hot    even if you asked them to put the roof boiler on    I wonder if the bedsheets glasses bathroom are ever really cleaned   Well the only good thing in choosing this hotel is that it is near the Metro and the shopping area of Karol Bagh   But if I were you and want value for money I would avoid it at all costsP S  Beware of the lift also It can close on your limbs Better you climb up the stairs to your floor    Youve been warned     
P => I think you have all been rating the wrong hotel My fiance and I read these reviews and thought WOW such amazing reviews and so high in the Delhi hotels ranking we cant go wrong for the priceBut we did For one thing there are  Welcome palace hotels in Delhi and the one in THIS review is the one we stayed in We booked  nights in a double room with ensuit for  rupees a night online  We turned up and were given a shoe box with no AC no towels and no loo roll  Apparently these  rooms are the ones advertised on the hostel and hotel websites for  but are actually used for staf to stay in We were then expected to tip  bell boys who all jamp at the chance to grab our  rucksacks to take up  flight of stairs to the room  Which we had to do as they just hung around and waited for their tip Around  mins later another bell boy appeared knocking at the door bringing toilet roll expecting a tip i didnt know it was a luxury to expect loo roll We then ided for  rupees we should be in a better hotel with AC but were tierd so we upgraded  We were then shown every room in the property ranging from our room being the worst to  bed delux rooms  we upgraded to AC costing  a night and once again we were expected to tip  bell boys for taking our rucksacks accross the landing  Later on in the evening we had another knock from the same bell boy bringing us a towel and again would not leave the room and folded the towel twice waiting for a tip  This then continued for the rest of the stay we would arrive back after a hot sweaty day of sightseeing our room would not have been serviced and after jumping in the shower up to  knocks at the door till  pm with porters bring various things loo roll soap another towelIts a pity you get free internet and the metro is close and this whole area is much more peaceful than in town with nice places to eat and shop and to be fair a little cheaper and we would have been happy but they really need to sort out those porters they made us feel terrible sad eyed and dirty  hanging around We have now moved to another hotel Stay here by all means as the area has everything you need but I would nip the bell boy issue in the bud before you even close your hotel room door 
P => Good travel centre shame about the rat We stayed here for  nights in il   Generally the reception area was OK and the staff reasonably helpful  However the sheets on the bed had already been slept in and there were some fairly unsavoury bugs in the bathroom  Breakfast was OK but took ages to come and you have to eat it in the lobby which is where I saw the rat  However the travel desk was excellent and arranged a car for the whole day to take us round to see the town  Unfortunately my friends had a bad experience in a taxi that was arranged by the travel desk but I guess they couldnt help that Overall I would say that this hotel is acceptable if you are on a budget but I think I would try my luck somewhere else next time  
P => wonderful relaxing place stayed at this amazing place called welcome palace   where everything is easy to get food travel nice executive suiteany help any time  this is in heart of city good shoppin place around mc donalds sravan bahvan all good food joints and food of welcome palace rocks      was there for vacations after very long and i think had wonderful time    vacations was fun like never before all the best to welcome palace and their vry vry helpful employees   keep it up   Mili 
P => Amazing Staff make this hotel excellent We just returned from a fabulous three weeks touring beautiful India where we spent a total of  nights at the Welcome Palace Hotel divided into two different segments  The Welcome Palace staff made us feel like family each time we arrived arranged for our transportation with flawless efficency made sure we found the best restaurants and even took us shopping to their secret favorite shops  And these wernt the tourist trap places Their insight and friendly manner was so valuable  The hotel itself is clean and spacious They provided ample hot water once we figured out how to turn it on bottled water to drink and the room service was very good  The shinning star here is the staff     all wonderful friendly and helpful  Id recommend the Hotel Welcome Palace to anyone looking for an affordable clean and friendly hotel to make your stay in India a five star experience  
P => 
P => A basic hotel Delhi has gone haywire with hotel pricing so what you could get for a small budget even a year ago can not be found today  The Westend Inn is a very basic hotel  Its generally clean but make sure you get a reated room on the side across from the pool  Some fixtures like the soap dish in the bathroom are broken but the bed is comfortable sheets are clean the phone works theres a tv etc  Westerners should keep in mind that this is India what you might get in the US is not going to be the case here no bathtubs for example  The hotel staff speaks limited english be prepared for that in in India in general so if you want something complex the only answer youll get is yes but you wont really get what you want  The wifi is a joke it didnt work for the majority of the time we there but then again this is an India issue in general  The rooms on the second floor have better wifi reception  The business center is not a business center and again internet only sometimes work  The westend inn is not as horrific as some other reviews make it out to be but dont expect a  star experience dont expect a US  star experience either for that matter either  And regarding mosquitos youre in India they are going to exist and if its rained recently they are going to be out in force  Dont open your windows and ask for the repellent plug in you see advertised all over India The food is pretty ent here and cheap  Room service is not so great food was terrible but the buffet at the restaurant was good as were several of the other items we ordered off the menu  All in all a ent experience  
P => Favourable I have recently returned from Delhi where I visited along with some  others as part of a cricket tour Before leaving we were all alarmed at the reports on TripAdvisor However after our stay of some  days the reports were generally unfair Our party found the Hotel clean and well maintained some building work is in porgress to part of the building and the staff to be very courteous and helpful The reports about airport noise are clearly wrong The only downside is the location which is isolated from other facilities and involves an adventure in the Delhi traffic  
P => Avoid if possible Stayed here for one night en route back to the UK  I didnt pay for the room myself but was aware of how much it cost  For the price I have to say I was expecting a lot better Start with the positives room was spacious and the ble floor gave a sense of luxury  Then the negatives the furniture was a little bit worn and somewhat dusty  The bathroom was very poor the walls had patches of mildew and the fittings were covered in limescale  The toilet even though it had the quotsanitary sealquot on it had clearly not been cleaned with a toilet brush  The windows were covered in dust However the worst problem was the noise  The room overlooked a small internal courtyard that was being used as a quotutilityquot area and the staff were washing dishes late into the night  I put up with this despite being woken up by the noise at AM and about AM  When it happened again at AM I called the reception  The attitude of the duty manager I think was not helpful he suggested that I was imagining things I could see the pile of washed crockery out my window and then said he was quotsockedquot sic that this happened etc  At AM with a flight to catch the next day I came close to quotsockingquot him myself   I saw him go down there and things quietened down but started again at AM For what its worth a colleague stayed in the same hotel a few days earlier and found it fine  There are apparently quotoldquot and quotnewquot rooms be I got the old rooms  
P => Fewer stars than you might expect We were part of a British group booked into this hotel for two nights while touring Delhi  This was a change from our original hotel itinerary in the Delhi area    and it was somewhat disappointing  On the plus side it is close to the airport  But in most regards it is not up to strong standards if you are looking for a four or five star hotel  This is two or three stars in Paris at best and yet it is far from any tourist sites and shopping  The dining room food was adequate although some in our group went hungry not liking the few choices  Breafast selections especially were limited  The pool is fine and lovely in the afternoon but sunset does bring mosquitoes be sure to have and use your spray  The English language is a challenge for some of the staff so communication can be humorous or frustrating  The property itself is not bad and has potential  However some aspects of the rooms are rundown and needing more diligent and regular ongoing maintenance  The hotel is in three buildings  One has a lift the other two on two floors each do not just so you know  Overall this hotel was a disappointing ending to our week in India    our other hotels in Agra and Jaipur had been so very much nicer cleaner and better run  
P => Nighte  Avoid at all cost I am an Indian living in the US  I am extremely patriotic and proud of India  But this is not about India just a WARNING about this hotel I was transiting via Delhi and had to spend the night  The airport counter recommended this hotel and gave me a ride to the place   Check in went on well  Noticed a party going on in one of the rooms with loud music and over  guests and called the front desk if they knew about a party and when it would end  The sound was reverberating since the rooms were all facing an open center area and the volume was way up on the powerful sound system   Response quotNo we dont there is no partyquot  Hmm thats an odd response right   By around  PM it was getting louder and the children were running around knocking on doors waking people up   This triggered a whole bunch of guests mostly people transiting and spending just the one night weary and tired to come out of there rooms and complain   Now the staff said they knew about a scheduled quotReception partyquot in one of the rooms and did not let people know during check in and that they cannot ask the people to reduce their noise quotsince they were in their roomquot For crying out loud there are over  people spilling out of the room loud music reverberating and children running around knocking on all doors Its very odd that a hotel would ignore all their guest for a party  It  very well be that they got a whole bunch of money for it but shouldnt a hotel of this standard live up to it  The party went on till well over  AM  In spite of guests complaining and simply too tired from their travel do walk out of the hotel Now dont even get me started on the service at quotbreakfastquot where there were over  staff helping around  guests where two of them were ganging up on an American guest for taking a second cup of coffee  Apparently each time you take anything they need to note it down and put it on your tab Back at the airport I asked the same counter which recommended this place and found that a lot of people have bad experience at this place and that they are forced to recommend this place since the owners are politically connected Now i truly believe that all the quotStarsquot that this place  have or get is all because of the political connections  
P => stay away very run down dirty and mosquito ridden   dont believe the non smoking policy there are no non smoking rooms and they all smell of stale cigarettes  The front half of the attached building is collapsing half demolished looks like an earthquake zone  Definitely not   quality but if you can get a really really cheap deal its manageable for one night  Buffet was disorganized but OK  Yes its close to airport but nothing else is  
P => Worse hotel experience in  years    On the basis of description found on the web I expected to have  relaxing nights in a hotel with small garden and swimming pool  In fact the only positive facts about it are  it is close to the Airport indeed you hear the planes and  it has a swimming pool which you  not need so much if your aim is to sleep     In short a collection of the worst imaginable  doors are paper thin and windows have single pane which as the hotel is next to a major highway means constant traffic noise and full perception of hotel noises as well   in fact we did not sleep for more than   of the nights we spent there     staff is at best strange usually fully dismal receptionist not really speaking English understands AM for PM and therefore your airport pickup is not there for instance   also loving to wash the floor and clean the rooms in the middle of night preferably making as much noise as possible in the process and speaking really loud so you have no chance to sleep  sub optimal food  particularly gloomy court for dinner and breakfast  not so clean bathrooms  no customer service and attention  and the cherry on the pie our second night a drilling rig was operating a large one to dig a deep well just m from our bedroom   at pm I called will stop in  minutes at  will stop in  minute at  I called the manager at  I went to fetch the manager myself and drag him literally to the rig at  I had to bring the manager again and finally at  the rig stopped operating   the staff that said it will stop in xx minutes not only did nothing but did not even check   they just replied this to keep us happy  in short I did not believe it could get that bad particularly at that price  STAY AWAY BY ALL MEANS 
P => Stay Away The tour company I used booked me here for my first night in Delhi  I was appalled  There were mosquitos in the lobby and the entire place looked like it was falling apart  The walls were stained the pool had no water in it and the bedsheets were visibly dirty  The towels were gray there was no shower curtain though the curtain rings were still hanging and I felt it necessary to shower in flip flops  The only bright spot was the inexpensive internet access that allowed me to look up alternatives for my return to Delhi later in the week  
P => Sehr schlechtes Hotel  
P => 
P => touch above the average Travelling from UKwe used this hotelon the fringe of Carole Bagah mkt twice at the beginning and end of our india tour for one night on each occasion  The double room was quite generous and  situated to the rear of the building not overly affected by street noise However since the hotel finish was predominately ble including the floors we did suffer from some in house disturbance where the occupants above insisted on dragging the furniture around the floor for some reason with the resulting clangour a mite irritating  All aspects were Clean Clean Clean and this is why after reading some reviews of what can be had in Delhi we gave   Rooftop restaurant was quite enjoyable although slightly restricted menu wise  The food was fresh though and the service friendly  A hotel that delivered all that we needed and we would use it again because it throws up no horrors and avoids the lottery of selecting an alternative NB this hotel selected for us by our tour operators quotCOLOURFUL INDIAN HOLIDAYS aka PACKAGE TOURS INDIA  if you want the seeming contradiction of a fully superior service with huge savings while touring India take our unreserved recommendation  Superb throughout  
P => Very bad experience I checked in this hotel with my dhter and wife on th il night for  days  The st thing which was very shoking to us was the condition of the bed  The bed sheets and pillow covers were full of stain and were of lowest quality  On our complain the staff brought the new bed sheets  They were equally bad  Major drawbacks of this hotel what I have noticed are  Location is at a ket place  Surrounding area is dirty and full of people  Hotel rooms are stuffy  Hotel itself is cramped  No space even for taking a stroll leisurely  Breakfast is not at all worth for money  Staffs are not friendly  If you are not careful cheating will be the inevitable experience in this hotelMy good advise to any fellow traveler especially foreighners to avoid this hotel entirely  
P => Acceuil pas sympathique   
P => hotel correct et bien situ   
P => 
P => Best beds in India I am not a fan of Delhi in fact the Hyatt is the best thing there  Wonderful comfortable beds great bathroom amenities the lavendar bubble bath is lovely  Great service fast internet reasonable location for the airport  Delhi can be very smelly and quite dirty the Hyatt is a welcome respite from it  There is a pool but Ive never gone out to it the air is to vile Great spa and fairly priced excellent jet lag massage 
P => Very good  star hotel I stayed in this Hyatt in new Delhi for  days  I arrived early in the morning   am and the staff immediately arranged me in my room without any additional charge  My room was in the th floor big enough with fine oration flat screen TV coffee maker mini bar etc  The bathroom however was small with old fashion furniture in need of reation  Nevertheless my stay was fine and relaxing  The lobby area was really impressive The hotel has several restaurants international chinese east Asian Indian as well as a beautiful bar with live music in the evenings  Breakfast was very good with a lot of items and with live cooking stations  I had a dinner in the East Asian restaurant very very good althought pricey  Also I had a dinner in the quotAanganquot Indian restaurant located in the lobby floor the quality of food was excellent the service too and the live indian band playing traditional indian music was fantastic  Finally there was a gym and fitness center with sauna jaccuzzi outdoor swimming pool etc all of high quality and beauty  All the staff in every department of the hotel was extremely helpful and polite always with a smile  All in all a memorable luxury and relaxing stay 
P => Very nice but not the best We stayed two nights here and I would first commend the service at this hotel  The staff were alert attentive and courteous at all hours day and night even if my appearance was a bit disheveled after the hr flight from Chicago I dined at the Cafe and the Italian restaurant and the quality of food was very good at both   the cafe in particular had a wonderful selection of breakfast items and an open kitchen where you could see the chefs at work or make special requests  I stayed in a standard king room which was quite small   a mirror lined one full wall to create an illusion of space  The bed was fairly comfortable but not impressively so  There were fine complimentary chocolate truffles by the bar and a large LCD TV on the wall across from the bed  The bathroom was also nice with lavender scented amenities which were ok  I was a little annoyed that the bathrobe had not been washed from the previous guest but there was a spare in the closet  Overall this was a fine  star hotel but I have stayed at other  star hotels in India that were about the same price but which felt a lot more luxurious than this one  
P => Good Bssiness Hotel Great place to stay  I was only there for one night before while retrning from US to Banglore but its a beautiful place  The lobby is huge three restaurants a bar a mini golf course in the back nice pool very safe rooms were huge and very comfortable staff was very friendly  
P => Excellent Service  I stayed in the executive floor for over two weeks and can say that I had a great stay The lounge staff are very friendly and efficient  The airport transfers were very smooth  As someone stated the hotel looks drab from the outside and there isnt much to see or do within walking distance The rooms arent the biggest  The water pressure from the shower was poor  My biggest complaint would have to be the internet  It was painfully slow and the connection would drop far too much  
P => Serious comfort  Beautiful lux rooms to wash away the hectic Delhi circus The buffet breakfast is one of the best I have had I am confused as to why other travelers say it is not up to Hyatt standards I just returned from a lovely stay at the Hyatt in San Francisco and while perfectly adequate the Hyatt in New Delhi is light years better   Stay there  
P => over priced I have booked through Jet airways website under the Hotel booking section as it was offering competitive rather cheap rates in the club floor  Check inn was at the club level special desk and it was smooth  The club lounge is basic and simple and attendants are always attentive and overly curious  The breakfast at the club lounge was very basic English breakfast  Rooms are clean and soft bed with wider option of pillows The best part of the hotel is its restaurants and room dining  Variety of options and the Italian one is a must try  Over all good experience 
P => Terrible Hotel Avoid at any cost while you are in Delhi Probably the worst stay ever in any hotel in India I arrived after a long flight from London in the afternoon and after the massage went stright to a meeting and when returned in the evening called the Reception to advice the Air conditioning is not working  The technician came and checked and advised there is nothing wrong with it it will be cool soon  the whole night the temp didnt go below degrees centrigrade  As this wasnt enough although I had put a Privacy sign outside the Housekeeping kept knocking the door at am asking it to be cleaned Again I called the AC guy to fix the air conditioning before going out in the afternoongt having being told its been fixed I foolisly accepted the room was hot once again for the whole night againand hence no sleep for two days I only go to the hotels to rest and have a good night sleep both night with temp over  degrees in the room I couldnt sleepOn Saturday I had dinner at the china place the food was good but the champagne i ordered was flat Restaurant mananger duly changed the bottle which turned to be flat again  He offered another one and by that time my patience was running out suprise surprise it was flat too I just signed the bill and left leaving most of the champange in the bottle  Did I get offered apology or written off the charge no way  its not the staff fault I guess its my fault accepting to stay at your hotel for the first timeOn check out when asked how was the stay and when I explained an apology was duly given but apology doesnt give back the sleep which i didnt have for two days and fix the temp in the room and remove the frustration of the dinner without a ent glass of champagne which I was going to enjoy with my wife  The receptionist suggested to take off the spa charges as compensation which i refused as there was nothing wrong with the spa what was wrong is the charges for the room for two night and the bottle of champagne which should have never been charged as Hotel failed to provide the room at ent temp to sleep and still charged for the champagne which was flatThe receptionist promised to speak to the Rooms division Manager and the GM and lets see if they respond  I have been in the hotel business for the last  years and this stay in so called  star hotel takes the biscuit Probably the worst hotel stay I ever had in India which prides itself with good hotels and great service which this hotel failed and should never be a HYATT as it doesnt deserve to me more than a  star hotelAshok UmmatCEO Brook Hotels Ltd

P => Absolutely Loved it My two dhters and I stayed on night at the Hyatt  The staff was very helpful proffesional and courteous  Ambience and or was perfect  Our rooms were clean large beds and pillows were very comfortable  Has a gym and pool for use  Morning breakfast which is included in the price was out of the world  Indian Continental Asian fresh fruits and juices and salads all comprised of this breakfastbrunch  Servers were very welcoming  
P => Very FriendlyCool  Very FriendlyCool amp Calm A great atmosphare for business review with pure mental amp personal satisfaction at the end of the day  Foods amp Room were excellent  
P => Loved the Food We Visited there for Dinner amp Stayed in one room for one Room also       It was Excellent stay for our Friends amp Management is too Co operative amp Cleanliness in Hotel is No       
P => Good One Good Hotel Value for Money 
P => Wonderful service Excellent service 
P => Just the right one This hotel is value for money and is a perfect location if you have business meetings in the centre of New Delhi  The restaurants in the hotel are excellent and specially the Italian restaurant is outstanding  
P => romance best hotel i have ever been to nice staff and nice service everything was perfect with very helping staff  quality of food was also very good such a delicious food i havent eaten in my whole life  i liked the service most  
P => Great for Business Awesome Food The Huge facade is one of the most recognizable structures of Delhi and located in one of the busy business districts  Palatial lobby and extremely efficeint service  Standard Rooms though feel a bit cramped for space  Multiple choice of good restaurents  Tried out the China Kitchen  Food and ambience were excellent  
P => Well located property Very well located business hotel  central and not far from the business districts and the airport  good service  the italian restaurant was exceptional  
P => Loved it The hotel is in the real sense a complete hotel  It has everything that a buisness traveller needs  The Comfort level was too good and the staff were friendly enough to give you an unforgetable experience  
P => Nice stay I stayed here for a day for a business trip  As i expected rooms were luxurious with beautiful pool view  hotel provides excellent food  Hotel staff was very courteous and friendly  
P => Surprising Reation Went to stay for  night for my Business purpose  It is a luxurious property and I was looking for some Luxurious treatment to unwind after my gruelling Meetings  However I was dissapointed in some rspect  Firtsly There was NO Bathtub in the room On top of that there was no cover for the Shower area which left the whole bathroom wet  In the spa I tried to book a female massuer for the next day afternoon and she was booked for the whole day till lare evening Surprising I did complain for the above at the time of Co but no one got back to me Even then I do lik the overall experience most of all excellent Staff Quality  
P => for people with higher budget excellent five star hotel with notable ambience  overpriced food good but highly overpriced  breakfast thopugh overpriced but worth that much 
P => Great Staff at Nice Hotel This was the only five star hotel that my husband and I stayed at while traveling around India  We stayed for two nights over a weekend in il  This hotel is spotless  Everything is extemely clean and spotless throughout the hotel  What I enjoyed most about the hotel was the breakfast  Breakfast was included with our room  It was a large buffet that had Indian and Continental food  The servers were also very attentative and there was never a wait for seat  The dining area itself is large and open aired  I would recommend getting breakfast included  As for other hotel amenities there was a nice clean pool  We sat by the pool but the water was to cool for us to go in but it was evening time  You can order drinks and lunch while lounging which is nice  There are several restaurants to chose from but we did not eat at any of them because we were always out in the city during the lunch and dinner  The hotel room itself was nice and modern  The room was an adequate size for India  The furnishing and flat screen TV seemed somewhat new  We did not have a view but we were not expecting a view knowing the location of the hotel  The room was nice and quiet  We never heard anyone in the next door rooms or hallway  In the mornings you could here a little honking but nothing compared to the louness of hotels we stayed at  The only thing that we did not like about the room was the bathroom  It was a good size but sort of ugly  It was clean but was a green ble color  This just is not our style and it really did not match with the rest of the room  The shower had hot water but the shower head itself sucked  It was small and the pressuse was not consistent out of it  The staff are very helpful and really seem like they care  We asked a lot of questions cause this was our first stop and first time in India  The concerige front desk and hall attendants were all the best that you would find Overall we do recommend this hotel  It is clean and friendly and has cozy modern rooms  I would say there are no major surprises with the hotel which is a statement that could be good or bad  
P => Needs a makeover The property location is great and so is the staff and hospitality The Business Centre was good and services availalbe on time  The check in was great since I was on the club floor    and did not take more than a few minutes The morning breakfast spread was strictly okay at the business lounge     be with the selection of news papers and magazines a few more stuff to eat  be great Only thing to improves is the hotel or      it surely needs a makeover 
P => Excellent place great hospitality absolutely clean and IS WORLD CLASS Hyatt Delhi is a great property  I love staying here  I had stayed in their property at Spore and Mumbai as well  The rooms are excellent coffee shop where the Bfast is served in one of the best Staff are very cordial they have great membership programme as well Overall it is a world class property and a great place to stay  
P => Good food at the indian restaurant Well hyatt is one of the most expensive and this trip thus wasnt really value for money  The hotel however has a good indian restaurant and when you are travelling to India after quite some time you are happy with that  The rooms are ofcourse good and that helps in getting up every day morning afresh 
P => Good Stay and Great Food Good modern and comfortable room   Great Bed  The Large LCD TVs are stly placed     recommended  
P => The other reviews are wrong We are very surprised by some of the positive comments in the last couple of reviews as we can only criticise   and we are not usually critical people  The hotel is still undergoing major refurbishment which means granite blocks are being machined noisily in the reception covering everything in dust  The hotel staff seemed more keen to look after business events than people staying in the hotel so that the pool was closed to guests throughout our stay whilst they catered for weddings and the like Drinks were ridiculously expensive   or  for a medium range bottle of wine and   or  for a gin and tonic Our group felt very unwelcome and unwanted  As for location   how can anyone say it is near amenities It is on a ring road on the outskirts of Delhi and a minimum  minute taxi ride into the centre where all the sights are  Do not stay here unless you want to be surrounded by traffic and be close to the airport  
P => Great place for a layover Property   not the most attractive hotel in the world but it tries  The lobby is large and a bit over the top with a lot of black granite and brass probably inspired by a visit to a Hindu temple filtered through a  s ascetic sensibility  There are well over  rooms and many people from Delhi come here for the food so the property is pretty busy well into the night  It is located in the south part of Delhi so getting to the main part of town for sightseeing is kind of a pain  Not that it is a bad thing but the armed guard luggage screening and pat down at the front entrance was a little unexpected Rooms  the rooms are a bit on the small side but there are some thoughtful touches that make them practical  The work desk rolls underneath itself so there is more room if you are not using it and the bathroom makes good use of space by having a half tub in the shower area  The toilet paper placement under the sink is a bit cumbersome  The bed was comfortable the pillows were not  The room we stayed in could have used a bit of updating as the walls were a bit red and some of the granite in the bathroom was chipped  The hallways leading to our room smelled musty and there was carpet coming up here and there  They also had a tendency to leave housekeeping trolleys in the hall for hours on end and since the halls were kind of narrow this was just a nuisance Amenities   like a city unto itself the  restaurants  including some of the best Chinese food outside of Hong Kong  large gym spa  fairly good massage menu  with beauty shop facilities and an arcade with shopping make a good case for never leaving the hotel  The concierge can arrange for city tours and to have medications delivered from a local  reputable  pharmacy  The pool area is OK with a good number of loungers if getting sun is your thing  or being outside in Delhi is your thing   One advantage to the Hyatt is that besides the Radisson it is the closest  star hotel to the Delhi Airport approximately  minutes with light Delhi traffic  minutes at AM  All in all it is pretty good place to be stuck for  hours waiting for a flight out of Delhi Staff   The Hyatt will win no awards here  Admittedly we had just come off a  night stay at the Oberoi so my expectations were a bit high  The driver who picked us up and dropped us off at the airport was a very nice chap but that was pretty much it  The staff seemed cold and little things like asking for a phone number for my airline from the concierge desk seemed like a chore  The wait staff in the restaurants was friendly if a bit overbearing  The reception staff at The Regency Club took forever to check us in and just about as long to check us out Overall  a nice place to hang out if you are waiting for a flight out of Delhi  
P => Flawless consistent service  Stopped for a week and also used one of their conference rooms  The staff would bend over backwards for you  There were reations going on but we were well informed and the rooms were clean and tidy  We ate in every restaurant in the hotel and would recommend the china kitchen The food and drink was great but very expensive especially the wine a glass of new zealand sauvignon blanc was    Get out of the hotel and jump in a tuc tuc to PVR priara for a cheap authentic meal  Dont let the beggers outside the hotel put you off the hyatt is pure luxury the health club is great too  
P => loved the service their service was excellent all the time they were asking for snaxfoodtea etc and they gave me all that with good manner  
P => Mixed bag The hotel is truly a mix of the good and the bad  The pros are its proximity to the airport city center and fairly good restaurants  The negatives start with the fact that the hotel does not disclose that it is undergoing reations anywhere on its website  I stayed in room  and had to walk past several rooms with unnumbered doors that were open and the interior gutted Despite recent reations to the room the mattress sagged and I ended up sleeping in the middle so as not to get a sinking feeling  The hotel also quotmistakenlyquot charged me for an airport transfer when I did not use one   This seemed somewhat deliberate as when my local contact called to see if they had sent a car to the airport to pick me up he was told that there was no booking 
P => Not the best saty but not the worst either Stayed  nights in a King room  Burned Gold Passport points for  of them  Check in was not smooth  Room was not ready and it was after midnight  There are a lot of airline crew that stay here so that is probably why  Finally did get into our room  Smallish  Comfy bed  Internet worked  Bring earplugs if you have an exterior facing room as there is constant honking or horns  The hotel is big and usually full so things are going to happen  This includes service snafu s and maintenance issues  Every guest you encounter will have something good and bad to say however a lot of the guests are very repeat guests so that says that they are for the most part happy about their experience  They do work hard to make things right if it is brought to their attention that you are not satisfied  I was actually impressed by this  The restaurants with the exception of the  hour restaurant which is not really  hours were good  After I got home it was not clear if the VAT on the cheques in the restaurants is really a VAT or a gratuity so you might want to clarify this when you are there  Nice busy pool and once you got the staff attention they were attentive  Lots of pigeons and other birds to watch and occasionally dodge the you know what  Lots of FA s and pilots so plenty of interesting conversations around the pool and in the bar  Met some great people I had some interesting emails with the concierge desk prior to my arrival but it all worked out in the end  The city day tour they arranged included a stop at a rug place that I found a total waste of my time not to mention high pressure sales so have your driverguide skip that part of the tour  The rest of it was fine  Don t let anyone tell you it is a couple of hours to Agra  It took us almost  hours to get back because of the traffic was at a stand still  It ended up being a very long day indeed from a until almost p  If you are expecting an intimate hotel with a smooth as silk service experience like you will find elsewhere in Asia this is not the best place for you  This hotel is perfectly fine for most travellers if you are prepared for the occasional wrinkle along the way  
P => Expensive poor service and poor breakfast I spent only two days with my mom in this hotel in the end our trip to India  The hotel restaurants and rooms are nice  It is expensive and the service is poor  The toillet was blocked and we spent two hours waiting for someone to fix the issue actually we checked out without solution for the problem  The breakfast was also an issue if you dont like to have indian food all pastries looked like have been made a week ago  The bread was dry and hard  We got very disappointed since the restaurant looks pretty good LOOKs only  The frontdesk was also very rough  Our advice is to get a reservation in The Park hotel chain since the service and food is just wonderful  
P => loved it i like this hotel visit delhi mainly for business and was picked up every morning for work so i really dont know if location is a good one in my opinion there was nothing around or walking distance to see or visitevery restaurant visited was al least  minutes by carinside the hotel was perfect room of good size perfectly mantained good business services and breakfastnothing to complain about was a joy arriving everyday after a long working day 
P => great   no complaints This was my second time at the Hyatt Regency in Delhi   the first time was two years ago and there were some things I didnt like then  This time I stayed a week and I have to say that everything was nearly perfect   nice room comfortable bed good restaurants good service  The gym is pleasant and although the hotel was packed there were always enough machines  There is a newish Italian restaurant which is excellent and a new Chinese restaurant which is even better  Although it is on a very busy road the rooms are fully soundproofed and I didnt hear any of Delhis infamous constant beeping At the rear of the hotel is a large pool and pleasant garden where you can have drinks and light meals My only small complaint was that the bathroom fittings could do with refurbishment   taps need replacing toilet flush was a bit lethargic etc  And also that the breakfast can be a bit chaotic when the hotel is full as it was during my stay   peak of the tourist season But I would stay here again definitely  
P => Hyatt Regency New Delhi Regency Club Level Floor   I looked on trip advisor for a while before making my ision on the Hyatt  I had read a few things before my trip to New Delhi but still arrived feeling like I had not prepared enough  I came to realize extremely fast if you want things done in New Delhi get the tipping wallet ready  This place is worst in tip for value then Las Vegas in general  The hotel is pretty nice over all and yes service is pretty good if you are willing to dump a few Rupees on tips  I found that advice prior to my trip that  rupees is pretty good which most cases was but if you want something done and fast  rupees up gets what you want pretty darn fast and with a smile  If you don t plan on tipping then I suggest you dont stay at a  star up hotel in New Delhi  I ided on this room because reading other reviews on hotels in general in New Delhi the level of service and accuracy of things is very low  So I figured I would try to find the best place with a good name and find a top room  The Hyatt I like in general as a hotel because it has a national name and corporation behind so you can usually find customer service somewhere if all else fails  Being on the Regency level I was greeted at the airport by the hotel and shuttled off to the hotel  I arrived in the morning and they are pretty strict about the early check in deal so I dropped off my bags and already had a day trip planned to Agra  On returning to the Hyatt later in the evening I checked in on the th floor of the Regency Club and of course things can never be right  I had booked two rooms  One I booked on line at Hyatt and the other I booked online at Expedia  The room booked at Hyatt of course was accurate at check in but at check out they bumped up my price an extra  rupees for some reason  I am still debating this with them and the credit card company  Not something I wanted to do and had previously read that they are notorious for this so great I am one of the statistics now  The other room booked through Expedia was a disaster  Expedia charges you the total room at booking through the website  So I paid the entire amount including taxes at the time of booking through Expedia  Well at check out Hyatt wanted to charge me again for the room and I was about to blow up at this point because things just didn t go as planned  Well anyhow already running late to the airport I ran into the business center and printed off my Expedia confirmation and my credit card statement showing that I had already been charged and still Hyatt did not take it at face value but rather told me they would figure things out send me a bill later  Well lucky for me the Expedia room worked out and I was not double charged or I would still be debating that as well if I had not taken the time to solve it right then and their  So big suggestion if you ide to stay here bring all your reservation confirmations with you to check in and make sure the quoted or prepaid room is understood with the check in counter people at the time of check in it will save you a tremendous amount of time later in emails and telephone conversations with your credit card company and the hotel  The next morning I wanted to check out New Delhi so I hopped into a taxi and not knowing better told him to take me to the arch and he did not turn on the meter  oops  I learned that you are supposed to negotiate these fares or just rent the driver for the day  So I ended up understanding this fairly quickly and negotiated  rupees for the day  That seemed to be the set rate for it was like this the remaining two days using other drivers  I also learned unless you like to be taken to the commission shops be direct and firm with the drive on telling him you want to go to specific places and don t want to go shopping with him when you can just go to Connht Place and stay away from the government emporiums unless you want to pay the premium  The way I understand it is that the government emporiums pay a kick back of  rupees to the taxi driver for just bringing you the emporium and then   commission on whatever you end up buying  So don t go to the taxi driver suggested places for shopping rather just direct him to various places like Connht Place  Don t misunderstand this and think this is on the only place and no government emporiums in this area because there are more places and still government emporiums here in this area as well but you can surely see the difference  Just tell the taxi driver you want to start out by the Pizza Hut or KFC  They are clueless and think you just want to eat and tell him you will be back after a few hours  He isn t going to take off because you haven t paid him yet so take a nice stroll and shop eat or whatever floats your boat  So now more about the hotel  One room I had gotten was just a Regency King and it was actually fairly small compared to other Regency Kings I have had in the past from other Hyatt s  But it was OK nothing special other then the bottle water  The drain in the shower was horrible and flooded every time the shower was turned on  The other room was a Regency King Suite and was good size  It felt more like a Regency King room I am used to  It had a lovely sitting room and very accommodating in size and feel  The suite was a nice room for my friends to stay in because they had three travelers so two sleep in the king bed and the other in a roll a way  Very nice room and their shower seemed to work just fine  Being on the Regency level you get the breakfast in the morning and the drinks in the evening which is a very nice feature to staying on the Regency level and the staff is very friendly while serving you  Again a little tip at the end of the breakfast and night cap does some wonders for your stay  The staff is more appreciative and goes out of their way to help the tipper that is for sure  So good place to hand over  rupees after the end of breakfast and drinks for better enjoyment to your stay in the long run  I found the location of the hotel not to be very close to many things and at least  minutes from the sites  I ate dinner one night at the Spice Route at the Imperial Hotel and found the location of the Imperial fairly close to the sites so I  have to try that the next time I go to Delhi for the location seems much better off  The Hyatt just seemed away from it all  Highly recommend the Spice Route for dinner and make reservations at the Imperial hotel  Also the Hyatt has China Kitchen which serves fairly good Chinese food but again make reservations in advance for it feels up fast  The health club at the Hyatt is small and very busy for they allow outside membership  So if you want to exercise and enjoy the sauna at the hotel you can but be prepared for a small over used gym  Overall I found the Hyatt in New Delhi to be very TIP happy and OK if you are ok with tipping everyone at the hotel who  look at you or try to help you  I don t think that is unusual thing for New Delhi in general  It seems to be a very TIP happy place which bugs me but at the same time I am already their so I want to enjoy my voyage and not let a few dollars get in the way of my enjoyment  Upon leaving give yourself plenty of time at the airport  Security is crazy for they have these big scanning machines that don t do anything because I didn t see one bag being opened but they require every bag to be placed on this thing for inspection  I don t have a clue as to what it is suppose to do because a billion people are all trying to throw their suitcase onto this scan machine at the same time with really no organization to the whole thing and then clamoring to retrieve the bag at the end of the scan machine while some workers place a security check tie around your suitcase  It s a joke and very time consuming  Do not try to check in until you have cleared the dumb scanning machine process  Immigration lines are long and slow and then again a security check again is required for your personal hand carry  Also don t forget to get a stamp on your hand bag carry on because they won t let you board the airplane with out a stamp on the carry on luggage tag  Again just take my word for it very TIME CONSUMING  New Delhi will tier you out 
P => Enjoyable hotel nice rooms and restaurants This hotel has an excellent standing  The restaurant are good for India  Our oom at the top floor was very well furbished and we had a warm welcome  The sauna was a good point for the evening  The only disappoint was a mistake on the bill at the departure but they corrected it on our request  
P => Good for a short business stay   nd visit I stayed at Hyatt Regency in Delhi this was my second visit  I think that somethings have slipped since last year when I stayed such as concerige desk had to remind them several times about car bookings  The food as always is good the rooms are pleasant although can be cold   I turned my ac off and the complimentary water is much appreciated The staff are very helpful on the whole although a little slow in the restuarant  
P => Excellent somewhat pricey but great service Excellent hotel that made our stay in Delhi a worthwhile experience check in was easy and the rooms average until we found that our friends were in newer plush rooms on the same floor whilst our rooms were the old style upon request the management bent over backwards to move us to the newer refurbished rooms as soon as these became available later that night    the flat screen LCD TV  the wood panel  the soft mattresses the ambience and the transparent bathroom wall with the sensuous blue soft lights all reminded me of the high end boutique hotels in pricey ManhattanThe room service was excellent as was the health club with newer equipment   elliptical crosstrainers and treadmills with integrated TV monitors  the massage treatments were truly a treat and fairly inexpensive by US standards  Their popularity was evident by few time slots available for massage at short notice Service speaks volumes in my book when the concierge willingly sent staff on motorbike for medication to a  hour hospital pharmacy some distance away from the hotel at am to treat my sick child and had the medication delivered promptly to our roomThanks Hyatt staff    I have traveled all over the world and rate you a true  star experience We will be back when we visit India amp Delhi 
P => Superb Hotel Fantastic Dining I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a week in ust on a business trip to New Delhi  I found both the service and the facilities to be outstandingThe first thing you should know dont bother scheduling pickup from the airport through the hotel  The price is outrageous  Simply grab a taxi from the airport and pay  Rupees maximum  If you are a westerner on your first trip to Delhi you  not be prepared for the tipping situations  Check the discussion forums here at tripadvisor for tipping information before you ide to accept assistance with bags etc The hotel is of course not really walking distance from anything  Im not sure if there is any hotel in Delhi that is walking distance from anything  But the area is ent enough  The entry and lobby are very nice check in is easy staff is excellent The rooms are great  Very new looking  Housekeeping is simply superb exceptional fantastic The beds are luxurious the bathroom large the amenities plentiful  LOVED this room  Internet is a little pricey  There are an abundance of channels on the television  The hotel restaurants are simply outstanding  Breakfast is delicious and loaded with options  Do NOT miss out on the italian restaurant  I just got back from Italy a couple of months ago and I can honestly say the restaurant at this hotel has the best Italian Ive had in years  Do NOT miss itThe price of this hotel can be intimidating but there are deals to be had for the diligent researcher  We booked at  USD per night  Not bad  In sumy this hotel stay was absolutely fantastic  I will be in town every ust for the next several years and I fully intend to stay at the Hyatt each time  
P => Perfect stay Great Club room  Nice buffet in the evening and breakfast at the Club LoungeVery good spa with the best ayurvedic massage Ive had in IndiaThe staff is wonderful 
P => Perfect hotel for business travellers I first stayed at this hotel around  years ago and should have written a review back then but sadly never got around to it  I went back to Delhi last week and again stayed at the Hyatt Regency  It really is a great hotel and worthy of a ent review  Ill start with the rooms which are nice and comfortable if slightly dated  Lovely wooden floors and comfy beds  The bathroom provides all the basic amenities you would expect to find and more  There is a drain by the side of the bath that some of my colleagues noticed a smell from and even bubbles coming through but I myself had no problem with my own room  The service in the hotel is really great and extremely attentive  Wherever you are in the hotel front desk lobby outside or any of the restaurants you will find the staff extremely helpful and very polite  My friend and I ate in TKs which is an asian restaurant   we both rated it extremely high  The food and the service were perfect  It was far too hot for me to sunbathe by the pool but I had a great view from my room and having been to the pool area on my previous visit I can only assume the pool service is as good as ever  A great visit   highly recommend this hotel  
P => Great service We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Dehli right after Christmas  Our flight was late out of Taiwan and the staff at the airport was really helpful especially since we had two small children We stayed on the executive floor and the room was beautiful and the staff was great  We went on a tour of Northern India the next day and stayed in the hotel again on our way out of India  The food was good and the hotel was great for our kids I would recommend this hotel for a short stay with children but probably isnt a long term stay since it really isnt near any of the sights in Dehli and is basially a business hotel  
P => Baautiful plce they take care of you I stayed at the Hyatt Regency for a business trip  Theres not much around the hotel which is typical for Delhi dusty roads honking horns people on bicycles  My room was beautiful and well supplied  I had an Internet connection problem after I checked in and within  minutes a young man in a suit was at my door to resolve it  It was  PM Friday night  I was admiring the plantings by the pool and an employee greeted me and told me the names of the plants  The Health Club was well equipped and machines were always available The one weakness this hotel had in my view was a smaller   of Indian food in the buffet Id previously stayed at the Grand where they had a bigger selection that changed every day  If you like to stick to traditional Western food theres plenty of it  I even saw a guy eating a steak which made me cringe My boss and I paid night in peak tourist season some people checking in the night I left were paying  and were complaining loudly and boorishly  I dont know if they had better rooms but mine was a good value for   
P => Nice Hotel Ive read the reviews on this hotel and I just dont get it  A lot of the comments  be true but are really pretty minor problems and they dont really warrent the negative ratings  Its almost as if the reviewers havent stayed at  star hotels internationally I was at the hotel from the th thru the th of ober and found the hotel to be good and the service excellent  We were there for a conference and were very pleased with the hotel The rooms are small but adequately sized with a king bed desk with chair and easy chair  The furnishings were fine   not worn   but the hotel is remodelling all the rooms and are supposed to be finished shortly  The new rooms have furnishings to maximize the space like glass desk top headboard mounted on the wall and bedside lamps mounted on the wall instead of nightstands  Some of the rooms apparently did not have temperature adjustment but mine was adjustable The food was very good  We had two catered lunches at Djinns as well as a dinner with entertainment Friday night by the pool with mulitple ethnicities of food Indian Italian Arabic and they were all very good  The service was excellent so I dont know why other reviewers complained One negative had to do with the mosquitos  The weather was unseasonably warm and there is a dengue fever outbreak in Delhi over  cases with  deaths so far so the hotel was constantly fogging outside and fumigating inside  The inside work was ineffective though and there were a lot of mosquitos inside  No one in our group was bitten but we were swatting and nervous   even wearing quotOffquot during our conference The hotel isnt within walking distance of shopping but most foreigners wouldnt want to walk in Delhi anyway  There is a camp of homeless living under tarps across the street and cows roam the streets but thats just India  The pool area is gorgeous though so when youre in the hotel its an oasis in Delhi  
P => A professional hotel with systems that worked for us My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency the night of y   We paid a bit over  for the room  We had an excellent experience  The international airport pick up was efficient  The room was comfortable and the staff were friendly professional and helpful  Breakfast and lunch in the coffee shop were very good  My wife left her glasses in the lobby and we were able to retrieve them from the lobby staff who found them and put them in the lost and found  We took a hotel taxi to the Ashoke Hotel and back for a reasonable fare  The drop off at the domestic airport was pleasant  The hotel is not within walking distance of any shops or commercial areas so we had to change money at the hotel rate  But we would enthusiastically recommend the Hyatt Regency as good value for the money  
P => Lot of  for little For  you would expect that youd get the room that you reserve King non smoking  Instead I got a smoking room and two twin beds pushed together  The Polo lounge was good and the atmosphere lively but you also have trouble getting a seat in the place  be because this was a Saturday night  All in all it was just a average experience  The staff were helpful and attentive and that was the best part I guess  
P => fine I used the hotel for a day room   so did not experience the facilities It is a very busy hotel   the lobby feels like a train station   although it looks much sterIt has a range of facilities coffee shop bar restaurants  gym and loads of boutiques selling goods for all pockets   from souvenirs to jewellery  It is quite close to the centre  The staff were all very polite and helpful with all my queries and requests however bags took a long time to get to my room and then to get loaded into the taxi on departure The room was comfortable with all the amenities you would expect form a four star I paid  rupees to get to the airport by a hotel recommended taxi the hotel car costs  
P => Loved the Hyatt I stayed here while on business for two weeks and I loved it  The gym and spa were great and the staff was extremely helpful  The buffet breakfast was included in my rate and was a nice way to start the day a nice mix of western and Indian breakfast foods and french pressed coffee  By day three the waiters new I liked ketchup and tabasco and would have both waiting for me upon my arrival for breakfast  The rooms were a bit small but were clean and nicely appointed  I had no trouble at with any of the temperature controls the AC made the room cold the heat made the room warm  
P => Dreadful This Hotel is a joke  Out of date product in the mini bar rude staff slow restaurants expensive drinks poor transportation small rooms ancient bathrooms and basic at that  Wouldnt advise even considering it 
P => OverPriced  
P => Calm and luxurious amid the chaos of Delhi  
P => Nice Hotel Not Great Location Pricey  
P =>   
P => Primera empresion excelente regresamos y fue descepcion  
P =>   
P => 
P => really a great staff Everything its ok  Room bathroom the staff  Good place and good people  They help you with a smile on their faces  
P => Nice central location   great staff The airport pickup guy had to wait  hours for our late plane   no problem he was there and we connected easily this was at am in the morning  The middle of the night arrival at the hotel we came from the U S was a bit of a shock but it turned out to be perfectly ok  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful  The location is right within easy walking distance to all kinds of shopping as well as to the excellent subway station  subway costs  roepies one way  The only sort of complaint is that there was a bit of noise up until about pm  The clean rooms did not provide top sheets on the bed we did not care as we carried our own  The food at the roof top restaurant is ginal we only tried breakfast but there is an excellent restaurant within walking distance on the same road called quotTemptingquot This hotel also arranged a car for us to return to the airport  roepies  All worked out great For a day auto rickshaw drive for around  we would highly recommend Bill phone       He is quite trustrworthy and will show you a great time Tell him Dutch recommended him 
P => A lot of history but a tough crowd I came back from a one week trip to New Delhi and surrounding areas  We stayed in a budget hotel called Indrastha at Karol Bagh  Its situated on Tank Road nestled between Ajmal Khan Road and Gurdwara Road  Right next to it is the Bengal Sweet Center  The hotel is ent  I travelled with my whole family wife  kids and mom  We stayed in a double room with extra bed  Ac room  The room size was not big but given our family size I have no complains  The hotel is generally clean and the management in general helpful  They have a hr travel desk and offer airport pickup for a fee  For Rs    tax it was a ent deal inclusive of Rs  for the extra bed and including breakfast which was not that great and served by a very serious guy   Karol Bagh is quite central and the hotel is right next to Ajmal Khan road with can be a shoppers delight  Plenty of restaurants around  Their website is     Dont go by the pictures in their website for room size  My double room had a single queen size bedOf the big indian cities I have visited Delhi seems to be the cleanest seems to have the best roads  Drivers also seem to follow traffic rules in general within the inner city and also seem to be mindful of the omnipresent traffic cops  People sitting in the front seats have to compulsorily wear seat belts The people in general here are tough  Plenty of street arguments especially traffic related  They dont seem to smile much and they have a very in different attitude to providing service  Im told that people here are very status conscious and money matters a lot  Although I didnt take a auto rickshaw I heard they are a rip off  Delhi has a lot of historical sites  For the kids there is Zoo Appu Ghar Doll Museum etc  Although I didnt try it there is also a boat trip along the lake next to the old fort  The most impressive of the places for me was the red fort for all its history and fall from grandeur I visited HaridwarHrishikeshAgraMathuraBrindavan  Very impressed with the roadshighways  Concrete and the trafiic moves very smoothly  kms is vey do able I stayed overnight at Haridwar at Ganga Azure near the railway station and in the ket  Not bad  Again clean and reasonably spacious for the prize  Rs  for  incld kids for one night inclusive of taxes  The Har ki Pauri Ganges is a ent walk from here although there are plenty of rickshaws for Rs    The restaurant at the hotel is pretty Ok  
P => P simo trato y p simo hotel  
P => Excellent but overpriced like most Delhi   hotels Like the mid town cousin this hotel too is over priced and around  mins from the centre of the city  But service is excellent if you can afford average rooms at  a night  
P => Royalty at The Palace The Taj Palace exemplifies Indias rich cultural heritage and the amazing levels of Service amp Guest Relations that are so typical of Taj Group of Hotels The expansive ble lobby of Taj Palace is imposing as are its rooms specially on their newly reated Club Floor  One feels Royal the moment one enters and a stay here like in the old Taj at Mumbai is an experience  A must for all foreign tourists visiting India More expensive than most other Delhi Hotels possibly due to its grandeur or its location at Diplomatic Enclave this one typically costs around US per night for regular rooms while the Club Floors are around US The Rooms were well equipped with large LCD TV DVD player Internet Bose Stereo amp Bose WorldSpace Radio sets  Apart from the custoy welcome drink on arrival in suite we were greeted with flowers a fruit basket cookies amp a bottle of Chilean Wine  The mini bar was well stocked as was the teacoffee maker  The newly reated bathrooms have modern fitments and ample toileteries  The Club Lounge was being reated but we were invited to the open bar in the Verandah where the choicest Wines Champagne amp Single Malts were liberally poured for us along with some delectable horsdevours  The Chef at the Coffee Shop prepared excellent Lebanese fare for us amp I found it very reasonably priced  The Tea House of the ust Moon is a speciality Asian restaurant and famous The Orient Express is also there for continental cuisine amp wines Excellent Service levels all through  The Taj lives up to expectations with her hospitality  
P => old but still ok The hotel has the old world charm about it  but is now getting a bit creaky while the rooms are large amp airy the carpet on the floor is a bad idea Love the LCD TV but its installation on top of old furniture and all old furniture in the room is a bad idea Missed the shower cabin but location and breakfast is still great  
P => The Coffee Shop is outstanding  Ambience and Food are superb  The Taj Palace made our  day stay memorable  All around spick and span surroundings and a delightful environment I was happy to see the security arrangements too just like at airports  Baggage screening and frisking all done efficiently  Obviously Housekeeping and Room Service were flawless  However the only facility i would want as a tourist is an inclusive Transport Service to and from the airport  For such a prestigious hotel it is easy to provide  
P => Great ambience A top rated business hotel  Ideally located away from the traffic jams  The Rooms are big and spacious  Taj hotels are known for courtesy and good food  Its really a home away from home The Hotel facilities were more than sufficient to launch my product  The arragements were superb  arate entrances to the halls was really helpfull  
P => The surrounding greener and garderns were nice  Pool side sitting arrangement  Taj Palace is in the midst of a beautiful greenary though man made  The hanging creepers in the pool side tables is a real treat to the eyes  Loved the hospitality of the staff  The facilities in the room were excellent  
P => Standard Taj Delhi is the only city where I think the Taj properties have serious competition from others and they just dont cut it This is a solid business hotel but nothing about it stands out besides the usual high standards of Taj service The other contenders in Delhi are The Imperial amazing and Le Meridien and Shangri La are also better than the Taj properties  
P => Staying at Taj becomes an expereience in itself  The great thing about this hotel is its convenient location  Easily approachable from the airport or the railway station  Very nice and wooded surroundings     something of a rarity in N Delhi  So itsa  star but somehow lacks the amenities or services a wee bit that one would expect from such a hotel My experience with this hotel goes way back so im not sure how much has changed since then Room service is ent    but could be a bit better  Food is great    the buffets are a must try Room or needs a little upgradation something a little more ostentatious  The lobby is big and just too open for comfort     so much more could have been planned there All in all if you were to choose between the neighbouring Maurya Sharaton and Taj Palace      id say Maurya Sheraton is where i would prefer to stay  
P => Good Service Taj Palace Delhi is a Hotel that I frequent  They take good care and the service is really great  I enjoy the hospitality and care they take  The rooms other than Club Class are a wee bit small  so if you like your rooms to be of ent size choose the club class  
P => Taj Quality but poor location A nice hotel with a good breakfast buffet but its located in the embassy area of Delhi so theres nothing within walking distance of the hotel    boring I would prefer to stay somewhere with more activity and cheaper 
P => Good  star As with most hotels in Delhi very high security existed  Hotel is not close to any major sites located in the diplomatic community about halfway between airport and central sites  However roooms were very clean service excellent food esp breakfast superior  Our only real complaint is the street noise horns hearable trough the windows  
P => Fantastic Hotel excellent service  will definitely go back Stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel for a week with my wife and  kids  Perhaps one of the best hotels that I have stayed at in all my travels  The rooms were comfortable and the hotel lobby is very impressive  The Taj hotels are known for their service and this hotel is no exception  The service at the restaurants was spectacular  We had the chef stop by every day asking us if the food was good and the waiters were exceptionally attentive  
P => Very good  and an upgrade twice I stayed at the Taj Palace hotel as part of a tour for two nights  once at the start of my trip and once at the end  The hotel was not quite as grand as the Taj hotels in Mumbai where I live but it was still very nice  It was very quiet when I was there and both times we were all upgraded to club rooms which was fantastic  The rooms were very plush with great views  the only thing was that it was so high tech it took me a while to work out how to use the lights and the bath etc The private club breakfast room was superb the business lounge was excellent the room service excellent and I loved the little touches like being brought chocolate cake and straberries in the afternoon Also Molten Brown toiletries    lovely  The restaurant was fine but better than the food was the service  very friendly  Recommended for a stopover or business trip in Delhi  
P => Fantastic hotel This has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in  The room was fantastic the staff were great  The hotel is spotlessly clean  
P => Nice Hotel pretty average We stayed at the Taj Palace for  nights  This was our first stop on our  day tour of India as part of our honeymoon  The hotel is in New Delhi and resides within a residential area  We felt very safe at the hotel there are guards at the main gate and even security staff at the reception area  We were told that the hotel gets a lot of Government officials staying there The lobby is lovely and looks rather impressive with a large Chandelier  The rooms were pretty average and what you would expect from the standard hotel  We felt that the room we stayed in rd floor was a little tired and could do with sprucing up  I am quite allergic and sneezed a lot in our room  my sure sign of dust lurking  They did give us a bunch of red roses and also a cake to congratulate us on our wedding  which was nice Service was good and the food in the restaurants was of a good standard  though as is the case in most Indian hotels you pay a lot for such standards Overall pleaseant stay  not bad a a stop over hotel  
P => i love this hotel stay and enjoy alot Room Amenities The hotel has round  villa rooms in Portuguese Goanese design all air conditioned and set in beautifully landscaped gardens  All the villas are elegantly appointed have international direct dial facilitymusic cable TV Room service and laundry serviceDining For the foodie there is The Banyan Tree serving Thai and Chinese cuisine The Beach House for Continental Indian and Goan cuisine and Caravela the bar Hotel Facilities Other facilities provided by the hotel includes a fitness centre swimming pool indoor and outdoor games travel desk car rental shopping arcade currency exchange dor on call and baby sitting  Meeting and banquet facilities are also available 
P => Nice clubrooms reason to stay here Took a club room a very good buy  Newly reated beautyfull bathrooms erate shaower and tub shower with rainforrest shower head  All in black bel  Beds nice  duveets and pillows wonderfull  The butlerservice comes with the room check in in the room and fresh juice at arrival  The club lounge ok free drinks and internet The service in the italian restaurant not always that good but as clubbenefit you can take breakfast in the lounge  But in the restaurant the service was sometimes grumpy sometimes very sloppy  and at times very good  The food fine  The poolarea ok the beautysalon with good service If we hadnt had a club room  we had no reason to come back   but its closer to the airport than some of the others   
P => expomania The taj palace at delhi is an exotic hotel with all the luxurious facilities one can even wonder of be it the spa gym or swimming pool  the restaraunts offers a multi cuisine buffet with all the delicious dishes from around the world  the attractive ambience of this place keeps you adhered to it and would surely make you stay more than you would ave expected to   
P => Not that great really We stayed twice at the Taj Palace for two days each time in     We were in the ordinary rooms on the third floor  The room was OK nothing special  The rate for this room was  a night plus   very considerable  taxes   thats expensive anywhere for what you get here The hotel is in the middle of the diplomatic enclave and armed troops and security guards are everywhere  Its a long way from other places to go or eat  We found the service like other reviewers have a bit too attentive it starts to get on your nerves after a while though most of the staff are very nice if a little quotgive me a tipquot oriented The food is poor not to say terrible   We tried the Indian Restaurant and it was the worst and most expensive Indian meal we had in a month in India  No pappadums for example and dry tastless biryanni The buffet breakfast is average for this standard of hotel   no special touches as you find in other similarly priced hotels  They run out of everything   grilled tomatoes for example  all the time and it takes forever and  requests before they fill the dishes back up  Best of luck if you want an egg with your breakfast   three staff stood in front of the egg chef filling in forms when I tried   it seems you have to get a member of the waiting staff to get an egg for you as you are just ignored if you stand there We tried the same restaurant at night for a buffet meal   but where they cook the main course to order for you  As at breakfast its completely chaotic  You have no idea who is supposed to be serving you  Knives and forks are nowhere to be seen and are mostly missing from the table   Our waiter quotcleanedquot the table by giving me a used a stained place mat and ignored the crumbs and bits of food laying on the surface  He and the myriad of layers of different kinds of waiters watching were completey unfazed when I took a cloth and cleaned up the table myself We ordered the main courses specifically to be mild  When they came they made the hottest mexican dish seem like milk shakes   they were mind blowingly spicy  The lamb dish came as straggly little bits of meat with lots of little bones in it   really truly awful food We were offered replacement dishes when we said we could not eat the main courses  I ordered a rissotto with prawns which was microwaved to the point of explosion making the prawns like bits of car tyre and my wifes so called French onion soup was thin and small The raita was the worst I tasted in India   there was no chutney at all for the over spicy pappadums All in all it was very poor l food and chaotic untrained service  We had booked at the hotels flagship restaurant which is in a replica carriage of the Orient Express and so named  Its  a head minimum but our experience with the rest of the food over  meals was so bad that we cancelled the booking  The bar service is equally bizarre and annoying  There is a nice seating area outside the reception near the pool area  We sat there and asked if they had diet tonic for the G and Ts as the full fat is too sweet and full of calories  No they did not have it  OK two Bacardis and diet cokes please  Five minutes later the waiter came back to say they could not serve that drink there  He offered us whisky or brandy or wine but claimed thay were not allowed to serve a bacardi and coke there   and we would have to move indoors to the Orient Express bar to obtain that drink  We did not want to drink in the inside bars as the ac is set to Alaska levels and its freezing cold and it was a pleasant evening to be outdoors  Why on earth the waiter could not go and get us the drinks and serve them where we sat was never explained  We spoke to one of the the hotels charming hostesses who greet you or arrival about this incident but she clearly had no idea why this was and she seemingly had no influence over the hordes of differently garbed bar staff most of whom appear to do nothing at all  We went inside for our drinks  Stay somewhere else for this money  Our guides told us the Imperial has much better food  Or save money and stay at the Amber where we also stayed during this trip and which we have reviewed on here  
P => Not a  star experience Stayed in a suite in a non club floor  Room was spacious and well appointed  Liked having a arate dressing area  The bathroom was not up to par for a luxury hotel  Although it is reasonably sized with arate tub amp shower it is lacking in several areas  First it looks incredibly dated s style  The water temperature was very erratic shower took   minutes to get warm but tub was warm instantly  THe drain pipes are too small so the shower fills up with several inches of standing water while your wait for hot water  The toilet makes gurgling sounds after flushing  The maintenance staff agreed that the drain pipes are insufficient Overall service is generally attentive but somewhat erratic  The breakfast buffet is fairly chaotic just getting coffee is a   minute process amp the rest of the food is okay  Had generally good service at the front desk until checkout  The credit card company required a call as often happens when using your card for a large charge in a developing nation  The clerk said that nothing could be done amp insisted that we call the credit company ourselves  Not exactly  star service  After some prodding he finally called the credit card company amp everything went through I would probably not stay at this hotel again  Rooms are overpriced for what you get  However I did become a convert of the Taj Group after staying at several of their palace hotels in Rajasthan  So I would look for a smaller or newer property  
P => i love the service and presentation i and my husband returned from my husbands friend house we saw the hotel the Hotel is very magnificient and we have never experienced never before  it was so lovely to see  
P => Staff stereotypes visitors I have been staying at the Taj for a year now as a long term guest  The hotel has begun to stereotyping all female guests that come to visit  Having a girlfriend that works in a  star hotel she has been coming to visit for a year now  Every time she comes they treat her with a lack of dignity and respect  She is appalled at the way they treat people and said she does not understand how they still function as a five star hotel There is a large group of people I work with that all stay at the Taj  Every one of them has had problems with the security staff  
P => Superb Service From the start when I landed into Delhi International Airport  name of airport  to be received from the Taj Driver AND the Guest Relations Manager at am that there was something special about this property and its service  We arrived in a standard car to be greeted at the door with exceptional quality service from the Guest Relations team who knew my name and also somehow worked out that I was very tired and I wanted little hassle to get to the room I was guided to my room without any formality as it was to be taken care of in the room by my welcoming butler  I was upgraded non the less to the Taj Club and the service was beyond expectation I felt royal important and secure   the team at this property are the best I have ever experienced in all my years of travel The room was appointed with the best quality fittings and in India where  star is a highly competitive arena   this Taj Property has got it right The bed was luxurious the mini bar reasonably priced the food at the restaurants stunning  For a business hotel this is the one to stay at   the room rate was around Rs   USD a night so the value for money is certainly being served up to you as a guest This is the only hotel to stay in New Delhi in my opinion Pros Service Attentive staff Great food great little mini golf course out backCons   None that I can think of 
P => Exceptional service at Taj makes you feel that you alone are staying in hotel Taj group hotels are excellent by local standards but north american travellers  not find these exceptional in terms of interiors of the hotel However it is the service at Taj Palace which makes it stand apart compared to most north american hotels Though not like a king but the prompt service makes you feel that you are the only person staying in the hotel Also those who love to eat food is excellent and buffet breakfast is very unique  
P => A bit tired The restaurant service is good typical of most Indian establishments  Rooms and hallways are a bit tired and in need of a major upgrade and soon particularly at the price the rooms are offered  Staff courteous  
P => My favourite hotel in Delhi This hotel is by far my favourite in Delhi  Though a little out the city the atmosphere and rooms are superb and offer real luxury Unfortunately its pricing has forced it out of my budget but if I were looking to pay that sort of price this would be my choice  Rooms are great restaurants welcoming and staff as you would expect from Taj are delightful  
P => Reasonable Hotel I only stayed for one night at the Taj Palace on a very fleeting visit so I can not provide a particulary indepth review  However the only negative thing I would mention is that it is starting to look just a little bit tired   but only a little The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the room comfortable and fairly spacious  It contained the usuals you would expect to find in a superior hotel complimentary toiletries fruit and chocolates  It makes a good airport hotel as it is only a  minute drive away  Not so good if you are looking to have shops hustle and bustle near by as the area seemed quite quiet There is a reasonable sized outdoor swimming pool which alas I had no time to use but it looked most invitingThis hotel wont knock you off your feet but you will have a perfectly pleasant and comfortable stay  
P => Great hotel arrived at hotel after long flight from newark  immediately escorted to club floor and spacious suite  room  like lobbywas beautiful amenties included snacks on arrival robes free happy hour in private lounge nightly  business centre facilities and staff were great  hospitality of staff exceptionally good   we were greeted at every turn by a friendly helpful person  breakfast buffet was enormous and of good variety  hotel restaurants were first class   esp good service in chinese restaurant  overall a very very very good stay 
P => Too many problems for the price The Hotel had a lot of problems for the price   They tried to charge for a airport pickup when I had arranged my own  I had too argue with them about this   Noisy reations kept me up when I first arrived when I had a long flight and was trying to rest  Rattled the glasses on the desk   They couldnt fiqure out how to link two reservations and wanted me out when I was staying longer   The front office woke me up at am over some trival subject Good points   Nice gym and workout area  Good food at the Oreint Express 
P => A property in line This is the second time Ive stayed at the Taj Palace but the first time was nearly two years ago  I thought it was a low risk choice however as last time wasnt too bad but it has definitely lined Check InWas swift but their computer systems were down at the time so we didnt know if I got my room choice until we got in and could quotsmellquot whether it was really a non smoking room  Fortunately it wasRatesToo high    but then hotels in Delhi are all very expensiveRoomSmall  Mine had new carpet could still smell the glue and new furniture but old TV and a bed that hadnt had a new mattress since the English got the boot  Tiny bathroom  An unusual complaint is that the toilet was too high off the ground  I know bad visual but this was quite uncomfortable Cheap shower curtain meant that the bathroom floor was usually wet quotBathroom smellsquot passed into the room from adjacent rooms  Very annoying GymWAY TOO SMALL About  or  treadmills lifefitness  old lifefitness elliptcal and one new one  bikes  At peak times the cardio gym was completely full with people waiting  The weight machines in the weight gym were obviously purchased by a purchasing guy who was trying to save money and while they are good quality the quotsetquot is incomplete i e  a quadricep machine but no hamstring machine etc     as if only half of the requirement was purchased  With  guys in the weight gym it starts feeling very crowdedFoodAverage Breakfast in coffee shop is a quite limited buffet and I sat outside one morning and was disturbed by a strong smell of human faeces coming from the nearby drain Room service was prompt and efficient  Food was tasty ServiceTypical for India  A few aggressively nice women working reception and in the lobby as a greeting function and no one else really cared  Took about  tries over the first  of  days to train the restaurant staff how to make a good Caffe Latte  Still each one seemed to take  hour As per a few of the earlier reviews the usual was handled well the new or challenging was hardly handled at all  Delhi is frustrating and Im about to draw the conclusion that there are no good hotels there  The Shangri La is the only major hotel there that I havent tried    so it must be the only good one as the Taj just doesnt cut it    like most of the others   especially when the rate is over night  
P => Below par I chose the Taj Palace after reading the TripAdvisor reports  Many reviews were very positive   a number critical  On balance I thought the Taj Palace would be a good choice It wasnt   the hotel is very expensive   the rooms old and well overdue for a reation although there are some that have been reated they werent on offer to me  The rooms are average in size the walls thin which meant that noise travelled  The food equally expensive and average  The hotel is well away from the attractions of Delhi  The service was inconsistent ranging from above average to plain ordinary  Simple requests were well handled anything more complex or requiring a ision was impossible  I was less than impressed with a hotel that charges top dollar by any standard and falls short on what it delivers  Intuitively there must be better choices   look elsewhere  
P => Excellent service Incredible service from everyone  The staff are immensly well trained and are extremely coutreous  The in service dining staff even make sure the food was well prepared and to your satisfaction an hour after you are servedThe rooms are a bit tired and unless you have work in the diplomatic area too far from most sights  The service no doubt makes up for alot though 
P => Nice hotel great service I stayed at the Taj Palace for a day in e   The check in process was smooth and fast  The room was about average in size but was ently appointed though a bit frayed at the edges  The hotel was in the process of being refurbished  I wish they did not put off the refurbishment for so long I used the room service and found the food to be good  The restraunt in the hotel is a fine one and my guests really appreciated it too  
P => nice hotel The Taj Palace in New Delhi is a very comfortable hotel with a few quirks  We booked  club rooms for a three day stay  Our rooms were rather small but had been freshly updated with modern or  Theres an extensive and varied breakfast buffet and snacks in the club lounge from  till  pm  The staff is very polite and attentive but strangely uninformed the concierge was unable to provide us either with alternative places to eat in the area nor with any information about local tours of Delhi  Also theres no information in the rooms about what is included in the Club Room price and the receptionist didnt seem to know  The quirks There are no clocks in the rooms though the staff did manage to find a cheap alarm clock for us to use when we asked  The bathrooms are arated from the rooms by a wall of glass  There are shades that can be lowered but these provide only an illusion of privacy   at night especially everything can be seen through the shades  This  be OK for couples that arent shy but was rather disconcerting for our opposite sex teenagers who were sharing a room  
P => Great hotel Cannot fault this hotel at all  Very nice rooms and common areas and staff always polite coureous and attentive  Staff always greet you nomatter if busy  When contacted hotel to confirm booking they had wrongdates but said it would be fixed  When we actually arrived the wrong dates were still entered however this was fixed quickly    have been the travel agents mistake who know There is a great selection of restaurants and places to hang out inside the hotel  Always a great atmosphere  Great to tourists or business travellers  Room service is to die for as it arrived in a silver trolley  The waiter wearing white gloves laid out the table in the room and served the food  He even offered to pour the tea and put the sugar in  Amazing attention to detail Great location  Would definately stay there again  
P => Great Hotel but some rooms need urgent reation We a family of four stayed at this Hotel for three night in total in   and   at the beginning and the end of a trip in Rajasthan The first two nights we stayed on the Club Floor floor seven and we enjoyed nice a spacious rooms well equipped  On    we stayed one night on floor three where unfortunately the good memory we had from our previous stay instantly vanished at the sight of the worn out state of the rooms  The cleanliness was good but you could tell that these rooms were oldish and needed reation  We were disappointed The staff was always very helpful and warm attending to our needs  The lobby was great and luxurious contrasting with the rooms somehow During our first stay we were invited to share champagne with the floor manager Club floor and share our comments  Breakfast was very good but we did not try the other restaurants nested in the hotel as they were quite expensive for a family of four The location was good too about  minutes from the international airport and  minutes from the city centre If we ever go back we will make sure that we stay in one of the refurbished rooms but surely this bears a cost  
P => A very good business hotel I stayed here for over a week and was overall very pleased The room was spacious and very tastefully furnished with plenty of complimentaryfood mineral water and amenities included  The spa and gym are extremely nice   one of the best I have experienced at a business hotel There is certainly a lot of hotel service  From the hotel door to your room you will encounter a half dozen at least staff who will ask you how things are and whether anything can be improved  The staff provided me with a lot of timely help    they brought things up to the room made inquiries on my behalf explained the use of appliances in the room  It is also true that sometimes their interest in helping was not matched by ability    in a few cases they seemed to be just reading from a script  This was particularly true in the restaurant where staff would sometimes forget orders or nod eagerly but misunderstand them The number of quotfeedback requestsquot you get is oddly high but I do have the impression that this hotel will continue to improve because of them The hotel is not near any attractions    you will require a cab to get anywhere  But Im not sure there is a better location    you cannot easily stroll in Delhi even if you are close enough to your destination One of the things that  be confusing to travelers I think it is reflected in the mixed reviews is that although the public areasare very opulent this is not a luxury hotel but rather more like a good business hotel e g  riott  The rooms are pleasant but the walls between rooms can be a bit thin  Like a business hotel they tend to overcharge for many extras e g  wifi business services   actually by overcharge I mean that they charge exactly what I would pay in a business hotel in europe or the US  There is a travel desk which is really helpful with bookings    something particularly important in India they can solve train and air problems book tickets and arrange a car with driver  But they could not recommend or arrange tours or provide any useful advise on holiday issues  I have stayed in very few proper hotels in India so I cannot say how this compares to the competition  ButI was happy to get to a place that was comfortable run professionally and where everything worked  The other hotel guests I met during my stay     mostly business people    felt the same  As long as you are not looking or paying for something more deluxe this is a good choice  
P => One of the best in the world India is both beautiful and maddening  One of the best isions I made when travelling there was booking this hotel  The service provided by the hotel is absolutely outstanding  From the check in right in your room a great quiet room with internet  hour room service with excellent selection and good food fitness centre and most especially the travel desk every aspect of this hotel is near perfect  The travel desk alone is worth its weight in gold  Air India cancelled two of my flights careful when flying out of Delhi with all the fog in ember  The rude AI agent at the airport brushed me off so I came back to the hotel and they sorted everything out  Their rep will even meet you in the airport to help you check in at no extra cost  Pay the extra money and stay in the Taj Club it is well worth the extra pampering Minor quibbles are that you pay for internet and the hotel is less centrally located  Nevertheless I would stay again without hesitation  
P => Receptinist is NOT a Taj hotel standard I was invited to stayed at Taj Palace for four nights The Interior of this hotel is definitely the Taj hotels standard The Lobby is very spacious and fabulous with a lot of Indian paints on the display  Club floor room is also the Taj standardwith all the ammenities you would expect for a five star hotel BUT the Recepetionist are NOT the Taj hotels standard  They are NOT helpful when I ask them the location of the shop to buy saree for my wife  I handed him a copy of newspaperad of a saree shop and I asked him the best way to go there His reply was You can take a taxi  He did not show any intention of showing a map or asking someone eise for more information I would not complain this sort of thing if it were not a Taj hotel  Hoping to check it soon  
P => Stay Away Unless you Like Rats in Room Stayed there after great experience with another Taj Hotel  Stayed on the Club floor and paid over  US for two nights in a very small room  The staff was very pleasant and well meaning but you can tell a hotel when it comes to handing problems  At  am while working on my computer a big fat and obviously well feed rat scurried around the floor in my room and then into the bathroom  When I called the floor desk they were helpful in moving me but no apologies and nothing from the manager  I then e mailed the hotel after I left along with Taj management offices and no responses  I am sorry but if there is one big rat on the seventh floor where they have some sort of food facility due to the club room then there are likely more rats  It was not only amazing to me that I paid so much for a rat infested room but the fact that there we no apology or even acknowledgment of my issue is really telling  I can understand a hotel can have an occasional problem but to not even respond tot he guest is not acceptable  I have stayed at great hotels all over the world and this I the first time I had to deal with a rat infested room  
P => You want customer service Youve got it here We stayed here for one night before heading off to Agra  and what a hotel it is Beautiful elegant friendly and the customer service is second to none  When we checked in we were upgraded   for no reason had breakfast thrown in for free   for no reason and complimentary champagne delivered in our room   for no reason The staff were incredibly friendly and the hotel was stunning  Set in a good location about a ten minute drive to the centre of Delhi  The grounds were neat and pretty and the pool was a good size and clean  The lobby and restaurants were of ample size and if ever we needed to stay in a hotel in Delhi again it would be this one over the Imperial Shangrila and Oberoi any day  
P => Excellent in all aspects Stayed for  days and from the time you meet up with their Guy at the Airport Pickup you experience the Service  which is of the highest level  The facilities both in room and at cafes and other venues within the hotel match the service as well  I get the feeling that the staff in all categories give the highest priority to Customer Service They are willing to do the extra bit to make your stay comfortable The food is also great  The only negative comment that I can make is that of the environment around it   there is no shopping opportunity within short walking distance but on the positive site the hotel is located in the Diplomatic Enclave which makes it a safe venue  Additionally the hotel cab service Rs   Per km Hr Min Charge Rs  does a great job   so you can visit any place without any risk  The Drivers also speak basic English carry cellphones etc which ensures that your drive is perfect as your stay  
P => Impeccable Service I stayed in the Taj Palace for three nights whilst in New Delhi on business  The service at this hotel is extremely good and cannot be faulted  I was offered complimentary ice cream and coffee with my meal last night and on arrival I was upgraded to a quotclubquot room  The staff go out of their way to be helpful and everyone without exception is extremely courteous and polite  My room on the seventh floor had a very good view over the city including the india gate and the immediate area surrounding the hotel is green and pleasant  The main downsides to this hotel are that it is starting to look a little tired on the outside and the bathrooms and the spa are not  star quality although at  per night perhaps the rack rate reflects this  My bathroom in a club room was small and cramped and the fittings are probably at least  years old  Similalry the showers and toilets in the spa could do with being updated  Other things to be aware of in Delhi a   tax is added to the room rate and    to all food and spa prices and   for alcohol so the overall experience is not as good value as you might originally anticipate and you cannot really walk to anywhere from this hotel  
P => Taj Palace needs a reality check There is an indifferent and sometimes absent hotel management response to long stay customers who object to constant construction noise  The food menus rarely change and for the most part the food is not good value for money  
P => Loved the Taj Palace This is an excellent hotel the service the food and the ambiance are all amazing  We arrived in Delhi at AM therefore we werent allowed into our room right away  But the night manager leveled with us and said if we pay the rate for a regular room for that night he would give us a room on the club floor for the duration of our stay and it was definitely worth it The only bad thing I can say about the hotel was that my sister and I were mildly electrically shocked by two different socket in our room it wasnt too serious but it did leave us both a little frazzled the Manager on duty immediately sent the hotel dor up to see us and changed our room right away and were were transfered into a suit  The food at this hotel is great the breakfast is the best I have had anywhere in the world and the service is just beyond amazing  The entertainment at dinner was also great we had a singer named Sebastian who was really nice and had a great voice  If you have a chance try out the spa we had a massage and scrub done and it was fabulous  Overall we had a great stay at the Taj Palace 
P => Pleasant Stay I stayed at the Taj Palace hotel on il nd while transitting through Delhi  The hotel staff were pleasant and professional as is to be expected from a  star property  I had booked a pick up and drop to and from the airport which was helpful  The room and bathroom were smaller than I expected but had all amenities  Bottled water and coffee maker were complimentary  I was put up on the fifth floor and although it was quiet throughout the night the noise started early in the morning and stayed through the day  When I complained it was explained that the hotel was reating the sixth floor hence the noise  The noise was horrendous  It was load banging and I felt that the floor was going to come through  The hotel did agree to change my room for the rest of the day but as I was checking out later that day it was not worth it  The hotel itself was beautiful and the room service was excellent but the reation really spoilt my stay  I had stayed at the Imperial last year and found that hotel to be better with more history and wonderfu artwork  If anyone is already booked at the Taj make sure you are not on the fifth floor or seventh floor  Apart from that the hotel was very good  
P => Excellent choice This hotel is clearly one of the best in Delhi  While we were there the hotel was hosting a conference for VIPs around the region  It was definately disconserting to be frisked upon entering the hotel and the guards with rifles on the roof front gate and entry were distracting to say the least  However the hotel upgraded my family to a lovely suite with a connecting room for our kids  The restaurants were first rate as was the pool and health club We were trated very well  If I were to complain about anything besides the armed guards it would be that the electronic systems for lights iand showers in the rooms were way to complex Having said that its a great hotel  
P => First stay in India Booked the Taj via Castle and King as part of one of their tours  Lovely hotel room was clean staff helpful and friendly and food superb particularly in the Masala art restaurant  Would definitely recommend  
P => Long Stay   Great Experience I stayed in this hotel for nearly  months and I would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to Delhi The hotel is well staffed and has  restaurants  bar and a lounge  It has a fairly large well maintained swimming pool as well as gym facilities During my stay the hotel hosted a number of conferences and weddings but it never seemed over crowded or too busy The rooms arent massive but are big enough and the room keeping staff do a spectacular job If you want something special say extra water bottles each day it is a good idea to have a chat to your room keeping staff or if this is not possible leave then a note with   rupees enclosed stating your request A few of my colleagues had problems with their room bill   I didnt   so make sure you take a note of everything you charge to the room The interent is expensive so if you are staying for longer than a few days make sure you ask about discounts for a wireless connection in your room for use with your laptop The hotel is V shaped around the swimming pool  Even numbered rooms face towards the road and entrance drive and can get the traffic noise  Its not too loud but  annoy some people  The odd numbered rooms face out onto the pool and although the view is better they can be very noisy late into the night when the hotel is hosting a functionwedding If you are staying for a long time or require additional space ask about the availability of a corner room which are almost double the size for the same price The hotel uses swipe cards as access keys to the room  Make sure you get  and keep them away from your mobile phone which has the ability to interfer with the magnetically stored information on the cards  Most people will have a problem with their access card during their stay it seems never ending sometimes but the hotel are usually pretty quick to send up someone with a new card The hotel is in the diplomatic quarter so at least a min drive from anything you might want to see or do  There is nothing within walking distance so dont stay here if you were hoping to walk to India Gate or Old Delhi Taxi cabs are readily available and if you can afford them expensive hotel cars work around the clock  
P => spring for club level the newly reated club level is simply to die for  as a frequent traveler I was bowled over by the level of service at check in and check out and the reation of a business friendly yet fun and comfortable room on the club level  Only issue we ran into was the fact we arrived a bit late for breakfast and the staff there was not at all pleased    that was a bummer for the price we were paying special dining area or not  other than that HIGHLY recommend  
P => Five Star Service all the way I stayed at the Taj Palace ten years ago and thought it was okay    nothing special  Now Im actually AT the Taj Palace right now and I am overwhelmed with how wonderful the service is  I am staying in a club level room and that is well worth the upgrade  You get free breakfast where you can order anything you like you get butler service that makes you feel like you have a personal Jeeves you get some free laundry services and a free shuttle to and from the airport  Also free internet in the club itself  The rooms are exquisite   fabrics are top quality towels are fluffy toiletries are plentiful  I just stayed at the Shangri La in Manila where they were pretty stingy with sub par toiletries so this was welcome  Also the toiletries are Molton Brown which I adore  The bathroom is all ble and granite with a huge lit make up mirror which I really appreciate  The room is also spacious with a desk and two chairs including a loveseat coffee table and large flat screen TV The view from the room is also amazing right across the swimming pool and to the park beyond My only quibble is that closet space for two people is rather cramped and the bathroom could be a smidge bigger  
P => Fantastic Stayed here for almost two weeks fantastic hotel Service excellent Particularly recommend the chinese restaurent food absolutely wonderful  
P => soulless luxury It is not easy to find a good hotel for a reasonable price in delhi  For the last two nights of our journey we chose one of the top hotels  The building is impressive spacious and the rooms are excellent large and quiet  Five star standard perfectly  The staff is friendly and always next to you On the other hand the hotel is far from the city center in the diplomatic area  Totally boring  The only place of interest is a cafe on the other side of the road where you can eat and drink ten times cheaper than in the hotel and meet some indian teenagers The hotel itself is full of luxury but lacks of style and atmosphere  Cold as the ble flooring  It could be anywhere else Our budget reservation via internet was without breakfast but unfortunately there is nothing in the surrounding where you can go for some snack in the morning  The opposite cafe opens at  am so we had to smuggle some food into our room for the next morning Funny thing but as higher the accomodation price as more you have to pay additionally The standard room charge is much overpriced but you can find large discounts booking via internet  
P => Loved the Taj Palace Right from the word go it was perfect  On arrival at Delhi international airport I was met and assisted by Taj staff who escorted me to the spankingly new Toyota  The hotel provides complimentary airport transfers to the hotel and back for those guests who stay on the Club floor  At the hotel lobby I was welcomed by Taj hostess who took me straight into my room on the th floor  All the rooms on this particular floor was recently reated  You enter a different world altogether when you enter your room  It was done up quite painstakingly  It is the most modern hotel room that I have ever stayed in  Being a travel professional I have had the opportunity to visit and stay in many wonderful properties across the world  But from the standpoint of room or fixtures and fittings this one beats almost all  Bathroom amenities were in sync with the class of the room  The food outlets are absolutely top class whether the cuisine is Chinese Tea House of ust Moon or Indian Masala Art  Service was flawless throughout  All in all I had a great experience  I love the Taj Palace the BEST in New Delhi  
P => Great hotel great service I spent ten days at this hotel  on a business trip  It was my first trip to India and I was pleasantly surprised to be met at the airport by a car from the hotel with a drink and hand towel to freshen up with  The hotel is in the diplomatic enclave of the city and is well situated  The staff were extremely helpful and solicitous and often took care of my needs before I knew I had them  The room was a standard double but well furnished and very clean  The steward offered me fresh fruit juice to drink as he took care of the check in details for me  There are several restaurants in the hotel but my favourite was the Indian which had a menu that went on for days  Again the service was excellent  Breakfast was served buffet style in the cafe and chefs would cook almost anything you asked for  There was western style food bacon and eggs as well as Indian plus an array of cereals fruits juices fresh squeezed etc From a business standpoint the Business centre was well manned and had everything necessary  It was located below the lobby and was quiet   The hotel also has a nice fitness centre though I didnt use it and a spa  I had two massages during my trip both excellent  the Indian Traditional massage was extrememly relaxing and the backneck massage was just the thing after a long day in front of the computer  There is also a well stocked store in the hotel  with very nice quality shawls jewelry ties books and other items you might need to take home to your family  Again great service  There is a nice terrace outside as well as a pool which I did not use  I was very happy with my stay in this hotel  If I were to criticise anything it would be the air conditioning which I found a bit too cold  However you can turn it off in your room in the evenings so it was fairly comfortable in any case  That is a minor detail though and not enough to really complain about Overall the hotel is a nice traditional large hotel that gives you a healthy dose of Indian hospitality  
P => Its Good Not bad at allNo its really quite goodReception is large clean modern and full of great staff very helpful  They helped me find an obscure address in Delhi Room was very comfortable and quiet I had a good nights sleep here  Bathroom was also good View out of the front was fine Swimming pool is OK some areas like changing area are getting a bit shabby and need a tidy up but otherwise OK Dinner and Breakfast was great excellent buffet lots of choice good quality Yes I would stay here again  
P => A real luxrious Hotel It is the best hotel i stayed in  The staff is too co ordial and the gr thing about all the Taj in general is they take a personalised care about you  I went to Delhi for my competition and i was surprised that the staff also wished me before leaving for the venue  Spectacular rooms nice srvice great ambience makes it all a wonderful experience  
P => An oasis of calm    The Taj Palace is an oasis of calm in hectic Delhi  The staff are professional and friendly      The Orient Express Restaurant lived up to its reputation as one of the top  Restaurants in the world The food and service were excellent The room was on the small side  but had good views over the pool Overall a good stay    would use again when in Delhi  
P => excellent hotel for business traveller Superb care and hospitality great attentiveness faultless luxury transportation to and from airport very sound restaurants and exec areas  Very inspiring and much recommended  
P => Good Hotel but Stayed at this Hotel in mid e for two nights  It is an excellent property in an exclusive New Delhi locality  Had problems checking in as our two room reservation was not available due to overbooking  Were upgraded to a single suite room after some tough talk  The front desk staff need to shape up and cater to travellers needs in the unearthly check in hours  The hospitality team more than made up for the tardy front desk staff  We were double billed for our stay but then credit card companies will fix this The property is great the food is good the location is great but the front desk staff need to shape up  
P => Absolutely Wonderful This was our first trip to India and having read lots of reviews about the hit amp miss hotels I wanted to stay at a more upscale reliable place  After searching the net for places and prices I came upon an amazing rate for the Taj Palace Club level rooms and booked it at once about  weeks prior to our travel  Our reason for travelling to India entailed some stressful experiences so I wanted the hotel to be as stress free as possible The Taj didnt disappoint  As a club level guest everything was first class and absolutely perfect  We arrived at about  a m  local time and the staff whisked us through the checkout and to our room   down pillows and overstuffed quilt waiting bottle of wine fresh fruit amp flowers in the room electronically controlled lighting an electronic safe and a special breakfasttea buffet room only for Taj Club level guests The amenities didnt end with these roomfloor features  The staff was attentive without being obnoxious  We were never asked for a tip by anyone and were never pressured about anything  All the prices were exactly as stated and there were no hidden fees  The serving staff in the buffet room addressed us by name each morning and by the end of our stay knew what we wanted as far as food amp drink  Service was always readily available and when we encountered a problem of our own creation the hotel maintenance staff was right there within  minutes The food at the hotel was absolutely wonderful  We had room service twice and ate at the hotel restaurants three other evenings  The only lackluster experience was in their Chinese restaurant  The Kafe Fontana was velous and the room service was without compare white glove individualized service  The pool and gardens looked quite inviting but as the weather stayed cool throughout our stay we didnt get to experience any swimming Overall this was one of the best hotel experiences weve ever had  Definitely a  star place with all the extras and weve stayed in many hotels throughout the world  
P => loved this hotel We stayed at the Taj Palace after a two week long trip through the North of India  This hotel is absolutely stunning a true   hotel  The pool is great  We had a club room in which they give you free water and a bottle of red and fresh fruit  The room was perfectly fine  What I must commend is the service this was the absolute best service ever  And mind you we work for an airline and travel a lot  The staff was so attentive  They actually told us where to go shopping which was the G K I ket andor the central ket for steel products the former has fixed prices and the best restaurant we ate in while in Delhi  The breakfast was very good  We had some kind of indonesian salad by the pool and that wasnt worth it  We had room service which was not good  The bar is expensive because of all the taxes on alcohol just buy a bottle in the streetaround  and mixers and youre good to go if youre a drinker  We also ate in Zen in C P  and that was great chinese food  We used the same taxi driver the whole time we stayed at this hotel because he was so nice and honest  Mehar Chand you can actually ask for him I think his car      Rupees for  hours and he would pick us up when we told him every day  This hotel is expensive but really all hotels in Delhi are   but it is definitely worth it   we also stayed at the Intercontinental Grand   and this one blows it away really  Also if you are concerned about the hotel not being in the center   dont even worry about it   its not an issue there because you really are not going to walk around    you will take cabs everywhere   the city is really dirty and extremely overwhelming I hope this helps and have a great trip 
P => Taj   Great hotel Stayed at the Taj Palace in il of   First night in India after a long  hour flight  The hotel is very impressive and the staff is excellent and speak good English  We booked rooms in the Taj Club and were directed to the th floor for check in  The only two complaints I can make about this hotel are  at  PM midnight our rooms were not ready  After traveling  hours we were ready to sleep  Also the bar in the hotel closes early around  PM  However you can walk next door to the ITC Sheraton whos bar and club were great where its open longer I wouldnt hesitate to stay at this hotel again  Staff was friendly and very helpful  Booked a one day sightseeing tour through the travel desk  They were knowledgeable friendly and we had a great day  Rooms were nice pool was nice and lobby was comfortable  They even had a bottle of Italian red wine in my room as a greeting  
P => Great Servicerooms a little glum Stayed at the Taj Palace in Delhi for  nights on a business convention The hotel is very impressive and service really is superb No request is too difficult for the ever attentive staff Hotel is huge with a great poolrestaurantsbarsnight club and a shopping mall Room was a little on the old fashioned side in terms of or although has all the first class amenities i e tvwireless internet accesssafe etc All in all a safe bet in Delhi  
P => Expensive but   After spending  nights I can sayUps   the staff was very helpful and attentive  I needed some helpto clear my stuff at the customand they helped me  Generally speakingthe service has always been quick    My room was very very quiet  It is not a true luxury room but in the end it was OK clean and big enough    For people like me that cannot stand indian and spicy food the evening buffet has always some continental food  The morning breakfasts buffet was excellent   the bar and the business center are open hr a day Downs   at almost  eur  per night itis overpriced but these are the prices in Delhi I talked to many people and do not expect to finda five star hotel for much less   the hotel is set in what is probably the cleanestpart of India   the diplomatic enclave   but you cantreally go out for a walk  The area is full ofdiplomatic and military buildings facing huge roadsfull of traffic  Overall I would choose the same hotel if I haveto go back  
P => Business trip I stayed at this hotel in ust  and received excellent service  The rooms were very clean  The hotel has a good location and was close to the airport   minutes  The mini putt course was really neat  The onsite restaurants were excellent as well  Good buffet and superb service  Overall a nice stay at this hotel while I was in New Delhi

P => Hidden Gem in New Delhi We stayed in this hotel on our last night in India  It is about km away from Connht Place and there is no metro station nearby but we knew this before booking and choose to get away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi for our final night  An autorickshaw from Connht Place will cost about Rs  though youll have to go to a pre paid booth because most drivers will try to charge you at least Rs   The hotel will organise a taxi to  from the airport but it is much more expensive than getting a pre paid car which will be about Rs   depending on the terminal The hotel was very nice  There is a great rooftop area where you can eat and drink the staff will go out to get beers for you at Rs  each and have view of the Lotus Temple  Breakfast is buffet style in the lobby  The rooms are spacious and modern with a proper king sized bed feather duvets flat screen television and large bathroom  The only fault is that there was a slight smell of sewerage but this came from outside  I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi and have a quiet relaxing night somewhere  Do your sightseeing during the day and head back to this oasis  
P => Lovely and helpful staff We stayed in the Amber for a total of  nights and loved it  The people were very service oriented and helped us ease life in Delhi  Delhi is a bustling city but the hotel is an oasis  Check out the roofgarden when youre here  
P => THE place to stay in Delhi We found The Amber on tripadvisor when we were looking for a nice and quite place in Delhi to spend our last four days in India after travelling three weeks through Rajasthan The Amber is located in a very silent neighbourhood but all hotspots are easy to reach within  minutes  The Hotel is really beautiful a wonderful mixture between western and indian style  The beds are very comfortable and the rainshower is amazing  With really hot water heated with solar energy  And also the ayurvedic beauty products are greatBut the best at The Amber is the really friendly and helpful staff who is making everything possible  We wanted to do a daytrip to Agra and they tried everything to arrange our traintickets for the next day  Since this didnt work they organized us a driver and guide for the Taj Mahal so that we had a wonderful trip And last but definitely not least the FOOD which was really amazing I had vegetable shahi korma for four times because i liked it so much and the cook always made it a little bit different for me so that i wont become boring  All the other dishes were delicious as well  I would have loved to take the cook home with me  So whenever you come to Delhi you should stay at The Amber  It is definitely in one league with all the big names in Delhi but it is way more friendly and reasonable in price  
P => Why is there so much hype about this place The place doesnt measure up to the rave reviews it seems to get  It is far from the airport  Interiors of rooms are fine but the window is so small as to make it feel like sleeping in a basement  Service quality of amenities just doesnt quite make the grade of a great hotel  
P => A Quiet Oasis in Delhi Amber is one of a kind in Delhi  Quiet contemporary comfortable clean  It excels in all areas  Mukesh the manager and all of the staff are very friendly and make you feel right at home  There have been very few hotels anywhere that I have actually sat down in the lobby and engaged in conversation  The room or is very modern and the bathrooms are spacious with all the up to date amenities that you expect  Food is very good and there is a nice rooftop garden with a great view of the Lotus Temple at sunset  I stayed in two different rooms on front and back ends of a trip to Kathmandu and both visits were equally impressive  The staff were very flexible in accommodating my  and  oclock early morning wakeups for the airport  Its location in a residential neighborhood is both a pro and a con    great respite from the constant honking horns of Delhis traffic but also hard for drivers to find  Prices are very reasonable compared to the quotbig namequot hotels in Delhi and you will get equal or better service  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Amazing Customer Service I stayed at the Amber for only a  nights but wished I would have stayed there much longer  The hotel was immaculate very modern and very well appointed but more than anything the customer service was incredible  I forgot my hair brush and the staff actually went out for me and bought me one at pm at night  On two mornings I also had to leave at am and they were able to accomodate me for breakfast and even sent me along with some Indian specialties for later in the day  The owner and managers are very good and highly responsive to any requests you might have  The only downside for me was lack of hot water on  of the days I was there but I came to find that very hot water in India is rare even when staying at the best hotels  All in all I loved this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone  
P => Saris and Parties with the Boss After spending just over a week in the deepest sub incontinent living in villages traipsing through farms and battling  inch cobras I needed a quiet and hassle free place to stay in Delhi as I cht up with friends reviewed footage for a documentary Im making and chilled out  Indian hospitality is where the guest is king  This seems to be The Ambers motto I arrived in Delhi via the domestic terminal   the Amber only offers transfers from the International terminal  They suggested the best way is to take advantage of the pre paid taxi rank approx  rupees to Sukhdev Vihar compared to over  if the hotel arrange it for you  The rooms were very clean but the windows dont open  The roof terrace is nice but there is no gym  The food was good   tho rather expensive for IndiaDelhi if youre into the  rupees for a chicken biryani schtick Now   the service  I acquired some sari fabric on my shoot  I casually asked the people at the desk where I could get a top and a petticoat for it  They not only took me to a tailor at a local ket to get measured up but collected the gear and gave me an adhoc sari wrapping lesson  I was having lunch when the boss wandered over and introduced himself  By the conversations end I was his guest to one of his friends pre wedding parties  Everything I couldve possibly wanted was catered for  The only issue I had was that no taxi driver or tuk tuk man knows where this place is  Id suggest a little map printed on their calling card to help guests out The boss said hes up against hotels like the Metropolitan  In terms of size and facilities they cant compare  So where they have to excel is in service  The rooms are well appointed the rain showers are amazing  And its one of the few hotels in Delhi to have an environmental commitment to solar energy and reusing rainwater  Having stayed in many hotels around the world   mostly boutique ones   The Amber is so far the best  So if you can afford it and you dont really want the impersonal service you get with the bigger chains come here  Stay  
P => Excellent clean hotel in quiet location with rooftop terrace and great staff This was our second stay in Delhi within a fortnight and in comparison with Old Delhi where we first stayed the Amber was a breath of fresh air literally  The hotel is situated in a quiet location which is mostly residential so not really an area with lots of amenities on its doorstep but with thousands of autorickshaws in Delhi this is not a problem  The hotel is immaculately clean all white ble and over  floors with a fantastic roof top terrace with grass and rattan furniture making it the ideal place to relax in the evening with a meal and view across of the city The staff are all excellent  You receive an exceptionally warm welcome when you arrive and are all helpful throughout your stay  We were even allowed a late checkout to fit in around our flight times meaning that we could get the most out of our last day in India  The restaurant is situated on the ground floor near the lobby so not the most relaxing of spaces however you can take meals on the roof which we would certainly recommend  The menu is varied with Indian Chinese and Western food  The food is of very good quality good sized portions and reasonably priced  The complimentary breakfast is adequate but have to admit we did not get up very early so did not benefit from it as much as we perhaps could  The waiting staff are all excellent  What is particularly nice at this hotel is that the staff are happy to engage in conservation something that we found is not so forthcoming in the larger hotels in India this gave a much more personal feel to the place The room was very clean nicely orated and the beds were extremely comfortable  Whilst the rooms do have windows ours was frosted glass so do not expect to get a view but you do get natural light  and the roof terrace more than makes up for this  The bathroom was very good nice large walk in shower and again all ble  Certainly clean I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a quieter and cleaner location in the city  
P => Wonderful Experience I recently spent  days at the Amber hotel and found it to be a pleasant surprise  I have been traveling to India for the last  years and have stayed at many hotels in Delhi and found the Amber to be up there with the best  The rooms are large clean and elegant  The bathrooms were of the highest standard with a wonderful shower to refresh your self at the end of a busy day  I stayed in room  and found the view delightful as an array of colourful saris wandering down road in the early mornings and evenings  The staff at the Amber are wonderful they are warm and helpful  It was always a pleasure to arrive at breakfast to a friendly smile and efficient service  The food was amazing because it is a boutique hotel they cook your meals from scratch and you do not get food that has been pre prepared  Sitting on the roof top and eating the delicious food was a nice touch as the Diwali fireworks went off around us  As for the location it was good for us  It got us out of the chaos of the busy Delhi streets  Close by there are some great restaurants if you feel like going out for your evening meal  It is very close to Nehru place and South Extension to do some shopping  I would recommend that you have clear instructions as to how to get to the hotel so you can tell the taxi drivers  Once you know where you are it is not that hard to find  Ask the staff at reception and they will write it all down for you  The hotel has great Wi Fi service that never failed  A few more little touches of India would not go astray  The staff are dressed to western formal for my liking but this is the only negative thing I can think to say about this hotel  Looking forward to staying again in the near future  
P => Home from home I stayed at the Amber again this time which would be my th stay here  It is by far the best value  star hotel in Delhi  The staff are friendly and helpful and always remember you on your return  The room service has greatly improved and is now as good as anny hotel with a much wider menu  The best new addition is the sun terrace which is a great place to chill out  Will be staying here again next year 
P => stylish and comfortable in Delhi The room was excellent   very modern and well appointed  Great bathroom  Service is immaculate and very friendly  Its also in a relatively quiet location   which is very welcome in Delhi  This is obviously not in any way a heritage hotel but for anyone new to India or just wanting a very comfortable and welcoming start to a trip its a great stay  
P => STAYED AT THE AMBER AGAIN I stayed at the Amber Hotel again on my trip to Delhi and this hotel is the really really good  The people working there remembered me and were warm as ever  The hotel is extremely clean and I would reccommend it to any traveller looking for  star accomadation at a affordable price  Food service and accomadation is top notch  Check out their website for an accurate description  Stay at Amber and you can thank me later  
P => Refreshing new take on a business hotel  I stayed at The Amber from  ust  to the th  I arrived at  AM at the Delhi airport yet I had a driver from The Amber awaiting my arrival  Multiple hotel staff enthusiastically greeted me despite the late time  My room was immaculate and very comfortable  I particularly liked the bathroom which was huge and stylish massive rainfall shower head bowl sink liberal use of ble  My bed was comfortable and the room was quiet the hotel is not located on one Delhis manic roads but in a more quieter neighborhood that is around the corner from the chaos  I thought the room service and staff was overly generous and the staff were very helpful in helping me plan my time in Delhi  I used their helpful laundry service which had quick turer  I would stay here again and I highly recommend this place  This hidden gem is a great value 
P => Fisrt class service   excellent hotel  We stayed at the Amber for our first few nights in Delhi  The rooms were even better than those shown on the website  The staff were incredibly helpul and genuinely went out of their ways to ensure we had a happy and comfortable stay  The location is about a  minute taxi ride out of central Delhi at a cost of about rupees  It was actually refreshing to be away from the noise and hustle of Delhi in the evenings as the hotel is located in New Friends Colony which is itself home to many great restaurants and bars  The hotel staff were brilliant rooms very clean and modern great AC and showers  All in all a great base from which to explore Delhi  
P => I wish we wwere staying longer an excellent choice and hotel iding on where to stay as new travellers and in a new country hectic city was a difficult ision however we are thrilled we chose The Amber  The staff are friendly and will always go the extra mile to help and advise  The hotel features beautiful interiors and makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive at the front door and are greeted by Mukesh and his wonderful team The rooms are beautiful the showers are incredible and our overall stay has been a fantastic start to our trip  After reading several comments made by other guests we were somewhat concerned over the hotels location however the staff go the extra mile to helping with booking taxis and even taking us themselves to the local town which boasts wonderful resturants  This was perfect for  single females who have never travelled to India   I would without hesitation recommend this hotel to anyone and would not be put off by the peaceful location  It is not far from the main attractions and is worth travelling that little bit further out to relax at the end of a hectic day An excellent hotel overall 
P => Love It  Gorgeous and peaceful that too in the heart of Delhi Great Service and very friendly  ever helpful staffThe rooms are lovely and extreamly comfortableMUST TRY FOR ALL  
P => A great hotel with very friendly service A great modern and clean hotel unusual in India as many hotels are quite dirty  In a quiet area of Delhi within access of amenites by short taxi journey  Staff are very friendly and willing to offer lots of help  Roomes are very modern with lovely bathroom facilities Internet connection is free and is high speed which is great if you are a business traveller and the flat screen tv with English channels is great 
P => Great Hotel Not the typical and not for Delhi Wonderful hotel  New and modern thoughtfully designed and appointed  Excellent service from the hotel front desk staff reservations restaurant to car service  We stayed here twice over a month each stay was great and consistent ly excellent  The restaurant is exceptional and of good value Indian to Continential Italian and Chinese  Would stay here again and recommend to friends  
P => A safe haven in a chaotic city Excellent hotel in south east Delhi   located in a quiet residential area which made you really feel like you had escaped the chaos each evening which is much needed believe me The staff were unbelieveably friendly and helpful   ordering taxis tours restaurant bookings train tickets     you name they would do it for you The security staff even helped us with a taxi driver who had totally ripped us off   we managed to negotiate the price together after the drive back Quite a new hotel with beautifully furnished and clean rooms   fantastic room service and whilst breakfast menu was quite sparse the food and service again was excellentWould definitely recommended as a safe and peaceful base whilst exploring Delhi 
P => Brand hotel   lovely rooms Brand new hotel with all the mod cons of a big city hotel Excellent service but lacked ambience or atmosphere i think there was only one other person staying at the time Food was great room was lovely and a welcome break from the budget accomodation we had been staying in up until now  The staff were extremely helpful and very accomodating Would say that it was well off the beaten track and was a long drive from most things so not a good location if you are wanting to get out and see lots of sights  
P => Lovely small hotel in the upper end of Delhi hotels  We stayed in three different hotels during our visits to Delhi and we liked The Amber  Its a small but very welcoming and friendly hotel in one of the quiter suburbs of south Delhi away from the hustle of CP The breakfasts were good and included in the price of   per night per room  The staff were very helpful and the room was beautiful  The only issue was that none of the taxi drivers seemed to be able to find it although to be fair this was the case with a lot of hotels and sites in Delhi It is out of the way but close to The Lotus Temple and south Delhi restaurants  
P => Nice room terrible location We stayed at the Amber on our last night in India before flying home The location is a long way out from anywhere  We wanted to do some last minute shopping  Unfortunately this is in completely the wrong area It is about half an hour if the roads are good to get into the centre of New Dehli  We were also disappointed that the hotel did not have any alcohol as we would dearly have liked a drink after a very hot day sightseeing  On the other hand the room itself was lovely  It was spacious and well presented  The breakfast was adequate but no more All in all room great location bad and quite expensive  
P => A great small hotel We were passing thru Delhi so we just wanted a comfortable clean hotel for one night  Our travel agent had offered two options but we did not care for either  After checking the hotels on Trip Advisor we opted for this boutique hotel based on the reviews  We found it to be a very nice and contemporary with a great bathroom comfortable bed and bedding and great staff  
P => A PLACE TO STAY IN DELHI We stayed at this relatively new modern style hotel as part of a wonderful  day private tour organised by Mr V P Singh of the Indian based company Legends and Palaces   The bedrooms and bathrooms were delightful and  star quality  The service is almost too attentive  Be careful with dinner as VAT amp Service is added to the bill  That said the meals we had were good and tasty  Note the lounge is part of the dining area and entrance hall  Despite these criticisms the hotel is in a quiet leafy sides street and is good value for money for Delhi  
P => Perfect hotel for stay in Delhi After many hours of research on the web especially on the Tripadvisor site we ided to book our  night stay in Delhi at the Amber Hotel and we were not disappointed The hotel was in a quite residential location as well as being close   minutes to shopping areas the room was spacious big window large flat screen T V  and white crispy bed sheets clean amp the bathroom with rate thick glass shower area with rain shower on top  the staff well trained and friendly and nothing was too much trouble  On arrival there was a welcome drink offered however the receptionist take us to the room and informed about the facilities  We dined in the restaurants at the lobby level and found the food to be high standard and reasonably priced  All in all a fabulous stay and we will certainly be back  
P => Quality hotel Good hotel rooms are wonderful great staff BUT breakfast is very average and basic that needs to be addressed also it has not got got a bar and that was a BIG let down and we were told we couldnt bring our own drinks down from our rooms  but the hotel itself is very clean and we would go back 
P => Wonderful looking hotel great people I stayed here for  nights with my  yr old son and we really loved this hotel  We even extended our stay there a night  Delhi is a typical Indian big city   dirty noisy seemingly incomprehensible  The Amber provides an impeccably clean beautiful calm quiet island in the storm  The staff could not have been more helpful  Breakfast was good too  Its definitely worth it to have the hotel send a driver to pick you up from the airport  Also FYI there are two Amber hotels in Delhi and one of them is in a bad location so make sure you take down the info for the right one  
P => Excellent hotel but overpriced The Amber is off the beaten path and you would need your own transportation  An excellent clean and very modern hotel run by a friendly staff who is eager to help  The price for a room is comparable to five star hotels in Delhi  The Amber provides a clean modern place in a nice neighborhood  I would get into a larger five star hotel that has the infrastructure for rental cars tours and an enviornment to meet other tourists  The hotel does have access to rental cars but we got a car for less than half of what it would have cost us to get it through the Amber  
P => Nice hotel terrible location unhelpful staff Amber is a very modern and brand new hotel with all of the luxurious touches of a  star hotel  The hotel is very clean the rooms are average sized and the ultra modern bathroom is a very pleasant surprise  The evening manager was extremely helpful with our check in and put an effort to accommodate our requests On the other hand the morning reception staff had a huge attitude problem and seem to have difficulty communicating with each other  They did not help with travel arrangements and ended up directing us to one of the scariest bus stations in Delhi  We ended up going to the Intercontinental hotel to get help with travel The location of this hotel also makes it awkward for pretty much everything  Sukhdev Vihar is also not the best part of town  We arrived rather late in the evening and driving through the residential part of a sketchy neighborhood was not terribly comforting  We stayed in room  and the view onto the unfinished road outside was less than appealing For the high cost of this hotel we would have preferred to stay closer to Connht Place  
P => Excellent boutique hotel in Delhi stayed in Amber hotel with a friend of mine for three nights what i love first about the hotel is the very friendly staff and the General Manager himself very helpful  always smiling and wiiling to help you anytimethey gave me a late check out till  pm the lobby is beautifullly orated with free internet in the roomslobby the location is in a quite neighbourhood all major attractions are within  minutes drive distance the rooms are clean and comfortablewith italian fitting in bathroom and rain showewith hot and cold water Room service is quick and food is good and hotel seems to be well executed in all fields i love the buffet breakfast and fresh fruits as well  
P => Excellent hotel in Delhi One of my favourite boutique hotels in Delhi  If you fancy a splurge get one of their rooms It feels like you are in English country house Great room design and bathrooms in a beautiful townhouse  Good service too  Please note it is not a huge  star hotel so if that is what you are used to it  offer you the similar facilities  It is a new building with white floors and lots of character  and big on luxury The location is great in a quite neighbourhood Make sure to sleep you quiter in this Hotel all the serices are greatlike room resvicetaxi servicelaundry service and restaurant and of course all the staff is friendly as they are eager to serve you all the time  
P => Way beyond my expectations My stay at the Amber was perfect The hotel is modern elegant and cozy  Showers were delicious had a hard time finding those during my travelings rooms extremely clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful with everything Definitely the best hotel i stayed during my month long stay in India  Paid higher rates in other hotels and got much less for my money  Really recomend itAnd if you get tired of the intense Indian spices there are tons of western food options  
P => It was nice to be pampered Found this hotel on Trip Advisor  All that was said in the reviews are true  Moreover one must emphasize that the reviews do not speak enough good about this place  The staff is fabulous always eager to help and friendly I needed an Indian SIM card for my cell phone  The duty manager sent his assistant on foot at  pm to escort us with the necessary documents to get a card To me that was beyond the call of duty and that says it all The kitchen is open  hours and the service and fare is superb  The whole place is orated with ble floors  the bedrooms have wooden floors and is spotlessly clean including the linen I have one small negative comment and that is about the device that maintains water pressure which constantly pounds every several seconds  and heard mostly on the third floor I mentioned it to the duty manager the next day and he said that he could have shut it off at night had I called the desk before I went to sleep I would not hesitate to stay here again  
P => Home from Home My family and I stayed at The Amber in ober   We had  Premium Room and  Executive Room  We did look at the other big hotels in New Deli but ided to go with this smaller and very modern looking hotel and we were not disappointed with our choice  Both rooms were beautifully furnished with a very contemporary feel  The rooms looked exactly like the photos on the website and were very clean  Breakfast was very good and different every day  The staff were very friendly and could not do enough for you nothing was too much trouble for them  We felt because the hotel was small the service and attention to detail was of a very high standard  The location was good and pretty central  Although the hotel itself was in a residential area it was only  minutes walk away from many shops and restaurants  It was also helpful that the hotel had a driver and a car available for day trips  This hotel was definitely a really good find  Im sure next time we are in Delhi we will definitely be staying there again  
P => Very nice stay This is indeed a hotel that deserves its ranking  I booked this hotel because of its nice reviews here on tripadvisor and I agree with all the positive reks already posted  Very nice and helpful staff  Large modern cleam rooms  Nice little restaurant  What more can you ask  
P => Great boutique hotel We booked the Amber because of the reviews on here and we were not disapointed  We stayed on four different occasions during a month long trip to india and each time we went back it was at least as good as the last time We stayed in the premium rooms which are slightly larger and offer free internet that works multi channel big flat screen TV  coffeemaker in the room mini bar etc etc   in fact every bit as good a room as the Taj Palace where we also stayed and just as clean  We stayed in  and  Meals are taken in the hotel lobby which is quite small but we also ate in our room several times  There is a  hour room service with basic things like club sandwiches and pizzas as well as some limited indian food that is very good but the hotel also sends out for food from three chosen restaurants   an Indian a Chinese and an Italian   we chose the Indian and the food delivered in about  minutes was outstandingly good   way superior to the indian restaurant in the Taj Palace for example Its also very inexpensive by western standards  We had no Delhi Belly problems whatsoever  Note they have no license for alcohol but will send out for beer and other drinks for you  Try Kingfisher beer in very big bottles for very small money   it goes great with a curry The service is first class   from the smiling saluting security guard to the boys that take your cases  We left one suitcase and some packages with the hotel between visits with no problems and at no charge  We also used their very cheap and first class laundry service leaving clothes to be done between visits  Hard to criticise  Its in a quiet area quite a way from the airport and they could do a bit more with the roof terrace that would make a nice little sitting out area   there is nowhere else to sit outside  but all in all this is an absolute gem  
P => Excellent hotel If you are afraid about cleanness dont worry   its very clean and comfortable  Besides its a new hotel so everything is modern  The location is great  Its not a commercial centre  Its a residential zone so its calm The services are also great  Very nice for business travelers and tourists  
P => Best New Boutique Hotel in Delhi My fiance and I stayed recently at The Amber Hotel and we were very happy with this hotel  In fact this is the first review weve ever posted on TripAdvisor because its such a little gem of a hotel   we wouldnt be surprised if it overtakes the others in the rankings We were looking for a middle range luxury boutique hotel in Delhi   and if youve searched the net as much as we have you know theres probably less than  hotels in that category in Delhi Delhi hotels seem to be  extremes either extremely grand and expensive aka The Imperial or quot Starquot hotels   if youve stayed at a  star in Delhi you know what to expect basic facilities a little outdated not very modern and a bit overpriced   so not always matching   star standards  So for a few extra dollars night we stayed at this very modern quiet and up and coming hotel  We booked the Amber directly and we got complimentary breakfast included nice assortment of pastries toast fruit etc       they also have a restaurant and breakfast buffet downstairs nicely arranged next to an indoor water fountain  We were surprised by how modern the hotel is   didnt realised its only less than  year old so everything looks new furniture bed linen floors pictures     The room facilities were very good  They have the typical toiletries complimentary shampoo   which incidentally is the same brand they use at The Imperial and that hotel is in the   range But heres something we didnt get at The Imperial   a Hair Comb We thought it was nice touch to get a personalised Comb that says quotThe Amberquot so we kept it  You also get very good towels hairdryer room slippers shoe shine we kept that too teacoffee facilities though they could do with a few more chocolates in the fridge and a very nice Plasma Cable TV The service was very good and very personable  Because its a smaller hotel you do interact with the same staff a lot more so its not a different face every night serving you room service or different person behind reception  They arranged some emergency transportation for us our planned driver had an unplanned accident and suggested some restaurants nearby to eat out   so they were very helpful In terms of negatives its a struggle to fnd some because they were honestly very good      but if we had to say some    be  or  instances when we had to repeat a few things to clarify some things we were saying in english but its trivial really     the room service menu is huge but dont get too excited over the Pizza the kitchen might not be prepared to make it   so please try their local dishes theyre very good  
P => An oasis of calm and stylish luxury in Delhi   AND its affordable What a top notch boutique hotel  This property is so well executed that youd seriously think that you were in Barcelona or Miami Beach  The rooms are comfortable and feature satellite television the food is good the bathrooms are immaculate   what else could you ask for in DelhiI was only there for  hours in transit before catching an early morning train to Agra  The hotel was even nice enough to book my train ticket for me and had it ready when I checked in saving me the horrible agony of having to pick it up at will call at the train station  Anyone whos ever dealt with buying or picking up a ticket an Indian railway station knows what I mean  They did charge a small service for this but it was very reasonable be only   rupees The bestworst thing about the hotel is the location  Its in a quiet residential neighborhood which was perfect for people like me who didnt really want to be in Delhi in the first place but it  seem kind of isolated to independent travelers who prefer to explore things on their own  Youd likely need to use the hotel car and driver to get anywhere as I didnt really see many taxis or rickshaws around there but I was there in the middle of the night so be I just missed them  There is a big hospital across the street so Im assuming that you probably could get one there  
P => Excellent hotel I saw the one review of the Amber and went to the hotel website and booked a room  I was really nervous about it since the rates were so much lower than other hotels in New Delhi but I ided to give it a shot  Wow was I impressed This hotel is gorgeous  We arrived late at night and there was a security guard at the front door which I appreciated  The front desk staff was adequate but not overly friendly  But the room was gorgeous  The basic room is exactly as depicted on the webiste     gorgeous wood floors a very comfortable bed a nice modern bathroom a great TV and the list goes on  We were on the inside facing into the courtyard area so I heard zero street noise  My only advice is too book your own driver as their driver service was about twice as much as the other quotes we got from other companies We did not try the breakfast but one morning there was a buffet which was included in the room rate  But the next morning there was no buffet and we ordered off the menu and it was included in the room rate as well I would definitely stay here again  
P => Excellent Boutique Hotel An excellent property of a converted Delhi mansion in the South of Delhi  AmbianceA modern glass and ble entrance to a front desk with a small seating area and adjoining dining tables  This was obviously the living room  dining room of the home  There is a smal courtyard that rises all the way thru the four floors of the hotel  LocationCentral location in Delhi about  minutes from the rail station and  from the airport with typical Delhi traffic  I am not sure whether the location might be a bit hard to find by a typical cab driver as the building is in a residential area  The RoomA modern European architecture with the mix of fine wood and glass finish  The room is well appointed with large closets a LCD TV mini bar and many other amneties can be secured through the front desk  i e  DVD Players etc  A great selection of channels as they are using the Tata premium satellite service a feature that not even The Imperial Hotel currently offers  This might sound a bit unimportant but when one is traveling thru India most TV reception is restricted to a slate of  or  English speaking channels  The bed was firm and comfortable and bedding was of excellent quality  The pillows were plenty and quite comfortable  The restroom is well appointed with a glass encased rainfall shower and hot water was a plenty ServiceExcellent response and attention as one should expect in India  The staff was very helpful and attentive and could easily communicate via Hindi or English  The only misstep was when it took a bit long for the room service to be cleared out FoodI arrived very late in the evening and the kitchen was able to create a good replica of Penne Bolognese  The food come within  minutes after the kitchen captain came up to the room for the order  PriceA very good value at   Rupees  Similar  star hotels will be in the   Rupees  The food service was actually relatively inexpensive for this type of hotel in India  Usually I would spend   Rupees for a meal and my bill came under   Final CommentsActually a bit hesitant in posting this review as this hotel almost qualifies as a hidden gem and jeopardize their availability for my next stay trip to Delhi  However I was so favorably impressed from my usual stays at The Imperial Taj or Ambassador that they well deserve it  
P => Hotel sympatique  
P => 
P => Great hotel great people Here came my holidays    and the selection was Hotel Claridges in Delhi for my trip to the Golden Triangle Great hotel  great people and great services   all being met at one place Our stay at this hotel inspired us to come back to our native place and ofcourse   we will definitely stay at Hotel Claridges Delhi 
P => Great place to stay We had two stays here at either end of a Golden Triangle tour  The hotel was very plush we had a deluxe room which was spacious and well orated  Also impressed by the slippers  bathrobe in the wardrobeThe pool and surrounding area was lovely just a shame the sun went behind the surrounding buildings pretty earlyReations were ongoing during our stay however did not cause us any real disturbance aside from hearing drilling one afternoon by the pool The service was a little variable and its this which prevented me rating this as a   The door staff porters amp housekeeping staff were excellent   very friendly and chatty  The reception staff were polite but indifferent and the Pickwicks restaurant staff did not seem particularly interested at all We tried the food in the Jade chinese restaurant which was superb also Pickwicks for breakfast and an evening meal  The food here was excellent however the service let the place down  Our drinks were forgotten we asked for extra butter at breakfast which never arrived amp the service was extremely slow  
P => An oasis of calm and charm in a the madness that is Delhi We booked two arate nights at The Claridges one at the start and one at the end of a two week trip north to the Himalayas  Both arrival times at the hotel were early in the morning  Expecting to wait around for the midday check in we were greeted by friendly efficient and polite staff and were found rooms almost immediately   one at  oclock in the morning  Whisked up to our room by a smiling floor manager in an impeccable suit we were given a clean comfy mini suite with a huge bed and huge screen TV  There were no extra charges for the early check ins The two restaurants we used were well staffed by smiling helpful people  Breakfast was a fresh and plentiful buffet with hot choices cooked in front of you  For dinner we chose the European option there are  restaurants  We were escorted by a delightful chatty receptionist to the rear of the building where we were seated on an atmospheric terrace with a stream and billowing muslin drapes  The food was excellent not quite Michelin but my steak was cooked just right and a reasonable French red wine at about  GBP completed the evening Having an afternoon to fill we walked towards a New Delhi local ket  We were stopped by a Tuc Tuc man who promised to show us Delhi  A bit wary but with the assurance of a friendly passer by we bit the bullet  Kamal our Tuc Tuc man as he turned out to be called did show us Delhi  Safely patiently and with good English he took us to a few of the best sites and to the best place to buy a great silk Kashmiri rug  We can thoroughly recommend Kamal as a reliable and knowledgeable driver  He charged us  rupees for the round trip about   GBP including waiting for us when we went sightseeing  He can be found on his mobile      give him a ringOverall a great Hotel experience   good security  hour armed police presence in the background   lovely staff   everthing worked   good food   a real oasis of calm and charm in the madness that is Delhi  
P => Never never never again What a dreadful experience We had previously stayed at the Taj Palace   incomparably superior   and found The Claridges grossly inadequate  The refurbishment wasnt complete we had to have the plumber TWICE in one evening there was no storage in the bathroom and the shower soakaway was unable to deal with the inout from the shower  Worst of all there was hammering going on under our room until   a m despite repeated calls to Reception and the Duty Manager  As a result we had a sleep free night and were far too shattered to do the visits we had planned for the next morning  Totally unacceptable and never a word of apology let alone any compensation  The hotel should be thoroughly ashamed of itself  
P => Above average hotel with below average service The hotel is centrally located in the embassy area near Khan ket  Although Khan ket can be walked in about   minutes it is advisable to take a taxi or ask your driver to drop you off at the ket and take a taxi back to the hotel  The check in process at about am was fast and being upgraded to a suite for  nights was appreciated  The room and bathroom were spacious and clean   complimentary bottles of water every day helped beat the heat and potential bout with diarrhea   hour internet use was not complimentary and set us back about  per day The below average score for quotServicequot was due to the lackadaisical attitude and lack of attention to detail of the wait staff for breakfast and dinner at Dhaba  Coffee and refills were not served in a timely fashion for the entire stay of  days  On the rd morning I observed the female host take something from the serving table and quickly put it in her mouth as she was walking towards the pastry area  Except for the doorman a lot of the staff did not acknowledge us with a smile even when I said good morning  The reception area staff were also not friendly although they did what they were supposed to do Food at Dhaba Restaurant was expensive with the taste average at best  I would recommend heading over to the Khan ket to eat at Chonas Indian food Salims kebab rolls change money and shop a little bit In regards to the quotsoft remodelquot noise reported by guests I did not hear any construction noise during our stay  According to the hotel the remodel will be complete by the end of ober   Speaking of currency exchange change as much as you can at the Punjab Bank no commission vs Thomas Cook   commission  For a hotel that has a lot of positives Claridges Hotel will be an option for me to consider but it is not a hotel that I can say that I will definitely go back to if another alternative is available  
P => one of the most centrally located  star hoetsl in delhi claridges is located  mins khan ket and lodhi garden and is one of the most centrally located  stars in delhi   in the heart of lueytans delhi its one of the best places for a business meeting or just staying if you have a budget problem  they have a  hour coffee shop sevilla  spainsh restaurant which has one of the best ambience in delhi and is worth eating in in winters as its open air   a vodka lounge with one of the best stocked bars in town  the service is excellent and so is the pool and the business facilities   unlike other multi storyed hotels in delhi the rooms dont have a dominating view of the area but they are extremely plesant and clean   stayaing is claridges is an expensive and also it tends to be booked heavily during riage season and winters so its advisable to book in advance  
P => Claridges was wonderful Really nice hotel with exceptionally courteous staff  Very clean and nice rooms  The breakfast buffet was very good  
P => claridge is classy but not always perfect The Claridge is definitely classy great furniture beautiful colours interesting architecture    In addition it is well located for dealing with embassies or to go the bustling activities of connht place a short taxi hop Still not everything works perfectly in the claridge rooms are uneven with some without any views some noisy and some with rusted pipe fittings  These are easily forgotten if you manage to get a good deal  But if you are paying above  USD and you room is still average you  wonder if another choice would have been wiser  On the other hand most of luxury hotels in Delhi are expansive during high season so you  just enjoy the very elegant setting and furniture of the claridge    
P => EXPENSIVE HOTEL NOT VALUE FOR MONEY The hotel is located centrally in new delhi and it very convenient for business visitors  Its gym and pool is merely functional  The people are nice and warm  Breakfast is ordinary and the lobby is only acceptable  Their charges for health clubs are very high  
P => Excellent value   good service   friendly staff We had the pleasure of staying here one week apart and in different sections of the hotel  Our first bout of stay was excellent   staff were helpful polite and accommodating   the service in the restuarants was excellent   rooms were very nice   just by the pool   all in all on this occasion the hotel was very good However on our second visit to the hotel   the only complaint we had was the room   we were on the first floor and the rooms above are being reated therefore there was quite a considerable amount of disturbance during the day and this went on to approximately   at night  However as we were only staying one night this time we felt we could put up with it   if we had been staying longer we certainly would have asked to be moved to a quieter room  The room itself was lovely   and once again the staff were excellent  All in all a very nice hotel and a good stay  
P => A great Place to Stay in New Delhi My wife and I stayed at The Claridges two different times between ch  and il    Each time we were greeted warmly and made to feel at home  Our first room was on the first floor off the pool area and had a sliding door that gave us access there  It was quiet at night and we had it all to ourselves  We ate at two of the restaurants both reasonably priced and with wholesome mostly vegetarian fare but thats about what you get in India  One of the hotel shops is a bakery  We bought some pastries to eat in the room with tea  The hotel provided china dishes napkins and silverware for us to enjoy our treats  Just a short walk down the block is a house owned by the wealthy Birla family at which MK Gandhi stayed near the end of his life  It is open to the public and has artifacts of the great man and dipictions of the important events of his life as well as impressive statues and gardens  
P => No complaints Stayed for  nights at the end of a visit to north India  I have no complaints about Claridges and found it to be a very good hotel  Location was in the posh diplomatic area of New Delhi lobby was elegant and luxurious and staff were very helpful and friendly  I insisted on a refurbished room and found this to be excellent  The room came with a balcony and a small wardrobedressing room leading to the bathroom  This small wardrobedressing room was poorly lit but otherwise I was very happy with the room  There was a large flat screen TV and internet access payable no road noise and a generally comforable feel to the room  Breakfast was tasty with good choices  We had an offer of free spa treatment for staying  nights but we found that men and women had different times for accessing the spa and we could not be there together strange  
P => Poor quality of the rooms Stayed here for the first time in ch   I visit Delhi regularly and have stayed at a number of other  star hotels  Service at the hotel is excellent people are friendly but there is one major problem The quality of the rooms  My room was in urgent need of reation one chair was wobbly and even dangerous to sit on the bathroom was just shabby for a five star hotel  Morevoer it had only a tiny window and when you looked outside you were staring at a wall one metre away from the window  I checked the other rooms in my corridor and found them similar  Clearly based on my experience the Claridges is the most inferior five star hotel in Delhi in terms of room quality  
P => Lousy Whilst externally everything looks fine in details it isnt I stayed for  erate stays with a couple of days in between On both stays the bathrooms have mould and fungus all over so whilst the Molton Brown toiletries are nice mould isnt so nice the internet which is costly is intermittent The staff at the reception try to look extremely friendly but are are on another planet an example is when i checked in I requested them to check up with my airline if they were on to send a free complimentary car as I had bookedno body bothered They habitually try to multitask like when checking you out attend to other things and are not able and delay you On my second stay i asked for a room after the first stay had a lousy room with a view but they put me in one  where the glass is covered in a film so you cant look out at all as it looks out over some equipment  The room doors vibrated everytime someone walked past in the corridor outside On the positive side the Dhaba restaurant was good as was the beds and linen in terms of comfort Many nice alternative places to stay  
P => Having stayed here before       Having stayed here in ember  we were familiar with the Hotel and loved the service then and it was similar now with heightened security of course  As a family of  traveling together we had  different rooms and all were comfortable and suited our rather short stay  Dinner and Breakfast at Pickwicks was great as all our picky palates were thoroughly pleased  We will stay here again if we go back to our roots  
P => Wouldnt go again We had booked a Claridges room but werent informed in advance that all these rooms are smoking rooms  Also the first room we were offered overlooked a massive air conditioning unit on the roof  The manager said they could remove the ashtrays and spray air freshner which would make it non smoking We ended up paying for an upgrade which was a disappointing start to our holiday Apart from that the hotel is okay  It is a lovely building and the bar and restaurants are pretty good however we would not stay there again  
P => Very comfortable but it seemed a bit pricey Great service and a lovely hotel  The rooms were large and well orated  The bathroom or could do with a freshen up but that is being a bit picky I thoroughly enjoyed Like a lot of Indian Hotels though  It was pretty expensive  The pool area wasnt anything to get excited about but the service was good around the pool The hotels retaurants were all good in their own way  My favourite was probably the Italian restaurant  
P => Not first class I was told this was a first class hotel but it certainly isnt  It might have a ble entrance hall but thats about it  We stayed here twice at the begiinning and the end of our holiday  The rooms were tired smelled of smoke and were grubby  Ours wasnt even ready when we checked in at  oclock at night The food is pretty awful and certainly not what you would expect of a supposedly st hotel  
P => Fab breakfast Lovely hotel with a colonial feel  Good location within easy access to the sights of New Delhi and Old Delhi  The breakfast we had was the best of anywhere we stayed with a good choice lots of fresh fruit and best of all soya milk  The only negative was the bar which was dark and dingy and very expensive  
P => A once good place running down We stayed in the Claridges in Delhi as a first stop on our honeymoon trip through India When we arrived at the hotel we noticed it looked quite nice and well laid out for its hotel class until we went to the room  At this stage it appeared the claridges had lost some of its former charm The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the stay so from that aspect they do have that part down and organised However the rooms were small and wearing down  From our room we had a view over the inner courtyard and swimming pool and the rest of the building appears just as run down and worse for wear the bathroom although well equipped and neatly furbished was still on the small side the outside pool area was also a bit on the small side and sat on an inner courtyard overlooked by the hotel from all angles  The pool itself was well maintained otherwise and served its purpose We had a chance to wander round the rest of the hotel and found some restaurants connected to the hotel which look interesting and appealing although we had dinner plans elsewhere for that one night thus did not get a chance to try them As for breakfast this was well managed and nicely spread with a good choice of continental and Indian fare Overall its obviously a five star service but in a building that is quickly running down and not being maintained The hotel needs a refurbishment to match its staffs efforts  
P => No carpets please A little background first My husband has been working in India  I flew over to join him in Delhi for a week  Thus we arrived in Delhi from different directions at different times  I arrived at am from Australia while my husband arrived at pm that evening via an internal Indian flight I booked a Club Room with twin beds  The charge including buffet breakfast for two in Pickwicks Restaurant amp taxes etc was  Australian dollars per night  As arranged with the hotel via email prior to my arrival there was a chauffeur driven car waiting with my name on a sign for me at the airport  This service costs about AU one way The hotel check in service at am was well managed and took place in the room rather than the front counter  A hostess showed me to my room on the first floor which looked exactly as it did on the website  However the photos do not provide smell  As I stepped into the room there was an overpowering musty damp carpet smell  I informed them that I would not be able to stay in the room with this smell  We tried to open the window but this was not possible  Another room   across the hall   was immediately offered as a replacement for the remainder of the night  This room also had carpet and a lingering musty smell but it did have an opening glass door onto a landing overlooking the pool so it was possible to get fresh air  I believe this was a Claridges Room As this room had a king sized bed instead of twin beds I informed them that it would not be suitable once my husband arrived  They assured me that another Club Room would be available for me in the morning  When I followed this up after housemaid service in the morning   a Club Room on the nd Floor was offered to me  This room had ble floors   no musty smell at all  It was fresh clean and spacious  Also the bathroom in a Club Room is larger than in the Claridges room  It has a arate bath and shower with a large vanity  Whereas in the Claridges room the shower was over the bath and the bathroom was only large enough for one person at a time Breakfast in Pickwicks Restaurant had everything you expect in a western buffet breakfast  Fresh amp tinned fruit French yoghurts cereal cook your own toast pastries breakfast cakes eggs cooked to order bacon sausages tomatoes mushrooms and also Indian breakfast  Staff are eager to please and attentive and even provided us with a container of pastries amp cakes when we advised that we were driving to Agra for the day Note It takes  hours to drive to Agra from Delhi There is a very good Bakery in the hotel  The prices are a little cheaper than in Australia but pricey by Indian standards  However the quality was excellent and ideal if you want a light snack in your room instead of a full meal for lunch or dinner  Mini bar items are overpriced like every hotel  Although the bottled water was probably the most extreme  I think it worked out at AU  for  litre bottle  You can buy the same cold at a roadside stall for less than  cents   INR However  x ml bottles of water are included in the daily room rate  One in the bathroom to brush your teeth and  with the complimentary teacoffee items The staff at Claridges were polite and efficient but I couldnt help feeling that they were always waiting for a tip  Being Australian I am not accustomed to tipping and do it badly  I feel uncomfortable when someone hangs around like a bad smell waiting for a tip  I also felt that they were doing no more than their job and did not warrant a tip but perhaps that is an Australian attitudeThe housekeeping facilities are very good with sheets amp towels changed daily and toilettries replenished  The only issue I had was with the quality of the towels  I must admit to a towel fettish here so you  discount my comments if you dont have the same fettish  The towels at Claridges were not up to spec  While they were soft they were not particularly absorbent and you were left with a slightly damp feeling after using them We didnt use the evening turn down service as it was at   pm when we were either in the shower or getting dressed for dinner and didnt want hotel staff in the room at that time The internet speed in the Business Centre  computers and a dodgy printer in a shabby basement room is very slow  It was not possible to attach photos or word documents to emails  The system would crash while trying to upload  Short emails were all that was possible  This was a pay per hour service So overall A beautiful clean well maintained hotel  The quotlookquot of the hotel is opulent  Staff are polite amp efficient as long as your request is within their past experience  The negatives are the poor Internet facilities and the towels  
P => Very nice hotel in a nice area I had a very nice stay at this hotel  The room was nicely orated with nice ammenities  There is a very modern clublike bar  I ate at two of the restaurants    the cafe for several meals and the spanish restaurant which as a very nice outdoor atmosphere  The food was good at both  The hotel arranged an excellant driver  The pool area is pleasant with good service     I have no complaints with this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again  
P => Mixed feelings We were doing the Great Rail Journey Palace on Wheels trip so we stayed in this hotel  times and had  different rooms  First room on ground floor  nights with doors into garden and pool area  Lovely room  Bed very hard Noisy at night due to tiled ble corridor and lots of people moving about  Nice amenities   robes slippers etc  Second room a few nights later  night was awful  Stained carpet No window When I opened the curtain it was just a blanked out window  Good job it was only for one night  Would not have put up with any more  Third room on our last night of the holiday was much better  Several people in our group had a similar experience being in rooms where the windows were blanked out  The pool area is very nice but there were only  sunbeds when we were there  Not enough  The hotel is looking a little tired in places  There were a number of areas that needed stening up  However the staff were lovely and service was great overall  Food was good  Try the pancakes for breakfast 
P => Excellent hotel to combine business and pleasure Very friendly and efficient service throughout our three day stay  Staff are discrete personal and help you feel so welcome  Attentive to every need   Senate club very relaxing   a genuine stress buster  Large bright comfortable room  Pickwicks restaurant good value but can become crowded  Very European feel to this place and airconditioning is definitely efficient  If you are travelling in heat of summer this place should be good  
P => Just right for arriving in India We arrived in India and went straight to the hotel   it was luxurious beautiful and felt nice and safe just what you need when arriving in a foreign quite scary city  It has all the stuff we grew to expect   you have to tip everyone and the telephone sometimes didnt work and things that you expect to work like the shower button were a bit dodgy but   hey   it was actually the best of the Indian hotels in terms of comfort and facilities  I went and used their beauty parlour and had a head massage which was very cheap and very good  We ate in one of the onsite restaurants the first night   big mistake as it was very expensive and we wernt business people eating on the company account but tourists saving our pennies for other stuff  We actually stayed twice at the Claridges and the second time they upgraded us to a suite whcih was sumptuous and breakfast was in a special arate suite people only place no riff raff   we fitted right in as you can imagine and we had room service then which was terrific   much cheaper than the restuarants and fantastic food beautifully presented  I would happily go again 
P => Oasis away from hectic Delhi We stayed in  hotels and this one was by far the best one  It felt like a real oasis once coming out of the very busy Delhi Not cheap we know but worth it The restaurants were very good Sevilla a bit pricy but the location makes up for it and we enjoyed cooling down at the Claridges after our hectic days in Delhi  Minus point  taxis  Drivers are not very reliable and they tend to cheat on customers  But yes thats very common in Delhi  But luckily we found a company with drivers that were quotsafequot and who didnt hassle us at all  So with those quotsafequot taxirides we felt a lot more at ease  
P => excellent value for money  This hotel is excellent value for money  The room was very large with a large balcony complete with table amp chairs overlooking the side street  The hotel has a colonial feel and the staff are all friendly amp helpful  There is a large lawned area at the front where guests can sit at tables sipping tea amp watching the comings amp goings of other guests The hotel is a little out of the way with no amenities within near walking distance but taxis can be quickly summoned by the doorman  
P => Great hotel I stayed here with a colleague at the beginning and end of our trip to India  Im not sure I could really find fault with the hotel  The staff are friendly and efficient the rooms are very clean and well stocked with little luxuries and the food is good too  Its not quite as close to the centre of Delhi as the Imperial and not quite as grand but Id happily stay again  
P => Loved it We had  rooms booked and were very happy with them both  Family of   The or is excellent and there is a lot of attention to details given in the rooms Staff were attentive and polite Will be going back there the next time we are in Dehli  
P => We will be going back We are expats who travel from one part of India to Delhi regularly  We bring our little girl during our travels to Delhi so accommodation has to be close to home comfort as well as the feeling being spoilt  The Claridges gives us both  We have always liked boutique hotels no matter where we are around the world  The staff here is just amazing   very polite accommodating and not  in your face  The whole hotel is very pleasant  We enjoy taking my little girl for a walk around the pool and the gardens and every once in a while I feel like I am living in my very own mansion  We love the quee on the front lawn   where we sit around and enjoy the lovely Delhi  The location is really central and we enjoy being accessible to many sites  
P => An Oasis in Hectic Delhi Claridges Hotel was a standout on a recent trip to Delhi  The hotel is in a beautiful residential area of New Delhi and is a modern hotel that recalls the glory days of the British Empire  Definitely a perfect location for an Agatha Christie mystery  This is a small hotel with a large garden and seems to be overstaffed so service is excellent  Don t be surprised that many of the staff know you by name  The tour desk can be contacted by email prior to arriving and all traveltouring arrangements can be made for the duration of a stay  Our budget room booked through Asiarooms com was well orated and the size of a good sized ship s cabin  However other rooms were quite large  There are several restaurants but we only had time and energy to eat at the grill for breakfast and dinner which was ala carte or buffet  Free wireless internet is available in the rooms and throughout the hotel In and around Delhi the pace is quite hectic so after a long day it is refreshing to find the calm and restful atmosphere at Claridges  This hotel proved to be an excellent choice both in price comfort and amenities  
P => Overpriced but good restaurant and bar After staying at sub par properties and viewing some downright disgusting hotels in India we chose the Claridges as our last hotel in India  The room was clean and comfortable the interior of the hotel is lovely and has character but it could use some updating on the outside  That said the Spanish restaurant was very good and the hotel bar was quite nice  We left paying US for one night a dinner and drinks for what I would consider a four star hotel  In India apparently this is a good value  
P => Three Rooms three different stars We stayed here on a group tour this t  the first night our room was fabulous the second night when we returned it was awful and smelled of cat urine and was much smaller the third and final night of return it was small but musty  I will say there breakfast and service was great  We ate in the Jade room on our final night and had a wonderful meal  They were great about exchanging different currency and making change  
P => GREAT PLACE TO STAY Am i glad that i ided to stay in a hotel that is safe central and good in all respects the service is amongst the best i have experienced staff is polite and helpful   nothing is too much  Their new restaurant Saveilla is to die for  the food is out of this world book well in advance  the hotel is partty refurbished a few dollars more is well worth it as they have all the great features The breakfast at the senate only for new club rooms is superlative  We were there for  days and really enjoyed it  
P => A nightclub not a hotel Any hotel review in New Delhi should be prefaced with the caveat that quotIndia Risingquot has prompted a flood of business visitors into the Indian capital from all over the world  As a result when it comes to quality hotel rooms it is a sellers ket  Thus visitors should have no illusions that a night room will get them value youd find at a Four Seasons Shangri La or any other top tier Asian facility When it comes to The Claridges potential lodgers should be aware that the hotel was recently sold locals tell me that the family which sold it had been feuding and the place was allowed to deteriorate  However the new owners still have a long way to go to get this place up to acceptable standards  When making my reservation I specifically asked not to be located near the ground floor Aqua vodka bar which is infamous for its blaring house music into the wee hours  You guessed it    I was booked onto the ground floor about half way down the corridor  The floor of the hallway is ble and the corridor is arched thus forming a wonderful acoustic amplifier  If you and a friend want to hold a conversation at opposite ends of the hallway you will have no problem  If its past midnight and you are trying to sleep ahead of an important morning business meeting then you will be miserable  The bass from the music can be clearly heard and inebriated patrons outside the door to Aqua or in the lobby will be audible inside your room  Yes I did complain several times but to little avail  Bluntly the owners need to ide if they want to run a hip nightclub or an acceptable hotel  Those who also find an internet connection a priority in their hotel will be disappointed  The hotel offers a pay as you go wi fi service that is unreliable  The hotel also charges an extortionist  rupees per day for a  hour long connection  Thats nearly  I dont think Ive ever paid that much at any hotel in the world and is certainly beyond the pale for a hotel in India with a sporadic connectibility  An alternative is to hunt down a staff member to log you on to one of the three computers in the business center for which they will also charge you  Other concerns the key card for the door seemed to de magnetize every couple of days or so  Cigarette smoke and other undesirable odors from the room adjacent to mine wafted in through the vents  The toilet paper dispenser was situated behind the toilet lid meaning some tricky maneuvers to comfortably carry out operations  Stained carpet in the room  Towels and bedsheets that smelled of smoke or had stains  The morning tea at the breakfast buffet tastes more like coffee pots obviously interchangeable ask for your own pot of hot water and tea bags instead  After several days here I reked to colleagues that staying at The Claridges was a part time job in itself  On the positive side the food is good in the restaurants  Wait staff are polite and efficient except for the infrequent glitch in orders  Theres a Sunday brunch served on the front lawn  Aqua has the best selection of vodkas in New Delhi which youll be able to enjoy before the DJ arrives and blasts you out of the bar  The hotel is centrally located  I previously stayed at the nearby Taj Ambassador which had a lower rate not sure if thats the case any longer and would recommend that over The Claridges  Unless you are hostage to this hotel as part of a tour package or can secure a room elsewhere besides the ground floor you will definitely desire to give this place a pass at all costs especially at the rates they are quoting these days  
P => great experiance i had checked into the hotel mid ober for  nights and i must say that it was quite good experiance The staff was really nice and helpful the rooms were excellent and were much beter than the rooms at the Taj or the Oberoi  I guess since the reation has been done on the rooms the hotel had done a fabulous job  I celebrated my birthday along with my wife at the heotel must i say without my giving any such hints they organised an excellent dinner for the both of us with a bottle of wine along with the staff and the general managers compliments  Recommend all to visit atleat once  
P => Claridges   staff excellent  treat you like a Viscount Stayed in The Claridges for  days  Excellent in every way attentive friendly staff scrupulously clean excellent restaurant choices Italian Indian Chinese  trendy Vodka Bar  especially on Wednesday and Friday  Taxi service was inexpensive and prompt notwithstanding the infamous Delhi traffic  UN personnel guests brought added security checks but it will be my home from home on future trips  
P => What a disappointment Visiting India last week we chose to stay for the first  days and final day at The Claridges Hotel in New Delhi priily due to the location being central and their ability to provide  erate beds in a room  Although the room was small  for the first  days it was adequate and we were told upon our departure that we could repeat this set up after our tour   Upon arriving back after a long and tiring journey from Agra we were informed that they only had the club room available at a much higher rate  We were so tired that we had no choice but to accept this  Now read the following Blood on the bedsheets a shower that leaked so badly in the bathroom we had to use  towels to cover the floor so we didnt slip over which they promised to replace but didnt mould and damp on the walls and the extra bed turned up at  pm in the form of a badly damaged and dirty matress thrown onto the floor by  very rude staff members  Other highlights of the stay were  erate occasions of being shortchanged by lobby staff when changing currencies not by a few pounds either completely wrong breakfast being delivered damaged garden furniture with nails sticking out that ripped my friends trousers rancid butter   oh what a wonderful  star experience  If you pay for what you get we were seriously overcharged  I have stayed in modest guest houses in some of the poorest parts of Sri Lanka and have been delighted with the atmosphere cleanliness honesty and hospitality of these places to these I shall recommend others and return myself    as for The Claridges my advice is simple Avoid it I shall 
P => Good Hotel let down by pool area Spent  nights here having completed a  day tour round the area  The service from staff was the best on our whole  week holiday Other reviews have mentioned the rooms and reations taking place  The rooms were good but out of the whole lot only  face the pool area  I think as tourists we wanted to unwind around the pool having spent the previous days rushing round Rajastan  This part of the hotel wasnt  star and really needs sorting out  Having said that I got the impression thats lots of its guests are business people or Indian families so gathering around the pool isnt as important as to themTry not to use the phone in the room either  I spotted a fraudulent transaction on my account and had to phone the bank straight away  I was charged   for a  minute phone call  So if you need to phone home get a phone card 
P => World Class I recently spent several nights at the Claridges  The service is extraordinary and every employee is friendly and eager to be helpful  The hotel    recently reated    is gorgeous and the location is great  Our meals at the restaurant hotels were first class and we got a great rate on the internet  Highly recommended 
P => Great value for money The Claridges was a change from most hotels in the region  The rooms are large cellings are high and amenities are morden and the most enjoyable thing is the natural light We stayed for  days whilst i was busy with business my wife made the most of staying in heart of Delhi  The staff was friendly and helpful  
P => Terrible Although the   that has been refurbished is very nice indeed if like me you were stuck in the   that had not expect to pay  for a large room with stained carpets sofa and walls a bathroom with cracked tiles and bath half eaten trays of food left on the ripped carpeted corridor floor leading to your room and a very noisy air conditioner  On the plus side they make very nice ice cream coffee in the coffee shop  I appreciate that they are half way through updating but to continue to place people in these rooms and call themselves a  star hotel is a joke 
P => Nice hotel but a few problems I spent  days at the Claridges in late early ch   Its an older hotel that is undergoing reation  I had a reated room complete with plasma TV and electronically controlled lighting and drapes  The bathroom had a nice ble shower and the entire room showed very nicely  While it showed nicely not everything worked properly  Channels on the TV had to be switched manually I think because no one could figure out how to program the remote  The shower door leaked and water flowed freely onto the floor  The air conditioning vent had very wide slots and flies constantly came through  Lastly they use a ghastly cleaning fluid on the ble floors that leaves a terrible odor The hotel has several restaurants and all are good especially the chinese  Service is prompt and very friendly  Like other nice hotels in India the staff tries almost a little too hard and you are constantly saying no thank you  There is a nice lawn with umbrella tables out front  Great place for a cigar and drink this time of year  If not for the odor Id give the hotel a third star  
P => Claridges very subpar for the price  
P => surprised at the quality of accommodation  
P => Great hakka style food  
P => Beyond the raj  
P => Very  Colonial   
P => Too expensive for what you get  
P => Good hotel in nice neighborhood  
P => Colonial  
P => que de bruit  
P => Luxus pur  
P => Ausgezeichnetes Hotel  
P => impeccable  
P =>  pouvantable   
P => Buen hotel en una zona tranquila  
P => Un disastro  
P => 
P => Central Business District of New Delhi Well located in Connht Place also known as the Central Business District of New Delhi The Connht hotel a First Class  Star First Class hotel in New Delhi is suitable for the discerning business Traveller as well as the tourists  The hotel is in the vicinity of New Delhi Railway Station and also well connected to the International and Domestic airports  
P => A nice hotel in the middle of everything After three nights in two star hotels I was relieved to stay here  It is way above twothree star but definitely not  star  However it felt like a  star by comparison Room was spacious modern and had all the amenities I could want  Very nicely orated fruit basket cookies and water bottle daily  Hotel staff very gracious and helpful with all my requests including a late checkout because I had an  p m  flight  They arranged for cardriver for sightseeing at very reasonable rates INR  for the day It is set back off the street giving it a classy and safe feel which was important as a single female traveller  I would definitely recommend it  I booked it through an online reservation site way below rack rate  
P => Well located  I stayed for  days at this property right in the heart of New Delhi and had a comfortable stay  It is m behind Regal Cinema and iseasily approachable  Hardly one hrs drive from the airport it is just min drive to the New delhi railway station Connht Place is full of restaturants and food outlets and most are in the vicinity of this hotel The rooms are well furnished and the bathroom accessories are of modern touch  The AC is centrally controlled and is quite effective  The hotel has excellent staff who are avaiable on call The erstaurant food is not great and is okay for a meal or two but not for a stay of     days Overall a good experince for a business trip  
P => Economical option in the centre of the city I visit New Delhi quite often for work  Whenever mhy work needs me to be near the city office  This one of the economical options there Some parts of the hotel seems to be stuck in the mid s  But the staff is very warm and cheerful  They have refurnished some of the rooms these rooms are pretty nice for the money that is paid  The older part is a bit below the k The bathrooms are pretty small and not for the claustophobics  The toiletries provided are not of very high quality recomend that travellers take their own Earlier it used to overlook the Shivaji Hockey stadium which was a good sight to wake up to  But now it is all been demolished for a Metro Station not sure if one will get as much sunlight once that is constructed  The hotel offers a fruit basket which is very good though  The breakfast is pretty functional though  Their Restaurant where the breakfast buffet is provided could do with some urgent reation though Overall stay in this hotel if you have very functional requirements and the expectation is low  
P => Liked the welcome cookies and fruits Nice and cleanly maintained rooms breakfast has variety nice to see welcome cookies and fruits as you check in however over priced lower rent would attract more traffic 
P => Okay experience The rooms are well furnished  Some of them offer a great view of the stadia next door  The hotel has good service but late night orders are sometimes delayed beyond reasonable time Room or is appreciable though layout could be improved upon The location of the hotel is quite an advantage and the rack rates are pretty competitive The front office service could be improved upon sometimes the checking out process can be quite time consuming Overall a good hotel and staying could be a pretty good experience  
P => An ok hotel for the budget traveller cant complain much as it is like a typical  star hotel  Dont expect much from service but is ok when the budget is limited  didnt try the food during my stay  
P => WONDERFUL STAY The Connht is a wonderful hotel conviniently located amp suberb staff  I have stayed for  nights and enjoyed them all  Room was quite good with excellent view of city  Basket of fruits amp biscuits is good gesture by hotel  Eating in tea lounge is very enjoyable cakes amp pastries displayed are fabulous  Tried room service for dinner food was good  Live breakfast is good to see amp encourages you to eat  Bar is quitely located with light music We also had a joyride on Delhi Metro as station is very near to hotel Overall enjoyed stay amp would again like to come to The Connht when we visit India in future  
P => Excellent Stay Hotel is in hub of city but still peaceful and with much wanted greenery  Staff very courteous  Cleanliness very good  No need to spend for going to shops as we can walk to connht place  Stayed for  nights and will try to come again  
P => Lousiest Service Ever Completely untrained staff  Our list of complaints was much longer but here are the memorable highlights They wake you up at  AM to ask you if youd like to use the laundry service They dis regard the quotdo not disturbquot sign on your door  The housekeeping staff can wake the dead with their ruckus while they clean other rooms around yours  Doesnt help that the walls and doors are paper thin   All in all God help you if youre trying to sleep in  The breakfast is terrible and the waiters are sullen and cant be bothered to bring you anything Ive had better service in rat traps in Paris  
P => Wouldnt recommend this hotel We stayed at this hotel as part of the Golden Triangle tour I was a bit hesitant after reading so many negative reports on tripadvisor but our tour operator changed our booking to this hotel at the last minute stating the other hotel was too far out of central delhi for sightseeing  To be honest i wish hed never chnged the booking  the lobby is nice airy and really inviting the bedrooms tell a different story wed booked a triple room and it was so small that the double bed took up most of the room the camp bed they put in after  hours of waiting had virtually no chance  The bathroom was dingy and small  Towels and bed linen had seen better days and i was reluctant to use them  The little quotbar Areaquot in the lobby was ridiculous it took  minutes for the waiter to bring us our order of  servings of cheese toast  Breakfast was okayish  I wouldnt stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone it was double the price of the hotels wed had in Jaipur and Agra but they were far far better in terms of quality of service rooms and facilites     
P => Tired and worn Myself and three friends stayed at the Connht Hotel at the start and end of our two week trip to India  While the complimentary fruit water and cookies were welcoming the or and fittings are very tired and dirty in places  The bathrooms are extremely small but reasonably well equipped  The breakfast buffet has a varied selection and omlettes cooked to order  Service is helpful  This is definitely not worth  stars but conveniently located  
P => Mid Level Hotel The Connht is well located in central New Delhi and within walking distance to Connht Place  The hotel has very small rooms but the rooms were fairly clean carpet was spotted in places and the air conditioning adequate  There was no internet access in the room but they did have dial up speed wireless internet in the lobby so bring your own laptop  The morning buffet breakfast was one of the best in all of India for variety quantity and quality I rate this hotel  stars by US standards and fine for people who just want a place to sleep  Others have commented that some other rooms were not that clean so if you get a dirty room ask to be moved Tip Ask for a room on a high floor if you want a view of the city  The hotel does not charge a fee to exchange money and the rate is fair  
P => Oh dear Where do I start   dingy dark dank   room upholstry and carpets dirty furious air con unable to disguise smell of damp     maintenace work   loud constant banging necessitated a first room change    more to come later   a dark dingy restaurant that absolutely no one seems to use except for breakfast where there is no cold milk or at least there was but waiter didnt want to have to go and fetch it We had  nights at the start of our trip and one at the end which after the first  nights I was not looking forward to   on arrival for out last night we were given a double bed having asked for a twin I insited on moving  moved to an quotupgradequot with flourescent strip lighting that was either all on or all off  no bedside lights at all    and still a double bed another furious room change this time to the quotbest quotsuite in the hotel   still grubby and dingy  and with a loud whirring noise that quotmaintainencequot were coming to sort out    still waiting at   a m   they never arrived     mouldy baths peeling paint gloom and doom    one positive thing  the sheets were very clean This hotel  function well as an Indian business hotel but that is all  Staff demoralised and obviously used to complaints no fault with the staff but with management and owner  Dont bother with this hotel   this is no  star but  at best  P S go to the Oberoi   as amazing as the Connht is awful 
P => Beware of what you eat We stayed at the Connht Hotel for two days before we travel the quotgolden trianglequot  The bathroom had mold around the tub and the wiring for the hair dryer was down to the wires  They are also doing some work on the place  All day long there was hammering and pounding  The day we were to leave on the tour we had breakfast in the hotel  By noon I was so sick I could hardly stand  My hosband and I ate the same food except for the juice  So traveler beware  
P =>  star at best How is Hotel can be a  star is beyond me   star at best fits the dirty rooms moudly bathrooms terrible service from staff  How other people gave this hotel a good review is beyond me  Didnt we stay at the same place  I guess they must be used to sleeping on soiled bedding and moudly bathroom floors and tubs  
P => average hotel We spent  nights at this hotel  nights at the start of the holiday and  at the end  We found the hotel average the rooms were small but clean  Nothing to complain about but of all the hotels we stayed at during our holiday it did have the best buffet breakfast  The best thing about the hotel is that it is within easy walking distance of Connht Place which is a great place to go shopping  
P => Needs alot of work The Connht was likely quite nice in its time but time has not been kind to this hotel You can tell immediately that it is an old hotel but the lobby gave a good first impression with a professionaly done fresh flower centerpiece and the staff in clean pressed uniforms  The check in was quick and the bell boy efficient  The rooms are where the main problems lie  They are very old in both appearance and smell  We took two rooms and both were far from satisfactory  The air conditioning blows a musty smell and the walls are moldy  The room is fairly small and the carpet was filthy as were the sheets on the bed  The bathroom was clean and the shower fine  They provided teacoffee making facilities and one bottle of water complimentary  The service at the Connht was generally good although one of the front desk associates took  minutes to return our change having to go back into the cash drawer three times and still returning the incorrect amount This was our third hotel in a nine hotel trip through India and was the only one that we found to be unacceptable  The location is great but not worth staying there  The upside is that they seem to be doing reations  The down side is that they will have to tear down and rebuild most walls to get rid of the mold and likely wont do that  
P => The  not posh  Connht The Connht is to be avoided if you want rest at the end of a long day  We arrived late very tired after a long train journey  Our room was very small the carpet and soft furnishing soiled however the sheets were clean and the bed OK  I must have been very tired because the bathroom look OK too  We went to sleep immediately  Imagine our surprise when on rising the next morning found the tap was missing from the bath it was rusted around the fitting so had been like this for quite some time sorry couldnt manage to post photo  The Manager was rung and we were moved to another room this time with a tap over the bath  The carpet and soft furnishing in this room were also soiled and grubby  It is a big city hotel however the staff were distant the foyer was also grubby the furniture sticky as were the soft furnishings  We left a report for the Management  We are pleased to say that this was the only poor hotel on our day trip  All the other hotels were excellent and of course we have let our Travel Agent amp friends know about the Connht  
P => Liked the Restaurant Arrived in the early hours of the morning as our first stop in India  Rooms were soon made ready for us and were fine   basically what you would expect from a business focussed hotel though not in the top category of business hotels  Staff were pleasant and helpful   arranged a visit for us with little notice  The breakfast was better than most we had in India and the food at the restaurant was good and good value as well  The hotel was well located if you were familiar with Delhi but a little daunting for a first time visitor exploring locally especially taxi and tuc tuc drivers seeking trade when you ventured from the hotel  
P => Soft Surfaces need Cleaning Too  I was booked into the Connht Hotel in New Delhi by a tour company  I was told it rated  star  Definately NOTLocation was quotGod knowsquot where  I looked out my room window and there was a double window scill easily a couple of inches deep in pigeion crap  Pigions were running up and down and very noisy  Across the road a depressing slum  Not a pretty picture All hard surfaces in the hotel were clean and sparkling  i e  ble floors glass wood tiles etc  All soft surfaces in the hotel i e  carpets upholstery draparies were amazinging ignored and filthly  The carpet in my room was so dirty and stained that I slept with my sox on in case I had to get up at night  No way was I putting my bare feet on that carpet The Lobby has great furniture but the fabric is all black where ever people put there harnds   a lot of greasy hands touched this stuff  The attractive draperies were just plain dirty  Cleaning should be day to day maintenace Even with everything clean it will only rate  stars max  The hotel dosnt seem to be near anything and the most disturbing I was being told I could go out alone on the street I booked a hotel not a jail cell  Get cleaning guys and talk to the neighbourhood

P => Good hotel great location but very small rooms We stayed at the Florence inn for  nights  One of the USP of the hotel is its situated bang on Karol B a very busy shopping street  The room that we had was a Deluxe room which according to the front desk is the Standard room of the hotel  On getting inside the room what struck me was it was the smallest hotel room I had ever visited  It was square room with the bed in the middle and only  person could walk at a time in the room  Also the room had no windows which I felt was rather strange  The food at the restaurant was good but the restaurant staff were not so polite in their manners  
P => Highly Recommended  Quiet location in the middle of everything in Delhi  Great staff and excellent management  We were a group of  people from different parts of world came to attend a workshop in Delhi  We were quite lucky to find Florence Inn  Full credit goes to our ground staff from dehradun and Mr  Jaydeep the GM of the property for making our event a memorable one  Service meals cleanliness and quality of rooms were impressive  The Conference rooms are spacious and well suited for a get together or a conference It is a very professionally managed hotel staff very friendly and helpful  Restaurant is open round the clock buffet breakfast is good and safe  The hotel is close to all basic necessities and the metro rail station which is a great boon getting around Delhi  
P => Very ent The hotel was good overall the rooms were very clean I liked the fact that they had TV in English and in French I was jetlagged so I watched a lot of TV The Food was ent Im glad the breakfast was included it made it easier for me The only little glitch is the pick up from the airport they didnt tell me that the driver wil be waiting for me outside so I waited inside and I couldnt see anyone holding a banner with my name and after I waited for a little while I ended buying a pre paid taxi for a  rupees  the hotel had charged me  Rs  and once I left the airport I saw the driver outside so I got stuck with the pre paid taxi ticket which the hotel didnt want to reduce it from the  Rs   I ended up using it  weeks later when I came back to Delhi for a day  
P => If you want to be exploited stay here  Positives Clean rooms and generally good standard overall for the hotel  Air Con works Negatives Not hr hot waterFood is bland at bestManagement will try and exploite and extort money at every opportunity We were charged over  rupees just for a taxi from the airport to the hotel  We confirmed with the pre paid taxi rank that this should cost no more than  rupees  When arguing with the manager about this he had a stack of excuses longer than my arm ready for the offing  There after service was offered at an absolute bare minimum to meet their standards  We booked tourist advice arately from the hotel and was interogated on a daily basis what we were doing who with and how much it cost  Regardless of what we would say they could always do things fasterbettercheaper Breakfast was bland and spicy   too hot even for my tastebuds let alone my wifes  Whilst the hotel is located on a quiet side road the area itself is very busy and even by Delhi standards not a particularly safe area for tourists after dark  
P => Loved the Hotel The best place to stay if you are in Delhi  Its not too expensive and the service is the best  You would really be very comfortable once you get in eventhough you are a foreign tourist  One more thing that I liked is that there is a restaurant inside the hotel and so you need not find out a place to eat or order into your room  you can collect as many as your friends and take them to this restaurant in this hotel and enjoy  The food is really hygenic  Try it out  
P => Peaceful haven Peaceful and quiet position after the hustle of Delhis streets  Welcoming staff and tidy small but clean room  
P => Great Value and great service I stayed at the hotel at the beginning of il having pre booked over the phone  The hotel is great value I paid the equivalemt of approx   and is certainly a ruby amongst the dust of places in Delhi within this price range   see the reviews of a lot of other hotels within this range in Delhi and youll see what I mean  The location is very handy just meters from Ajmal Khan Road in Karol Bargh  Its especially useful if youre going there to do lots of shopping as the shops are literally on the doorstep but without being so close to be effected by noise  The metro station is also very close and just two stops from Connuaght Place Rajiv Chowk My parents went a week ahead of me and were very well looked after  My room had everything a good standard room should have including ac and fan satellite TV minibar  Good bathroom with the usual bathtub and shower combination  The management and team are extremely helpful and deal with any issues or problems very quickly  The food is good and room service is also available  hours  All areas and rooms are very clean as well as very well orated and they seem to be constantly keeping an eye on this  It seems to have been recently modernised and very popular for large business meetings   this I guess helps to ensure the standard is kept high  They also have an PC for internet access in the reception as well as WIFI throughout the hotel but its worth checking this is working before going if its an important feature for you I would definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone and I will be going back on my next trip  
P => Fantastic value for money The Hotel Florence Inn was our first hotel that we stayed in during our trip around the Golden Triangle  As we were travelling in the budget range our expectations were not very high so we were more than delighted to find that the Florence Inn provided us with sparkling clean rooms and excellent service  The rooms had their own combination safe cable TV and cheap well stocked minibar  The in house restaurant and room service meals were excellent value for money about  Australia an for a big multi serve vegetarian meal  The front desk staff were very helpful and polite  
P => Comfortable and exceeding expectations The Florence is a nice little hotel tucked away in Karol Bagh and miles better than we had expected or hoped for for the very reasonable price of INR   the lower price is for standard higher price for deluxe we stayed in both over  nights The location is very convenient for the metro   a  minute walk down a busy shopping street brings you to the hustle and bustle of the road where the metro station is and then its only  stops to Rajiv Chowk aka Connht Place  Theres an internet terminal in the lobby and wi fi throughout the hotel both at a charge of  rupees for  minutes We expected very little from this hotel and were pleasantly surprised  The rooms were clean relatively well maintained not shabby and quiet  The main difference we could see between the standard room where we stayed the first night and the deluxe room was the slightly bigger size   but the size of the standard was fine  Our friends also stayed in a standard room and it seems some come with a wet room fairly standard in India while others with a bathroom i e  with a tub  All clean and comfy though and well equipped We had dinner in the hotel on the first night and the food was fine surprisingly not that greasy and reasonably priced  Although they dont advertise it on the menu beer is available and because it wasnt printed anywhere we even negotiated the price down  Breakfast was simple and nice  Staff were polite and helpful Would definitely recommend this hotel   it makes all the difference in a place like Delhi to have a quiet safe place to come home to 
P => Loved the Florence Loved our almost month long stay in Delhi at the Florence  Actually it became our home away from home  Stayed with my inlaws and my  year old son  The staff was absolutely phenomenal They were so attentive to my sons needs and to our own   they gave my son balloons as he had commented on a guests balloons  They even rescued him from an elevator incident Room service was quick efficient food was excellent  Truly appreciated our clean amazing room along with its completely western style bathroom Make sure if you can that you hire a driver for your stay it will make your visit pleasurable and non stressed as no one should drive the city streets of Delhi  And besides at around   a day its definately worth it So dont worry how far everything is in Delhi its all relative  Actually I found that the hotel was very conveniently located   Karol Bagh which is excellent street shopping and about  minutes away from Connht Place Thank you so very much to the staff there   again they were exceptional As a very well traveled Canadian I will definately be staying there again and highly recommend this hotel  
P => GREAT PLACE     cleanquality space friendly  trustworthy staff good price I spent  months in India    lived in Delhi and Bangalore for extended periods and traveled throughout the country i was a study abroad student then did some volunteering  As a  year old female safety and cleanliness were my top priority when I found myself booking hotels when I was alone  It is about time that I give this hotel a great review  Nothing comes cheap in Delhi especially when it comes to finding a place to stay  I knew i wanted something safe and clean    and so I ided to avoid any accommodation in the Paharganj area near railway station  Although the Florence Inn is not the most convenient place if you are hoping to explore South Delhi it is not too far away from CP and Old Delhi and isnt too bad in general if you are accustomed to a commute or Delhi traffic  And compared to other nice places it is a great deal You wont find such quality for this price anywhere else in Delhi when you are traveling in other places in India outside big cities like Delhi or Mumbai you will be able to find cheaper places  I stayed in this hotel a few times both alone and with friends  Each time I stayed in their cheapest room  The cheapest rooms however still felt like luxury  The basics    Clean sheets towels soaps etc  And also ble bathrooms plentiful counter space in the bathroom TV with HBO  news channels hot shower with good pressure  It is definitely a place that meets Western standards  The service and staff were great    They are willing to help and answer questions and are very attentive  The staff carried my suitcases for me into my room  i never felt uncomfortable around them  The staff at the front desk who speak very good English let me use the internet for free in the lobby and print things out for a small price on their office printer  Further after i checked out but wanted to do errands and go out I was able to leave luggage safely in the lobby  They even let me leave some luggage for a couple of weeks in a storage room    it was all there when i got back in perfect condition  There is free breakfast every morning    which has options for everyone  And the restaurant also serves lunch and dinner  They also have room service if you want to eat in the privacy of your room or get a quick snack they have great iced coffee and parathas  Also they have a reliable quick laundry service  When my friends visited me and they arrived in India for the first time I took them here  They appreciated the quality of the hotel  I highly recommend this hotel To book   just call the front desk Find number on their website  The place can be tricky to find    The hotel can arrange to pick you up and take you right to the hotel  It is extremely close to the Karol Bagh Metro station and this is where you should be dropped off once you have figured out how to walk from station to the hotel  Also to be safe carry a hotel business card with you so you have their number on hand    they can give directions to your driver if necessary  
P => Lovely quiet and clean hotel We arrived late at night  tired mums with three tired teen dhters and were so relieved to find ourselves in this quiet little oasis  the rooms were spacious and spotless the breakfast was delicious the staff were extremely friendly and helpful  we would highly recommend this hotel for other travellers  
P => Great Hotel There were  of us at this hotel including two under s We have stayed in Delhi previoulsy and therefore were aware of the Karol Bagh area  It can seem scary at night but the actual location of the hotel is safe and convenient   right next to the metro The staff are all great helpful but the hotels greatest asset is the cleaners   it is so clean which as a mother I was so thankful for as it saved any upset stomachs with the kids My children had braekfast and dinner at the hotels and I have no complaints  Restaurant is small but pleasant There is internet access and the water is never cold 
P => Exceeded expectations In looking for hotels in Delhi an affordable hotel without scary reviews is hard to find  The Florence Inn was clean and affordable and ideal  I highly recommend this hotel  The staff was overall very helpful and nice  We changed our travel plans after we arrived to see Agra and Jaipur  They happily changed our days for free If this is your first time in India as one of the other reviews pointed out the neighborhood at night appears quite scary  We arrived late at night  However once you see the area in the day you will realize it is not that bad and right beside a fun ket especially on Monday  I never felt threatened in this area  If I ever return to Delhi I plan on booking a room at the Florence Inn  
P => Liked the hotel a lot   good value for money The rooms are small but very clean and the ambience is good  Its a good value for money  I lived in delux room  The staff are very cooperative  The maintainence is good  The toilets are clean  The food is also tasty and hygenic  
P => Good hotel but scary location We stayed here in tember  as part of a trekking expedition  we stayed here a few nights at the start and end of the trip  Its a good basic hotel with friendly staff  Rooms are comfy and adequate  The only bugbear was noisy aircon Beware the beggars and the ket outside the hotel  Its not dangerous but its intimidating  It gave us a flavour of what street life is like in delhi Recommend the Crossroads bar around the corner with good food drink and ambience  It seems to be a magnet for ex pats and tourists  We watched India win the  cricket here and the atmosphere was electric Overall no complaints  good straightforward accomodation  
P => A pleasant suprise We stayed at Florence Inn for  nights in t  and were impressed by the nicely reated character building  Although no view to speak of the rooms were well appointed compared to other indian hotels we tried  Ac shower TV fridge all worked ket and metro are nearby however it is at the end of a lane so I wouldnt want to return alone after dark 
P => Good value hotel We read about this hotel at India Mike and we tried it for  night at the end of our travel and we were very happy with the choice  The hotel is very clean and comfortable and the service is correct  Also the neighbourhood is much more exciting than Pahar Ganj  We have been in many hotels during our India travel and this one was one of the best  The pricequality relation is better than other Delhi hotels and I cant understand why travel guides dont recommend Karol Bagh i e  the neighboorhood where Florence Inn is situated  There are a lot of shops and restaurants few tourists and a good atmosphere at night  
P => Cheap and Clean  Unusual for Delhi  
P => Nice hotel scary location  
P => Great hotel for Delhi  
P => Good value for money  
P => Sch nes Hotel  
P => super Eindruck insgesamt  
P => Bon rapport qualit prix pour Dehli  
P => Non male

P => Nice people poor location Very friendly staff who were keen to assist above and beyond the call of duty and let me check in long before the official time Adequately comfortable room  Hot water supply rather unreliable  A bit noisy at night but then this is India     Drinkable coffee I probably wouldnt stay here again but thats priily because of the location  Its a safe area and its not too far from many sites of tourist interest but its a bit frustrating that as far as I could find theres nowhere to eat nothing to see nothing at all to do within walking distance   so you end up spending a lot of time in cabs or rickshaws A couple of tips related to transport if you do stay here  Its usually easier to get a cabrickshaw on the OTHER side of New Rohtak Road  And when returning to the hotel ask for the Liberty Cinema   no drivers will know the hotel but the cinema about a short block away is a well known landk  
P => Right by train station but not so nice The Grand Inn is five minutes from the Delhi train station which certainly is convenient for early departures  Also it is in a quiet area  My brother and his wife had a room right next to mine  We shared a very mini walkout  Their room was OK  However my room had not been cleaned and the bed had been slept in  The food we ordered was good  Still searching for a reliable budget hotel in New Delhi    
P => DISGUSTING  Beware this place is a dump  Probably the other feedback critiques have been written by friends of the owners  There were cockroaches in the rooms they dont even change the sheets for new guests there were hairs in our beds   we slept fully clothed  the sole towel that was once white is a horrible shade of grey  Location is extremely noisy just by a very busy main road the area pretty grim as well  All in all a rip off joint to be avoided at all costs  The quotsuitesquot are also not suites at all just bigger rooms with the same grotty look  DISGUSTING  
P => WOW wonderful experiance stayin in this hotel wonderful helpful staff very near to best of the places neat good big rooms good food kind hearted staff had wonderful staying in this hotel i think its priced ently had tight budget this time thought wud stay in some local cheap hotel but when travel agent booked this hotel thought it will be not be good but when reached there we got warm welcome and when we saw suites i was amazed and thanking god again and as it was vry clean and beautiful room with clean hygenic bathrooms which is imp thing and with all the facilities and vry vry helpful staff  i think best time we had in delhi and in our hotel room  
P => A good and reasonably priced hotel in Delhi I spent two nights at the Grand Inn and I must say Im very satisfied  The rooms are ok  The food is very nice and of course very spicy  And the employees are very helpful and friendly  The owner also personally helped us a lot  The hotel is relatively well situated close to the Karol Bagh bazaar and not far using the auto rickshaws from Connht Place  Finally I believe the price is reasonable  I am planning to go to Delhi again next year and Ill definitely book the Grand Inn again   Avinash Meetoo from Mauritius 
P => totally unbeliveable Its probably the best hotel youll find in new delhi   every hotel has its own specialities but to find one completelly special hotel is very difficult  The Grand Inn is one of those comletly special hotels because of its following points Location is excellent   Other hotel facilities are great  Interiors are very nice and the rooms are specially made for complete rest and comfort   food quality is very high   It was great pleeasure to stay in THE GRAND INN    
P => i loved this hotel a lot staff was very helpfull and friendly  i suggest this beautifull hotel to ppl who really want to enjoy the stay in delhi  the cost is good enough reasonable   hrs room service is wow would always go to this hotel if in delhi and also recommend my friends for this one

P => Love the use of space Delhi Hotels I am use to such as the Hyatt Intercontinental Sheraton or my favorite Shangrila where all booked so I was struggling to get hotel and given that I plan to stay in Delhi for more then a month and half I was hoping for the usual hotels  A friend booked the Grand hotel for me so needless to say I was worried about this hotel since I have never been to it before I arrived at this hotel and as I walked into the lobby the first thing I notice is how large and roomy the lobby is  It is open concept design with very high ceiling  This hotel has the largest and most roomy Lobby I have ever seen  Amount of room in the lobby is the first thing you notice and it is a welcome site given that Delhi is a very busy place Hotel staff took minutes to register my stay and guided me to my room where they gathered the rest of my information they needed while providing information about my room The hallways on the th floor where I stayed where not large however it really did not feel small  You can see the end of the hallways window which makes it more roomy then it is  The minute I walked into the room and I was shown the bathroom I stopped  I have no eye for art but I cannot overcome how simple yet beautiful the entire bathroom is with elegant wooden sliding doors to dark ceramic tiles that makes you stop and stare  I stayed in Shangrila Intercontinental Hilton Hyatt and many other hotels which are all nice but the Grand by far found the perfect use of space and combined the closest bathtub shower and closet in to one space  It is also the one thing you will take a picture of and describe to family and friends The entire room lets you breath with lots of space and very littlethings in your way  Flat TV hangs on side of the wall and a small bar is place under it it  Small work desk that faces a long hallway to the front door  It takes few seconds to get to the door when someone knocks it just to give you an idea of how large the room is and how simple layout makes it even larger I have different taste for food since food is just food no matter what I eat  I cannot therefore give you a good review of the food at this hotel  I had no issues though other then smaller selection available after hours for room service  Sheraton did have a lot more selections at any given hour however I spend most of my weekends in my room as I work a lot I had no issues and with the room and loved the bathroom I felt very comfortable and often had no reason to leave my room Space is really the key for me personally and this room had plenty of it Amenities included a fruit basket and lots of bottled water  This is the only hotel in Delhi where I had at least   bottles of waterat any given time  It is also the only hotel that provided the largest bottle of water at no cost  Typically you get small bottles and you have to pay for the larger ones  I take about  bottles a night to work and drink about   Housekeeping puts them all back by next day Privacy is a big thing for me since I am sleeping daytime and working night time  Often in most hotels even with the do not disturb light house keeping calls me in every hotel I stayed I explained my schedule on my arrival and had no issue for the most part but did get a call or two times  I slept in both times however and they where trying to get to my room as scheduled Privacy is done via a switch by the bed Iron is on request only at this hotel however  I needed it few times and one time I got it onetime other time I was told that they could do the ironing for me as they had no iron free  I had my shirt back in less then  minutes  Only issue I had was that they of course did a better job then I could and would prefer if the iron was always not available Internet is the most essential thing for me and in room internet by cable only  Speed varies from slow to high depending on timeof day  You can steam media mornings and evening but slows down in the afternoon  Internet was down in my room once after  weeks of stay  I called and I was told it will be up by morning and it was  It was AM however and I just finished work  Business Center was not effected I am use to Nortel phones and this room had one at the desk I do not use hotel phone for long distance and not sure howit compares to other hotels  My room had  phones  One by the bed one on the desk and one in the bathroom which I would never use for any reason  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and have done so for other visitors from my company who stay at Shangrila usually  This is hotel is different from the most flashy but equally nice hotels  It is is unique hotel in terms of space and interior design  
P => Owesome services The services of Hotel is supreme one of the best in Delhi for sure Interiors exteriors all are royal with luxurious comfort and food are also so delisious     
P => Good location but highly overpriced The hotel is under reationIt sells under the shadow of Grand Hyatt its erstwhile nameBe warned the hotel had cht fire a year back due to maintenance defects and poor upkeep Its a beautiful hotel but stay here at your own risk I booked through the website looking at the photosbut the hotel is highly overpriced for the money it chargesfew restaurants not open yet I spoke to some people and they siad quality has suffered since all staff had left post the fire incident Surprisedhow the Federal Fire department gave ok to pen so soon  
P => One night stay   beautiful room I just stayed one night there as I was returning from Jaipur and leaving next morning back home  The hotel has been under reation and it is very beautiful  I had to write the review because the bathroom was one of the best I have seen in any hotel around  The room was also very spacious and nice the only problem we experienced was that over the ac when turned off you could hear the neighbouring room We had neighbours having a party or something so in the middle of the night it was hard to sleep because you would hear the lhter of the other guests  
P => Loved the stay there  The GrandNew Delhi is the place to have a perfect stay Had been a menber with Them and always enjoyed the faboulos fascilities It was a great stay always Have stayed there couple of times and everytime we left it with a good smileJetPrivilege membership      
P => Hotel under reation but continue to books guests at outrageous rates Be forewarned Although the website suggests otherwise this hotel is effectively closed and under reation following a fire in the hotel over one year ago  The reception desk is closed none of the restaurants or bars are open no taxi stand etc  Its also in the middle of a nowhere and surrounded by construction sites  Staying here would be a bit like staying in the Twilight Zone    and paying  per night to do so  Management appear unethical  Total scam  I happened upon the hotel when I wen to the spa which is associated with the spa  Great spa but avoid the hotel until it is actually opened  The poor guests I met at the spa who booked rooms due to its proximity to the airport and promising website were furious and preparing to prepare a formal complaint with the tourism authorities  
P => In the middle of nowhere Great hotel   but in the middle of nowhere  It is more like an airport hotel location  The hotel from the inside is awesome  Great swimming pools sauna etc beautifully orated but small rooms with nice bathrooms  Service was not very good but hey this is Delhi  The location is just very bad a lot of rubble and construction around the place and not views at all  
P => Good business hotel convenient to airport Overall a reliable choice for business travellers to Delhi was recommended to me by locals when you dont need to stay in the center of Delhi  Id stay here again on a return visit Pros  Well appointed rooms with arate showerbath  Bottled water provided in room    Good breakfast buffet and also good lunch buffet    Close to the airport flights can arrive very late in Delhi as mine did am  Airport pick up car service worked very well book this ahead with the hotel extra charge  There is the traffic polices prepaid taxi service at the airport as well but I didnt use it   Well equipped fitness center for a hotel with around  different cardio bikestreadmillsellipticals and half a dozen weight machines plus free weights  Attractive grounds and lobby area well staffed and very good serviceCons  Room rates in Delhi are high and The Grand is no exception  My cost was over night including breakfast  You might want to book through a local if you have a contact for better rates   Location is south of the city nothing to see withing walking distance today a major new shopping mall is going up nearby so that will change in time  Travel time to center Connht Place  India Gate or the Gurgaon business district can take  minutes by car hiring a driver for the day is advisable if you have multiple stops or just want to be sure of your transport back  Taxis arent that common and traffic is nothing short of amazing  can be both chaotic and often jammed with bikes pedestrians and every imaginable vehicle on wheels   Some of the hotel carpet and furniture is tired and worn but all the natural granite wood and waterfalls more than make up for it  
P => Beautiful hotel I stayed here for  weeks with a friend  This is a beautiful place with top quality service  In fact they pretty much OVER serve you  by coming into your room like  times a day to do things but I think thats part of the culture  Theres a lovely spa nice gym tranquel pool and just a nice place to stay  Outside the hotel is dirty and rough looking but thats the area of New Delhi  
P =>  Fantastic Hotel   Stayed only  night early t   Location is near airport  mins  Rooms large clean and comfy  Price AU pnight incl bfast  Restaurants  were excellent we sampled Italian AU incl alcohol entree amp main and was good  Service in hotel was excellent  Bfast buffet best in India on our  weeks holiday  Pool is large heaps of sun lounges and quiet at this time no children Yeh  Pool fooddrinks Beer AU for  bottles long service non existent but that was sorted quickly There is nothing outside hotel vacant land and highway so dont expect to go out wandering or quotseeingquot Delhi at night  Take auto into central Delhi  mins  Hotel great for business and also tourist if in need of quota no hassle Indiaquot for a break  Good for next day flight  Taxi ambassador to airport Rs  max  
P => spacious rooms As i walk through with my wife to the hotel it looked like walking to a mansion  A tremendous looby is waiting for you on your arrival  check in time taken by the front office was good   we went to the room without any escort that is really bad for a first timer in the hotel  Rooms are excellent spacious neat and clean  breakfast was at cafe which is huge place only drop back of that area is that the buffet is at the last end of the cafe  for a person sitting on front section is quite annoying going to the buffet and helping himself again and again  service was excellent by the cheerful staff  up keep of the place was not so good  all the points on the rating goes to the rooms andthe staff at the cafe  
P => Nice accomodations but a bit out remote This is a well maintined hotel outside of New Delhi  If you are looking for convenience to local places including Connht Place you should expect to spend some time in a car or cab  Hotel car can be a bit pricey but secure if traveling alone  The rooms are very very nice as is most of the staff  Prices here have been escalating for some time and rooms on quotclubquot floors are identicle to every other room   expect to pay more anyway  Ive stayed here many weeks at a time over the past  years and have always been pleased at the end of the stay  Food service can be exasperatingly slow especially in the main cafe so go to breakfastlunch or dinner with plenty of time  Food and service in the Indian and Italian restaraunts is great  Beds are very comfortable and the room is cleaned every day if desired  You can turn off your doorbell for privacy   just dont forget to turn it back on if you want room service Pool gym and spa are all very well kept and modern  Food and beverage are available by the pool  
P => What a Terrible Front Desk Overall the hotel is nice and comfortable  However the front desk staff is filled with automatons that cant handle anything outside of what is scripted for them by management  I had a ent experience with the restaurants the health spa and the overall experience but the front desk was completely unwilling and unable to comprehend the fact that they were overcharging me as compared to the booking made at travelocity  I was completely turned off by the front desk staff and travelocitys customer service staff  I would NOT stay at the grand again or use travelocity  I have a full detailed explanation of the situation here      
P => Grand New Delhi I stayed there last year  The hotel is very nice  It is very nice when you come back from Delhi with all its noise and dirt and you enter this well kept place Reception is pretty slow  The spa is very nice  I liked the food in the indian restaurant a lot  The other restaurants are not that great  Rooms are extremely spacious  And the hotel is pretty new or at least it looks new  This is very important as I have been to some older top end hotels in Delhi and you would not like to stay there  Prices  be a bit high but it is worth it Overall a good place to stay after a long working day  
P => Excellent relaxing break before flying back to London I first stayed at this hotel  years ago when it was owned by the Hyatt group and loved every minute   better than Hotel Nikko that Id booked into originally but ided to check out of as it felt so claustrophic and busy  I left the Grand at that time thinking that it was one of the best hotels I had ever stayed in  I was nervous of booking in again this time having read some of the reviews and realising that it was no longer a Hyatt group hotel and was worried that the standards might have fallen but the rates on offer were lower than any of the other hotels I was interested in  per night plus taxes and I neednt have worried as I had the most wonderful  night stay  The whole hotel feels calm and relaxed the rooms are very spacious well designed and furnished with extremely comfortable beds and fantastic bathrooms ble everywhere and big fluffy white towels  The Oasis Spa treatments were excellent and well priced and and the pool area is one of the best I have seen in a city hotel  The pool is enormous and set in the middle of beautiful gardens  The hotel is a little out of the way about  minutes taxi ride into the centre but all I wanted to do was relax and do a bit of shopping so it suited me to be away from the traffic and noise of New Delhi and hopped into a cab whenever I needed to which you have to do wherever you stay  Service throughout was good but I have to say I dont think the club level is worth paying the extra for  The food is better in the restaurant and you also get to sit with views of the gardens rather than the club level lounge on the sixth floor  I dont think the staff were particularly helpful with enquiries about hiring taxis I was quoted  rupees to hire a driver for the day when  weeks earlier Id paid about  rupees at another  star hotel and Im fairly sure I was overquoted on the taxi going back to the airport  However apart from these minor things I thought the staff were extremely helpful and I loved my stay here  I left feeling totally relaxed and would definitely stay here again  
P => Superb Simply the best hotel that we have ever stayed in Everything was excellent  A bit out of town but there are v  cheap taxis just outside  Transport to an hour at the ket and return   including generous tip 
P => The good the bad and the very very ugly Delhi was busy all the usual suspects were full I had no choice desipite some of the reviews  I was heading for the Grand First Impressions were good  This is a large impressive hotel clean and well orated  There were plenty of free staff at check in but when I tried to get my room I was told I had been given a free upgrade and had to check in on the sixth floor  I tudged up there to find a queue and some of the slowest poorly trained reception staff I have ever come across  it took mins to get from reception into my room  This  appear a small thing but flights from Europe land into India late night or early morning  Its the last thing I needed Despite the reception problem the room was fantastic black ble shower and bath walk in wardrobe lounge and bedroom  star standard Since all the flights land so late it would be nice to get a late night drink in the hotel  Delhi have granted late licences for some of the large US luxury chains   not the Grand  I sat in my nice roomon my own with the two bottles of beer from the minbar The next day I had the most shocking experience with the food  The restaurants served me underdone tepid prawns followed by undercooked chicken  Both of which I sent away  No five star hotel should serve food in this way the health implications are serious  BewareThe other really startling thing is the price   night  Now I dont mind the cost if I get the quality goods but with the poorly trained staff the dodgy food its just not worth thr risk Altogether this is one to avoid  
P => Absolutely Horrible Stay My room was booked by my local office in Delhi at the quotCorporate Ratequot of nearly  USD for the night  The room was actually quite nice but having arrived somewhat late on a flight from Bangkok I ided on staying in the room instead of exploring  I ordered room service from the quotAround the Clockquot menu  Simple   I wanted a milk shake and chicken sandwich with cheese  What I received was Strawberry Quik mixed with milk and some sort of mystery meat on a bun  I couldnt even eat the sandwich due to the fishy taste of the chicken  I ate a bag of chips from the mini bar and fell asleep  My flight was early so I showered in a very nice bathroom and headed to the front desk forgoing the included breakfast  At check out I complained to the clerk about the absolutely apalling meal  He completely ignored my complain and produced my bill which included the  meal I didnt eat  I refused to sign until he contacted the manager  The manager couldnt be bothered to see me in person and told his clerk over the phone that he could reduce the food charge by     what a gesture  Included in my bill was a charge for quotVAT Meal Planquot  I assume this was for the included breakfast I didnt eat and was told by the clerk he couldnt change the bill anymore  I filled out a survey and voiced my dis in writing but Im sure it wont help  All in all   the rooms are overpriced at  and of course the customer service left so much to be desired  Ive been to India before and found Delhi to be even dirtier than I remember the last time  Except for the very few tourist type things   I will never route through Delhi again unless absolutely necessary  If I am I will not be staying at this hotel again  
P => beautiful hotel This is a very nice hotel  It feels big  The breakfast was excellent but the service in the Japanese restaurant was poor when we were there and dinner in the coffee shop was fair  The rooms are nice and staff was friendly  
P => Far too expensive You must be careful when booking and negotiating a price with this hotel there are hidden costs and taxes which you dont see till checkout  The rooms are the same whatever floor you are on  Dont get sucked into the th floor Club floor  Its pointless and offers little for the extra money involved  The Happy hour lounge is free between pm to pm which offers good food unfortunately the drinks waiters made themselves obvious by their long spells of absence whilst your glass sat there dry  I paid  USD plus  rupees in cash for two nights  That works out to be circa   per night  I knew I shouldnt have had those cashew nuts out of the minibar 
P => Great Hotel for the price We stayed in this hotel for  nights only in the middle of tember  Here is what we experienced  Checking in process    took less than  minutes  Everything was booked already by Orbitz  They just assigned us a room after some initial signatures and other formalities  The crew were courteous and accomodating to your needs   Room    Great room A very comfortable one also  We asked for a crib for our  month old  It was provided at the same time The bathroom was nice  The overall or of the room was very good too  Above all the room was quiet   RestaurantFood    This was complimentary and we loved it  The stuff was very hospitable and was always attentive  The food was delicious    both at the buffet and during dinner   Checking out process    This took less than  minutes Id love to go back to this hotel and Id recommend it to others for the price I paid US  approx   
P => LOVED IT the only down point that we were only here for  nights  It is simply the very best hotel I have ever stayed in and the gardens the pool and the whole design of the place was second to none  The staff were friendly polite and helpful  A peaceful haven yet close to the airport for conveneince  Would love to go back 
P => Excellent value for Money I spent  nights at the Grand Delhi in late   Overall given the price I paid USnight I was impressed given a similar property in downtown Delhi would have cost US  However after  nights I had enough of the place and changed to the Intercontinental  I was much happier at the Intercontinental because we were able to walk around the city go back to the hotel to refresh continue walking etc If you are a tourist I would NOT stay at the Grand unless you are in transit and wish to be close to the airport  The location in the middle of nowhere is really depressing  You will be much happier in downtown Delhi where there is much more atmosphere OverallGood points  Price  Very large and modern rooms  Stylish bathrooms  Beautiful and spacious lobby and public areasBad points  Service is simply terrible  The staff do not speak English at all well  They are incredibly slow to respond to housekeeping requests  We waited over an hour for them to bring something to our room  The people at the front desk were inexperienced slow unhelpful and rude   Once past the lobby and grounds the public areas are very worn  For instance the hallways leading to the room feature filthy walls stained carpet and drab lighting   While still stylish the rooms are showing definite signs of ageing e g  dirty curtains stained carpet chipped and damaged furniture   The bathroom is without question the slipperiest I have ever experienced  The problem is it is an open shower and the combination of the black ble and deluge of water creates something akin to black ice on the floor  Be very careful   As others have advised the location is quite useless if you want to see anything in downtown Delhi  By taxi Delhi is  minutes away in good traffic a lot more in bad traffic   The restaurants are extremely over priced by India standards  This compounded with the fact that you are literally in the middle of nowhere means you will be forced to dine at these establishments from time to time   The quality of the buffet breakfast is quite poor  The service of the staff is even worse  I will never forget how rude the chef who cooked the eggs was  He would just growl at people and shove the food at them  The only positive is the location by the pool  
P => Best deal for a  star hotel in New Delhi I stayed at the Grand New Delhi from e     I thought this place was excellent  I have stayed at many luxury hotels and this certainly ranks up there with the rest  The pool in the back is excellent  My goal was to try to find a  star hotel in New Delhi for around  a night  I was warned not to get anything less than a  star hotel in India if I wanted anything ent  I paid  a night thru Expedia  which I thought was affordable for  nights  The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is their room service food is sub par for a luxury hotel  And also its not a great location except that it is close to the airport if you want to get there quickly  However its in a quiet area if this is what you are looking for and besides if you want a luxury hotel in New Delhi in the downtown area you will be paying a small fortune  This was a great deal  
P => Grand New Delhi I dont know why some of the reviews are so negative towards this place  IT s one of the best hotels near the airport  Well kept clean and the rooms and room bathrooms are very stylish and upscale with black ble and open stand up shower  The service is average at times but that is probably because it is suck a large hotel with over  rooms  The breakfast buffet is mediocre though has much variety  I liked the price best about this hotel I paid somewhere around USD per night     This is an ex Hyatt hotel so even though they have change dtheir name to the Grand they have still kept their franchise standards  I reccommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a clean comfortable hotel to stay at  
P => Nice hotel but       It is a very beautifull hotel but the service is slow at best and they have the most uncomfortable beds that i have ever slept or tried to sleep in  It was like sleeping on a rock and i woke up with severe backache  For this reason i dont think i will be returning the hotel which is a shame as it has such potential  
P => The Grand is grand  
P => very elegant hotel  
P => A perfect stay  
P => One of the best hotels in Delhi  
P => Think again about staying at the Grand hotel Delhi  
P => Quality and Comfort  
P => 
P => Good hotel but be aware Stayed here for  nights very impressed then came back for another  nights      Disgusted to pay for a Deluxe room and be given a very average room  On complaining was upgraded back to what we were in previously and had paid for        Best floors to be on are  and   Rooms are comfortable and airy  Housekeeping staff are wonderfully friendly and if you get the right waiters in the restaurant make eating a pleasure  Food is very good and menu is varied  No tummy complaints  
P => Excellent Service with centralised location Hi I have booked the executive room and was given an upgrade to their deluxe rooms  st impression upon entering the room was that the photo shown in the hotel website under rooms was entirely different and I was very dissapointed with it  Secondly as I arrived at local time pm I requested for an ironing board and was given a very old dirty looking rusty ironing board  Shock no   Worse thing is they say I cant even keep it for a night as thats the only ironing board they have  So ended up I got them to take it back and send it to me in the morning  Luckily this time round I was presented with a much better ironing board else I cant imagine myself using it  This hotel provides excellent service especially the cafe staff at level   The coffee at the breakfast was bad as they explained that they are using Nescafe powder no coffee aroma and tastes funny  Yaswant at the cafe ended up brewing some good coffee for me with the hotels coffee beans and I was impressed by the extra mile he went for me at no cost  Feel if the hotel is positioning itself as a business hotel the coffee standard is extremely important I have taken up the hotel package which is a great deal with complimentary  way airport transfer and breakfast and dinner  Do note that the bill will be chargeable in Rupee according to the exchange rate  This hotel is also  mins walking distance to Connht Place  
P => Disgusting  Staff are exceptional nice though  What a disappointment  The rooms advertised on the internet are not what you get when you arrive  We stayed on the th floor and was so disappointed that we checked out the following day we were supposed to stay for  nights  The bar and restaurant are of good standard  The reception is also of a good standard but the rooms are diabolical When asked to see another another room on the grounds that I was unhappy about the standard the staff were only too keen in offering up another room which I might add was of a dismal standard  So in sumy rooms are disgusting and staff are exceptional  Its a shame  
P => Nice and pleasant stay Rooms were clean reception and room services were good  Would recommend this for stay 
P => Solid  star near Connht Place Nice room with wood amp ble floors  Within short walk of Connht Place shops if thats of interest about  mins  from airport  Combo hotel and office building Breakfast selection was wide and very good  Pleasant staff Negatives were small hard bed some amenities e g  lotion were not replaced from previous occupant  
P => Value for money I like this hotel for its value for money On my companys business trips I stayed in this hotel several times and had recommended others including foreign guests  Rooms are well appointed and adequately big so as to be comfortable  Brake fast is included in the package and with sufficient spreads to take care for a good day For tourists it is excellent value for money with all amenities and located at a convenient place from allconsiderations I 
P => 
P => Best Hotel We Have Ever Stayed in  WOW  What a fantastic hotel  Warm welcome from staff on arrival   Room was everything you would expect from a  star hotel large room with dressing room and large bathroom  Furnishings were of top quality  Staff were always helpful and courteous and could not do enough for you from the maid to the hotel manager  The hotel is like stepping back in time with its impressive lobby and seating area  Every floor of the hotel is like walking through an art gallery with numerous pieces of art its well worth going for a wander and checking them out  The staff are dressed in uniforms similar to those that would have been worn in the colonial era  The atrium is impressive and the ideal place to relax and have afternoon tea  The hotel pool is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Delhi  
P => Exceptional We stayed for a couple of nights at the beginning of the month and when we checked in they had upgraded us from the basic room to a ior suite  The room s were perfect but since we didnt need or use the sitting room dressing room amp spare bathroom Im not sure Id pay for if we go back to delhi  The highlights were the hotel itself which is immaculate the incredible staff the most beautiful pool the location a short walk from connht pl and next to the Tibetan ket amp the sheer joy of staying in a non corporatechain hotel  We went to the spice route and had a good dinner  Ignore the guide books and go for an indoor table also it is expensive and be warned the food is more asian than indian but if you are staying and cant be bothered to go out   you wont be dissapointed  The second night we went to Bukhara   and HATED it Firstly its in the sheraton which is an ugly airport style hotel  mins awayand the restaurant is like being in a flintstones theme park  There is no cutlery   the seating is on tree trunk stools and the tables are slightly bigger tree trunks   neither having been hollowed out   theres nowhere to put your legs  The food was quite good but no better than every other restauarant we subsequently visiited on our trip   and it cost over   with a cheap bottle of wine  starters and  mains We really liked delhi and loved staying at the hotel which provided a welcome peaceful escape from the hem of old and the bustle of new delhi   
P => well too overpriced Dont mind the big name and historical background  this hotel is way too pretentious and overpriced  The hotel management still live in a dream and is not aware that the city has changed  you can now find jus as good middle range places to stay with the same comfort reasonably priced services and even more modern facilities   Though the service remains friendly there and the rooms comfortable and beautifully orated it is difficult to understand why they charge so much  Why is an ordinary Wifi connection charged  Rs every  mns   Why has the price of the Sunday buffet tripled or more over the last few years to reach at least  Rs each drinks extra for ridiculously small shares of food  Why having a simple drink in the Atrium has got so expensive   Watch out in   after the Commonwealth Games rush no one will be able to afford a room or even a drink in this place   An other problem is that the staff doesnt know the difference between being helpful and intrusive  If you just feel like a cup of tea theyll insist on you having expensive cakes with it they are trained to be more commercial I guess  If you want to work quietly in your room keep the dont diisturb tag on the door all time as the roomkeeping staff would ring any time to offer some service leaving you the nasty impression that youre just taken for a tip cash machine  Some would even follow you in the corridors to help you open your room door thanks I can manage with my key    Too much attention also means less privacy and you sometimes feel youre being   watched   all the time   Last detail avoid the rooms opposite the fitness room if you dont want to wake up early in the morning at the sound of loud speaking staff and customers gathering there  On the whole I would advise to forget about staying there and just afford a meal in one of the restaurants some time when in Delhi  Not more you can find beautiful guest houses hotels in the city now with nice gardens free Wifi and nice rooftop restaurants    
P => Beautiful but stuffy The atmosphere at The Imperial is a bit stuffy for my taste  I love opulence but only when it is accompanied by a warm friendly atmosphere  The fact that they wanted to charge me for a whole day for an early checkin was shocking  I liked the size of the hotel not too big that you get lost  The food was outstanding and restaurant service very attentive  
P => Best hotel in the World Ive been there several times during my year in India  Its a very refreshing hotel in the middle of the town  The staff is very professional and have high standards of client service  I invite people to spend some time to see all the wonderful art museum that this hotel is and to invite family and friends to the brunches or to other special events they do amazing deserts 
P => Overrated We were very dissapointed with the Imperial  It felt to us like a big impersonal commercial hotel    The room we were upgraded to a ior suite was lovely with all the comfortssize and amenities one could have wanted with one big problem the two windows faced directly into walls a couple of feet from the windows  According to the desk manager only the regular rooms face the atrium  If you look from the outside at the configuration I doubt if very mmany rooms have any view  The staff were fine except we wanted to take the tour of the art collection but they couldnt be bothered getting back to us with a time The Spice Garden restaurant was excellentOur last time in Dehli we stayed at the Oberoi which I would recommend over the Imperial except the Imperial location is somewhat better   
P => Historical Grandeur which does not disappoint Stayed at this incredible hotel for sadly just  nights Stayed in a heritage suite  Unbelievable  The ceilings towered above the vast sitting room and large bedroom  Beautiful furniture and the rooms are all so cool in white  Historic pictures on the wall  The bed was just perfect and the bedding so luxurious  No outdoor facing windows but who cares when your room looks onto fountain courtyards  The staff could have not been more helpful nothing was too much problem and the guide the hotel found to take my me and my partner around old Delhi was tour guide to Presidents and Kings  Excellent  The hotel even laid the hotel car on which was extremely comfortable and rather grand with the hotels logo emblazened on the side  Security at the hotel is very tight with bags and luggage screened on arrival  Never been at a hotel that not only checks under all cars coming into the hotel drive including their own but one has to pass through a metal detector to get into the hotel  Room service was efficient  The phoneas promisedwas answered almost immediately  There are simply so many places to eat in the hotel that one was disappointed that one was invited out for dinner and so lost a valuable night of trying out the hotels various eateries  We tried the  restaurant for dinner which is a wonderfully historic room  I had a curry but my fiance went for some Australian lamb chops  London prices I afraid and almost  times the cost of my curry  So beware  There is the beautifully orated spice route restaurant which I was sad we had no time to try  Apparently it took  years to orate in natural colours  I did however get an opportunity to try the beautiful pool which was refreshing as it was spectacular  Breakfast is a real treat  A trail of delights are on offer from curry to pain au chocolat banana smoothies to green tea  Take it outside on the famous terrace overlooking the hotel lawns  The hussle and bussle of Delhi can be heard beyond the tranqui heaven that greets one It was here the partition of India was worked out in   How often can a breakfast venue have that claim to fame  The staff even in the morning are there to assist as best they can  This hotel is a seriously grown up hotel and not aplace for back packers  It deserves the same respect as the very best of European hotels  Try it though if you are on a budget it might not be the place for you  One cannot help by feel somewhat superior as one passes the other delux hotels of Delhi for none have the majesty of the Imperial 
P => Great Service I have visited Delhi last month  It is one of the most memorable tours in my life  When I reached Delhi flying down from my country I felt the warm spirit of the city  The tree lined roads first surprised me  I thought it as a city of concrete building but it vanished when I saw lines of trees on the Delhi roads  I traveled Delhi for a business purpose  After completing my business works I enjoyed a day long tour  Really it was nice I hang out at the India Gate in one evening till  am and it was an amazing place  I toured Huun s Tomb Qutub Minar Red Fort Chandi Chowk ket Jama Masjid and many more  I enjoyed a Bollywood movie at a PVR  I ate at some very good restaurants  The typical Indian food is a little bit spicy but tasty a lot  At this Indian city I have seen so many European scenes 
P => unbelievable stayed here for  weeks in e  and this hotel is amazing  food was great accommodation was great staff were great and friendly  except i had money taken from my room and i reckon i know it was a staff cleaner  he basically brought it to my attention  i did nt  pursue as he obviously needed it more than i did  but to stay at this place is a must  a bit pricey but well worth it  the porters out the front were good craic and the  bar was home away from home  the spice route has some fine cuisine and the pool is a great place to relax and listen to the world go by on path over the fence  breakfast is also brilliant 
P => Awful service stay at the Taj Having spent two weeks travelling around India on honeymoon my wife and I thought wed stay at the Imperial for our last night  Here is what was wrong Reservations had forgotten that my wife was with me and the room was set up for single occupancy  Having informed that me double occupancy incurs an extra charge my wife and I still had to share bath robes towels slippers mineral water etc  Reception made fuss to say that they would send us cake and flowers as it was our honeymoon   it never arrived  We stayed at three Taj hotels over the previous  weeks and they each gave us a bunch of flowers chocolates towels in the shape of swans and a lovely smile  Engineering had to be called out twice as there was no hot water in the bathroom  Once at am and once at am  Room was freezing cold engineer said thermostat didnt allow the room temperature to be above the outside temperature  Service is nothing compared to the Taj The place relies too heavily on its reputation  The room is crammed full of advertising for its shopsservices and lists of nominations for awards just in case you come to realise its a rip off  Never again  
P => Dont waste your money We stayed here for three very forgettable nights whilst being made feel very unwelcome  Upon check in we were shown to our room by a mono syllabic receptionist who failed to mention anything about the hotels facilities breakfast or location  There was some confusion about our booking which the hotel resolved in a very unstaisfactory manner making us feel most unwelcome  The staff in general were rude and the concierge service was quiet poor   when we asked about flight confirmation they did not bother to confirm for us and in addition provided wrong information regarding events in the city On a positive note the hotel itself is beautful  The rooms are large and comfortable  The pool is the most impressive weve come across   its huge with a great area for sunbathing  There is also a good gym available  This is a nice hotel in a nice location however the staff let it down badly 
P => Good Not Great We arrived in Delhi at midnight on the Shabati Express from Agra  It wasn t the Shinkasen but significantly superior to Amtrak  Our excessive luggage received some appropriate disapproving looks from fellow passengers  When will we learn to minimize the trinkets amp souvenirs Once again Peirce amp Leslie was there to rescue us with four porters in tow  The few thousand meter walk to our vehicle through the surreal chaos of night time Delhi is one of my favorite India memories  It was wild  As we were entering the Imperial my son and our escort became quite excited  The stars of  Love Aaj Kal  passed by and gave us a friendly nod amp hello  My son who had been watching Idian TV told me they were the Brangelina of India  That s what the Imperial is  It s the hot trendy yet traditional In Spot  The hotel is beautiful with an outstanding art collection  The public rooms echo Luytens and Busby Berkeley at their best Check in was quick and efficient with no standing  I m not a fan of buffets but the breakfast spread was as varied and tasty as I could have wanted  There was a table of  Asian  fruits and every morning there were a half dozen fruits I d never seen before  The pastries were the best I ve ever had  The manager was constantly circulating the large rooms to make sure nothing was amiss   impressive attention to detail and service  We liked the lounge   The servers were excellent accommodating and we enjoyed talking with them The gym was a tad small and I couldn t see any sign of a drink or a bite to be had at the stunning pool  The front of the house at Spice Route had some attitude  be they thought they were the Waverly Inn of Delhi  I cancelled our reservation and instead we enjoyed ourselves at   Our Heritage Suite was very attractive and comfortable  The linens were fine and the Imperial logo was on every piece of cloth in the room  All were available for purchase in the gift store  The rooms had no view  I mean none a wall out of one window and a pigeon perched on a high ledge out the other  The bathroom had no arate shower and the tub had a shower curtain  I hate shower curtains  It looked like half the rooms were being discretely reated on our floor  Our suite had most likely been recently redone   quickly  When I plugged in my computer the wall plate pushed through the sheetrock  Our son deemed his room  cozy   At least he had a sliver of a view and a glass enclosed shower We enjoyed Delhi and the Imperial was well located to venture out  It s a first world capital city   star hotel just a notch below what you would find in NYC London or Paris  Unfortunately we had been spoiled by Oberoi and Aman  The Imperial s new GM should spend a few nights at the competition and see what Indian hospitality can be or he can continue to run a beautiful In Spot that falls short of its potential  
P => Hotel is still fabulous I got very concerned about our stay at the Imperial as I had heard from several people that the management of the hotel changed within the past year and that standards had slipped  The previous manager of the Imperial is currently the manager of Raffles Singapore  So I approached the Imperial with some trepidation  I was really pleasantly surprised  If the hotel was indeed better in years past it must have been truly awesome because it is a still a magnificentt place to stay The interior of the hotel is memorable  I think the hallways are really the best of any hotel that I have ever stayed in  ble floors and walls lined with antique prints make going to your room a wonderful and interesting experience  I learned so much just looking at the hundreds of prints on the walls  And the rooms were quite beautiful as well with spacious showers and nice toiletries although NO hair conditioner   one of my pet peeves    True our room had no view to speak of   The windows in the old part of the hotel are quite small and as mentioned by another reviewer there is extensive work going on one side of the Imperial  There are some shanty type buildings outside where workers do sleep  The hotel promised that the work would be quiet and I would have to say that it was  And I didnt have any issues with privacy from the work area although I was aware that there were people out there  There was extensive screening from the rooms although this wasnt necessarily very attractive  All in all I didnt find the work area to be an issue After a hot day in Delhi the Imperials pool is quite a treat  I didnt notice fumes as mentioned by one reviewer  There is a large generator overlooking the pool that did make noise but it wasnt a problem  The pool is huge with magnificent fountains and lovely gardens surrounding it  The pool is a memorable part of the Imperial experience We made extensive use of the cars and drivers at the hotel and found them to be excellent  One of the drivers took us to Agra and if you are familiar with Indian roads you will know that this is quite a wild trip in some respects  In Agra there is almost no adherence to any traffic laws  The Imperials driver was great and made us feel very safe in the midst of the lawlessnessAlso the concierge at the hotel got us a tour guide for Delhi with about  minutes lead time  The guide was incredible with a masters degree in history  Such an intelligent and knowledgeable guy     I was impressed that the Imperial could get hold of someone like that with such short notice and at a very moderate price  So we were impressed by the concierge service at the hotel Oh and the breakfast buffet at the Imperial in the  restaurant is fantastic  Lots of variety of high quality food in a stunning setting  Dont miss itSo I would have to say that our stay at the Imerial was quite exceptional in many respects  I mean why stay in the bland s style box hotels in New Delhi when you can stay in this historic and elegant place  The only other place in Delhi I would be tempted to stay is the Aman and that just didnt work as well for our party this time  Imperial all the way  
P => Amazing We stayed at the Imperial twice when we first touched down in India and when we were due to leave and I must say that this hotel is simply magnificent  An oasis of peace in the center of crazy Delhi with a great mixture of colonial style with ultra modern chic The rooms were amazing and the staff managed a perfect level of service being present whenever needed without the usual intrusiveness that we found in other hotels in India   The pool was fantastic and the cocktails divine and high tea is an absolute mustTo cap it all they noticed it was my partners birthday and left a surprise cake in the room giving me total kudos  
P => Unforgettable experience with Imperial Delhi I travelled to delhi in   and stayed in Imperial Hotel Delhi  I found it so comfortable and it was my valous stay there  httpwww indiofile comnew delhi hotelsimperial html 
P => stylish and sophisticated Beautiful place in the shoppingentertaintment area close to Conht place restoraunts fast food shopping cinemas  
P => Amazing   Simply perfect One of the best experience Ive ever had in a big city  So quiet compare with the overexciting athmosphere of the street  And so luxury with one of the best Thai restaurant inside  Expensive like any other  stars luxury but real great experience  
P => Watch out for touts when you leave the hotel on foot When you walk out the gate of the hotel to look at the shops on  Path road or go to the emporium handicraft house right across the road there will be rickshaw drivers hassling you and sending you deliberately in the wrong direction so they can get commission by quothelpingquot you find the right store Ignore them and be firm  They can be quite overwhelming and even aggressive  If you cant shake them just shout out for one of the several guards standing at the gate of the hotel I mention this because my wife fell for the scheme and was taken to some obscure shop several blocks away  A potential hazard  
P => Excellent hotel best staff  Great hotel impeccable or and beautiful rooms  Staff are all excellent friendly and efficient  Have stayed  times in past year and it gets better  Gym could be better  Pool is excellent as is location  
P => nicest hotel I have every stayed in Lovely lovely hotel everything about it was amazing  I think the pool was my favorite part amazing saline pool really amazing  The rooms service and or hotelwide was such a treat and the brunch was out of this world  Totally a adent treat to be able to stay here  The location was great just down the block from CP and across the street from the cottage industry emporium  Great shopping  I loved Delhi a beautiful city well planned out and full of sights sounds and shopping delights  I loved the whole experience  Cannot wait to go back  
P => Gorgeous luxury hotel   highly recommended This really is a beautiful hotel  The pubic areas are stunning and everywhere you go you can smell jasmine We stayed on two arate occassions once while we were on business and the second time on our return from a tour of the Golden Triangle which was organised through Castle and King Inc based in New Delhi and they were excellent  It was Castle and King who recommended The Imperial to us On the first stay we were in a Heritage Room it was very large and elegant  I loved the soft quilted slippers and crisp crested bedlinen  We had drinks in the Atrium and although not cheap were generous and the nuts and nibbles were frequently topped up so unlike hotels in England   We had dinner in The Spice Route which was excellent and the service very good  Despite our Indian business associates telling us not to order Indian wine we did and the white especialy was very palletable I went for an early morning swim at am in the pool and it lovely the beds were already out and the pool attendant was attentive without being intrusive On our second stay we stayed in a o Suite which was also lovely the only thing was the floor was in the process of being orated and the gorgeous smell of Jasmine was over powered by the awful smell of paint  As we were only there for one night it didnt matter much though I would thoroughly recommend this hotel   it is steeped in history and is quite stunning  I have stayed in many lovely hotels but this and the Rambugh Palace in Jaipur are my favourites I would go back in a shot  
P => Colonial Style The Imperial New Delhi is a fantastic sanctuary in a dirty messy and sad city     As soon as the gate closed behind us we could relax and checked in to very comfortable rooms with all the necessary amenities The style of the hotel is true colonial with a  s or  You really feel set back in time at the hotel and everything is well maintained  The lunch buffet at the hotel was one of the best ever with a fantastic choice of salads charcutterie bread and all kinds of cakes and dessert We sat outside on the terrace very stylish Only quotdrawbackquot is the view over the street with the very sad Indian streetlife      But I guess that is a part of New Delhi you have to deal with   All in all a perfect place for a quothideawayquot from New Delhi in New Delhi     
P => Classy and stylish   a true Jewel in the Crown Prepare to take a trip back in time and enjoy delightful service and an amazing colonial or  The hotel pays so much attention to detail it really shows  Fresh flowers everywhere and a nice scent with aromatic oils in all the hallways  Room incredibly comfortable and classy  Wide array of restaurants and bars I had lunch at  very good and dinner at the Spice Route for all the hype surrounding it I wasnt too impressed  Only downside it doesnt have a spa In short lovely luxurious hotel a real oasis  
P => Loved the property The hotel is is in the heart of the city     to start with  It has a beautiful propoerty that reminds you of the English era the food is awesome and the service is unbeatable  I will reccomned this to all        
P => The place to stay in Delhi    if you have money We stayed in the Imperial as a treat as it was our last stop before returning home from our travels  It was way above what we would normally spend on a hotel and I was a little anxious about the expense And it is a lot of money  But at the same time it is considerably cheaper than its equivalents in Western capitals  Everything is so well finished   the lobby the rooms and the dining areas are all immaculate and have an understated elegance  The service is exemplary from the moment the door is opened from you and your bags are taken by the bellhop to the people on reception and in the dining areas  We had breakfast included and this covered a very wide variety of foods including surprisingly good pastries lots of different fruits and the usual made to order egg station  I was also pleased as we were upgraded from a room to a suite  The suite was lovely with two widescreen TVs and two bathrooms  The whole experience made you feel special and pampered and if this is what youre looking for the Imperial is the place to be  
P => Loved the scent Just too good fragrance all around it gives a perfect environment to relax Food too good one needs to try the prawns dishesi also liked the gazals that were played Rooms very relaxing and just perfect to stay The surrondings and shops also quite good 
P => A beautiful hotel A stately hotel with an impressive facade and interiors  Lovely rooms great pool breakfast 
P => Best Hotel I had stayed with Imperial a couple of times  I visit Delhi freqquently for official work  The property is just great rooms are superb good service  would recommend all  
P => Gorgeous gracious retreat in a perfect central location We stayed in an Imperial room the lowest room category for three nights in   The hotel is not inexpensive but with a discounted internet rate we felt it was very good value for money  Pros Central location yet peaceful  Gorgeous public spaces and facilities from restaurants and bars to pool  Spacious room with high ceiling beautiful or large dressing area and nary a peep from the neighbors  Generous bathroom amenities complimentary bottled water and fresh fruit renewed each day  Great housekeeping  Great breakfast buffet  Superb friendly service from airport pickup to front desk and porters to the rest of the vast staff that keeps a place like this running seamlessly at all times  Cons Not one that I can think of India is wonderful but sometimes challenging for a Western visitor  After a long block of sightseeing coming back to the Imperial was like exhaling deeply there everything is easy Every little request was taken care of immediately and with good cheer everything is beautifully maintained and scented with jasmine the a c  backed up by what must be an enormous generator works wonders even when others in the city are suffering power outages  Best of all though were the staff  Other hotels seem to struggle to strike the right note with service  The Imperial delivered the perfect balance of solicitude without obsequiousness correctness without overformality or snobbishness total warmth and grace  And they made it look effortless We will definitely return  
P => Fragrant luxury in the heart of Delhi We visited the property for two nights in ember a couple of weeks after the Mumbai attacks  Christmas parties were in full swing and the security was cursory and shambolic  However the first impression on entering the lobby is of a luxurious fragrant oasis in the heart of the city  The rooms are comfortable there are plenty of dining choices the children enjoyed the Italian restaurant and the pool looks inviting  I would go back but would prefer a more thorough security process such as those adopted by the hotel chains cht up in the attacks  
P => Opulence at its best As always The Imperial Hotel in Delhi sets the standards for hotel industries world wide We travel a lot all over the world and this hotel still remains our most favourite of places to stay for quality staff service opulence and well being  Although pricey for some at US per night it is reasonably priced for five star service in India and everything is awe inspiring The staff are long term employees who know how to provide for your every need and go out of their way to make you feel special  From arriving at the entrance where their uniforms take you back to the Maharajas to walking through the foyer where the flower displays changed fortnightly are artistic creations and found throughout the hotel but the most impressive of all is the ble flooring   stunning patterns and immaculate tiling The British Colonialism oozes of early s with photos adorning all walls of those days   the history is amazing  You walk the corridors feeling as if you are part of that era  The artwork on the stairwells and passageways to the rooms keep you entertained every time you pass by and the furniture down the corridors are of the time and place gone by  All rooms are opulence with class and the fine Victorian styled or sets it apart from the rest  It is always a pleasure to return to this hotel   whether for a meal although expensive with a wide choice of restaurants to stroll the gardens and corridors or to just lap up the luxury of a top class hotel with impeccable service smiles and to live the era of the s time after time 
P => The Imperial   one of the best hotels in the world My wife and I stayed at the Imperial for one night at the start of our two week tour of Rajasthan  Having stayed there on business for a couple of weeks in  I was keen that my wife experience the Imperials elegance and service and it didnt disappoint  Everything from the hotel pick up to the breakfast selection was excellent and although drinks prices are expensive they are no more than you expect from a  star hotel The Imperial is also very well located with the main Delhi cottage industries emporium directly opposite you just have to brave the taxi drivers outside the hotel who tell you its closed  I recommend Chor Bizarre for an evening meal in Old Delhi at the Hotel Broadway and has excellent North Indian Food and Dilli Haat for a slightly touristy but nonetheless enjoyable shopping experience   the fact that theres a small entrance fee means you arent pestered by touts and beggars  
P => lined since last visit I stayed here a couple of years ago and loved it but this time it just wasnt as great  The concierge was ok but not particularly helpful whereas last time he couldnt do enough for us and was excellent at helping us plan our stay  The room quotoverlooking the poolquot was in fact looking at trees which if you looked carefully enough you could glimpse the pool and a building site  The bathroom which is huge had no arate shower and the cleaning wasnt that great   the toilet needed a good scrub Dinner at  was fine but nothing special and the cocktails in the bar werent great at all  It also lacked much atmosphere which is very different to my last visit  One thing to point out that I didnt really focus on last time was the quotspaquot  Its not a spa its a hair salon that does manicures and pedicures and has a storage room that doubles for a treatment room if you want a massage  Its very old and dated and grubby   the foot massage and pedicures are very good though   and not at all like a relaxing spa that you might imagine in such a hotel  Overall its still a good hotel but standards seem to have slipped somewhat 
P => Pure luxury I stayed in this hotel for  nights with my wife and son  We had a really good time and we enjoyed really ourselves  The hotel is one of the bests options of accomodations in Delhi beacause it is a colonial style perfect for staying in India The room was absolutely perfect very clean and very big  We had shower and bath  Also we had breakfast which was quite good If I went back to Delhi I would go to the imperial without any doubt  
P => lovely i stayed at the imperial with my son and friend and enjoyed it very much   we were given jr  suites as an upgrade  they were lovely  very charming  well done   the hotel has alot of beautiful paintings and drawings of india which are wonderful to look at  the staff was very good   the pool was a nice place to be after the busy city life   we enjoyed the restaurants also  very good food    
P => excellent hotel excellent location a really good hotel with everything you could want  Not quite as stunning as the Rambh Palace or the Oberoi Avillas but extrmely good for a city centre hotel  The hotel tour is well worth taking   lots of history  The location is perfecty   half way between Caunht Place and India Gate  The business centre is efficient although the internet connection is a bit slow  Food was terrific and the service was excellent   a great refuge from the hustle of Delhi   the only place in Indai where a tip was refusedThe only downside was that the swimming pool area wasnt the most attractive and got a bit crowded in the late afternoon  
P => Quite simply stunning I have stayed at The Imperial a number of times and it is quite simply one of the most stunning hotels I have ever set foot in  The service is impreccable as is the hotel its surroundings and food  It has one of the best restaurants in the world The Spice Route as well as one of the most lavish bars I would recommend pre dinner sundowners on the lawns  If you can drag yourself away from the hotel youll find that it is centrally located for one of Delhis most pretigious shopping districts Cannought Place  There is also a shopping emporium across the road from the hotel which is well worth a visit  Overall I cannot recommend this hotel enough  
P => Wonderful hotel This is an absolutely beautiful hotel  Everything gleams and there is a lovely jasmine scent everywhere  They upgraded us one category from the basic Imperial room to a Heritage room and it was gorgeous  Exactly like in the hotels photos in fact it was even better  and how often can you say that  Room   was spacious enough that I dont think there is any need to book a suite  Yes there was no view and the fruit plate was tiny but thats about it for the negatives  The hotel is an amazing museum of art from the East India Company period and we thoroughly enjoyed strolling the corridors viewing the many pictures  The Spice Route restaurant is fabulous to see but I didnt find the food particularly special but then we have great Asian food in Vancouver  The buffet breakfast in the  restaurant was fine and not expensive for a   hotel  The service in both restaurants was adequate though nowhere near as good as the Rambagh Palace Jaipur or the AvilasAgra  Locationwise the Imperial is great for tourists very central for all the sightseeing and only  min  from the New Delhi railway station therefore easy to catch the  am Shatabdi express highly recommend  to Agra amp the Taj Mahal I chose my accommodations in India with a bias towards historical significance and the Imperial did not disappoint  For the price of a highend cookie cutter chain hotel room in North America I got a unique stunning hotel full of Old World charm with luxury to boot  I would happily return to this Delhi landk  
P => Very high quality class act My wife and I started our visit to India with three nights at the Imperial  The name fits the place  The hotel is elegant and sophisticated with a well developed air of the old British era in India  We were booked in a very spacious suite with a very large living room bedroom large enough to hold a very comfortable king bed and some additional small pieces of furniture a small sitting area with desk near the closet and a pleasant and good sized bathroom  While very comfortable the room didnt strike us as really quotspecial quot The furnishings were perfectly fine but quotunexcitingquot less interesting and attractive than we found in most of our other hotels  There were two minor drawbacks We had only a single relatively small window and it looked out toward another wall of the hotel and the plumbing was such that water going down the drain made a loud sound as it exited our room  Staff were very pleasant and attentive true everywhere we visited  The breakfast buffet was outstanding something we found to be characteristic of the  star hotels at which we stayed and we enjoyed both the Asian and Indian restaurants  Our meal in the Spice Route Asian was quite good if not as outstanding as we might have expected given its reputation  Our meal in the Indian restaurant actually wasnt that tasty although I attribute that to the selections we made selected actually by our guests a colleague from New Delhi and her husband  The atmosphere in both was outstanding  The hotel is filled with drawings from the British era many quite interesting plus several rekable floral arrangements including in the lobby  Incidentally a tip for touring in Delhi When in Old Delhi make sure to take a bicycle drawn rickshaw ride through the ket area  The crowds the colors the noise the smells   it all combines into a seemingly well orchestrated chaos a truly memorable assault on all the senses  That was one of the major highlights of a great trip to India filled with highlights  
P => A beautiful hotel We stayed at the Imperial for a blissful week  It is a beautiful s hotel which is well run and in excellent condition  There are many delightful architectural features e g  internal courtyards with fountains and the jasmin scented corridors are orated with delightful pictures   our corridor had tinted prints of rock cut temples in the south of India which gave us the idea for another tripBreakfast was excellent and a real pleasure to enjoy on the shaded terrace  We ate at all of the restaurants the  Brasserie San Gimigniano Italian Daniells TavernIndian with music and the famous Spice Route South East Asian  All were good with the Italian restaurant particularly enjoyable The staff everywhere were very pleasant and helpful We visited a number of other  star hotels for drinks and meals including the Taj and never felt that we had stayed at the wrong place  All in all good value for money  
P => Great historic hotel I stayed at the Imperial Hotel while visiting Delhi in transit to Bhutan   The hotel is very centrally located   Close to the Red Fort and Parliament   The hotel is very traditional and finished in a colonial fashion   It has all modern amenities small gym and business center as well as very good restaurants   The Spice Route restaurant was excellent and regarded as one of the best restauarants in India   The staff are very friendly particularly the Sikh doormenand the concierge was responsive to our pre arrival requests   While in Delhi we also ate at the restaurant Bukhara located at the ITC Sheraton and thought that it lived up to its reputation as one of the best restaurants in Asia   Bukhara had the best Indian food we have eaten particularly if you like grilled meats   If you are looking for a traditional hotel in Delhi the Imperial is your choice  
P => Elegance and Comfort in a Great Location My husband and I and another couple stayed at the Imperial Hotel for  nights in ruary  The hotel exceeded our expectations in all respects  The king beds were so comfortable the rooms were elegantly orated and the bathrooms were modern and spacious  One of our favorite parts of the hotel was the amazing breakfast every morning  They had everything from an omelette station to a smoothie and cereal bar to delicious pastries and breads  One of the nights we ate at the Spice Route in the hotel  Again delicious food impeccable service and quite the or We all highly recommend this hotel for many reasons and without a doubt we would stay here again 
P => Beautiful Old Hotel My husband had a conference in Delhi so I came with him for a leisurely vacation  The room was beautiful with ble floors and a great big double armoire instead of a closet  All the sleeping rooms as well as lobby and hallways are floral scented from oil burners I think to counteract the smell from air pollution  There is fresh fruit in the room as well as complementary bottled water My first time in India and I got sick as a dog  The room service staff was very good to me taking my requests for specific food items not on the menu and suggesting things that would be easy on my stomach  
P => Beautiful hotel amazing service an oasis in the hem  I travel to New Delhi twice a year on business and have been lucky ebough t stay at The Imperial for most of these trips  It is always a delight to come back to  A much needed home from home and an oasis of beauty and calm after the frenetic activities of the day The service is superb making sure that all your comforts are met  All of the staff are incredibly helpful and polite  I have been upgraded to a Superior room a few times so if you are staying for a while its worth asking  The Imperial is becoming more and more exclusive and I hope that it does not lose its old colonial regal charm  There is now a new very extravagant but beautiful pool and a spa is being built it will benefit form this as at the moment the sap facilities are somewhat limited The Imperial offers a range of restaurants the best of which is the beautiful Spice Route If you can afford to splash out stay here and enjoy the smell of jasmine that pemeates throghout 
P => Exceptional ambience In the madness of Delhi this hotel is an oasis  Fastidiously maintained you wander in awe of the British Empire  Spice Route the restaurant is excellent  A memorable experience  
P => Lovely Hotel This hotel is lovely The rooms are very comfortable with lovely big bathrooms  We tried  of the restaurants The Spice Route and Daniells Tavern  The food was OK in each of them but the service was exceptionally slow and forgetful  The restaurants were also freezing The bars are lovely in the hotel and I did have one of the nicest Mango Daiquiris I had had in India  I was disappointed to discover the swimming pool was closed especially as we had had no prior notification of this  I would stay here again though but I probably wouldnt eat here  
P => Jasmine scented splendor The Imperial was the final stop for our last two nights in India  It was something we were looking forward to a great deal  The reception area and flower arrangements throughout the hotel are stunning  The smell of jasmine runs through the whole hotel and creates a real sense of serenity and well being  The hotel is impeccably clean our room was very comfortable and we enjoyed every minute of it  However   One day we were there was Republic Day  We had booked our room months in advance and a courtesy note to advice us of the disruption the day would cause should have been sent   they had our email address i e  all the shops and main attractions were shut and its a dry day  They could have used it as an opportunity to get tickets for us   The swimming pool area was completely under repair and having a massive overhaul which was a big disappointment   we should have been forewarned about this and potentially an incentive to still stay at the hotel provided i e  a drink in the bar or a concession towards a spa treatment for example   This is not the hotels fault but one evening in the Italian restaurant our meal was pretty much ruined by a bitter old American who complained about absolutely everything and was extremely rude to the staff for a prolonged period  It does give some indication of the types of people who stay here i e  those who like to get their own way and do not consider others because they are so rich    It just left the evening a bit tainted when it was a treat for us to be there   I was surprised at the room rate that breakfast wasnt included  Its pretty expensive   its a buffet so just eat and eat to get your moneys worth 
P => Fantastic Hotel   Probably the best in Delhi A fantastic hotel  Everything about it was great The interiors of the hotel are fantastic  Everything was designed to a very elegant taste really British Imperial Time The rooms are very spacious nicely orated  All the amenities are there and are of the top quality The service is quick and efficient  We tried what is supposedly the best restaurant in Delhi quotThe Spice Routequot and we were quite disappointed by how regular the food was That was the only down side of the hotel  Other than that it was a fantastic stay and would definitely go there again if we are in Delhi  
P => Grand old lady Grand old lady with some really nice art o touches  Feels very British imperial although elements have been modernized  Some good restaurants and excellent service  Drawbacks   the swimming pool is right one hedge away from one of the noisiest road ctions in Delhi  Do not stay here if you are intending to relax by the pool  My room looked onto the reception not something everyone would care for  
P => An excellent place to ompress upon arrival into India This is one very gracious hotel with a most accommodating staff  Rooms are lovely and calming and I was so happy I had my first three nights here before my seven week tour of India  Breakfast buffet was plentiful but the Sunday brunch at  rupees USD  was a bit pricey for the uninspiring food choices  Nonetheless Id stay at this hotel anytime again  
P => Grande Dame with a strong lack of atmosphere The Imperial is truly a grand and mythic hotel  One of those you want to stay at least once even if everybody knows there are sme better in town Usually when you stay once you cannot imagine going anywhere else afterwards for your next stays  This works with the Raffles in Singapore or the Oriental in Bangkok  But there with the Imperial my next stay might let me try the Oberoi or of course the opening Aman DelhiThe Imperial is a wonderfull building plenty of memorabilia of old India   sometimes you do not understand how this can be possible without being shocking for Indian citizens    Public areas are a bit glitzzy but let us think this is due to recent reation The overall staff is friendly and respectful  And they have an excellent Thai restaurant with a top service  The bar is really enjoyable as well even if they might learn to make less sweet cocktails my Singapore sling was more into syrup than any alcohol The service at the airport is excellent as well and we did not have anything to do until accessing the airport lounge  That is perfect Then come the many issues which make the Imperial a faded glory The spa first  NO SPA Even no indoor pool in a frozen city for uary Can you believe this  I cannot imagine coming there in Summer   Then the rooms  We stayed two times at the Imperial at our arrival in India then  days later  We had very nice suites Heritage and Art o and I do thank management for the upgrades  Those suites are nice but bathrooms need a serious modernization only one lavabo No conditioner As welcome gift few fruits  These are details but we are speaking of world top hotels there   Relation with money is tricky after checking out I wanted to post a postcard  I was asked for the  rupiahs while in the room waiting for the bellmen to pick up our luggage an employee entered the room and check three times the minibar then call the reception to say what we took away   of course he did ask for permission to use the phoneFinally security is a big joke  As a VIP guest the security manager asked me who I am   all staff members had my picture before    At the entrance we are asked to go through a security gate when ringing they do not go into deeper examination   The Imperial is a really beautiful hotel with many quotbutquot  I hope its management will act to improve it  
P => Fantastic atmosphere The imperial is a fantastic hotelThe location is perfect very close to the center of old Delhi  The palace is fantastic and the staff friedlyThe atmosphere brings you to the old times of the colonialismWe found a very good offer on the website of the hotel and would definitely suggest to stay in this hotel 
P => Imperialist paradise The hotels museum like qualities are well known and all true  I have never seen much less stayed in something so lavish  Unfortunately I was there for business as otherwise it would be tempting to take refuge in one of the rooms for a week  Excellent cleanliness food etc  Caveat I found the staff to be far more deferential than I was personally comfortable with  My only complaint the business centre services were priced well beyond the realm of acceptable  
P =>  Star Luxury with a very friendly Atmostphere Charming hotel with a lovely atmostphere  Beautiful public areas with interesting art splendid double room with excellent facillities  The outdoor pool was a lovely place to relax after a long flight s was the main bar  We had a most enjoyable meal in The Spice Restaurant which is ideal if you like South East Asian Cuisine  The service was good and the staff were very friendly  
P => True tourist hotel A beautiful hotel with wonderful architecture and great location is spoilt by average staffing and poor facilities Like other reviews I suffered from poor staffing in restaurants the table wasnt cleared when I sat at it I waited over  minutes for a menu and getting the bill was an effort  Frustrating if you are having a break between meetings Despite the plush corridors and very nice room no effort has been made on fitness facilities and it is not clear if the temporary quotroomquot is permament  The weight area now has a dent in the ceiling from me lifting a handweight above my head Im only cm  And when I was staying the beautiful gardens that I remember from previous visits to the restaurants were covered with temporary structures for a function  A loud function which took place metres from my ground floor room Overall it is hard to justify the cost  a night trading on heritage and location might work for tourists but for anything beyond an experience it is disappointing  
P => The Only Place to Stay in Delhi This is my third visit to the Imperial and theyve done it again   a hidden oasis in the hustle abd bustle of path  Overall a great stay but There were a few minor things which disappointed Front desk and check in Me and my mom arrived at the hotel from the airport at    Check in is at  noon  The lady at the front desk said our room wasnt ready and we should wait in lobby   seemed reasonable  At   the room was still not ready and I questioned the lady at the desk  She apologised and suggested we have a coffee at their restaurant or something   I asked whether this coffee was complimentary as it was the hotel causing the delay  She refused point blank which I thought was very unreasonable for a hotel of this standard  This might sound miser on my part however hotels like the Taj Mahal on Man Singh Rd and the Oberoi have been much more accomadating in situations like this Room We stayed in an Imperial room no   which was at the end of the corridor on the ground floor  Good sized room however for more space I would recommend a heritage room which is what I booked on my last visit  Out of the three telephones one didnt work   I couldnt be bothered to complain though Breakfast buffet bf in the  restaurant serves a wide variety of indian and continental foods fresh fruits and juices bakery products etc      All were very good and its a great way to start the day Location couldnt be better   at the top of path   were all the touristy things are and also centrally located to everything of interest in delhi IGI airport is a  min drive away Rs  by local taxi India gate and Cannought Place are also very close by car VERDICT the property and the aura of the place the location and the overall experience of the hotel is worth the price tag attached to this place  A must see stay hotel  
P => Wonderful Imperial Expensive but well worth the money  We booked a suite for a family of   amp  and even though our youngest should have stayed in our king size bedsince she stayed free I found a blanket and asked for an extra sheet which meant she slept on the sofa  Our son was an extra    a night with a Z bed in the lounge Pool superb and the travel desk orgnaised a  hour city tour which including driver and guide cost around    for the  of us in a large Ac car  Food amazing as one would expect of a   and service impeccable Only down side was the suite has internal view which although reduced traffic noise levels meant no natural daylight I had a pedicure at the Spa which was extremely good value when compared to UK prices A true art o hotel full of historic paintings and pictures  
P => Exceptional ambience We stayed at the Imperial for  nights  A heaven in the middle of all the bustle in the streets The room was very comfortable  Very polite and helpful staff  Several very good restaurants in the hotel  I like very much the bar  Quick an effective service  We spent  afternoons by the pool which was great An overall very good stay 
P => Absolutely Beautiful  All round just the most spectacular hotel  Drive up a long palm fringed drive to the bell men wearing the most elaborate uniforms then enter the most sublime jasmine infused flower laden ble foyer  An all round sensory experienceImpeccable service stunning rooms quite formal and austere but quintessentially respectful service  You really feel like youve been transported to another place and time and are treated like royaltyIt is such a heavenly oasis of calm amp serenity in the hot hustle bustle of Delhi Ive been lucky to stay in some pretty spectacular hotels over the years and this is definately up there A level of service that you can only seem to get in Asia  
P => Elegant luxury We stayed for  nights and  nights at the beginning and end of our Golden Triangle trip When we arrived we were greatly impressed at how beautiful the hotel was  It was an oasis of calm in a very hectic and hot city It is a fine Art o building and has a lovely colonial feel inside with magnificient paintings and floral displays The room was spacious and very well appointed and quiet  It has all the ameanities you could ever need  We were unaware of any building work going on in the hotel The hotel makes you feel very special as if you are the most important guest It is nice to get the water and cold towels and fruit kebabs by the pool On our second visit we were welcomed back as if we were regular guests and upgraded to a suite We agree with other reviews that food and drink are expensive but what else would you expect of a  star hotel All in all this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in and would recommend to anyone  
P => Try it at least once This is my third visit to this hotel and this place never ceases to amaze me    The facilities and services are of very high class well pure luxury if you ask me    The whole place has a colonial feel and will definitely take you back in time    The rooms and beds are spacious and have all the modern amenities you could ask for  including a pillow menu The hotel is also located in one of the best parts of the Delhi path and is close to many restaurants and the shopping district   If you are frequent traveler to Delhi and never stayed in this hotel I would seriously urge you to try it at least once   Trust me You won t regret it   
P => My favorite place in Delhi After two    less successful    Delhi stays I ided not to fool around and just book the nicest hotel in Delhi for my third stay which numerous sources claimed was The Imperial  It was cheaper than I thought it would be perhaps   times what a typical budget room in Delhi would cost and while this is still fairly expensive you can certainly see where the money goes  Common areas and my room were impeccably clean well appointed and very classy  There must be thousands of unique paintings all over the hotel and in the rooms and I spent an enjoyable couple of hours simply walking around the inside of the hotel  The room was very comfortable better by a good gin than what I typically get in the US staying at   star hotels with a reading chair a top notch bed and arate tub and shower  The furniturefixtures are among the nicest Ive ever seen in a hotel  I ate at two restaurants The Spice Route and  both were quite good in fact The Spice Route I would call outstanding and only cost us about person with dessert  I ordered a cocktail from room service which was promptly delivered and delicious if overpriced  The service was excellent the best I had in India  They let me check in  hours early with no additional cost responded immediately to all of my queries and most importantly seemed in tune with what westerners expect from an expensive hotel getting the right mix of attentiveness and respect and avoiding the obsequiousness I experienced almost everywhere else  They treated me as a guest and not a cash machine which I really appreciate My complaints given what you get the room and the restaurants arent really that expensive by western standards but the pricing for extras is almost insulting    a minibar Coke would cost  a beer  etc and worst of all they wanted Rs to drive me literally down the street  KM to my next hotel    I got a taxi on the street for Rs and Im sure even that was gouging me  The car pricing in particular left me with a bad taste in my mouth  Still they were certainly upfront with their pricing and I was happy to pay for the room and food  I stayed at one other  star hotel in Delhi which was perhaps  cheaper for the room and food but was not nearly as nice so if youre going to splurge to escape Delhi I recommend going all out and staying at The Imperial  
P => Outstanding service The hotel was lovely  What I was so impressed with was the service  My plane arrived late  am and my prearranged airport transfer HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR WOMEN was there and waiting  My luggage was lost  My plans unfortunately were to leave on the am train to Agra and spend one night there and return back to the Imperial for business meetings the next  days  When I returned to the hotel the man that picked me up at am had returned to the airport and secured my luggage and the hotel had sent my luggage to the room and stored all my clothes in the closet  Outstanding 
P => Calm oasis in Delhi We stayed here at the beginning of a lengthy Indian vacation tour  The hotel offers the comfortable luxury rooms and good service at a price to be expected for a busy capital  We received excellent food and service during our stay  The service was not as personalised as some of the other comparable larger hotels during our stay but always good and efficient The rooms are well appointed and with all modern conveniences working  I note this because a couple of other luxury properties had glitches with the AC fans doors etc   The breakfast experience was a really wonderful preparation before a hot day in the city  The whole hotel is a bit of a museum  but that is part of the attraction for many guests  Business visitors will still be at home here  it was obvious that there were many guests international and domestic alike there on business In short I would certainly return to the Imperial as a tourist or on business  
P => In the middle of delhi Very nice hotel we stayed here in the begining of our tour in india and at the end spent  nights in total the hotel is fantastic ble floors wonderful jasmine scent our rooms had very comfortable beds the reception staff werent too friendly but we didnt have to deal with them so much so no big deal The restaurants in this hotel are fantastic we had dinner at the famous spice restaurant thai DELICIOUS also at the tuscany and the french food here was absolutely delightful They could improve the pool appeareance as it was the only thing of the hotel that didnt have good maintenance  great location in the middle of the city    good hotel to stay 
P => Superb This is a great hotel  It has a large very well trained and friendly staff all of whom are at all times impeccably dressed  It is an older hotel but maintenance and reation have kept it up to date and on par with anything new The restaurants are all very good too  I was here a week on business and I ate at them all  Even if you are staying somewhere else go to the Southeast Asian restaurant for delicious food and stunning or All of this is the reason that this hotel  be priced higher than some others but you do get a lot more and in the off season it is a huge bargain Delhi can be a tough city with the heat pollution beggars and unrelenting rickshaw drivers    this was my sanctuary  I can find nothing to be critical about 
P => Haven From The Heat As my husband and I have been regular visitors to Delhi in the last few years we have had the opportunity to visit the Imperial for meals and drinks on a few occasions and so on our latest trip we ided to stay here for three nights  Like all luxury hotels in Delhi it is very expensive   our special internet rate plus taxes came in at around AUS  a night for a basic room and breakfast  First time travellers to India should be aware that taxes on luxury rooms food and alcohol can add up to  a day to the final bill The Imperial really is like a piece of an India gone by   a remnant of the colonial past but one that is beautifully restored and maintained  The main areas of the hotel are glorious and it is lovely to wander the hallways and look at the artworks and photographs  Our room was spacious and very comfortable bed was the most comfortable I have found in India but a little cold   we had to turn the aircon off even though it was  degrees outside  We had a room which faced an internal lightwell and so it was generally quiet and no traffic noise just the tinkling of a fountain  On the second night we were awoken at am by some noise   probably from the ballroom below us    but when I told staff the next day they were very keen to resolve this and offerred to move us to another room We found the food in the  restaurant to be so so and I agree with other reviewers that the service is a bit below par  I say this as a comparison to the Oberoi in New Delhi where the food and service in the main restaurant are second to none  Another observation I would make is that the staff at the Imperial look uncomfortable and outdated in their liveried uniforms   although I understand they are trying to maintain the period look I think they would be better in more modern streamlined uniforms without the turbans etc  We did dine in the Spice Route and really enjoyed our meal  The menu is Thai influenced but with an Indian twist and we recommend the Kerala Lamb curry   delicious  The  restaurant has an interesting dress code and men must wear long pants to dine in the Brasserie or restaurant even when it is  degrees  My husband was dressed in st dress shorts and designer shirt and was asked to sit in the bar area rather than the restaurant because of this and yet the very next day a large group of visitors to the hotel wearing what I would class a very casual hippy attire were seated in the Brasserie next to us with no problem and then proceeded to smoke   no staff member was game to ask them to leave  A bit annoyingWe found the pool area and service to be good and as it was hot we took the opportunity to have a swim  The general location of the Imperial is great for shopping at the Emporiums and the kets on path where there are good bargins to be found but be warned when you venture outside the gates you are an easy target to taxi drivers rickshaw drivers and hawkers in general who will tell you all manner of things to convince you to go with them  This can be a little confronting if you have never been to Delhi before but just stick to your guns and walk on by  If you want a local taxi ask the doorman at the hotel to call one in and he will tell them what you want and will give you a rough idea of the price  You can hire taxis by the hour or by the meter  If you want big modern malls these now exist in Delhi ie Select City Walk in South Delhi or visit the more traditional shopping areas like Khan ket and South Extension for really good books clothes etc We enjoyed the experience of staying at the Imperial and would recommend it to friends but if we had to choose we would opt for the Oberoi for the standard of service the facilities pools gym and the food and location which we would consider to be superior for the same price  Visit the Imperial for afternoon tea or to dine at Spice Route or to look at the artwork but stay at the Oberoi for more slick service  
P => A colonial museum We stayed at The Imperial as part of a personal guided tour of Rajesthan  There is nothing to fault it  The rooms are beautiful the staff are attentive and the food in all the restaurants is very good  Walking around the corridors is like being in a museum shiny ble floors and hundreds of pictures showing scenes of old India  Worth a visit even if youre not staying  
P => An oasis of comfort Stayed for  nights on business and the hotel was one of the most comfortable places that I have ever stayed  The staff was attentive and accommodating  They arranged a day trip in a hotel car to the Taj Mahal and took excellent care of us  When I told the concierge that I needed a camera he immediately sent someone out to get two disposable cameras for us The grounds are beatiful and I would best describe the Imperial as an island of comfort in the general craziness that is Delhi  
P => Heavenly Respite This lovely hotel is wonderfully situated near all the great government emporiums and cottage industry shopping centers  So if you want to buy handicrafts and shop for the best prices this hotel location is it  The Imperial has all the touches that make you feel welcome from the candles in the hallways to stunning floral arrangements to rooms with all the amenities  I would return there in a heartbeat  Had a variety of treatments in the beauty salon whose prices were most reasonable  I recommend their pedicures and any kind of massage or facial with Andrea who has been there for  years  The hotels breakfast buffet is top notch  Dinner is a must at The Spice Route  The artwork in the hallways is unrivaled  
P => Business Beautiful clean and comfortable hotel  Stayed there for business but were helpful in arranging site seeing etc  
P => Excellent all round city hotel We stayed here partly on business partly vacation  The two rooms that we had were excellent and the service was perfect  It is a great haven in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Delhi  The hotel has more character than the Oberoi  My only gripe was that the pool area was very crowded on a Sunday afternoon  Otherwise there is not too much to criticise  
P => Great start to our holiday Imperial Chic  The Imperial is one of the most impressive hotels we ever stayed in well worth its price  We stayed at the beginning and at the end of our journey and it was a real treat every time  The Heritage rooms we stayed in were very big with look over the gardens or the front and quiet comfortable very clean and airy  The Hotels interior is clean modern and yet classic to preserve the charm of its history  Despite the size of the Imerial we found that the staff is exceptionally helpful at all times a well organised management keeps everything running without the guests noticing  We had dinner at the Spice Route and Daniells and both are very good restaurants  The Spice Route is well known beyond Delhi and often busy reservations are recommended  if you have the choice the area outside is wonderful underneath the sky  Back in Delhi we will make sure to return 
P => top in the world Everything is top of the line by all western standards exept the restaurant  where food is average at most and service laycy  The Italian restaurant is one of the best in the whole world  
P => Amazing India amazing Imperial Arriving in Delhi and after a whole day excursion it is a real pleasure to step into the Imperial  Excellent in every respect from service to quality of the furnishings and or  We stayed in a Heritage room for two nights  The rooms are very luxury with atmosphere and style although the bathroom has nothing extraordinary  Some good restaurants Spice Route is really charming and good but a little expensive  A real luxury and a real  garden  Hotel in the heart of this fast moving city  We would definitely recommend the Imperial  
P => One of the worlds great hotels One of the worlds great hotels   Although it is quite expensive I felt it was worth every penny  The rooms and common areas of this hotel are amazing exuding both elegance and character   Considering the offerings the breakfast buffet was very reasonable  I would go back in a heartbeat 
P => Wonderful hotel one of the best in the world Eight of us stayed at the Imperial for two nights as a treat an expensive one but well worth it  Excellent in every respect from the unobtrusive and friendly service to the outstanding quality of the furnishings and or  A real luxury  The price is high but you get what you pay for  
P => Amazing time at the Imperial We had an amazing time at the Imperial  We stayed twice and both times had really nice rooms  The lobbies around the hotel are very nice and the restaurants are excellents  The hotel will also arrange for a car and driver for the day  The new pool looks incredible  We would definitely recommend the Imperial  
P => Great place to stay Luxury rooms with atmosphere and style good restaurants although the Spice Route is overrated and overpriced and delicious breakfast buffet  Small but good gym  Ideal place to stay in Delhi  
P => Magnificent Officers Mess hotel Stayed in this hotel for four nights following flight from GB  Our luggage did not arrive with us because of delays in connecting UK flights  When it did my wifes case was soaking as was the contents  The hotel staff took away her wet clothes and these were dried pressed and folded and returned within two hours at no charge to us This hotel is a reminder of what a Raj Officers Mess was about   excellent service food and above all the friendliness and efficiency of the staff  Prints in the hotel reinforce the image of a Mess  Without doubt this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in during world wide travels  In my opinion if you wish to experience old fashioned service in India this is the hotel in which to stay  Of lesser interest to me than my wife is the proximity to the Governemnt and othe bazaars  Dont be put off by the number of touts outside the hotel  they are not aggressive and provide an introduction to the rest of the country  
P =>  Star Needs Tinkering      A grand boutique style hotel with proximity to attractions and less more touristy shopping in Delhi  The rooms are spectacular as are the restaurants in the hotel  Couple of reservations however The hotel fumigates the exterior of the hotel daily including around the restaurant while patrons are dining imagine large scale fumigation for mosquitos rising while you are having a drink or snack  When asked the hotel wasnt aware this could be a problem for some patrons  During the winter months the hotels much heralded grounds billed as an quotoasisquot in Delhi are untended and essentially shut down  The Imperial is the only  star hotel in Delhi that closes its pool and exterior seating areas in the winter we went to the Mauriya Sheraton and Taj Palace for lunches and found both pool areas open  Some days in ember were warm enough for swimming   however more importantly being able to sit outside would have been nice   The hotel puts natural scent oil diffusers throughout the hotel   including outside the rooms  During our stay the oil diffused was jasmine   while pleasant in small doses this smell over the fumes and dust of Delhi was a drag and would be impossible for anyone with allergies or other respiratory issues  The hotel shop has a superb bookstore but no other commercialshopping services available with the exception of a chanel store    empty and or closed throughout our stay  The location of this hotel is somewhat overrated as it is likely as a tourist you will most often have a drivertaxi to take you to shopping or sites   the shops on path are not the best buys or quality for shopping and feast on tourists I would opt on a next trip for the Mauriya Sheraton   it its shops and restaurants are fabulous and it is not particularly farther afield from shopping and attractions  
P => Peaceful Oasis This was my first trip to IndiaDelhi and Im very happy that I stayed at the Imperial  This hotel is an old favorite of a work colleague who visits India regularly and it certainly did not disappoint  I was a bit overwhelmed by the hustle and bustel of India as well as the VERY new sights smells and sounds     not to mention the local approach to driving  It was great to spend a day out in the new environment and be able to retreat back to the grand yet very comfortable Imperial  You honestly feel like you have stepped back in time when arriving at the hotel and greeted by the friendly staff  The hotel is a museum in itself  Be sure to spend some time looking at the art and photographs on the walls  My room was amazing with ble floors tall ceilings and a comfy bed  They scent the halls and rooms which I appreciated but understand might be off putting to those with a sensitivity to smell  I was shocked by the cost but understand that high hotel prices are standard for hotels in New Delhi  The contrast in general between the Imperial opulent and the surrounding area local shops etc was staggering  The Imperial is truly an oasis with a gated  acre compound of sorts My only complaint was a mix up on booking which I didnt realize until checking out  The Imperial had me reserved for an extra night that I ultimately had to pay for due to the  hour cancellation policy  Learned a hard lesson that verifying your reservation at check in is critical  An expensive mistake 
P => As you would expect from reviews     This hotel does pretty much what you might expect after reading all of the reviews  If you are starting a holiday as we were it has a slight business feel that personally I prefer to avoid as it takes me back to the office however once through that it fitted the bill nicely as a starting point on our trip  We felt cosseted safe comfortable and were able to settle into India easily  We had a Heritage Room which was OK but not spectacular   only one armchair and another less comfortable chair by the desk so if returning would probably go for a ior Suite We ate in    the casual bit not the posh bit   our first night and had a burger which was very very average and probably a mistake but we were tired and just looking for basic sustenance  We could see the Brasserie through the glass panels  It was very formal and for us the food looked good but huge portions so a bit daunting  So on our second night we went to the signature restaurant   Spice Route  Had a super meal   admittedly Sri Lankan and Vietnamese rather than northern India   but could not agree less with reviewer who compared it to a curry house  Really subtle delicate food   lovely  The bar areas are lovely and the service excellent There was a huge tent up in the gardens   presumably for a function   so it was hard to judge the outside space  The pool was very ordinary but it is ember so quite cool so no real requirement  Final comment in that Delhi is noisy  The hotel is on a main road so until quite late the car horns kept us awake  It is also wedding season so perhaps this was exaccerbated  Would recommend the Imperial but if I go back I would try the Oberoi as it looked to be in a quieter location  
P => Fantastic Imperial I spent two nights at the Imperial in ust as part of a trip to the Taj Mahal  It was absolutely amazing I wish I stayed for longer  It was luxurios but homely at the same time The hotel had a wonderful calm atmosphere with gorgeous flower smell everywhere Can t compliment enough the staff working there  The room was very elegant and comfortable the bathroom was stocked with lovely toiletries  The restaurants in the hotel were very good  I found the hotel taxis overpriced but as soon as you walk out of the room there are plenty of taxis The swimming pool was fab it was great to have a swim in the evening after a day out in the heat  be one negative  I booked through Expedia and when I checked out the hotel charged extra tax that I didn t expect to pay  Despite this I still think the hotel was good value and I would go back there  
P => Not what it could be As is the case with many world class hotels the public parts of the hotel really are the best bits  I opted for the cheapest room and whilst the bed was comfortable the room and bathroom really needed reation if this place is keen to compete with the best The bar is great as was the food served at the French restaurant  The swimming pool is nice although it is somewhat spoilt by the main road that runs along side itI probably wouldn t stay again especially at the rates they are charging however I do not regret having stayed there once  
P => A great disappointment I have visited the Imperial some  times in the past  years and it has always been one of my favourite hotels in the world However this visit  to   was an enormous disappointment and I subscribe to the increasingly widely held view that the Imperial is now bad value for money and the staff have become very arrogant For a five star hotel it does not offer as good amenities as its competitors  All  star hotels we visited this trip offered large complimentary bottles of water in the bedrooms and complimentary breakfast not so Imperial  We had a superior double room rate RPS  c  and whilst the room was correct it was not particularly luxurious  Little things were not thought through for example electricity plugs are right against the floor and so the guest has to scrabble on hands and knees to plug in an adaptor whereas all other hotels we visited had some at desk level and were thus easily accesible There was a very large function being held whilst we were there which necessitated the lawn area being closed and the outlook from the dining room and terrace being ruined  The general noise and disruption ruined our stay The swimming pool area is drab and hidden away and there are now completely useless shops for the visitor European and American visitors need an overpriced Chanel outlet like a hole in the head The Hotel car service to the airport is extremely expensive The staff give the attitude that this is the greatest hotel in the world and you are very lucky being here  This attitude was exemplified by the reaction of the cashier when I was checking out  He asked me if I had enjoyed my stay and when I said not as much as usual he smiled an automatic smile without listening expecting a yes it took him some  seconds to register what I had said  On the plus side the common areas of the hotel are quite beautiful and we ate very well at the Spice Route restaurant I was impressed by the quick response by the General Manager to my email of disappointment but my advice is go and eat there to enjoy the fabulous public areas but do not stay in this now outrageously expensive hotel 
P => Fantastic stay   although it hits your wallet Fantastic hotel and a great experience  Rooms are wonderful and comfortable with no faults However for a  star hotel its a bit diasappointing that they add quite excessive charges for their facilities for example  minutes of internet cost    Restaurants and bars are also a bit too expensive with the famoue Spice route not as good as a Above Average london curry house 
P => elegant hotel After driving through the chaotic streets of Delhi the Imperial is a welcome and calm oasis  This  elegant hotel has everything you expect from a  star hotel  The rooms are spacious and beautiful and the service is top notch  The spice route restaurant has a great interior with great food  The terrace is a beautiful place to have breakfast  The only thing we would do different is bring some nicer clothes to wear in the hotel all of the guests were a bit older and all were quite elegant  We felt a bit underdressed at times  
P => Claridges in New Delhi We had an amazing stay whilst on our honeymoon  The staff were very friendly courteous and helpful  The interior is delightful  Grand in every sense and better than most museums  The food and service was excellent and we would not hesitate in recommending or staying there again  
P => Beautiful Imperial The best in termsof location look and service at pretty affordable porice compared to other same class properties  The flowers roses arrangements are superb  
P => Elegant hotel This is a grand hotel and has a feel of travelling back in time to the days of the Raj  The best description of the hotel interior in one word is elegant  The rooms are spacious and well presented  The staff superbly helpful and friendly The restraints are all very nice and the food tasty and well presented  Down side in the restaurants was that people did smoke in them and I thought they were smoke free dinning rooms  A word of warning if eating on the terrace restaurant do keep an eye open aboveyou as we saw a large hawk take a meal from a woman s plate  Not a complaint it was amusing but could be a bit alarming if you are the one it happens to  We used a tour company organised for us by American Express by the name of Abercrombie and Kent  I can recommendthem to all who are looking for a professional guide that makes you feel safe important and caters to your needs  They organise a vehicle and guide speaking your language for you alone  It is not a shared service and they take you to the places you are interested in and do so with 
P => Best Hotel in Rajasthan The best hotel we stayed in India  Very nice restaurants good breakfast nice room  Pool rather small could be nicer  
P => Among the best in the world Its difficult to say anything new about this well located five star plus historic hotel an elegant and meticulously managed haven with art o touches  We spent four days there our second visit and have no complaints except the overpriced internet service  All the staff we met were competent friendly and helpful and our heritage room was very comfortable and fully equipped  The print collection is extraordinary and its worth visiting the hotel just to see the display in the public areas  The meals in  were excellent but the Italian restaurant while probably among the best in Delhi probably wouldnt get this ranking in Italy  Theres not much Indian in the Imperial apart from the staff and some of the food but the hotel nevertheless has a more authentic feel than its nearby western competitors  The pool area is adequate but relatively modest and contaminated by street noise but the Imperial is not a resort  None of this style and service comes cheap  Highly recommended to travellers not on a tight budget  Tip   book your cartaxi with the head porter and if walking pay no attention to the touts on the street outside  
P => Arrogant staff Tax scam I ll start with the best in that the hotel building and interior is very classy  By the worst   arrogant and snobby staff  They are not there to serve they are there to do what they want to do I was booked into the Intercontinental Nehru Place and it was too noisy so I went looking for a quiet hotel I went to the Imperial and asked if there was any availability and if I could look at a room  The lady at the front desk seemed to be looking me up and down iding if she would give me a room  She would screw her face up or give me a quizzical look when I expressed an opinion such as  the Intercontinental was too noisy  or asked  how much was the room rate   There didn t seem to any rhyme or reason to it more like it was dependent on her whims   one minute there were rooms next minute they were fully booked  I was going to walk out at this stage but I had already been to the Oberoi and Sheraton who didn t have availability I d been messed around by various taxi drivers in hot taxis between various hotels and it was late and I was getting desperate  She then ided I was up to scratch and showed me a room which was great and I agreed to take the room  She then took about  minutes to do the checkin and then gave me a different room to the one she showed me   just nuts   I asked for the room she showed me and she explained it wasn t available then she upgraded me to another room  My room was a heritage suite and consisted of a arate lounge room and bedroom with nice furniture and wood floors  Each of the TV s had a transformersurge protector which hummed like a power station   I disconnected them  The room looked into the inner part of the hotel and as such there was no natural sunlight but very quiet  The only noise was from the piped music in the hotel which I would have to listen to as I lay in bed at night as it penetrated the window looking onto the lobby  The room was artic cold and I immediately turned off the aircon but then discovered there is ventilation into the room which you have no control over and this continues to pump cold air into the room  It really was cold so I slept in my clothes and rugged up to watch TV etc  I asked the next day for the ventilation to be turned off and after various people arriving and going they did turn it off so I was able to control the room temperature  The bed was good the shower had good hot water  Internet connection was up and down   they charge Inr    per day i e  USday and it would have a good connection for  minute and then die for a minute and then come back to life  Sometimes it would just stop and would have to reboot  very annoying and not good enough to use skype  I downloaded a mb file and it took  minutes Breakfast was a buffet but very good   Inr  plus they expect tips Room service food was very ordinary   I do some Indian cooking and I think I could cook better than some of the meals they delivered Room charge was Inr per day plus they charged taxes of    x room rack rate Inr  so Inr taxes   this is just a tax scam and there is no basis for this   the correct calculation is  x    and they know it  So Inr  plus internet plus breakfast you are looking at US per night  This is just outrageous for what you get  It is a sort of hotel for people who like Mont Blanc pensrolex watches etc  It is snobby and elitist and just not comfortable for someone like myself  The arrogance of the reception and the tax scam give you a flavour of the type of people you are dealing with  Add to this an uncomfortable cold room and I will not be returning  It is tough to find a good hotel in Delhi as from what I can see they are all expensive and patchy quality but I think this place is better avoided   my next time I am going to try the Taj Palace as it has some good reviews  
P => Worth It A wonderful location  The staff were very friendly and the room was out of this world  We felt very relaxed here  It is expensive but its a real treat that makes it worth every last cent  No hesitation in suggesting this to anyone  
P => Couldnt ask for better What a great place to stay in Delhi  We looked at a lot of reviews at various websites including tripadvisor and though it is quite pricy ided to give it a go  No regrets whatsoever  Excellent ambience and you are treated like royalty  The room was splendid in or and very well maintained  The staff were always available and eager to help  We even had a cake and a bunch of flowers presented to us for the wifes birthday  Having stayed at some hotels in Delhi in the past I can honestly say that this one beats them all hands down  If you budget can stretch to it spend at least a couple of days here you wont regret it 
P => Great Experience and good location This is agreat hotel to stay in  The sevice is fantastic and it has a really lovely air about it   especially the breakfast service overlooking the imperial style lawn  The restaurants are great too and as a lone female traveller I was never made to feel uncomfortable  The staff helped me book my train tickets to Agra and back and also in getting me to the aiport  I have stayed at this hotel many times when on business in Delhi and I have only had  minor hiccups   ONce my door lock did not work so I was moved to another room after an entertaining experience of having around  different people come to look at the lock and discuss what might be wrong with it and the only other issue is when sometime housekeeping staff knock at your door to check that everything is ok quite a few times during the stay   which in most Indian hotels is a kind of hint for a tip   Like I say Ive stayed at lots of hotels in India and this does happen a bit so I still rate this as a minor hiccup  I would reccomend this place for business or pleasure travellers its pricey but worth it  
P => The best place to stay in Delhi Id definitely recommend the Imperial as the best place to stay in Delhi  True the Oberoi and the Shangri La are probably even more luxurious but neither of them has a tenth of the character of the Imperial  I stayed in a suite which was breathtaking  But the standard rooms are excellent too  The restaurants are the best in New Delhi especially the Spice Route  The buffet lunches are also not to be missed   if you cant afford to stay here its well worth dropping in for a lunch or afternoon tea  The standard of service is absolutely top notch and the hotels interior is one of the most beautiful anywhere in the world   and scrupulously clean  I couldnt have enjoyed this place more  
P => one of the best hotel to stay I stayed at the imperial for a week at the beginning of y  just after having spent few days at the Grandintercontinental that I ided to leave after seeing the Imperial what an excellent ision it was At the Imperial everything was fantastic the staff the terasse of  brasserie facing a peacfull garden the spiceroute restaurant and its mysterious atmosphere the swimming pool where squirrels and birds are playing     Althought I was working I was there with my partner and it was a very romantic place to stay  It is the best hotel I have ever stayed in  Go there and enjoy  
P => Overall an excellent property especially for colonial atmosphere just stayed a total of  nights here in e   after watching all the different opinions about delhi hotels in the last few months and after going back and forth ided to try the imperial due to the elegant colonial atmosphere and the good location for walking around  we were not disappointed  being low season rates were excellent booked at the hotel website just over  for the larger heritage rooms  the history and elegance of the hotel is just great and the staff rates about a   or   depending on which scale you are using  i found none of the attitude problems a few others have mentioned  one of the concierges pointed us a new deluxe shopping center for luxury designer ladies clothing the Crescent which was the highlight of my wifes visit many top designers featured in the indian fashion magazines have recently moved here from an older area that was demolished and we certainly would not have found it without his assistance  all other staff members were always friendly and helpful  sometimes you definitely find some minor communications problems and considerable shyness with some staff who look like they are newcomers to the industry  but with a bit of patience and a smile you will get what you want  i would agree that there are a few corners of the hotel and some areas in some rooms that need reated but in general the hotel is shining and polished with luxury  in our second visit the towels seemed especially worn for a deluxe property and the rather cheap plastic hanging shower curtain was out of place  but in both rooms the water pressure was excellent we had no problems with drains or discolored water  keep in mind that the indian govt apparently charges very high taxes on all hotel services as others have mentioned  you need to add about   to the confirmed room rate to get a true idea of cost and the same thing is added to hotel limo and other services  but this seems to be clearly stated at all indian hotels so it shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone  we booked airport pickup both times with the hotel and it was handled flawlessly  we did not have breakfast as we were always busy taking off for somewhere but i did walk through the buffet breakfast one morning and would agree that the selection was not bad but not what it should be  we had several meals at the  restaurant which were all excellent and the service the same     expensive sure but you are at one of indias finest hotels the location is one of the best for walking around the connht circle shopping area one of the better ones for street shopping with a minimum of street hassles  each street has its own gang of urchins who are all tht the same lines  curiously after a day or two of totally ignoring them we werent hassled anymore which shows that they spread the word that you arent worth the trouble one afternoon in old delhi we found a new scam     a crazy looking guy started following down the street talking to us and after a couple of blocks someone who was probably his cohort came along and said that he was accusing us of using his rickshaw without paying  anyway he was quite persistant so we reached the red fort where there was a police post and i told them that this guy was harrassing us  he calmed down a bit and we took a tuk tuk out of the area  getting back to the imperial i suppose the only criticism i would make is that having one of the most magnificient properties in the country they should spend the money and make it   flawless and updated instead of just     this comparison was brought home after a few days at the fabulous rambagh palace hotel in jaipur see my review if you are heading to jaipur where you can search high and low and not find a single spot of the hotel that isnt perfectly clean polished and of the most luxurious material  in delhi the taj mahal has more ostentatious luxury but the rooms are more standard business style  but if you are looking for an elegant historic and colonial atmosphere and a good location i think you will be quite happy at the imperial as long as you dont expect perfection  
P => Great location and good rates Stayed here for  nights in a very hot e shop around for rates   I got  a night which is very good for this top class hotelwatch out for the tuk tuk drivers who want to take you to the tourist shops rather than the real kets   once you emphasise that you do not want an air conditioned tourist shop they are fine visit the ke in old Delhi on a tuk tuk for a real treat   I gave the driver  rupees for the day and he was very pleased    gets you an air conditioned car for the day with a driver    if you get the hotel to book itthe hotel is very cool   ac everywhere and the staff are excellent   the bar can be a bit pricey but is very relaxing and the terrace is great 
P => Yes Yes YES to the Imperial Awesome albeit short stay at the Imperial last summer I flew into Delhi for one night last summer en route to Punjab This was my first stamp in the passport and I was traveling alone I booked a heritage room on the hotel website and also arranged for hotel car pickup at the airport  I was extremely nervous about this trip for a lot of reasons but the Imperial really helped me along The car service man was exactly where they said hed be with my name clearly visible  The greeters at the hotel entrance were friendly and helpful with my luggage   and I had a lot Upon checking in the staff upgraded me from a heritage room   to a Luxury Suite Can you say fabulousI ordered room service   India hasnt mastered the art of the meatless burger   but it was more for curiosity than a fault of their own  I did have to pay for in room internet but it was wireless and a negligible amount of rupees so no biggie there  I am headed back to Punjab this summer and will definitely be staying there again  Such a seamless experienceYou really cant go wrong booking this property  Rates are much lower in the summer cause its extremely hot there at that time but if youre going in the summer and can snag a great rate def choose the Imperial  
P => Everything it should be Arrived early Sunday morning met at the airport by two very spacious carssome confusion as we had two rooms but one was for the kids only charged for one car  Check in was fast and efficient  Had interconnecting Heritage rooms  These were huge and very well furnished including large B amp O plasma TV with DVD  Large modern bathrooms  Breakfast was buffet andor to order very large airy room with oudoor terrace  The two main restaurants one Thaione Indian were excellent   note dress code of formal casual which means no shorts trainers or jeans  Room service was also good  Swimming pool area was sheltered and clean and service was good complementary cold water and towels arrived as you sat down  Cocktails were also available Big old hotel but perfectly maintained  A taste of colonial times In the heart of New Delhi with some great little local shops just up the road Used hotel car and driver for New Delhi tour very well informed  Took guide for Old Delhi tour for extra info about fort etc  NB main monumentsmuseums are closed on Mondays  My favourite visit was Huans tomb   a hint of what the Taj Mahal is like   we did this on our own but there are lots of information signs  
P => Lururious oasis amidst chaos We stayed here  different times during ch  The hotel and its grounds were a welcome respite from noisy dirty New Delhi just outside the wall  The staff was very helpful and friendly  The Heritage rooms on the second floor are bigger and nicer than those on the first floor  Turn down service is to die for The breakfast buffet is excellent and the waiters are very attentive   we even had breakfast with one of the stars of Desperate Housewives and his partner The Spice Restaurant is excellent and the ambience is inviting  Even room service was fast and the food was great  We will certainly stay there again  
P => Comfortable stay but unimpressive food The Imperial is a royal treat no doubt  But the hotel mostly has its ambience and or to flaunt because after that it is mostly downhill  The hallways remind you of the history of the hotel and its grand heritage but the standard rooms are cold uninviting and small  My TV didnt work but was too busy to bother complaining but at other times the staff was quite responsive  However you can forget about getting an iron in the morning rush  The bathrooms drains need a bit of work  I got two different rooms but neither had a properly draining shower or sink  But my biggest complaint is with the food available inside the hotel  The much advertised Spice Route is quite ordinary but horrendously expensive  Daniels Tavern is actually better  But the more casual  restaurant has a menu that is too small to keep your interest for more than a couple of days and most of the servings are bland fried or just downright tasteless  However the breakfast buffet selection is quite good  
P => Dreadfully disappointing It is with much regret that I write about the serious line of the service at The Imperial hotel on path  Having stayed here four times in the last four years for a couple of weeks at a time it was one of my favourite hotels in the world  Even two years ago it was still an elegant oasis in the midst of a fabulous bustling city with cool corridors good if pricy food and a sense of time stood still  Well time has definitely stood still and the staff and management are resting on their laurels  The maitre d  of the coffee shop restaurant had a stand up row on Saturday th ch with one of my Indian friends which was both shocking hostile and embarrassing my friends ended up writing a letter of complaint to the hotel manager which of course has gone unanswered  The maitre d a few days later accused me of avoiding him although he had the grace to confess that hed been quothaving a bad day quot At breakfast each morning staff were slow and ungracious and they stood around watching whilst the crows in the garden came and stole food off punters  plates instead of responding to the cries of many frightened American women to shoo the birds away I know this bird problem of old and eat inside  Most staff it has to be said judging by their conversations with each other had been up all night watching India get thrashed in the World Cup Cricket which might account for their total lack of customer service   I had lots of problems with the sound proofing of my bedroom this is not the hotel for a quiet uninterrupted night s sleep and despite informing house keeping of my desire for no air con a little quirk of mine every day I would return home from doing voluntary work in psychiatric clinics to find my air con had been on all day and my room was now an arctic igloo my room  gets no sun during the day  By Wednesday I d had enough checked out and asked for the three remaining nights I d paid for to be reimbursed  At check out Akhil Arora the duty manager confirmed to me and on the phone my Delhi based travel agent that this money would be reimbursed My husband and I are now in protracted email negotiations with the hotel manager who has reneged on this promise to refund us our money  By accident my husband has been copied in on an email from the manager telling his deputy to hush up the matter  I am shocked that a hotel of this calibre can treat guests particularly a woman travelling on her own in such a rude and complacent manner  But I was not alone  I overheard several people at reception complaining about the concierge and about the poor sound proofing of the bedrooms If the hotel was so wonderful I might be able to understand the conceit of the staff  But compared to other hotels in Delhi   which offer more lavish buffet breakfasts interesting social programmes for guests bigger pools a spa at The Imperial I had to have my foot massage seated upright in the ladies hair salon the Imperial has been  about to build a spa for the last  years be an arcade of local shops if that s your thing The Imperial has a newsagent and a Chanel boutique  in the corner of the lobby and in two years I have never seen anyone go inside or even a gym The Imperial s  gym  is half a dozen pieces of equipment in a converted bedroom   The Imperial no longer has anything unique or special to offer expect perhaps its location being close to the railway station and the shopping areas of path and Connht Place   all of which are an inexpensive taxi or tuk tuk ride away from all the other major hotels  British friends who used to stay at The Imperial for months at a time when working no longer do so speaking of a serious line in standards as the best staff leave to work in real estate one of Delhi s booming industries  The Grand Hyatt The Oberoi or the new Shangri La are now their hotels of choice  Local friends of mine deplore The Imperial s smugness and fear that people will think all Indians are like this  They are not  Try another Delhi hotel and experience proper Indian hospitality  Don t be fobbed off with faux grandeur and money grabbing grandiose conceit from the staff at The Imperial  
P => Walk back in time We recently stayed  nights at this hotel which was like walking back in time  From the greeting by a turbaned doorman to perfumed and candle lit lobbies and hallways the place was elegant pristine and gracious  Beautiful carpets bled floors lndian prints sculpture and photos going back to the maharajah rule and colonial time were everywhere  better then any art gallery  An elegant buffet breakfast is served and one can dine inside or outside on a lovely patio overlooking lawn and gardens which is an oasis in the middle of bustling noisy city  The Spice Route restaurant is beautiful with fine food and service  While not inexpensive it was fairly priced for what was provided We stayed in a Heritage room which was good sized with a large bled bathroom and soaking tub as well as a mini bar  Quality amenities such as lotions and shampoos were plentiful  Turn down service was nightly which included bottled water and a goodie on the pillow  Down duvets and pillows rounded out the experience  There is a outdoor pool for those wanting to swim  This place was a haven in the midst of Delhi and a lovely experience to stay  
P => Something special We stayed at the Imperial for the first and last nights of our India holiday  This is one of the best hotels I have ever experienced in terms of character comfort and service and though expensive for India it is very good value  The whole place was reated about  years ago without losing its s style and charm  The location couldnt be better it is a far better bet than any of the international chain hotels out on the airport road The only word of warning is look out for the restaurant prices  We asked where we could get a light lunch on our first day were directed to the buffet    for what was basically a snack for two was completely ridiculous Only average food as well though our breakfasts were superb and included in our deal Your travel agent can probably book for less than you will pay booking online 
P => Impressive service This hotel has an colonial elegance style to it  We booked through the hotel directly cheaper so we managed to get a free car pick up from the airport it was great to just get off the plane and not have to fight to get a taxi  We arrived at  am in the morning and the upgrade room older style was ready for us when we checked in  Truely Amazing Room   The service is first class in all areas   We had pre booked the Spice Route Restaurant in the hotel as it was our wedding anniversary that evening this is the Thai  Eastern Restaurant  Dont bother the service was rubbish and the food very average  the price is expensive for what you get  But  minutes before we left the hotel manager walked a round the restaurant and suddenly all the staff came to life but we were leaving by then   So we left the restaurant very deflated for the bar we told the waiters how dissappointed we were with the restaurant with it being our anniversary as we ordered our drinks   minutes later they have a full cake in front of us   glasses of champagne singing etc it was so lovely  The bar supervisor Adishek had arranged for the restaurant Manager to come and see us  The manager was so apologetic amp she brought a lovely craved woodern box of spices and more champagne  She managed to handle a tricky situation correctly amppull back our view on the situation  The following day we took a metered taxi cab from the front of the hotel around all the sights  Red fort  Jama Masjid big Mosque  India Gate and Huuns Tombthis is brilliant do not miss it out  Shopping is good at the Cottage Emporium straight accross the road from the hotel get both giftswoodern amp bronze carpets paintings amp Indian style clothes Kaftans etc In the evening we went to the hotels Indian restarant Daniels  It was truely amazing  Food excellent  atmosphere great live Indian music playing and service brilliant but unintrusive  This is by far the better restaurant would highly recommend along with guys in the  bar  The Buffet Breakfast is included with the room price in the  restaurant so dont miss out on this as this is also excellent amp good to fill up on before a days sight seeing sit outside on terrace when sunny  its lovely outside  The pool was closed during our stay which is really dissappointing as a dip mid afternoon would be briiliant but they class uary as winter F and think its cold so they close the poolThis is an brilliant olde worldly hotel with excellent service and i would definately recommend this over an ultra modern hotel in delhi   Enjoy 
P => nice hotel surly concierge Really nice hotel but considering that youre in Delhi its a fantastic hotel  Beautiful rooms and hall ways  Concierge service however needs a lot of work  The main older guy is just really unpleasant but there is one nice young guy who occasionally mans the desk  Mostly we had to deal with the older middle aged surly guy who gave us inaccurate information  Most of the other staffs are nice  By and large its the best hotel in Delhi we stayed at  Imperial Oberoi and Radisson  
P => Wonderful This is definately one of the best hotels if not THE best in Dehli  Hotel Imperial has a wonderful location on Connht Place near bazaars and restaurants good service and rooms with great or  Although our plane was late for two hours hotel driver was waiting us in the airport at  o clock in the morning as our room rate included airport transfer as well We had a fantastic heritage room with beautiful big bathroom and Fragonard amenities  Daily fresh fruits were a nice little extra  As I don t like indian food so much we had a dinner in San Gimignano garden restaurant first evening where the food was excellent and we also enjoyed our breakfasts in beautiful patio  Only the swimming pool area is not that attractive but then again   it is a city hotel so swimming pool is not the reason why to go to Imperial  And they had an excellent service there afterall  They also have a wonderful pastry shop near the lobby and an absolutely gorgeous art collection  Imperial calls herself quotmuseum hotelquot and organizes sightseeing tours to the hotel  Everything was clean and nice and I would suggest that hotel to anyone without any hesitation  
P => Excellent Hotel This hotel is truly excellent and has taken its rightful place in my top ten hotels in the world The staff could not be more helpful and everything about this hotel excudes charm and service  The sandwiches in the bar are a little ginal but that is the only critism I could make  All of the drinks in the bar and peanut  snacks were great  The Spice Route restuarant serves great Thai food and this was not hugely expensive  Good value for money  
P => Nice but    Initially we thought this hotel was outstanding   we loved the or style and atmosphere   a reall oasis in dirtybustling Delhi  I would agree with other reviewers that some staff particularly the restaurant staff could come across as aloof and snobby  But it was very competent and never rude so I suspect this was either their natural demeanor or the way theyve been trained  Unlike some other readers we loved our meals at the Spice Route   and the or is something to write home about   the detail was incredible   supposedly took  years to build While our room looked beautiful at first blush I noted that they had an electric air freshener in the room on the first night  Everything smelled OK  On the second night the air freshener was gone and room started to smell a bit like the bathroom   theres an open drain in the bathroom that I suspect was connected to all the waste water piping and my guess is this didnt drain properly so toilet water was staying in the pipe and producing a smell through the open drain  It wasnt too bad when we went to bed and we were leaving the next morning so we didnt complain   but by the time we woke up it was quite pungent  So it seems they have some plumbing problems   something to think about Lastly if you eat on the patio keep your eyes peeled for hawks   I couldnt believe it but one of this relatively large birds that circles the sky over the city dive bombed a table  business men and snatched some food right of someones plate  Quite exciting to watch and Im sure a huge shock for the people at the table    
P => The Best Hotel Ive Stayed In If youve had enough modern high rise  star hotels like The Claridges and want a feeling of history without getting a hotel that shows the ravages of time this is the hotel Beautifully orated spacious great art work impeccable service without getting in your way  Go for a Heritage Room if you want space comfort and a homey colonial feeling  Dont miss the Spice Route restaurant and ask for a tour of the restaurant if they arent too busy  Breakfasts were superb We wrote a glowing report in their customer evaluation form but got a letter from the manager on our return apologizing for any discomfort or inconvenience we  have encountered  Something got lost in translation I suppose  
P => Terrific city hotel Booked direct changing dates and rooms etc but all no problem  We loved the bustling bars and meals in the indian and fusion restaurants were jolly good  The staff were charming and the location for shopping excellent  Breakfast outside was a lovely start to the day and the best breakfast we had in India Our o  suite was sumptuous  We took the hotel car and found the drivers helpful  
P => Beautiful The Imperial Dehli This hotel was gorgeous  We spent two nights here  The breakfast was delicious and the room was spectacular  I absolutely love ble and this hotel has so much  The British Colonial or is really wonderful  
P => Beautiful Hotel The hotel is REALLY LOVELY  I am a seasoned traveler who really enjoys the finer things in life  I found The Imperial very nearly immpecable  The entrance is attractive with creative fresh flower arrangements hats off to the florist and the halls of the hotel boast many beautiful prints and paintings  The heritage room in which I stayed was tastefully furnished with colonial style period furniture  single beds  Bed linens were comfortable and attractive  The bathroom was ble with a tub but no arate shower  Overall the room was very pleasant and light but sadly the windows in my ground floor room did not open so I did not get much fresh air  Also the tub clogged  I made a few complaints but the problem didnt get resolved  The buffet breakfast was great lots of selections of hot and cold foods as well as an omlette station  The ThaiIndian restaurant was fantastic though quite expensive even by hotel standards  Room service was great always on time and always delicious  One major drawback was the horrible massage facility  It was noisy and seemed dirty if you must have a massage go for the inroom massage option  The concierge is not well informed about happening restaurants or night clubs so do your own research  Also remember than in Delhi everyone gets a kickback for everything The hotel is well situtated near shopping and restaurants  We tried a really nice loungerestaurant called QBA in Coughnut spelling area  Also dont forget when shopping Bargain Overall the whole hotel experience was great  I am definately going back  
P => Really Over rated  We spent  days at the Imperial in ember   All the advance press about it touts it as quotthe best hotel in Delhiquot   Sure it looks great  But below the surface its just mediocre  The staff while seemingly willing and friendly never manages to deliver on any request  Most of the rooms have windows on interior courtyards which means theyre really quiet  If you get an outside view room be prepared for lots of noise  Including the bang bang of the staff fixing chairs while youre trying to recover from jeg lag  The Spice Route is claimed by Conde Nast Traveller to be one of the  best restaurants     but clearly their reviewer has not been eating in any even middle of the road fusion restaurants in New York London or Los Angeles  A good restaurant in any of these places wins hands down in a competition with the Spice Route  Where by the way the staff attitude is idely unfriendly  Now lets talk about prices  Every meal was over priced but the most riduculous offense of all was that the Imperial charges as much for a bottle of domestic Indian white wine Sula as they do for an import from France or California between US  for something you can buy on the street for US   Bottom line over priced over rated under delivers  They clearly have contempt for their well travelled target ket who all have enough experience to know this hotel is a sleekly packaged rip off  
P => Oasis It is highly recommended due to its reputation and Im actually fine with their practice of keeping those pesky tuk tuk drivers off the premises  The facilities look opulent inside and the air smelled of lemon or giner in the halls which is very refreshing after coming in from the pollution outside  The restaurants can get costly  I didnt think the Spice ket restaurant was anything to rave about  ent pricey and it was really dark in there The pool was nothing special  The gym is small but I enjoy small hotel gyms  The building is old of course and the windows are pretty thin because one can hear all kinds of outside noises from the room  Bathing was quite an experience I got dirtier than if I hadnt bathed because as I filled the tub the water was yellow To top it off we were ripped off with the taxes at check out should have been based on the discounted rate that we reserved the room for and not based on full price Management didnt care to apologize or rectify this even after we lodged a formal complaint  Also I think that having people constantly open the entrance doors seems a bit pesky and impractical  Why not install automatic doors 
P => The only place for pure luxury in Delhi We have stayed at all the top hotels in India including Udaivilas Rajvilas and Avilas and found that The Imperial more than holds it own  The hotel is full of authentic old photographs and furnishings but has been thoroughly reated to a very high standard  We particularly recommend the heritage rooms if you staying with a child as the room is beautiful and very large to accomodate the third bed  In fact we lined a heritage suite because the room was so good  The food is fantastic in Daniells Tavern and we really enjoyed the life music  The food was among the best weve had in India and no health problems  The hotel is also surprisingly quiet and tranquil given that it is bang in the centre of New Delhi  Frankly the only place to stay in New Delhi  I note another reviewer complained about the pricing but we never felt ripped off  The hotel is expensive but delivers  And if the security guards are hesitant about letting in autorickshaw at least it shows that are making a safe environment for guests  
P => Great service An absolutely beautiful hotel   the museum hotel in all its grandeur  The service is top rate the restaurants are out of this world  I have stayed in five star hotels all over the world and would rate this at the top of my list for best overall  If I had to quibble with anything it would be the hard mattress but that is a minor complaint in an otherwise superb hotel experience  
P => Pretty Much Perfect After traveling in the North of India for work this hotel could not have been more of a lifesaver  The room was gorgeous and very comfortable   fantastic bed and linens beautiful ble floors and bath excellent amenities  Had excellent meals both at Spice Route a must just for the exotic or and the french bistro  Spent some time in the bar working on my laptop   service was attentive and very friendly  I felt extremely comfortable in this hotel despite its imposing public rooms   I found the service had just the right tone  Highly recommended  
P => A restored masterpiece I had heard good things about The Imperial but I was still genuinely surprised when the hotel car from the airport dropped us off  You would never for a second believe that the hotel is  years old   it looks brand new  The refurbishment has been total   every fixture every fitting replaced whilst retaining a  s look  It is as good as Raffles in Singapore and without the hordes of passing tourists although tourists still seem to make up   of guests   very few suits  Acres of ble and hundreds of artworks line the corridors  The five restaurants offer a superb variety of food from around the world  Even the location is good for a tourist   right in the middle of New Delhi The only problems surrounded our original room a o Suite which seemed to be cursed The electronic door control wouldn t work the air con would not go off the TV had a constant hum unless it was unplugged and to cap it all the room overlooked some noisy equipment on the roof of an adjacent hotel building  We were moved to a huge suite with a combined steam room  shower and a Jacuzzi bathIf you stay here I recommend hiring a green and yellow Delhi cab from the hotel rank for a day  It will cost around   and is the easiest way to get around the New Delhi sites   Gandhi museum Nehru museum India Gate parliament building Huran s tomb highly recommended and Khan ket  If your flight departs very late at night you can negotiate a very late check out pm in our case with the hotel for a charge  In sumy there are cheaper five star hotels in Delhi but none are as beautiful or offer the same variety of eating and drinking as The Imperial  
P => Beautiful City Retreat The Imperial is a beautiful hotel near Connht Place  The hotel is a Art o showpiece with beautifully appointed luxurious rooms  Dont opt for the Heritage Suites as they all face into courtyards or atriums   leaving the rooms dark and with no natural light or VIEWS  The most exquisite and expensive cave Ive ever stayed in  The pool is especially nice as it is one of the few pools that is deep enough to dive into ft at the deep end but unbelievably noisy due to the street traffic and has regular wafts of urine smeels drifting by  The food was ok in the varying restaurants but the wine list poor and horrendously expensive the Shangri La however has a fantastic East Asian restaurant with well priced food and a much better wine list  The bar there was also much cheaper  
P => Luxury heritage hotel Luxury in Delhi  Vaste room great service  convenient location for the centre of Delhi   Conht place and the shops The tibetan ket is  min walk from the hotel great for silk but bargain hard and from the governemental shop  coutry cottage emporium where prices are fixed careful that at the exit of the hotel some guys will tell you that it is closed in order to draw you in his shop  For food try the South East Asian restaurant but keep away from the Italian one  
P => They dont come much better    anywhere Where would one start One of the finest   worldwide  Service as you can only get in Asia  Massive suites  Superb restaurants    def  try Spice Route and Daniells  Wonderful atmosphere and reated to a very high standard  I shall stay no where else when in Delhi  
P => A Haven of Calm While living studying and teaching in Delhi and Dehradun The Imperial Hotel became my haven of calm in the midst of Indias seeming chaos Between the years  and  I celebrated each of my own or my partners birthdays there  We both enjoyed the hotels attention to detail and the importance of the guests every pleasure and comfort  I was always touched by the fact that we were either given the same room from year to year one we especially loved or upgraded at no extra charge to a suite if the room we like so much was unavailable On our birthdays we always found a birthday cake waiting in our room no extra charge plus flowers our favourite drinks and snacks  This made entertaining friends very simpleWe have used the hotels fabulous lunch buffet on the outdoor terrace overlooking the private garden for parties with friends  Each event went flawlessly  Food wasis always delicious and the service is always attentive yet not overbearing This winter a trip to India is planned in ember and a birthday party at the Imperial is being looked forward to with much joy and anticipation  
P => Old Raj splendor This is a truly first rate hotel with a beautiful interior great bars and restaurants and luxurious rooms  Personal serviceattention is top notch and I got comfortable and complimentary rides both to and from the airport  My only substantive complaints are two First the cashier put huge holds on my credit card that lingered even well after I had checked out and settled the bill  This was quite annoying but  have been a fluke  Second everything is ridiculously expensive from minibar to restaurants  Still if you have the rupees you cannot do better than this 
P => Good hotel if your loaded This is a lovely hotel clean good facilities excellent service good food and a brilliant location  It is a great contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city and a good place to relax The only downers are the slightly pompous clientele and the enormous prices  The owner of this place must make a fortune 
P => Not as good as other luxury hotels in India My wife and I stayed at the Imperial Hotel in mid ust right after spending two days at the outstanding no tipping Oberoi Avilas Agra  The Imperial seemed a high class tourist factory by comparison  We cant blame the hotel for their well heeled but rude guests but an extended family occupied the room next to ours and left the door open making the hall an extension of their room for the convenience of their effusively happy guests and well wishers  The false colonial atmosphere is thin when reality sets in  Youll be sure to experience the costumed doormans pregnant  second car door close for those slow to tip and the ever helpful bathroom sink faucet turner oner and towel hander  The grand hotel show would be charming if the staff were faultless but there were all too human lapses that were never seen at the Oberoi  There was only one bottle of water in the room when we checked in  One staff promised to phone us with information and never did  Another got our order for the boutique wrong  I asked the telephone operator to connect me to Thai International Airways city ticket office and I told her the name of the building  When she checked and called back I asked her what was the correct number and she didnt tell me  Instead she connected me to the Thai International airport office and they kindly told me the number of the city office of course I was charged for the call to the airport  A card in the room proudly offers special pillows but of two kinds that we requested only one could be located during our  day stay  The buffet breakfast is spectacular and the food in the restaurants is excellent though not as good a value as Avilasi in Agra Before we checked out we called for a porter to get our two large suitcases  After  minutes we wheeled them to the lobby ourselves where a porter ran the last four steps to take them from us  Other things including Internet did work well and we can see why others were ecstatic with the Imperial  But we had just come from a hotel with better trained staff and real heart  
P => Nothing else to say other than   PERFECT The Imperial describes itself as quotamongst the finest hotels in Asiaquot and I have no hesitation to say that it is THE finest city hotel in Asia  We stayed for  nights in an Art o Suite having been upgraded from a Heritage Room  Our rate was  per night including tax which was more than reasonable in particular in comparison with other   Star hotels in capitals around the globe  The suite was beautifully furnished spacious and provided an Oasis where we could relax  The service was impeccable throughout the hotel and there was not a single staff member we ran into who did not greet us with a smile  It was quite clear from the beginning that all staff took pride in what they were doing  We ate at the Italien restaurant and were very pleased with the variety of food the quality and in particular the affordable wine list  On departure we had to order breakfast in room as the restaurant opens at am which was when had to leave  Breakfast in room is available from am  We made a note on the breakfast card to deliver it at am sharp instead of the usual  minute window hotels normally grant themselves  And so it was the door bell rang at exactly am All in all a beautiful hotel which even if you dont stay there is worth the visit as it could also function as an art gallery  
P => Saved by the Imperial Our stay at the Imperial came at the end of an exhausting time in India  We arrived at   in the morning our room wasnt ready   so they made another available for our immediate use  We were on our honey moon and the kitchen provided a scrumptious chocolate cake  The rooms were lovely  The suite was sumptious and luxurious  We ate at two restaurants superb food and service   The Imperial and the service makes Delhi memorable in lovely ways  Recommend the Imperial every time   people and management and experience   wonderful  
P => Enjoyed The Imperial We were booked into The Imperial by the small agency handling our independent itinerary in both Winter  and Winter   We loved the location the helpful smiling staff the heritage the gleaming facility and the sumptuous breakfast buffet  Our room wasnt on a quotPrincess Dianaquot level but it had everything we wanted  Were definitely not royals but felt like it  the way we were treated there  The desk always changed our Rupee notes for smaller denominations without a hassle  An added plus is being able to walk outside past the gate and right onto path Road where the shopping for trinkets is right there waiting for a bargain  We left bags stuffed with our path quottreasuresquot in the left luggage when we departed for the desert until our last night in India when we returned to The Imperial several weeks later  very handy  Would we stay at The Imperial again Yes Were returning mid ober this year  We know its not the fanciest in town but we were totally pleased  
P => Top property   beautiful artwork and tasty restaurants So happy that I ided to try the Imperial instead of one of the big International brands in town     Had a great  night business stay in mid  heat wave  Started out well before my arrival when helpful staff at the Conciergetravel desk advised me on how to spend my one day off arranged train tickets to Agra and my airport pickup  Food service manager booked my Saturday night reservation at well regarded Spice Route  Airport pickup was seamless   a spotless Rangerover or Landcrusier or some luxe SUV with driver and hotel rep ice cold water and cool towels  We stopped to rescue a fellow guest whose hotel car had been involved in a fender bender but made the easy drive to the hotel in less than  minutes  Check in was fine   though not especially warm  Common areas are dramatic and beautiful and every inch of the hotel has fabulous Colonial era artwork displayed  There are pretty fountains and statues and several attractive restaurants  The pool area is attractive though nothing spectacular  Beverage service there was efficient and friendly  The website promised Spa does not exist yet date TBA though I was told that there was a small beauty parlor and that room massage was available     Food and service were solid at all outlets though the bar servers at the  were a little harried one night and left everyone waiting  minutes for a drink  Dinner at the Italian spot was great   Basil sorbet was a fab dessert choice  Spice Route was very good  Club sandwich and such was very well done at the   Thali style lunch at Daniels was really special  And the all Bruschetta menu in the terrace courtyard was an interesting option for a light snack  Phew On to the room I was given a smoking room instead of my requested NS room but it had enough charm and no stale smoke smell that I didnt bother to change  The king bedded room was spacious with tasteful furnishings flat screen TV well designed storage and an immaculate bath  My view was over the internal courtyard   which was fine for me  I paid a very low night  Business Center was very efficient and professional though I thought prices were high   even by an International standard as I recall  INR per page for a fax   apx US     Location is good   short walk along path shopping arcade to Connht Place or easy taxi access to anywhere  The addition of a spa will be a great ammenity as travel in India can be overwhelming because of the beauty and sadness  I will stay here again  
P => The Delhi Classic Outstanding experience from start to finish  Airport transfer in brand new limousine with responsible driver and thats something in India  minute check in elegant rooms oozing colonial splendour  Ate in the Spice Route restaurant  Generous portions fine cooking and friendly staff  Ive been coming back to this hotel time and again as it provides a welcome relief from the usual  star clones that all look and feel the same  The Imperial has character 
P => This Hotel is Fabulous My Mum and I stayed her as part of our quotbigquot india trip     It is without a doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in and Ive stayed in some fab ones  Ignore the earlier reviews  The staff are very friendly   take the time to chat to them we had some great chats with the guys in the bar about India in general and cricket in particular  We wanted to visit one of the restaurants with the beautiful or when it wasnt open and the restaurant manager took the time to show us personally    The food excellent the surroundings gorgeous and we stayed when they were building the spa   Im sure its even better now  The hotel itself is full of museum pieces and you can even do a tour of the artefacts if you wish I cant recommend this hotel enough and will definitely be staying there on my next trip to India  
P => Nice hotel We stayed here  night during our quotGolden Trianglequot trip and LOVED it The room was quite large and came with some nice extras like cookies slippers bathrobes etc  The bathroom was also very modern clean and nice   compared to other hotel bathrooms even in the U S  It definitely was a hotel of luxury with history  I enjoyed walking around and looking at all of the artwork  The restaurants were nicely orated and had good food  The bartenders made good drinks  We wished we could have stayed here longer  
P => very very good The several reviews before mine are in no way accurate reagarding this magnificent hotel I would not be surprised if they were written by competing hotels The Imperial is by far the best hotel in Dehli Although the oberoi prperties in rajasthan are some of the best in the world the one in Dehli does not even come close to the magnificent Imperial hotel Great roomsfantastic staff and service Dehli itself is a dirty chaotic city that is a poor introduction to a magic country  dont get disheartened it gets better The Imperial provides a great oasis of calm Beautifully restored by its sikh owners who have committed their staff to the highest levels of service When In Dehli stay at the Imperial The much touted connht place is not so great and the government cottage emporium shop much touted by guidebooks down the street is a joke You can buy the same goods in the usa and europe at half the price Shoppping in Rajasthan is much better   
P => Average experience I spent  nights   amp  at the Imperial in New Delhi after spending  nights at the Oberio  Heres my take The bad  My room was probably the worst in the hotel  The linens were soiled and the room was extremely noisy  We asked to switch rooms within  hours and never heard back from the reception  Upon asking again same story  Now for the good  great locating near Connht Place and very impressive lobby and great restaurants  We dined at the Spice room  times and  twice as well  Food was great and they disounted the food bill   for using American Express  Overall my experience was average to poor  The Oberois rooms were much much nicer and the service was better  
P => Dont stay there  Go for afternoon tea  The Imperial was originally an art o hotel built by Luytens as a sign of the new India  Today it is an anachronism It is like an overdressed dowager still waiting for a s tea dance to begin  The problem is that in  the dowager is definately dotty and has some very strange ideas about how the world works Very little of todays booming and optimistic India can be sensed in a hotel where the waiters wear rather grubby regimental uniforms which might give the tourists a pretty patronising picture but miss the point The rooms vary widely within a category  A heritage room can mean many things  The showers are wonderful although the lack of a erate conditioner just shampooconditioner combined was annoying However clearly at this price the place is more than comfortable but special it is not  My advice is go for afternoon tea have a look but stay elsewhere The best thing about The Imperial was the staff member who knew how to humourously exploit the over the top nature of the place  The worst thing the need to hassle for a good room upon arrival and the tip hungry staff At the Imperial I felt like I was on a conveyor belt for well heeled tourists  If you want luxury in India the Oberois are the best  
P => Top notch though impersonal We stayed at the Imperial in uary   It was perfectly nice and we were happy wed arranged a pickup from the airport  Our room looked out on to the garden and was spacious and comfortable  It was a little disappointing that the pool was closed and also the restaurants were fully booked being New Year  The hotel is beautiful and a museum in itself  My only complaint was that the service was quite impersonal   wed just come from the Ritz in Singapore and it didnt have the same level of attentiveness or interest  However it is a landk and is worth the visit  
P => Overpriced pantomine in need of a cleaner The category  heritage room  covers a multitude of sins   and some few rather nice rooms which  be had in exchange for a demonstration of stubborn recalcitrance and insistence in the face of an impassive explanation that there is some variation in the quality of  heritage  rooms  Only too true The staff fawn uniformly and services varies between fair to average and not home at all  All expect the requisite tip in every interaction with payment now and service in quotbequot an hour or so  Information provided is often accurate   but rather misleading in its omissions  For example  Yes madam the swimming pool is just round there  does rather make one expect to find a functional swimming pool with water rather than a boarded up construction site with no water Once you disregard the scruffiness and enter the pantomime it is quite fun   but not worth the price  At half the price it would be fine Alternatively skip the pantomime and check into the Shangri la   real  star value for money with elegance and position and just around the corner  
P => Being Served    This hotel is a cut above the rest if you can stomach having ten people serving you at all times  The entire establishment really is a throwback to colonial times  from the architecture to the distinct feeling of priviledge  That said the rooms are huge with some ammenities I have never seen elsewhere lint rollers for example and the location is great  Any desire you might have will be attended to  I am a tour creator and had a group stay here and every single participant loved The Imperial  They raved about it for days Be forewarned that internet access at the business center is outrageously priced as are most menu items  Auto rickshaws are not allowed onto the hotel premises but if you step outside the compund they are readily available and a great way to get around if you are in a real hurry  One last thing  the pool is currently closed  you cannot even peak at it  and the gardens are pretty much non exsistant due to a spa construction  
P => Difficult staff and a lesson in fighting for what you want I stayed at the Imperial in uary  and did not share the enthusiasm of previous reviewers  While the lobby and corridors are stunning I found this to be the only positive feedback on my stay as a whole  The restaurants are very pricey the service at the hotel is abysmal the rooms are very cold in uary the swimming pool is closed and breakfast is opulent but the food is dull and uninteresting  Problems with service faulty communication between travel agent and reception desk  hours to retrieve a sweater from lost and found  hour average response for extra blankets We used a travel agent and got very so so rooms on ground floor next to the service area therefore a non stop flow of staff and noise in front of your door  At my second stay I refused such a room and was told the hotel was entirely booked but when I insisted I was shown a nice quiet room on the st floor While hotels in India can be a challenge the Imperial requires an amount of stubbornness unsurpassed in my travels  If you want to stay there make sure you know what you get in terms of rooms and are prepared to fight for it  
P => This is one of the great hotels of the world The Imperial is a Delhi institution but not one that is riding on its past laurels  Its great   it embraces you as you come in dirty and hot and soothes your aches away  This is an immaculate hotel which draws on the imperial past but doesnt glorify it  The architecture has strong art o influences gardens and pool are very nice  The bar will pull you in many times   its very old with perfectly trained bar staff Make sure you get a room with an outside view   the atrium facing rooms are a little bit gloomy during the day  
P => Overpriced When we arrived to our room at the Imperial around  pm after a very long travel day we thought our very expensive heritage room was just ok but we were too tired to do anything about it  But that night the heat did not work and it was cold and the toilet would intermittently not stop running water  The next morning when I pulled back the curtains I saw that we were looking down upon an ugly construction site  We had paid top dollar for the supposed luxury of this hotel and the quotextrasquot of a heritage room  When I complained at the front desk they seemed disinterested but finally someone agreed that if we would pack our bags they would move us to a nicer room with a nicer view before we came back at the end of our tour day  Well we got back and nothing had happened then we were told that the hotel was full and there were no rooms  After much complaining and consistent disinterest from the hotel staff they showed me  different rooms at around  and  pm both of which werent any nicer than the one we had and neither of which had a view  At this point I was just too tired to move and gave up since the toilet seemed to be working properly now and we were leaving the next day  They never took responsibility and kept saying that I had not booked a room with a view  Of course my issue was not so much that I did not get a great view but that the rooms themselves were not up to my expectations for the  we were paying and at any other hotel your room would be discounted if you had a ugly construction out the window  They really never offered an apology and were unresponsive to my complaints  Now I must say that all of the public spaces and restaurants are truly beautiful in every way and that we got good service at both the Spice Route and  restaurants once we actually got the attention of a waiter  I peaked in some other rooms while wandering the halls and noted they did have nicer rooms  So I think the quality is very inconsistent and the price value ratio at this place is way off   Dont know what other hotel options exist but I would only stay here if you get a much better price and can somehow demand one of the updated rooms  
P => One of the worlds top hotels Simple one of the best hotels in the world  Sophisticated and elegant the hotel and its interiors are works of art in and of themselves  
P => This must be the best hotel in India We stayed at The imperial in ember  This is a top class traditional hotel The building and the interior is truly superb  The staff are professional and helpful  Its not cheap but you will have to look very hard to find any fault If you are visiting for the first time I would strongly reccommend this hotel  Beware a cheap hotel in Delhi  be a total shock to your system 
P => Though The Imperial was Great The Imperial was the first hotel in which we stayed in India and was unsurpassed by any other  The hotel has a lot of character   the corridors and restaurants are repleat with th century printings and etchings  It was also spotlessly clean and the hotel staff were polite and helpful at all times  The hotel is a true haven from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding city  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast and also ate dinner one night in The Spice Route and the other night in the  Restaurant  The food was delicious in both  We whole heartedly recommend this hotel  
P => Looks good     The Imperial looks very nice indeed  Our room was nicely furnished and was spotlessly clean  However we did have some problems with the service at the hotel  There was a blockage in the drain of the shower which we reported on our arrival  If anyone did come to investigate then we were not aware of it since the problem persisted throughout our stay  Also be careful to check that you are billed correctly for any treatments in the barberbeauticians  We also found that staff couldnt really cope with a sudden rush of people coming down for breakfast  We had to wait for a table and then waited some considerable time for the toast and tea we ordered my fried egg never did materialise      Hope this doesnt sound too down on this lovely hotel but little things matter when you are in this price range  
P => Colonial spleandour at its best Just returned from a trip to New Delhi and this hotel is simply fantastic I checked in and out of this hotel twice and had fantastic rooms on both occasions  The service and staff were very helpful and nothing was too much of a problem to them  The general or of the hotel is colonial spleandour at its best The business centre is always very useful to me for email access etc and the wi fi connectivity they have at the Imperial is excellent  Overall I have no complaints will be staying there again next time and would strongly recommend this hotel to any visitors to Delhi  
P => Indulge your British Colonial fantasies Like most of the reviewers we had a great experience at the Imperial  Yes it is costly but for the service location art and or it was worth the indulgence  We arrived via plane in the middle of the night and Imperial staff were there for pickup  Bedspillows are comfortable  Noise was not a problem  Complimentary breakfastcereals yogurt fruit pastries juice eggs was available and was fine  As other reviewers noted the Imperial also houses a restaurant touted by Conde Nast as one of the top ten restaurants in Asia  While the or and presentation were great the quality of food was no better than a good Thai SE Asian restaurant in the US or UK  The other restaurants served good if pricey food  
P => Fantastic and doesnt have to cost a mint This is easily the best hotel weve ever stayed at  The reviews say it all   perfect service gorgeous surroundings fantastic food  But know that it doesnt have to cost a huge fortune We got a  rate and while our room was smallish it was on the beautiful first floor a short walk to the lobby and restaurants and near the business center where you can email and fax to your hearts content  And I would recommend the st floor if you can get it higher up the hallways get shabbier   per my walkabout one day to admire the artwork  And the FURNITURE If you are an antique buff at all make a whole hotel wander part of your itinerary especially the long main central hallways on each floor  You will be well rewarded  Also be sure to enjoy the breakfast   silver service galore   and the Spice Route restaurant  Contrary to some reviews our meal there was superb and the or is not to be missed  Our only complaint was noise  We were on the end and the walls do not block out the road noise nor the sounds of the wedding party outside  The pool suffers from the same road noise problem and they are doing some kind of reation out back so a large part of the rear gardens are torn up and blocked off  But for the rate we paid we were still thrilled   we plan to return on our next trip  
P => Perfect The Imperial is a wonderfuly restored old Colonial hotel  Great location  Terrific rooms  Helpful attentive staff  Great breakfastsWe had a very large room   be a ior suite  Very tall ceilings   peaceful elegant  Great amenities  You can walk to some great kets and the Government Handicraft store is nearby  The grounds are beautiful  They serve both Indian and European food at breakfast and we always had the Indian breakfast including the fresh lassi and fresh squeezed juices  Very clean  We would never stay in Delhi without staying in the Imperial  
P => One of the best I stayed here recently for  nights with my wife after our wedding  The hotel looks amazing and the rooms are excellent  With its wide ble corridors and the staff in their uniforms it makes for an excellent setting  The rooms are excellent in their size and furnishings and we found the service from the staff to be top notch  The real highlight however are the number of paintings in the hotel it is full of them and we spent some time just wandering the huge halls looking at them  Its nice to find a hotel with something a little different from the bland rooms you often get from the top chains and the Imperial has real character  After the Imperial we left for Australia and after staying in numerous hotels for our trip both me and my wife felt the Imperial was the best of the lot  Having stayed in some of the other hotels in Delhi we think its the best hotel in Delhi and a pleasure to stay at indeed its one of the best hotels Ive ever stayed at 
P => Be Prepared    Generally a nice hotel but I left feeling cheated and lied to   I generally felt like a walking wallet and although I tipped generously and often it often felt like it was way too much work to get anything accomplished  The staff were constantly smiling but seemed consistently confused  Isnt it a common request to be received at the airport We signed up for the best room available and werent given what we were promised  We eventually were able to switch rooms at a significant premium The food was not very good  The breakfast buffet is mostly mass produced doughnuts muffins etc  as well as bland fruit We also ate at the restaurant downstairs touted as quotOne of the top ten restaurants in the world by Conde Nast quot Avoid the restaurant if possible we were seated next to a very noisy large group and after struggling through our appetizers we were moved after puzzled and annoyed looks from the waitress  The food was very mediocre it was good but definitely not worthy of their quotTop Tenquot claim  Similar to what we expect from our local Thai take out restaurant  Only ten times as costly  The price of typical restaurant food in India is much lower than comparable meals in the US so the prices here were exorbitant  It cost around USD for dinner for two The pool is very small for a hotel and got quite crowded at the times we used it  Also around dusk the pool gets bombarded with a swarm of flying bats that skim a few inches above the waters surface  We were never actually hit or attacked but it was extremely unnerving In general the grounds were nice although much smaller than anticipated after reading about the quotsprawling gardensquot etc  The grounds consist of about  feet of grass surrounding the hotel before it meets the busy street Be careful with the minibar they give you a small bottle of water on arrival and the rest you have to pay for at  dollars apiece  This could add up quickly since the tap water is not potable I havent experienced other hotels in Delhi so its possible that they are worse but I would not return to the Imperial  
P => The only place to stay in Delhi Ive stayed here four times now and I would never stay anywhere else in Delhi  Its possibly my favourite hotel in the world   luxurious without losing its  character  The Spice Route restaurant is a must as is touring the wide ble corridors to see the original early th century watercolours and art o sculptures  If you need a great sleep on soft pillows and a huge dose of unbridled luxury after touring India stay here   you wont want to step outside  
P => Highly rated hotel One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in  Almost exceeded Raffles in Singapore thats saying something  Rooms not quite as booked on check in so got upgraded to a suite  We were only there two nights wished it had been longer  The rate included meeting at airport go for this it really smoothes the path   the hotel rep and drivers were very professional and got us to the hotel in quick time in the rush hour  Excellent reception from the fabulous doormen and lovely women  Particularly striking was the wonderful fragrance that met you as you entered the hotel  Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and welcoming  Attention to detail superb  You could spend a week roaming the corridors gazing at the superb artwork furniture and so on  The ITbusiness staff were superb got me online with my sad old laptop in no time courtesy of a loaned wireless thingy Breakfast buffet OK but the restaurants at night are excellent  Try the Spice Route great food but the room is just out of this world  For really great food go to the  for drinks in the bar best Bloody y ever I had to have another just to be really sure and then on to the restaurant for superb Provence style French food  Whatever you do have the Chocolate Souffle   total indulgence and one of the best Ive had including all over France  Room service for the kids was among the swiftest Ive ever had  The pool area is good and the grounds are beautiful  Just up the road is a McDonalds but dont go there for a meat fix as of course there is no beef  Also opposite is Central Cottage Industries Emporium dont believe the hustlers who tell you its closed and try and get you in their taxi to take you to another store  Here you can buy all manner of carvings ornaments and clothes at good prices without the hassle of haggling over price  I could do with that place at ChristmasThere isnt a downside to this hotel I can think of except having to leave it  When I pass through Delhi again I wouldnt even look at another hotel  
P => Wonderfull Wonderful hotel and vellously placed  Ideal environment of the colonial epoch everything is impeccable in this hotel from its commodes rooms up to the magnificent restaurants The Spice Route is incredible and bars it is an oasis inside the city  I adore it

P => hotel is gorgeous but service lashit I stayed here for four nights in ember  and am so disappointed that despite the facelift since last year the service is still the same slow unfriendly and depressing  There is a real problem in this hotel with the staff and customer service compared to any other  star hotel  The Taj puts the Lalit to shame mind you so would the travel lodge  Lets start with the pick up service at the airport  It was complimentary  Great  He nearly went without me though Two names on the same board  Because it had been booked by the same tour company the driver assumed that when the first person arrived they could go without me   It was the other lady who saved the day by asking the driver to wait behind for me otherwise they would have gone  Thanks to this lady Secondly on check in   minutes this process took  I had requested a quotquiet non smoking roomquot and called that day to confirm this request  They didnt have it Eventually after much negotiation they had a room but when I got there it was facing the train station and had no bath  So I called up and they showed me two other rooms with another compromise one was smoking one was adjoining room  I went with the quotquiet adjoiningquot   my god bad choice  The hotel might have been refurbished but the soundproofing at this place is dire  The next door neighbours could be heard rustling their newspapers and stirring their coffee   no joke It was awful  Also they ided to start smoking in a non smoking room as the smoke smell went right under the door and stank my room out  I called front desk to report this but who knows if they done anything Laundry service is late  My trousers were   hours late  Breakfast was nice but again bad service I was made to sit down at a dirty table no one cleaned it  Upon check out they had preauthorised the charges to another guests credit card and no one asked me how was my stay  They dont have questionnaires in the room and its no wonder they know about the hotels problems I am sure they must get lots of complaints  PS rooms are nice but not functional  Trying to figure out the shower the button is hidden behind the dial  I wont stay here on my next trip to India  
P => Pricey but Beautiful I stayed in a new room at The Lalit and thought it was amazing  The service food salon gym pool or etc  can only be considered five star but it definitely came at a high price  
P => Cordial comfort and convenience The impressive entrance and reception area makes an immediate impact  There are several very comfortable seating areas where you can wait for people or just watch the world go by  It is a busy hotel and I suspect that quite a few business people use it as it is close to the business area of Delhi  We liked the position of the hotel  it is about  minutes away from Connht Place and the larger than average rooms  We asked for a non smoking room as close to the top of the hotel as possible and we werent disappointed with the fabulous view  The air conditioning worked well and was easy to control  The bed was extra king size incredibly comfortable with a light duvet  I would have appreciated a sheet under the duvet   sometimes you dont want to sleep with a duvet but you still need a light cover  Both the bed linen and towels were top quality  We had to ask for extra towels and one light in the bathroom wasnt working but it was sorted out pretty quickly once we called reception  The flat screen TV showed all the usual channels including BBC   As I am not a breakfast person I really appreciated the tea making facilities in the room and also the amount of free bottled water  The bathroom was spacious with a huge walk in shower  Curiously the bathroom was arated from the main room by a see through glass wall   but you could roll down the fitted blinds if you wanted some privacy  The restaurant on the ground floor is open  hours   and we were grateful to be able to order food and something to drink when we arrived at the hotel at   in the morning  I didnt like having to pay to use the internet in the business centre if you had your own laptop the wifi was free  But I did like the fact that we were given a late check out and so could take our time before leaving for a late flight out  The pool area was good hardly used it seemed to us but we were there in the low season and the changing room facilities were fine although the ladies changing rooms could have been better stocked with shampoo conditioner and body lotion  The service in the restaurant was a bit hit and miss   sometimes very quick other times we had to wait for ages  Security at the entrance of the hotel was good   fast but thorough  
P => I would live here all the time if I could I stayed in the Lalit for a week in tember and am planning to go back there again for a couple of days next week  I travel to  and around  India a lot with my work and the Lalit is by far the best hotel that i have stayed in in Delhi and also in India even better than the Taj Bengal Hyatt etc  There were a few issues during my stay but the hotel manager went out of his way to resolve these for me going over and above what I would expect  The rooms are spacious modern and a joy to work in as was the gym  Ah The gym the pool and the spa   I would be happy just living here in fact  The gym has powerplates all the latest equipment a great view and the staff are extremely helpful  food   great and a wide selection for room service  Definitely go for the buffet breakfast if you can  
P => Lalit Very Comfortable big rooms beautiful lights and entertainment   helpful friendly stuff  Everything was Excellent  
P => NOT THE BEST   BE SURE TO REQUEST A NEW ROOM AND DONT EAT THE FOOD I stayed at the Lalit in    On arrival check in was quick and i was asked if i had stayed with them before  IF you are asked this question say YES otherwise the will give you one of the older rooms yet to be refurbished  I moved rooms as not only was it old dated and noisy dues to the nearby train station and the constant train horns but the wireless internet is so slow you cannot even access email The new rooms are very comfortable and modern and the wired internet is fine  Still noisy depending on what side of the hotel you are on  I ate in the hotel each night and mostly the food was fine  The Grill is expensive and service is VERY slow but the food was acceptable  The Chinese resturant is OK  The bistro in the lobby is expensive and the buffet currys are nothing special  They do however carry a mild case of Salmonella which is an unpleasant way to finish a tripCheck your bill carefully  I booked a room with free internet and they tried to charge me twice  Also check the dates on cans from the mini bar  In both my rooms they were over a year out of date Over all and acceptable hotel with good fitness facilities and good location  If you can get over the noise of the trains and dont get poisoned its fine  
P => Comfortable if somewhat characterless The Lalit is extremely comfortable well appointed and well run  The location is handy for Connht Place  Our standard room was spacious clean and comfortable  In fact everything you would expect from an international class hotel It suffers only for being a large international hotel in feeling a little anonymous and impersonal which is only a minor complaint If you can secure a reasonable rate via one of the hotel web sites this is a good place to stay  Watch out for early check in charges though  
P => A diamond in the rough The Lalit remains one of the most lavish hotels in which I have every stayed  Everything in the hotel is modern stylish and sparkling clean  There is a small night clubbar inside the hotel as well as a restaurant  Make sure to try the breakfast buffet it is awesome 
P => Pretty ent and a Good value Lalit is within walking distance of Connht Place  Very nice rooms good staff  I liked the gym as very few people used it and it had new equipment  Coffee shop is OK but breakfast buffet is not as grand as the Taj or Radisson but still good  Make sure you grab the waiters attention if you require coffee immediately  For some strange reason they havent figured out the caffeine needs of the Western traveler  I really liked their wired internet  High speed secure and no hassle logging on  Would stay here again  Paid    a night  
P => Very nice hotel walking distance to Connht Place Very nice hotel with helpful staff and walking distance to Connht Place 
P => Our home away from home for seven nights We loved this hotel  It was our home for a total of  nights during our  week trip to India this summer  The security is very impressive  We felt very safe and secure in a city which is pretty crazy at times  A full breakfast was included  We had most meals in the  resturant located on the first floor  Desk people were beautifully dressed and very helpful  Room service was immediate  They even knew our names  All issues were addressed promptly  The pool area is breathtaking  Lounge chairs rest in the water  Service was very impressive  We all had our hair cut and other services of the spa which were first rate  The shop owners in the hotel were especially nice  We bought saris and beautiful scarves from Kashmiri Arts located on the second floor  We stayed at many hotel during our stay which were nice but the Lalit is in a class all its own  
P => Impressive  Hotel Lalit has beautiful new rooms  Myself and my clients were impressed with the service  Mr Ravindra Ku FampB Manager has been very courteous and always make sure that clients go back satisfied and come back to Lalit for their next trip to India  I always impressed with Ravindra  He has been sending regular mails to remind us the interesting events gala dinners held in The Lalit   What a great way to be in touch with the clients in various countries  As promised with Ravindra Ku I recommended my clients to stay for  room nights in month of tember   Yesterday I got the feedback from the client that service was impressive and Ravindra and other staff of hotel took good care  All my Japanese clients felt like home   Thank you Lalit and thank you Ravindra   
P => Beautiful hotel I stayed at the Lalit with my partner during our recent visit to India  The hotel is impressive with high ceiling and modern furishings  Nice facilities especially the swimming pool and gym is equipped with new and good machines  The room is clean and comfortable  The staff are polite  Many nice restaurants in the hotel breakfast is good with wide spread of food I had dinner at Wok however food is not up to expectation should be improved with its presentation and taste  Excellent location just minutes away to the famous bengali ket  
P => Overall satisfactory but some minor problems We stayed three nights at the Lalit  I had a mixed experience with them during our stay  We had some minor issues besides that everything went well  We had booked through a travel agent and got a good rate for the room inclusive of breakfast The location of this hotel is really good five minutes from railway station and Connht Place  It was convenient as shopping and loads of restaurants were around the corner  Taxi charged Rs   and auto rickshaw charged Rs   to go to CP  Taxis were available at all times and rickshaw could be hired from outside the hotel The lobby is breathtaking with a nice waterfall huge paintings and pianist everything in the lobby is spanking brand new  Our room was on the th floor with a great view but the room was really old and it was especially visible in the bathroom with old taps rickety shower waterks and chips in the wash basin  We had problems with air conditioning making noises and that got fixed and one day cable went off as well but was fixed promptly  These are very minor issues but for a five star should have been fixed beforehand and it makes a difference between a good and great stay The breakfast was really good it was buffet style with both Indian and American options  There are tons of different items and baked goods as well  The food was prepared fresh and had several cooking stations The attitude of the staff was great and were always willing to help with a smile  Wifi is available for Rs  for  minutes  I signed up for this twice and used it for about  minutes each but upon checkout they billed for Rupees  stating that I used the internet for an hour each but could not explain the charges as I had only signed up for the half an hour option  I was not going to argue over  as they said have to check with the IT to find out the problem We were a bit let down with some little issues these things are not expected of a hotel trying to compete with Taj or Oberoi  Overall we had a satisfactory stay at the Lalit and will probably stay again because of its great location  
P => Fantastic Hotel On a recent stay I found the Lalit to be a great hotel to stay at in New Delhi  Very modern with a beutiful lobby great rooms great restrauntsbar amp a lovely pool area  Staff were always very friendly amp helpful and the bed was soo comfortablePool area very nice with lots of lounges to choose my only gripe that no alcohol would be served by the pool so much for my cocktail amp a swim Was about  blocks walking distance to shopsket or a few minutes tuk tuk ride for about  rupees  Price of food at hotel felt a little over the top for India though it was beautiful food the buffet to die for amp it should be expected at a  star hotel This hotel deserves it  stars I would stay again it was a great choice 
P => Good service good value for Delhi Have stayed at the Lalit three times now The continued updating of the building is good  The pool and terrace were available on this trip and are very nice  A small oasis of calm in the middle of Delhi  Only downside is the piped music can get on your nerves Staff are friendly and the service is good  Room service food and restaurant ala Carte menu is always a joy When we first stayed there it had the largest range in a breakfast buffet Ive ever seen  Unfortunately it seems to be getting smaller and relies more on processed and pre packed products  This might be a minor point but it was an attraction on earlier visits  It is possibly seasonal WiFiInternet price is high  Business centre printing prices are extortionate  
P => Absolutely delightful I really liked the property  Location is excellent and the hotel is  star delux i would say  At the bargain i got it was a steal  The rooms are classy and they upgraded me to their superior room on my request at the reception  Further even a late check out was given  Reception was good and very helpful  
P => Nice Hotel good room This is a nice hotel in the heart of new delhi  I was traveling with my friends  We had a nice rooms The hotel was helpful with helping us to get information about newdelhi recommending and booking nice restaurants But the cups and kettle in the room verey dirty they dont wash it well take care see and wash them good befor you use them Bathroom verey cute but there is problem in shower basin water is stuck   Internet verey expensive   
P => Excellent place Well the rooms were extremely goodstaff nicethe xcoffee shop greatchoice of breakfast was the best I ever had in india In short   excellent hotel   
P => The Best Hotel I Have Stayed At I initially planned on staying at the Lalit for only a few days in ruary before moving on to another place but had such a good experience that I ended up staying here until my trip ended in e What made my experience memorable was the kind of service that my family and I received  I fell ill on my nd or rd day and when one of the housekeepers learned of this he asked if I needed any medical assistance  We told him that I would be fine and thanked him  Later that evening I received a phone call from somebody  front desk I believe  asking how I was feeling  The next morning a manager asked me how I was doing and connected me with a dor who prescribed medication for me  Receiving that sort of attention says a lot about their level of service and it continued after I extended my stay  Everyone from the bottom to the top from porters waiters and housekeeping to upper management  treated us like we were VIPs  As for the hotel itself   Just as other reviewers have mentioned the hotel is beautiful and orated in a contemporary style The standard rooms are comfortable and of a good size  I liked the furniture and or  The hardwood floors are a nice touch and also function well in keeping the room cool  After a long hot day I would love to return to my room and turn on the large flat panel TV while sitting on the comfy bed  Although there are plenty of dining options outside of the hotel the  quotcoffee shopquot located on the lobby level served all our needs and we rarely bothered eating out  It is run very well and the service was excellent during my stay  The wait staff was attentive and always very friendly and the chefs themselves would often drop by to ask how the food was eager for feedback  The breakfast buffet is very nice  its possible that the selection  vary depending on whether or not its tourist season but regardless they offer both continental and Indian fare  The bakery next to the  coffee shop is also nice There are other restaurants in the hotel and I must say that the Baluchi restaurant is great  The food is good and  days a week there is live music performed at night  I would sometimes just go there to listen to the ghazals before turning in for the night The fitness center which is open  hours a day is good and quite exceptional for a hotel  free weights machines including a Smith machine treadmills and bikes as well as a small yogastretching room  Next to the fitness center is the spa and the lovely swimming pool which opened at the beginning of ch The location is excellent  It is not very far from any of the tourist destinations  In fact we could see two historic landks India Gate and Huuns Tomb from our hotel room window  It is within walking distance of the main Connht Place circus and a few other kets  the main Connht Place center as well as the smaller Bengali and Shankar kets  It is also very close to a metro station  All of these are   minute walks from the hotel though there are also plenty of auto rickshaws outside the hotel grounds and along the way if you prefer not to walk Overall this hotel has a lot going for it  I had a great experience and although I had never heard of the Lalit hotel chain prior to my visit I would most certainly wish to stay there again if I return to Delhi  
P => Beautiful Hotel Exceptional Service Great Food I stayed at the Lalit for a week while in Delhi this past spring and would HIGHLY recommend it to any travelers visiting the city  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff was phenomenal  Overall it was without a doubt one of the best hotel experiences Ive had to date   StaffThe Lalits staff is perhaps what sets it apart from other hotels in that they seem to go above and beyond to be hospitable to the hotels guests  Everyone was extremely friendly and always willing to go out of hisher way to ensure that we were properly taken care of during our stay especially the wait staff at the  restaurant downstairs  RoomsAs far as comfort goes the Lalits rooms are what you would expect from any really nice hotel in the US or Europe  What I think set it apart from others was the level of cleanliness immaculate in the room  Also the room we stayed in was beautifully furnished with modern or making it very pleasing from an aesthetic standpoint as well   LocationThe hotel is located very centrally in Delhis Connht Place district  This was great as we were close to many of the main tourist attractions Huuns Tomb India Gate etc  and certainly not far from the others  Given the traffic situation in Delhi this proved to be very advantageous throughout the trip  DiningThere are at least two or three restaurants housed in the hotel however I never ventured beyond its main quot Cafequot where I ate at least two meals each day  The menu is reasonably priced and very extensive offering American Italian Japanese and of course Indian dishes  Perhaps the best part of the restaurant aside from the fact that it is open at all hours was the daily breakfast buffet which offered a wide variety of fresh fruits cheeses pastries cereals eggsomlettes and much much more  Fitness CenterSpaAlso worth noting is the Lalits exceptional fitness center which offers a number of exercise options and wonderful equipment free weights weight machines ellipticals treadmills  Additionally they also offer kickboxing classes as well as yoga  There is also a spa attached though I did not make use of it  PoolJust outside the fitness center is a gorgeous outdoor pool where you can even order food and beverages to snack on while relaxing by the water  
P => Pleasant   the best beds this side of delhi The best bit about the hotel is that even though its in Connht Place its still removed enough from the madness  Its all but  minutes of walking to CP inner circle and path and similar to the metro station  Ideal for the business traveller as much of the Cp business district is like next door Also refreshing was the room though the touch up work was little sketchy at places   leaving much to desire but the rain head shower the bath tub the clear class partition between the room and the washroom   was clam and simple The minibar left much a lot much to desire i mean  cans of soda and two bottles of water please gimme sm more  The most comfortable bit about my room  was the beds   the best beds i have slept in the mattress was divine to say the least soft but just the right amount and the pillows again really nice   i had one of the most comfortable night caps ever in a hotel I tried just a bit of the breakfast and whatever i had was nice   There was some wall patchwork done which was really visible on the bedside and sm of the woodwork needed a new varnish but it was still a really nice stay  Oh just one more thing be be they could have a few more ppl at the front desk i waited a good  minutes before the three could be tend to my checkout which was performed by smone other than the actual front desk staff  
P => Excellent  Star hotel Really first cladd hotel or both business and pleasure Spotlessly clean excelent service  The outdoor pool is perfect  Food is good   especially the choice at buffet breakast so make sure its included in your rate   fresh fruit omeletteseggs cooked to order Japanese   and of course Indian so if youe new to India this is a safe intro to the joys of dosas vadi bhajis uppam etc  The Spa is World class too   but priced accordingly ie its not cheap The newly reated rooms on the upper floors have everythig you could ever need   great bathrooms massive flat screen TV etc Tip use black amp yellow taxis to get around negotiate fixed price   the Lalits own car  be air con   but its also at least  times as expensive  
P => Excellent Hotel in Convenient Part of City Great large Rooms and ovesized modern bathrooms  Nice views as well  Ate at two of the hotel restuarants WOK on the top floor surpassed expectations with excellent food though slow service  The cafe on the rd floor was mediocre at best  Service was excellent throughout our stay  Would definitely recommend the hotel for both business and leisure  
P => Business friendly hotel Good business hotel right in the heart of delhi situated in the CBD of CPBarakhamba road and very close to Barakhamba metro station this hotel smacks of business opulence  I stayed here for almost three months and became and gold member of priority club The deals are normally around k INR per night though it might rise upto k in the busy season it has one of the two heated swimming pools in all of delhi Okish restaurents but the coffee shop has a lavish spread for breakfast  The best thing about this was the quality of the rooms   lots of gadgets transparent glasses for bathroom walls and clean look to the entire place I recommend this  
P => Loved the Bathroom I stayed in the hotel in the month of il   The hotel is magnificent and I have just loved the bathroom which has a glass wall  It is so lovely that it was hard to drag myself away from the bath to the room  It was so hot and busy there I couldnt wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the bath  I was expecting a few nibbles but breakfast is a lovely continental spread with cheeses fruit pastries etc  Quite difficult to fit in any meals out after all that The hotel lobby is splendid with very good or amp ambience   things I would like the hotel to look into  The interiors of the rooms need to be done up  In my room the walls hd some cracks amp patchwork of painitngs were clearly visible which does not shw the hotel in the right perspective   The other thing I would like to highlight is that the hotel still does not have a loyalty program amp no tie ups with any airlines  This is a little bizarre consideing the tough competition that the industry is in   Airport pickups amp drops are charged      this is something weird I found In my view one of the journeys could be charged but not both BUT overall I would say this is probably the best hotel I have stayed in off late  Perhaps not the most convenient if you have business in Gurgaon But if you want to mix of good food service with the odd trip to connht place then this is an absolute mustDo pay heed to my suggestions    Lalit will definitely go a long way in fulfilling Mr  Lalit Suris dreams 
P => Best for Business events   Stay is calm  Staff very good  Excellent place for business events  Food excellent and having real taste of India  Location in middle of Delhi  Airport is just  to  minutes away  
P => nice stay Much more than expected  I went Delhi to attend a national meeting  My company opted me to stay at hotel lalit  The ambience of hotel is very gud  Service is very fast and courteous I liked the food and dining of this hotel very much  
P => Great new location old refurnished classy hotel the Lalit is the newer version of the Old Intercontinental hotel which used to be there  taken over by a new management this hotel is very much up to the k great place to be an absolute  star   ciaoronak 
P => Advantage Location This hotel is in heart of Delhi and is the best in terms of location and logistics The food in all the returants at this place is fingerlicking good The rooms are sufficently large with spacious washrooms The gym and the spa at this place is really good Overall this is a good hotel in the heart of Delhi 
P => Perfect Business Spot It is the perfect Business hotel in the heart of the city  The hotel has a great SPA which you should visit and use the facility  The resturant has a big spread of menu and food is average  Lot of place to hang around near by and shopping too  
P => Loved the new or of hotel Visited this hotel on a business visit and was very pleased with the arrangements  The hotel is just reated and it s a great atmosphere to mix business with pleasures in that hotel  Rooms are very good and I enjoyed the stay  The only problem here is the STAFF not friendly the room service takes a lot of time and most of the time the staff is too confused if you ask them anything they are a bit rude a bit attitude problem I can say  Overall well equipped good food great bar a perfect place for business if they have a better staff  
P => love  i like the overall experience    and moreover i visit  very frequently   im in love with it totally   coz you get liquor there    name suggests all     
P => Good Hotel for a Business Traveller A good quality business hotel in a convenient location with excellent dining options  
P => Better After Reation The Lalit has come up with a New Look after Reation  The Rooms are Much better and location as usual is good Close to many of the offices  The Restaurant is also very nice 
P => Great place Stayed in the presidential suite for  night due to unavailability of space  Rate of  USD per night did not matter since my client was paying It was one of the best experiences of my life  The complementary wine the jacuzzi and the rest of the services were first class  The brekfast was excellent as well  The or was fantastic and the location of the hotel is perfect for access to central New Delhi  Recommended for anyone wanted to stay in an upket place 
P => Dont touch the mini bar Goes without saying I suppose but tired and frazzled after a days travel the thought of a reviving GampT is irresistble until you clock the prices in this hotel   Rfor a gin or other spirit then add tax on top  They know how to charge here  Also beware of the buffet average though it is costs R  You expect excellent service at this price but it took over an hour before I could get into my room as the wrong key card was issued  times  
P => intercontinental touch is missing    While I had been going in this hotel for a while this was part of the priority club and now probably independent and named as Lalit  The intercontinental touch is gone the service level has gone down and I found the people to be more aloof than before  Their breakfast used to be one of the very best and very exhaustive  They were able to amintain that so far however I see people are little disoriented now  The maintanance of their gym and swimming pool is also going poor now  
P => Lalit good value for money The Lalit has been through a major overhaul and the reated rooms are well appointed with large flat TVs glass walled bath and shower area and a huge glass window to give a view of the city Elevators are still being upgraded to the wait is sometimes longer Food was not upto the standards of the old hotel Intercontinental  Breakfast was boring with only one fresh juice and one canned juice option  Usual eggs and sausage no smoked salmon and Indian parathas and dosas etc The mini bar has flavoured water for Rs   which is a total rip off  The hotel only gives you  small bottles of water per day which is not adequate Staff is a bit uncertain at times check out took a long time All in all a good hotel at a modest price in New Delhis Connht Place area  
P => Very good hotel   would recommend it  Just back from a  night stay at The Lalit  Very impressed with the hotel   pick up from airport and check in were very smooth and quick and staff were all very friendly and eager to help  Really good location   very easy to get a taxiauto rickshaw or even walk up to Connht Place  The doormen were always ready to get you a taxi and not push the hotel cars We had two double rooms on the st floor and although you could see the railway line from one room the noise from the trains was very distant and did not bother us at all  The rooms were very well equipped   the only thing lacking was the usual hotel guide although there was a room service menu  The bathroom was very nice but the mini bar was very sparsely stocked   only things in the fridge were one can each of coke and fanta although they did provide  bottles of water every day  Breakfast was very good and we ate at the  lobby restaurant one night which was very nice although the continual repeating chillout music got on your nerves after a while My dhters really enjoyed the pool area   in particular the lovely lounging chairs on the edge of the pool and my eldest and myself used the spa and thoroughly enjoyed it   very reasonably priced too  Wouldnt hesitate to stay there again if in New Delhi  Had a really nice short break on the whole and we were not harrassed half as much as we expected even though my  yr old has long blonde hair and attracted lots of friendly stares and lots of requests for photographs 
P => great breakfast spacious clean room too much noise from trains excellent hotel in terms of cleanliness service quality of food especially at breakfast and safe  However too close to train station so lots of noise all night and day  Good location though  
P => NAIL IN THE MAIN BED  GOT HURT DR IN HOTEL GAVE AN ANTI TITANUS INJECTION nail in the frame of the main bed which hurt me in the leg  a Dr was summoned and who gave an anti titanus injection   later i found other rooms carpertners banging away at the beds as they  have had the same problem also the hotel is too close to a railway station with trains hooting away day and night   
P => Nice Comfortable Hotel Room for Improvement We stayed three nights in total with a wedding party  The hotels or is very impressive and modern  The rooms are comfortable and we had nice views of the city  The breakfast is ent but Ive had better at similar level of hotels The pool area is also newly reated and is very nice  But I almost wished that its indoor because the air in Delhi is just so polluted that it wasnt very enjoyable breathing in all the fumes and pollution while relaxing at the pool The major complaint that I have is on the service  Check in is extremely slow  If there were two or three people in front of you on line be prepared to wait for over  minutes just to check in  We had to check in twice because our three nights were split up and both times we had similar experience Also staff at front desk seem confused sometimes  One time a front desk person actually told me the wrong information regarding hours of the sauna room in the gym area  Another time I wanted to break a large bill and the person sent me down the desk to another area but ended with no one helping me  Despite the hiccups in service it was a comfortable hotel and I would stay here again if I could get a good deal on a room  
P => Luxury Hotel Superb Location Loved It Ive just stayed at the Lalit with my family for  nights in ch   This hotel is definately worth its points  The minute u walk in to the lobby the features and or are very modern  The service was great I couldnt say a bad thing about it the pool area was lovely my kids loved it  Ive stayed in some  star hotels before but this was even better than the ones weve stayed in London  You wouldnt be disappointed I would recommend this hotel to anyone  There was alot of business people around but on our second day there was a few more families  There is a pastry shop in the hotel which is not to badly priced but other than that we ordered drinks at the poolside bar which was very steep  We had breakfast in the  restaurant which was lovely it was probably the best meal my kids had had since we had been in India  There was such a wide range to cater for all  The hotel also had agradin area where daytime shows were on also on the second floor the hotel has a range of boutiques and gift shops  The best thing about the Lalit was the location  It is literally  minute walk from Connht Place  minute car jouirney to the train station and it only took us half an hour in peak time to the Airport  Overall I would say I made a very good choice staying at the Lalit  Id been looking for accomadtion for nearly  months prior to my journey  Having  young children I wanted a nice hotel with a good pool and in a good location  I had firstly booked the Radisson but cancelled last minute due to its location  Lalit was definately very impressive 
P => The Lalit A magnificent surprise in a great Delhi location I spent  days at this hotel in mid  with my wife and son  The hotel was arranged by our Delhi office so I was a little surprised it was not a brand that I recognized    but boy what an absolutely outstanding experience While every aspect of my experience was great with no negatives here are the highlights  The people were the best thing about this hotel     they were warm friendly polished and VERY hospitable  They made us feel really welcome and service was excellent at every place  I thought they had mistaken me for some VIP but my wife and son had the same experience    The rooms were very nice      bright tastefully furnished fairly large and very well equipped    The  restaurant is probably the best quotcoffee shopquot I have experienced     great food served beautifully in a very pleasant setting  The breakfast buffet was outstanding  While we had intended to eat out and try Delhis many restaurants we ended up eating here pretty much all the time     The facility overall was beautiful     it was rich without seeming formal very bright airy beautifully orated with a collection of art by top Indian artists  Its the only hotel I know of that has a full time curator    The location was superb    right in Connht Place in central Delhi  It is hard to find a better location in Delhi  It is close to shopping business government parliament the historic old Delhi the newer monuments etc   Given Delhis traffic congestion that was a major boon  I understand that the hotel has been recently reated which I am sure added to its attractiveness but I have to believe that the outstanding service and flawless operation we experienced was the result of excellent management  And you could see them all over the place all the time  Bottom line a superb hotel we would gladly recommend to our friends  
P => Recently reated but pool is closed  Nicely reated hotel  Good size rooms  Excellent interior or  Somewhat noisy even though our room was on a high floor  The hotel is right at the heart of the city  Dining is open  and breakfast is a tremendous feast  Pool is currently being reated so is closed gym is small but functional  
P => Excellently designed city hotel dismal service We stayed at the Lalit recently on a visit to Delhi  The hotel has a lot of strong points   the design is top notch rooms are spacious comfortable and fitted with high quality and modern finishingsfurnishings   you get what you pay for  The hotel is within walking distance of Connht Place shopping and dining metro stations and even some other sites of interest  The  restaurant downstairs is fantastic offering one of the best selections of food I have seen at a hotel in India  The major let down were the poor response to some of the simply requests we had made such as a packed breakfast water information etc   I was expecting better  Extra services are mostly overpriced and poor in quality as well  Overall the accomodation represents the price you pay in an expensive city like Delhi but they really need to work on their confused disinterested staff  I did not encounter any signs of reation work during my stay  be it is over 
P => Impressed This hotel is now called quotThe Lalit   New Delhiquot I stayed at this hotel for four nights  The hotel was under reation at the time of my stay including rooms and public spaces  I stayed in a recently reated room  The room was very nice  Service throughout my stay was excellent  I ordered room service once excellent and reasonably priced and had multiple meals in the lobby dining area   The breakfast buffet is a ent value although the lunch buffet is very pricey  pp I would definitely stay at this hotel again  
P => Avoidable hotel My experience was similar to that of Isabella  I stayed last week for  nights Lobby and rooms are fine like most economical  stars but the hotel is undergoing major repair and therefore very noisy  Though the management always says that the work is mostly over or they stop work in the night if guests object etc but the fact is throughout the day and night carpenters electricians and masons keep working and stop for  minutes if you object repeatedly and then resume work again which at times is very noisy  Very difficult to find restful sleep in this hotel  Besides the hotel is very close to the train tracks and train make a big siren to keep people away from passing the tracks Staff is a mixed lot some are very polite and some very rude Avoidable hotel  
P => Worth the price   if the price is mid ket My experience was most similar to IsabellaNewYork in her review below  There are some real nice touches in this hotel recently reated rooms are modern and attractive with a big flatscreen TV and funky bathrooms  Also the morning breakfast was very good and I didnt have the service problems that others had  In fact it seems like the staff  have recently had a training course since they were frequently extremely solicitous  I would add that there is also a nice gym on the mezzanene floor that is open  On the other hand this is still a work in progress  I can report that as of late ember the loud bangings associated with continued reations are ongoing though I never experienced it late at night  Also my room like IsabellaNewYorks was on the side with the train station and while I got used to the constant whistles it would be a much better experience on the other side of the building  Having traveld to India in the immediate aftermath of the Mumbai attacks I was able to negotiate a much cheaper rate than TripAdvisor is listing my rate was about  which I think is a very good deal given the high price of business hotels in Delhi and the many near  star ammenities this hotel offers As others have noted this hotel has shed its association with the InterContinental chian and is now called the Lalit New Delhi  All cabbies seem to know it as the InterContinental still however  
P => Really good Hotel This is really excellent hotel with exception they did some works by night and there was more dust on the floor in front of hotel in the morning  I came in Hotel very often early in the morning       oclock and must walking under the wall workers  construction on the other entrance and so on Service was OK food people are very kind  
P => Overpriced The hotel has some great plusses and a few major negatives  Reception staff do not seem able to cope and are quite rude and off hand  Checking in is slow and my luggage took nearly forty minutes to arrive after completing the formalities  The lift service is totally inadequate  I regularly waited over five minutes for a lift to arrive either on the lobby level or on the th floor where my room was located and then it stopped at nearly every floor  The  restauant main cafe style buffet eatery serves excellent food but is very expensive compared to other indian hotels   rip off levels  The bedroom was superb with every comfort imaginable and excellent bathroom  Good location but the overall package could be so much better  
P => Nice stay The hotel has been recently reated  The new look is very contemporary  Our stay was great the rooms have a very modern look  The front facing rooms have a beautiful views  The bathrooms are very spacious  The restaurants especially  and Baluchi are very good  
P => Problematic hotel with potential Service in this hotel is hit and miss  Sometimes excellent and friendly sometimes incompetent and rude  Overall the hotel definitely has a long way to go to provide a consistent  star experience  Room was nice and very modern with flat screen TV and a futuristic bathroom  Room had absurdly loud noise coming from a nearby commuter railway station  Trains were making piercing signals at all hours to warn people off the tracks  Have never experienced such noise levels in a hotel room despite years of travelling around Asia  If you stay in this hotel make sure to get a room away from the railway stationHotel is  minutes walking distance from Connht Place a big shopping area that is dirty and has been aying for ades  The area is nevertheless popular with tourists and has a couple of ent restaurants A couple of nights I was woken up around  am from loud banging that went on for a couple of hours extensive reation work is going on in the hotel at all hours Breakfasts were excellent  Nice bright restaurant and wide food selection  Staff sometimes seem tired and unmotivated  Getting a coffee refill is often a challenge Dinner in the same restaurant was a depressing affair  When I pointed out that a particular vegetable was missing from the pizza despite being mentioned on the menu the waiter silently took the plate away  He returned about seven minutes later having added the missing vegetables on the original dish  The pizza by now was cold and even less appetizing  Another time a salad in the main restaurant was mediocre Room service was disappointing to say the least  quotGrilled vegetablesquot turned out to be an unappetizing soup like dish that was inedible  A sandwich was soggy an also unappetizing  Coffee was so weak it looked like weak tea  It is very hard to believe that any professionally trained chef could have had any hand in this food fiascoInternet in the room is horrendously expensive at   rupees including tax more than  USD  The login process is clunky and sometimes problematic Elevators are often malfunctioning and there are often long waiting times Indian newspapers have reported that starting next year this hotel will no longer be part of the Intercontinental chain  
P => Exellent hotel This is a very good quality hotel excellent facilities huge beautiful rooms very clean spectacular breakfasts good restaurants good service very safe knowledgeable staff  Would definitely go there again  
P => under reation for at least one month or two  We booked in this hotel for  nights in ust to have some restfrom busy india during ust in delhi choose a hotel with swimming pool if possible its so hot Well the reservation office forgot to tell us that the whole building and swimming was under reation that means dust and noise we chose a standard room they gave us a suite but when the door lift opened clouds of dust and noise invaded the corridor it was like a joke movie     we ran away from the hotelI wouldnt recommend this hotel for its lack of information or sincerity    
P => Best value  good  hotel in Delhi great gym  The intercontinental is my hotel of choice for Delhi  In an expensive city it offers good value  As already noted the reations are not too disturbing The rooms are fantastic and the hotels best feature  Most if not all have plasma tvs and great bathrooms  The gymspa is fantastic and a great way to finish the day  The restaurant is also excellent open  hours and experienced this by ordering a steak at am   perfect and the bars offer a wide choice  The location is brilliant and if you dont want to pay c   this is a great option  
P => Beware of the reations Stayed at this hotel for a couple of days RampR and sightseeing at the end of a business trip in the region and have to say I was disappointed The location of the hotel is great on the edge of the Government district of new Delhi but within very easy walking distance of Connht Place   but the quality did not live up to my expectations of an Inter continental The main thing to frustrate me was that the hotel is currently in the midst of major reations  The lobby is reduced to being a corridor   some of the lifts are out of action and significantly the pool and surrounding area is completely a building site  The pool is to be closed for   months apparently  Hammering and drills started at  in the morning and carried on until late at night  Worst of all however   even though I only booked   weeks before travle I was told none of this and there was no mention on the hotel website I did stay in one of the reated rooms and it was very nice if slightly small but there were clearly teething problems  My broadband wouldnt work so I had to call a guy to come and set me up with a arate connection each time I needed to go on line  And the cost of the broadband was extortionate The hour restaurant was unaffected by the reation but the food was ok at best   breakfast was a big disappointment  Room service was polite and prompt with a good selection but again food quality was average at best In sumy great central location with the potential to be great   but get the reations out the way first and then expect to pay over the odds for average food and service 
P => The Level of Service is Impressive I am on a PC points stay at this property  As an Royal Ambassador this is the best value in the system  The level of service and attention to detail is extrordinary  My sense is tht they deeply care about the people staying at the hotel  Because I am here for medical reasons the location of this hotel is ideal     blocks from Bengali ket   Blocks from connht place The renated rooms are very nice if you dont want a suite  I would opt for an executive suite or luxury suite in the Presidential tower  I stayed  nights in   Very quiet  looks over the pool now close d for renation  But the two luxury suites on the st floor are good for sleeping  Room  has a great view of the cricket fields at the Modern school and the view wraps around  Its pretty spectacular If you are an PC Ambassador the club lounge has breakfast   tea   and cocktails    It is on the th floor right below   The st floor presidential rooms have no one on top of you  They are very quiet  but not yet renated The elevators are under wraps right now so sometimes you might have to wait  But the new spa steam room suana and gym portend a bright future for this property once it is completely renated  
P => Comfortable stay  Stayed at quotThe Grandquot from th to th   We had travelled up from Goa and looked forward to our first trip to Delhi  I had pre paid for the room and check in was efficient and professional  I requested a reated room and was given a beautifully apointed room on the th floor  Rm   The room was very confortable and you can request harder pillow if the soft pillows are not to your liking  I was already aware of the ongoing reations but wasnt aware that the pool is also closed  It didnt affect our stay as the visit was short  We availed of the buffet meals every day and the quality was excellent if not a little expensive by Indian standards  The location is excellent and it is only a short walk to Connht Place  We also walked to India Gate  Taxis are easy to to arrange with the consierge staff  The only quotnot so positivequot incident happened at checkout  I was given my bill and the hotel had again charged me for the accomodation that I had already pre paid  I didnt notice until I had left the desk  I returned to the desk and pointed out the error  The situation was recitified but it was done with a grimace from the desk  I was not offered an apology or an explanation  However I have booked again to stay from rd to the th e   I would recommend this hotel if you are visiting Delhi  The reations are hardly noticable and the staff are generally professional and helpful Ken Brydon and PJ Hogan 
P => In spite of ongoing reations   a class hotel Over the past several years I have stayed at the Grand on at least five occasions   and if it was as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be I would not have stayed there as often as I did  In fact for New Delhi it is very good  I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza Friends Colony Le Meridien the Maurya Sheraton and the Imperial and for comfort value and service it is the equal of all but the Imperial which I rate as one of the worlds great hotels  The reated club rooms are superb No doubt it is expensive nearly  a night for a reated club during a high demand period during an international trade fair but similar hotels in New Delhi are even more expensive  When I visited the hotel was still undergoing reations   the lobby was restrictive and the pool closed  However other than that there were no impositions on the guests  The Indian restaurant Baluchi on the third floor was superb and good value for a  star hotel in New Delhi  The Chinese Restaurant on the roof top was disappointing  The  bar in the lobby has gone modern glass and clean lines and not to my taste   I preferred the old Champions Sports Bar which it replaced  Having said that it is a good watering hole excellent service good selection of drinks and best of all open  hours a day For the business traveller this is a very good hotel   good rooms reated ones good service and good location  I would also recommend this hotel for the tourist especially if they can get a discounted rate  A very satisfactory hotel indeed  
P => Good for business travellers and tourist This hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Delhi  Facilities are good even if at the present time  some refurbishing work is causing some limited access to the lobby  I have used the internal travel agency to arrange a one day tour of the town and I have been very pleased of the service offered  I paid  rupees  for a full day group tour it turned out that the group was only a party of three and the guide was excellent he spoke a good english was very well prepared and ready to answer any question  I have also tried two internal restuarants offereng respectively indian and chinese food  A little bit pricey  for a good dinner without wine but still acceptable  Main negative point is the noise from the nearby railway line quite loud Overall I can recommend this hotel to both business travellers and tourists  
P => Not worth the high cost The hotel is undergoing some major construction  The lobby is not really a lobby with the construction going on  The taxi and rickshaw drivers have a tough time finding this place for some reason  We were put in a room that is not reated yet  It was ok but the reated section looks so much better  The rooms are very spacious  The hotel seems to be more of a business type hotel  It just didnt justify the price we paid for it The concerige service is not very helpful and quite unfriendly  The room service and restaurants are very good  Everything I ordered was very tasty  I dont think I would stay here again  
P => Fantastic After reading the mixed reviews on here I had fairly low expectations about this hotel  In fact it was a fantastic surprise  The reation works continue but are now of minimum disruption and the newly refurbished areas are really great with very modern and cool design  The reception area was not completely finished although even here you can see how good its going to look  We were given one of the refurbished rooms on the st floor and it was very cool with great piture window modern interior design giant LCD TV and DVD cool bathroom with erate rainshower The heated useful in uary outdoor swimming pool on one of the hotels roofs is a real bonus as its wonderful to escape to this tranquil space in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Delhi city centre  It was dissapointing that the spa was more or less out of service with just some basic facilities available  The hotels website is kept up to date with what is and is not available during the works though The Grill restaurant on the top floor has a great menu and theyre happy to make something off menu for you if you ask  The qualitys great  Breakfasts also top notch  I stayed in the Taj Palace a few weeks earlier and much prefered the Intercontinental Grand  Its much cooler has more buzz and a better location all for a similar price  
P => Expensive   night   in Indian comparison This place is way too expensive by India comparison  And by international comparison as well  Even in Tokyo you can stay at cheaper price and with more comforts LOCATIONNote that there is anotehr The Grand New Delhi in the city as well  This place has nothing to do with Intercontinental The Grand  Taxi driver  have problems finding this place even though it is supposedly centrally located  So have the address at hand  And even if you have the address taxies  not find the place  Intercontineltal The Grand states it is on the akhambra Avenue off Connht Place  In reality it is some  metres from Connht Place and not on akhambra Avenue but on a small side street off it and next to the highway and very close to the railway  You can here the trains passing by in rooms facing east ROOMSStay away of the old rooms at all cost  The new rooms are very very nice see prictures  However at over   per night these are way too expensive  Especially by international comparison  Furthermore hotels on Jampath are more centrally located   and some of them cheaper HOTEL PREMISESThe lobby area was undergoing a major refurbisment in ember   Check in facilities were crammed to one corner while the whole otherwise big lobby was closed off for reations  Pool area is a serous need of reation as well  Gladly the pool was heated  Restaurant on the ground floor is of international standard   but at similar of even higher prices RECOMMEDATIONInstead of the big international names I would look for a  star Indian operated place close to Jampath  Youd get more value for you money   at a fraction of the cost  
P => Short stay in a flash one The room rate was extortionate USnight plus taxes but the room was incredible  How the team here made a small room into a masterpiece of open space architecture is incredible  The illusion of a large room is great  If you are a Hotel Architect go here and check out the magic Very impressed with the small things too like International Power Plugs as standardThe reations down stairs were still on and that also affected the Gym setting  The pool meshed over is an interesting concept but it does not keep out the smog The breakfast setting was stunning and the ground floor restaurant is brilliant  There is tons of choice for food at breakfast here Loved it   except for the room rateProsBest room setting for standard hotelBreakfastService was exceptional in all aspectsConsRoom price 
P => The Intercontinental The Grand Delhi We stayed at the Intercontinental during a short business trip intending to stay longer when the trip was ended but we changed our minds  The new rooms are big and have a glass walled see through bathroom but not a single mirror lit properly to apply make up in my case or shave in my husbands case  too trendy by half  A plasma screen TV not programmed in in either room we stayed in  The main problem alongside the constant reation is that there is no ent outside space The terrace by the dining room could be nice but has an extractor fan from the kitchen fed directly onto it and the poolside is grubby and meshed over and is not welcoming  For a business stay make it short and for a holiday go to a hotel with an outside space or a garden Ask for a room overlooking the pool   otherwise the railway station keeps you awake all night  
P => Great Stay I was in new Delhi for business and stayed at the Intercontinental Grand  I think that this hotel is great I was upgraded to a Club Room with free breakfast  I love the contemporary feel of the Intercontinental  Although it is undergoing reations my stay was very comfortable  Staff are great and I have really nothing to complain about  The chauffered mercedez car that we hired from the hotel for  days also made our journey through meetings in New Delhi very easy and the driver has great knowledge of the area  He brought us to interesting tourist areas in between our meetings  The Wok restaurant at the  level has amazing food  The breakfast served at quotquot restaurant was adequate  
P => Rip of After reading other reviews I got a reated room so far so good  The oration is Ok for a  star hotel  Service I received was only  star class worth for exemple the shower was not ounes cleaned during my stay also they never vacuumed the room  The breakfast was very basic  The rate for such hotel  service is a real rip of  
P => On its way up  I stayed at the Intercontinental   The Grand last week for  mights while in Delhi on business  Its the second time Ive stayed in this hotel the first time was about   years ago and its definately improving A few words of warning  The hotel is currently under renation and so the lobby is a real mess  Its all boarded up and there is no where to sit  They told me that  of the rooms have already been renated and I was upgraded from a regular king room to a quotclubquot room  From my room I wasnt disturbed by the noise of the renations but the smell of paint in the lobby is almost overwhelming  They also told me renations will be complete by ch  so keep all this in mind I remember from the last time I was there the rooms were typical Indian old style carpet on the floors and classic furniture  They were nice rooms but they were nothing fancy  Certainly well below what you would expect from an Intercontinental  But the renated rooms are absolutely superb  Parquet floors a bed that was on par with Shangrila beds which are my usual favorite modern orations a quot plasma TV and a fantastic bathroom with a arate bath and a huge rain shower  The bathroom has glass walls so you can watch CNN while youre in the shower or on the loo  I have to say the room was trully  star  There was also a nice big desk and a comfortable office chair the same one that is pretty much standard for Intercontinental  One gripe the internet connection was good but very expensive  After tax it was  rupees about  euros for  hours which is ridiculous I ate the buffet in the  cafe  The caferestaurant itself has been fully reated and is very nice  The food was excellent but typically expensive   about  rupees for lunch or dinner per person  Service was excellent The gym was a bit of a dissapointment   very small and no eliptical cross trainer  Hopefully that will also eventually be changed  Location is good very central in Delhi Overall the hotel is definately going in the right direction  Its well on its way to a genuine Intercontinental standard  One note Hotels in New Delhi are INSANELY over priced  I paid  rupees per night including the luxury tax which was the lowest rate I could find in any ent hotel in New Delhi  When you compare the room I had with rooms at the Park or the Metropolitan or even the Le Meridien where the rooms were even more expensive I rate this hotel as excellent value all things considered  
P => watch the phone calls Watched the phone calls   They rip you stupid in this hotel I got charged a    luxury tax on REVERSE charge international calls that NOONE answered at the other end Paid  rupee for a total of  min of calls Breakfast buffet was pretty good and rooms are very nice but the views are horrible  
P => nice rooms  This hotel is very old  There is some construction going on so you might find it a little annoying  Restaurnants and bar are disappointing and pricy  I paid night which I consider as a really good deal since hotels in Delhi tend to be very expensive  Service was excellent and my room was very well orated and clean  They have DVD players in each room  I brought some DVDs and watched all of them Internet access is expensive  I paid Rs hrs about USD  Most nice hotels in the U S  charge  day so this is absolutely a lot  Location is ok  Its quite far to Connht place to walk  But you can always take the subwayonly one stop to Connht place or taxi  
P => Grand Ripoff Ideal location and earnest labor staff aside the hotel is poorly managed ridiculously expensive and oddly designed Poor management   Power outages are a norm  Electrical issues in rooms  Missed wakeup call  Uncoordinated reception staffRidiculously Expensive  laundry bill for  tshirt  track suite pair of socks and undershirt was Rs       Criminal   Internet per day is  Rs    Again outrageous   Cheaper room are in construction areas    avoid unless you like the smell of varnish and paint and the noise of a hammerOdd Design  trying to be post modern without following basic design principles  oddest shower stall i have seen  no room to put away clothes  ac that makes certain areas too cold and the rest of room not as coldEarnest Labor Staff  Not the well dressed reception area staff who are mostly incompetent but the poorly paid room service staff and the engineering labor staff All in all a hotel that pretends to be something that it isnt and probably doesnt know and doesnt care  For the money you have to pay there are surely better deals in New Delhi  
P => Good business hotel in city center This InterContinental property is managed and run by an Indian hotel group which owns quotThe Grandquot brand in India  The hotel is very centrally located if you are on business at Delhi  The recently reated rooms are great   especially those in the executive floor  A glass walled bathroom big size plasma tv good bedding comfortable work desk and top of the line amenities makes the room experience satisfying  The executive lounge is great with nice range of drinks and some finger foods  A good place to socialize and do quick business meetings  The breakfast is good   both on spread as well as on quality  The hotel is undergoing a reation which can cause some minor disturbance especially the noise during your stay  I would recommend this hotel only for those who needs a hotel close to city center  If you are okay with any place in Delhi you  find a better hotel at a much better price  
P => Charmless but the hotel is going through reation The hotel is currently being reated ask for one of they reated bedroom which are very nice preferably facing the pool and not facing the train station as it can be very very noisy Rooms and restaurant are quite expensive and in my opinion is not worth it  It might be when the hotel will be fully reated currently there is no terasse to enjoy a drink in the evening or have your diner  The bar is pretty horrible undergoound loud western music big screen tv smoky  All in all it is charmless although my bedroom was nice  I was meant to stay  weeks    a night  I stayed one week and moved to the Imperial for the same price booked on the net which is just FANTASTIC  If you want to spend this sort of money in a hotel do not chose the Grand or at least not before it is fully reated  
P => Nice  star hotel in a not so nice area  I was going to India for a week and was terrified to read the reviews of the hotels in Delhi  They all said the hotels were expensive and below par  Well this hotel was very expensive but I have to say it was a solid  star hotel  Everything about it was great including the pool bar and restaurant  The only bad thing I can say about the hotel staff is that the doorman who is a large turbine headed man would give me dirty looks when I gave him a  rupee tip for getting me a cab  I though this as uncalled for since the I was told the daily wage in Delhi for a laborer is  rupees a day  The hotel restaurant was very expensive with dinner buffet costing about  US  But the food was outstanding with a wide variety of continental and Indian foods  So I ate there more than once and enjoyed it The hall on my floor did smell of insecticide but on the positive note there were no insects  The hotel states that it is on Conneaut Circle which is the center of Delhi  Well it is not on the Circle but about a mile from it  And with the beggars hawkers and traffic it is only walk able during the day if you have some courage  But it is not walkable at night  And the problem of getting one of the taxis is that I found them quite unreliable with them taking me constantly to their shops or just out of the way  And another point is that once you are in Conneaut Circle there is not much there aside from more beggars and hawkers  I found one ent coffee shop and no restaurants  So if you stay at the hotel don t think that you will be walking out and be in the center of a cosmopolitan Mecca  
P => Noisy and beware the reations Checked in the afternoon after travelling for  hrs and got allocatted a smoking room which reeked of smoke  The room was shabby and needed a complete make over  After complaining and requesting non smoking room were offered a room quotnewly reatedquot   Minimalist with a nice plasma screen  Nobody mentioned the fact that the floors service area was still being reated which was opposite our room Needing some shut eye the constant banging and knocking kept us awake  After calling reception and the duty manager around pm quotI will tell them to stop immediatelyquot  The banging continued for another  hrs  Also the room was at the back of the hotel facing the railway station so between the tooting of the trains throughout the night and the banging during the day we got very little sleep over the  nights we spent there  This impacted on the business meetings we had as we kept on dozing offBeing quotnewly reatedquot the bar fridge didnt work fixed after five attempts by handymen the hand basin didnt drain and there was a big gap in the ceiling above the shower rose  It seems that these details were not a problem with the front staff as nobody bothered to fix it even after complaining  There were some big conferences on at the time so the hotel was quite full explained the attitude of some of the front desk staff The food at the breakfast buffet was OK but it was better to choose from the a la carte menu for dinner  Beware of the add on charges  We were quoted U  for  hrs of access to internet using wi fi to which was added a service charge government tax as well as a luxury charge so ended up paying   more  Cheaper at the internet cafe near the hotel If you do stay at the hotel ask for a reated roon away from the railway station and certainly not where they are reating  
P => Okay hotel but nothing special be overpriced I was here for just one day but I must say that the hotel needs some upgrading  The rooms were perfect but the lobbyreception could use some upgrading  The staff at the reception is very slow and inefficient  The restaurant is nice  Swimming pool closes too early  Location is fine  Make sure youre minibar is filled with all the things that should be in there Breakfast in business lounge is rather limited I think  For the rest it is ok but probably a bit overprices as all hotels in Delhi  
P => OK Hotel I was somewhat cautious when I stayed here after reading the reviews but we had no problems at all  I was travelling with  other work colleagues and this hotel met our needs just fine  The room was very quiet aside from the occasional train tooting but I had specifically asked for a quiet room and I liked the large plasma TV in my room  Actually a colleague on the higher floor more expensive only had a normal Tv Location is near Connht place which is relativly central  The Bathroom was a little dark and the bath tub had a stain in it  But overall for the price etc I was satisfied with his hotel plus I only slept and ate breakfast here of which I liked the freshly cookedwaffles a lot  But avoid breakfast rushhour on Sunday around am too many people 
P => Grander than we thought We stayed at the Intercontinental Grand New Delhi during uary  On arrival we got a   greeting at the door  This was our first time in Delhi so we had no idea what to expect and having read previous reviews on this hotel was a little daunted that it was part of our package  We loved it  Yes there is building work going on so there is some noise at times  The rooms are being updated to reflect the trend in contemporary d cor  The views aren t great but even if they were the smog is so thick you probably couldn t enjoy them anywayWe were on floor  with views of the railway station and the highway with its constant horn blowing  It was fun watching the local life and the horns are part of the experience just like in New York but louder longer and more frequentIn our deluxe room we had a super king bed  The sheets and duvet were wonderful cool smooth cotton of very high quality  It was really comfortable  The bathroom was a little tired so I think this room was awaiting reoration but it was still clean with mountains of fresh fluffy clean towels  Strangely there was only one robe and one pair of slippers  There was all you could want   shampoo body lotion conditioner soap shoe shiner comb toothbrush kit shave kit and vanity kit  There was a safe hairdryer iron and board a well stocked reasonably priced mini bar and tea amp coffee making facilities  A great little perk was the complimentary provision of  litres of mineral water daily  The Delhi news was also delivered daily printed in English The food in the hotel was excellent we never had a bad meal any upset tummies Champions bar was brilliant  A never ending range of international drinks were available and good food  Here superb entertainment was provided by a four piece live band covering some of the best oldies  The drummer does The Eagles amp Chris Rear brilliantly and a female singer who could sing Karen Carpenter and Sade  If you weren t watching you d have swore they were the real thing   AwesomeBaluchis is the Indian Restaurant  We ate here for one lunch and one dinner during our  nights and found it faultless  The service and food was excellent  Tell them what you normally eat back home and they ll advise on what you might like to order Rendevous is the international buffet  The choice here was enormous  Ranging from continental Indian Chinese amp Japanese  The desserts were to die for  Tiny slices and portions so you could have more than one at a time   great to try all the different flavours  Rendevous is also where the buffet breakfast was served again loads of choice for all nationalities We didn t eat at Art tion but it is at pool level on the nd floor serving snacks such as Nachos club sandwich etc  There s a great pool if you get time to use it Also on Floor  is a jeweller  He was very happy to do a deal very friendly and spoke brilliant English Taxis and guides are always keen to take you to government shops  These are small malls where Indian handicrafts such as carpets fabrics scarves jewellery etc are sold  If you buy carpet furniture etc the government will pay to send it back home for you  I then later read in  rough guide  that there are fake government shops and whoever takes you there gets commission on your sale so beware if this will bother you All in all a satisfactory stay was had  The service was good the rooms were more than comfortable with lots of amenities and the food excellent   what more could you want 
P => Loud hotel with unprofessional personnel Intercontinental Grand in New Delhi is a huge  stories hotel with no soul  They reated a few rooms on the different floors they look good but all the other  old and smelly  Carpets smell so bad you cant even imagine And hotel located just next to railway station with trains departing every minute And next to the main road  As you might know Indian drivers horn all the time traffic never stops in Delhi so it is just inpossible to sleep without strong earplugs  We were in  different rooms until we found something quiet  Restaurant is ok it is safe to eat there  Hotel has an army of personnel they have a quard on every floor tonns of concierges and receptionists and they all want money They grab your bags and then tell you that you should pay them  Unbelievable 
P => Loved It After reading all the reviews I left London with a heavy heart  The last time I was in Delhi was  years ago and we stayed at this hotel and had a great time  But I have to say that the service we received was impeccable  We did stay in the Club rooms which were pricey but we wanted comfort  The rooms were great  The breakfasts in the morning were superb the pickups were a great service and we were very happy  The location is wonderful and we were able to get around very easily  I would definitely come here again once we have saved up some money of course 
P => Expensive but shabby We just got back from a stay here  Location was pretty good but the hotel is way too expensive for what you get  We paid night including a  nd person fee  As other postings note hotel is being renated and is noisy  hours a day  Rooms are drab as are the common areas in the hotel  
P => Worst hotel ever Just stayed at this hotel for three nights and what a dump  A mausoleum   shabby old dated staid run down  The check in staff are useless   half an hour to check me out and still errors on the bill  The rooms are old dated and very dirty  The shower fell to pieces  Dont even think about the restaurant  The bar is dark and dingy and completely void of any atmosphere  The hotel has a pool which is used by pigeons and everthingone gets pigeon excreta on them  Just dont stay here                   
P => Stay somewhere else Stayed in this hotel while in India for two weeks on business and it was not a pleasant experience  There are major reations going on in the hotel which means that you can expect to be kept awake by the hammering and drilling until well past  at night  Complaints to reception wont get you anywhere Internet connection is available for  minutes  hour  hours or  hours  You cannot simply ask to be connected for the duration of your stay  Even when you get connected it is often very slow or occasionally drops the signal Everything in the hotel is ridiculously overpriced   a buffet breakfast will set you back  rupees  And dont even consider wine with dinner unless you fancy spending  rupees on the cheapest bottle  Wine that would be  euro max in another hotel   in another country   will set you back  euro here The rooms were clean but drab and dull  In the bathroom the taps were water stained and rusting in places  And from my room at least there was no view to speak of Hotel staff were generally very friendly   especially in the restaurants  And the food was pretty good If you are looking for a place to stay for a couple of nights then this hotel would be fine but pricey but any more than that and I would say stay somewhere else  And if you want value for money you wont find it here  
P => Very disappointing stay I have just spent a week in the Intercontinental Grand New Delhi  A very tired and ugly looking hotel  The rooms havent been refurbished for a long time  There was building work going on hours a day in a lift shaft near my room which kept me awake every night  The Chinese restaurant on the top floor has closed down and on both nights when I went to the other restaurant on the top floor I found I was the only person dining in there  The swimming pool has a net covering it to keep birds out except a dozen pigeons were trapped inside the netting flying around  The hotel is in a run down area of the city close to a highway and railway station with trains running through hours a day sounding their horns as they pass the station which is clearly audible from your room  Very annoying at am Then on the last night I was woken by maintenance at am to fix the lock on my door which I hadnt even reported broken And to make matters worse my airport taxi hadnt been booked and when the porters finally arranged one the driver didnt know his way to the airport All this at a cost of over  for nights There are much better hotels in Delhi for cheaper I wouldn t even bother considering this hotel 
P => Worst hotel I ever stayed in I wish I could give it a zero instead of one point  This place is absolutely crap  I got billed   plus in two days of stay including food  The room was nothing to write home about   the cushions had stains on them from overuse  The bathroom was absolute rubbish  The service was poor  The staff seemed pretty clueless most of the time  They couldnt arrange a taxi for me and kept me waiting for half an hour  And I had a horrible view of a train platform from my window  Nothing to write home about in terms of views  I will never never stay there again  
P => solid hotel My boyfriend and I stayed here for  nights in il as a starting point for a  week jaunt through the north of India  I chose this hotel because we wanted something close to Connht Place and we wanted a good chain  I was under the impression that being near C  P  would be convenient and we could walk there  But really in retrospect its not necessary  You can stay in a hotel that is further away and really not miss any centrality because you cant walk anywhere It is too dirty and overwhelming so you will wind up in a cab which cost us  for  hours and the driver waited for us while went to eat shop etc  The hotel is beautiful and our room was great  They upgraded us to a ior suite and the view was stunning  However all of Delhi smells due to the pollution and this extends into the hotel  I also think that the water they use to mop and in the fountains are really contaminated and smell horrible  But aestetically and service wise the hotel was great  Also fyi they charge you some ridiculous luxury tax in Delhi this is typical of every hotel We ate at the buffet for breakfast and dinner  night and didnt find it to be anything to write home about  The bar food on the other hand was yummy We had the chicken tikka massala and it was delicious  We ate in Zen in C P  a chinese restaurant and it was excellent also  We went to a restaurant in G K I ket when we returned to Delhi sorry dont remember the name but its the only one there and that was the best one We thought that the hotel was beautiful  We wanted to use the pool but were absolutely exhausted and passed out on the st day after sightseeing  which by the way we got the cab driver for  for the whole day and he took us everywhere  So bargain with the driver when you get in  I hope this helps  I must say that the hotels in India were really expensive given that it is a developing country and how cheap everything else was Also we work for an airline and travel a lot just to give you an idea  We also stayed at the Taj Palace when we were returning so you can check out that write up also  
P => ent Hotel not great value New Delhi hotels are expensive and overpriced thats standard  Lack of competition and a shortage of anything    keeps the prices of   hotels at a premium  You either go   or take a risk with a     which other reviews show can be a very quothit or missquot affair Intercontinental Grand is in a good location very close to Connht Place I stayed in a club room which included breakfast and evening canapes beer tea and coffee all day etc   If you get a good deal its worth doing for a few dollars extra  Room was fine bathroom a little tired with a few burn stains in the bath  Service was ok with housekeeping giving you extra complimentary waters for a few rupees tip  Swimming pool was quite good smallish but gets the afternoon sun  Only ate in the hotel on my last night before travelling onwards got quotDelhi Bellyquot after a meal at the hotels specialist Indian restaurant which annoyed me intensely On the whole a ent hotel but poor value compared to others you might have stayed at  
P => Grand is only so   so I stayed at the Intercontinental Grand for  days during the beginning of ch   The hotel was average in general certainly not up to the standards of what you would expect from InterContinental  They were prompt in picking me up from the airport late at night an extra  charge and they were always helpful and quick with requests for extra towels etc  The rooms were dissapointing and I expected more for The usd I paid per night  A   tax was also added to all room charges but this would have been added to any hotel in the Delhi area  While in Delhi I read several articles in the local paper regarding the severe shortage of hotel rooms in the city  This is probably why they can get away with charging so much and offering so little  The room itself was tired and dated  The fuse for the lights blew when the bedside lamps were turned on the same time the blow dryer if you could call it that was on  The carpet was dirty and the shower curtain showed signs of mold growing on it  On the plus side they did have duvet covers on the bed and not just a sheet and blanket  They did offer wireless internet access although it was a bit pricy  per  minutes  The breakfast buffet was good and had several western style dishes available  There was a great pastry shop in the lobby and they brought unlimited complementary bottled water to to the room  The travel desk run by a different company located on the second floor was terrible  We bought plane tickets and paid for them only to show up at the airport and learn that they had been canceled by the travel agency and the money refunded to them  There are two very good although very pricy restraunts on the top floor  The location of the hotel was a plus if you need to be in the center of the downtown  Only a  minute walk from Connht Place and the main downtown area  I was in town for a convention and talked with several people who were staying at other similar hotels in Delhi  The general conclusion is expect to pay outrageous prices for any  star hotel in Delhi and expect to be dissapointed by what you get for the money  
P => Horrible Hotel I put a group up in this hotel for a few nights this ruary and all participants hated it  First off the concierges and check in staff were rude and impatient not to mention the fact that we were guaranteed better service if a male did transactions  The gender bias was appalling and embarrassing  Secondly several people had plumbing or foul odour problems with their rooms and although we paid for a higher grade of accomodations they simply refused to give them to us as they had overbooked  Something I later found out they are notorious for  For the cost of their rooms they are simply not worth it  Period  Rooms are slightly run down with somewhat shabby bathrooms  They do have lots of shops restaurant choices and a beauty salon  Overall the establishment is overwhelmingly large and comes with all the unfortunate problems usually associated with such a size  You will wait in long cues at the front desk receive offhand customer service and eat mediocre food  There really is nothing special about this hotel so unless you are using its facilities for business you are better off elsewhere  
P => Good choice Wont be the best  star that you ever stay in but it is a good choice for a few days in Delhi  The staff were helpful and the service generally was pretty good  The rooms were a bit dark and could do with some freshening but they were functional and comfortable  We stayed in a Club Room and found complimentary water chocolates and cookies waiting for us on our arrival  Breakfast is good  One tip if the main breakfast area is busy is to go to Woks restaurant on the first floor  Same breakfast lots of eager waiters absolutely no other guests     
P => overrated hotel Stayed here earlier this month  Hotel is centrally located and has spacious rooms with big beds and some excellent dining options  However rooms look a bit tired and bathroom carpet and linen are not very clean  At the time of check out the hotel clerk unjustly claimed that my travel agent hadnt made full payment for the room and forced me to sign an unspecified check  Since I had only half an hour to catch my train I had no option  My travel agent has lodged a complaint with the hotel  All in all a bit disappointing for a hotel that charged me  dollar a night  
P => good centrally located hotel This hotel is a good   hotel centrally located in the heart of Delhi  While not the quotbestquot   in the city it is not the most expensive either  It has most things that a traveler looks for including a variety of restaurants though the service could be stepped up small shops business centre large rooms and courteous staff  Would recommend as far as the big chains go  
P => Reasonable

P => Incredible hotel incredible service incredible food If you are looking for a smaller hotel with amazing customer service and mouthwatering food   The Manor is your place  The staff at the hotel were very attentive and catered to each and every one of our needs  We dined at Indian accent which was one of the best dining experiences of my life  The food was out of this world   so inative   I would say it is Indian food like its never been eaten before   There is a large area outside the restaurant where you can sit and enjoy good food and fine wine or just unwind with friends  Soft music plays and gentle lighting creating a very relaxing ambience  The rooms were spacy and clean and service was incredible  I would definitely recommend this to others who visit the city  I have stayed at the Sheraton Taj and Oberoi   and interestingly I have found that my experience at The Manor was by far the best  
P => A quiet oasis in a busy city At the end of your trip through India we treated us with a stay in The Manor The service the design the nice location exceeded what we had expectedWe felt at home immediately The restaurant also needs to be mentioned since the food was really excellent and delicious  
P => a true boutique property The Manor is a quottruequot boutique hotel The biggest attraction is the personalized service a warmth which is so missing in  star hotels  Its a small  room property set in a bunglow with nice green lawns  The interiors were very pleasing   contemporary with igold flowers placed interestingly adding a beautiful Indian touch The staff were so helpful in getting us all organized for our trip to Jaipur and then Agra  To be honest it was such a welcome change experiencing true hospitality   and the food was absolutely divine The restaurant there is an essential stop for every foodie  We had no idea that Indian food could ever be like this  We would definitely recommend this hotel 
P => The facility is a wreck beneath the surface Dont do this unless you have some assurance of change  Hot water and Internet did not work water from AC was over floor the foot massage offered is for a mere  minutes and the is very expensive  The staff is very kind but they cant fix a bad building  Sparks flew from the electrical outlet when I tried to charge my phone  This place could have ruined my trip if I had let it  Very large construction project right next door which is just beginning  Great location and room size was good  
P => Congratulations Trip Advisor   Great Hotel Well done trip advisor  Chose this hotel solely on your recommendation and it is great Staff genuinely friendly  But the food in the restaurant is wonderful  Really is out of this world  Only staying three nights and then moving on to the quotPalace on Wheelsquot but the Manor would encourage me to return to Delhi  And they also have a travel service to drive you round and see the sights  
P => At best an average hotel but great staff Had high expectations of this hotel given its tripadvisor ratings  In fact we also stayed at Amber rated nd and the Imperial rated  during this trip to Delhi  Although I have never been let down by tripadvisor in the past on this instance I was disappointed  It  have been because it followed an impeccable and faultless stay at the Imperial for only   extra a night  The greeting by the staff at the Manor was friendly and efficient but the room which was in an annexe had stains on the carpeting and a gap under the door which let in annoying mosquitos  We had avoided these pesky creatures throughout our trip and were not very happy to deal with them on our last night in India  It was pretty cold in the evening and the ac did not adequately heat the room either so we were given an electric heater  Not great for  Rs a night plus   taxes   being for service charges  The trains rumbled past shaking the room every   mins which interrupted our sleep  Although the bathroom looked the part the toilet seat was old and kept falling off too  I did ask for a room change but they were fully booked thanks to tripadvisor reviews most likely  On the positive side the staff were really lovely and tried to help best they could and the dinner in the restaurant was very tasty and the breakfast although limited was very good in quality I had asked for massages for myself and my husband but they were unable to procure the female masseuse so we just had the complimentary head and foot massage which was excellent I think our stay would have been better if we had been in the main part of the hotel  Avoid room  at all costsThe location in South Delhi is a bit far out really and we will most likely be staying at the Imperial again on our next trip  
P => soft landing in Delhi We landed in Delhi at lunchtime and were driven directly through the chaos that is Delhi traffic to this calm setting We had a suite Room  although it was more like a superior double having merely a seating area within the bedroom rather than a arate sitting room  The hotel looks good and the staff was very attentive  The trains can be intrusive although not enough to disturb sleep  Free broadband internet access downstairs and universal sockets in the room were useful and tea on demand was welcome Less impressive was the breakfast   if your room rate includes it it means one food item from the menu so either cereal or toast and one drink item so either coffee or juice  Extra items are charged for  They were also prepared to charge for an early breakfast to be served in the room but waived this when we protested  Apart from these negatives this is a lovely hotel in a quiet and safe location of Delhi  We would stay there again  
P => the best place to stay at in New Delhi this is an elegant boutique  style hotel less than  rooms i think in an upket suburb of new delhi   about   minutes drive from Connht place etcnew delhi is a polluted crowded and massive sprawl of a citythis place is a peaceful little gem and far better value than the US minimum expected for the better known places in path etcthe staff are knowledgeable and helpful    ie we didnt get ripped off by taxi drivers nor get lost  Staff recommendations on where to goeat were spot onthe breakfast terrace is a wonderful start to the day and being so small all the other guests feel obliged to say a friendly good morning to you even if you do turn up in your pyjamas with a bad hangover  if the price range suits   dont bother staying anywhere else 
P => I miss the Manor already The Manor is a great place to start a trip to India  It is indeed a quiet and relaxing oasis in the big dusty dirty Delhi  All the staff were proffessional and friendly without being overwhelming  The rooms were very clean with beds big and comfortable  You can choose from western or Indian food both of which are delicious As it was our honeymoon they left a chocolate cake in our room and a bath tub full of rose petals  very sweet The tea and chai are both very good best served overlooking the lush green lawn  Over all an excellent place to visit  
P => Lovely peaceful and clean in an extremely noisy city Fantastic small hotel rooms very comfortable staff very helpful and knowledgable food was superb we chose an Indian meal with a dessert the waiter recommended and we were extremely happy with his choice  Breakfast on the patio overlooking the lawn was very enjoyable and memorable enjoyed the wildlife in the garden too  If we go back to Delhi this will be where we will stay again  It was lovely  
P => great two night stop great boutique hotel  very comfortable rooms fluffy white towels and lots of hot water Restaurant was excellent and staff all very helpfulReally enjoyed returning to the hotel for tea in the garden after the hurley burley of Delhi  
P => Excellent hotel We have stayed in many different hotels in different countries however our stay at The Manor hotel is among our favourites even though we only stayed there for one night  We had a standard room and it was very nice and fashionably furnished  The hotel is located in a high end very pleasant and quiet part of central Delhi surrounded by beautiful villas  The staff was very helpful and professional  They also provide several complimentary services such as internet  The restaurant serves delicious indian and mediterranean meals  We highly recommend this hotel  
P => Loved it  Overall and Excellent Experience I was in India New Delhi for a conference Microbicides  from ruary rd to ruary th  I chose to stay at the Manor after TripAdvisor members completely panned the hotel that shall remain nameless that the conference recommended  I loved it  Overall an excellent experience   COSTCosts were comparable and often better than bigger hotels  I liked the space more than I liked the other hotels my colleagues used   FOODBreakfast on the veranda every morning  The complimentary breakfast was exquisite  Of course you had the usual continental breakfast offered as well as Indian style breakfasts  I didn t go to India to have eggs on toast so I ran through all the breakfast curries   choose a curry   ask how to eat it  The tea reminded me what crap we get in bags in the West  In fact I d told them how much I loved the tea and they mailed me a bag   SERVICELoved the individualized attention   an easier challenge for a smaller hotel I imagine but not one to be taken for granted  I felt like a house guest  Also for a relatively minor additional daily cost I had the use of a driver and a car  The Manor has its own cars and let me tell you having someone to take me back and forth to the conference shopping and on tours was indispensable  BTW for free the Manor will pick you up and drop you off from and at the airport   ARCHITECTUREI enjoy houses and architecture and the Manor s design is what drew me to it at first  I describe it as your typical warm weather upper class British influenced colonial style  The pictures I took actually look like the pictures in their brochure   The Manor actually lived up to its billing  How often can one say that Usually the photos the business takes are in the very best light  In this case the Manor did not need to struggle with that    SHORTCOMINGSThis was not a problem for me but be if you re sensitive to sound it might be  My room   shared a wall with the kitchen so I could hear early morning kitchen activity  It worked for me because I find that on business trips the dead quite of a hotel room deprives me of sleep  Sounds of life help me feel more relaxed  Of course in the grand scheme of things New Delhi is NOT quiet  However Friends Colony West is one of those upper class enclaves so it s a stillness in the middle of Delhi chaos  CONCLUSIONSLoved it  Will happily stay there again if I ever return to New Delhi I hope I do I loved New Delhi  Next time be I ll try to afford the penthouse 
P => Best hotel in Delhi by miles This was an oasis in the hectic buzz of Delhi  The standard room we had was very comfortable and clean though quite compact  Lovely shower  However it was the service here that was so spectacular  The staff went above and beyond to assist us and were so polite and helpful  The food was also great  We have been to India several times and stayed in many hotels  This was one of our best experiences and definitely the best hotel in Delhi in our opinion  
P => Loved the manor We booked the manor after reading other reviews  The Hotel lived up to all our expectations  Lovely Gardens in calm atmosphere  Food excellent Serving Indian and European cuisine  Staff go out of there way to be helpfull  The guest rooms are all wonderful  Contemporary spotless large rooms fresh flowers fruit and soft drinks all complimentary  The only down side is there is no where to walk out to  Gated residential area  However after a busy day in Delhi do you want to go out wandering at night  Very Highly reccomended  Ann and Mick U K  
P => Excellent On our nd trip to India Delhi was our first stop  Our plane arrived late at night and we were met by the hotel at the airport  The staff were wonderful and the room was very comfortable  Breakfast was included and made to order  The hotel is small and quiet  A nice transition to India  The only negative is the location is in South Delhi and we needed to take cabs everywhere I recommend this hotel and would stay there again  
P => Good stay but overpriced The Manor is a small family owned as of recently hotel  The staff is attentive and helpful the property is well manicured and clean the restaurant food is good and the room is clean and comfortable  My only regret was honestly the expense  I dont know why the average price here is listed as quotquot since I paid  for a suite  I have spent less money on far more luxurious rooms in places like Las Vegas and California  The TV in the room was tiny again youd expect a large flat screen for the expense  Take advantage of the car and driver that Devika Singh can arrange for you  I would come back to this property in a heartbeat if not for the price  I dont mind spending more to get more but on the value scale The Manor falls a smidgen short  
P => Favourite hotel in Delhi As a frequent traveller to Delhi I have experienced the best hotels the city supposedly has to offer Oberoi both Tajs Nikko Hyatt Imperial etc    and the Manor is without doubt the place to stay in my opinion  The property is small which facilitates a nice personal touch  Rooms are fairly spacious with ble laden bathrooms  For the price of a basic room at the Oberoi you can get a whole suite here which is twice the size of the Oberoi room I had  As a food lover the restaurant is a big draw even if there is only one  Even if you dont stay here I would recommend a visit to the restaurant which serves the finest Indian food Ive personally tasted as an Englishman thats quite a lot given our nations addiction to Indian cuisine  Service throughout the hotel is attentive and professional  Im very picky when it comes to service as my other hotel reviews testify but the Manor scores top ks here  What overwhelmingly sold me on the Manor is the setting which genuinely provides an oasis of tranquillity in the heart of the bustling city that is Delhi  The only negative is the hotels popularity  I had to check out for one day in the middle of my stay because it was fully booked this was flagged at the time of my booking so no gripes with hotel for this  Would highly recommend  
P => Nice hotel but hugely overpriced This is a stylish little hotel set in beautiful grounds  Rooms are modern comfortable and spotless  The staff are charming and helpful and more than make up for the polish of a big hotel  The restaurant serves good food and breakfast outside on the lawns is a great way to start the day The location works both ways youre a little far out of the city centre especially given Delhis terrible traffic but that makes the location a little more peaceful and besides its cheap to get around and the hotel can organise cars BUT the real problem here is the price  My double room was quoted at  a night  But by the time the hotel had added   service   luxury tax and   heres the issue   converted the bill into Rupees at a lhably bad exchange rate then converted back into dollars by my credit card company I ended up paying  a night  For that I could have stayed at the Oberoi   My advice is give this place a miss  
P => Poor reponse leading to failed booking  Front of office response entirely inadequate for prices I sent an enquiry for availables room by email via the hotel website and got an automated response  A couple of hours later the Front office emailed availability and prices   perfect I thought and responded that I would like to book how do it do it  No reponse by email  I phoned was told they had my email and would reply soon  I was also told I couldnt book the room by Amex over the phone   hours later and no response Another email still nothing  I called again and was told they would get back to me shortly An email did arrive eventually  Hrs after my enquiry   Sorry sir we dont now have the availability you wanted Fantastic  Im staying elsewhere  
P => Not for business I am in Delhi   times a year and thought Id try the Manor since it had gotten such rave reviews  I got the last room in the house with windows that backed on to a wall  Certainly nothing to write home about  The room was clean but the hotel interiors could stand a serious refresh  particularly at the rates USD charged As for business travellers the basics converter plugs iron took several calls to arrive  The front desk staff sluggish  The manager never arrived before I left for appointments in the morning  My favorite moment was trying to get back into Friends Colony at  pm one night  They forgot to tell my driver that the nearby gate was closed at night and it took  minutes to find an alternative route in  The restaurant does serve good simple continental cuisine Rates at the Imperial are often similar  a much better choice  
P => The Manor manner   A perfect antidote to hectic Delhi The only and I mean only downside to this hotel is its location but that is no reason not to stay  Most places in Delhi are  mins away in a car so why not spend an extra ten to experience the tranquility of The Manor The hotel is in Friends Colony a quiet area just off a main thoroughfare in southern New Delhi which houses some of the smaller embassies and consulates and a rather posh from the outside at least country club On arrival the st brass gates open to reveal the stylish exterior of the property and you are welcomed by friendly and efficient staff in the tastefully orated lobby  After the check in formalitiesare complete you are ushered to your perfectly air conditioned and reasonably spacious room  Ours was finished with dark woods and stone and had a very comfortable and large double bed Fruit flowers and newspapers appear in the room during the course of the day but the staff are never obtrusive  The restaurant is a delight with the interior or trumped only by the food which is exquisite  As other reviews observe this  well be the best Indian food you taste in your entire trip  Do sip a cocktail or two in the Onyx Bar and take tea on the verandaWe highly recommend The Manor for its visual and culinary taste and for the staff who understand exactly what the busy discerning tourist requires   rest and good food in a tranquil stylish environment  This hotel is a treat not to be missed Andy Mc a one time visitor to The Manor 
P => Great experience huge help booking my rajastan itinerary I used the Manor as my homebase from        while traveling to Bhutan Katmandu Uttar Pradesh and Rajastan  I had  stays altogether and was well taken care of each time  This is a small  room family owned and operated hotel in a quiet family style neighborhood just minutes from the insanity of Delhi  The rooms are quiet clean and very comfortable there is a restaurant onsite if you are too pooped to venture out  I was able to store luggage and clothing between forays safely  At one point I had forgotten my printouts from guidebooks in storage and they retrieved it and sent it by courier to my hotel in Katmandu  I left my camera on the Palace on Wheels train and they sent a driver to retrieve it  They took care of me in my jet laggidness from start to finish and put up with me when I was cranky and demanding  The very best however was Devika at Uniglobe travel which is connected to the hotel  As competant as I like to think I am with organizing independent travel she helped put together trains planes and accomodations where I was at a loss to find info on the internet on times distances or flat out how to get from one place to another  I cannot thank her enough for suggesting a car and driver for the final  days of my trip to really explore the areas not frequented by tourists    this is what made my trip to India more than great it was a memory of a lifetime There is no other place to stay in Delhi than the Manor     I only wish I could be there with you and relive the memories again and again  
P => A Hotel of Class We stayed here for  nights at the end of our tour of India  The hotel lived up to its reviews  The only one down side was the noise of the Trains at night  So make sure you have a room on the other side to the track  Also room  is next to the Air Conditioning System so some noise  They did however on request move us giving us a free upgrade room  It is a Hotel of Class Only wish it had been a bit less noise at night  
P => A calm quiet boutique hotel The Manor was a charming friendly and quiet hotel in the Friends Colony West about  minutes from Khan ket and  mins from Connht Place  The staff were really helpful  The cost of pick up and drop off at the airport were included in the price  The hotel is run by the owner Mr Singh who made a real effort to come and chat to all of the guests and make sure that we had everything we needed and to offer information on places to go and things to see in Delhi  We stayed here for  nights at the beginning of our holiday in India and for  nights at the end the first part in a room and the second in a suite  The suite was so much quieter and a nice size  The room was acceptable but ours was located next to the kitchen so there was some coming and going outside The bar and restaurant were nice although if you sit outside watch out for the mozzies I got bitten all over on the first night  The chef was great the food was lovely  All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Delhi  
P => Very good value We stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of ober  The staff were courteous obliging and quietly efficient  The suite was large clean and quiet  We ate in the restaurant for one evening meal and although the quality was very good it was inclined to be a little costly for Delhi  Wed recommend the Galati not that far away and its in the guide books where we had an excellent buffet lunch including soft drinks for less than R for the two of us  The hotel is to the south of the city some distance away from some of the more notable sites but this hardly made any difference as having a car and driver is probably the most efficient way to get around in India in any case  Id have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again  We also stayed one night in the Oberoi Maidens which proved to be a huge disappointment so for us it would be the Manor every time  
P => The only place I hope I ever stay in Delhi  The Manor overall is a fantastic place to stay Delhi was our first stop in India and we really needed the haven of tranquility that the Manor provides while we tried to adjust The rooms and bathrooms are great and clean of course and very stylish though perhaps a tad dark  But thats not too much of an issue as there are plenty of places to sit round the hotel  e g  on the loungers on the k or the lawn where they will happily place loungers for you  The train noise did not bother us but perhaps we were on the right side of the hotel The food is excellent and the restaurant beautiful and quiet and you can indulge in fresh raw vegetables without a second thought as they are grown by the Manor itself The staff are ridiculously helpful and will help you with anything that they possibly can Other services and features Theres a computer and desk provided in the passage area and the internet connection is good  The laundry service was also good and we had no problems with anything we got back and thought that we probably could have trusted it with more than we did We had a slight problem with the pick up from the airport and had to wait around for a while but as far as I can remember it came out that there wasnt a fault on the part of the hotel and in any case the welcome we received when we arrived made up for the waiting  If I ever return to Delhi I hope I wouldnt want to stay anywhere other than the Manor  
P => What a perfect little hotel I stayed at The Manor on my arrival in India and then again after a five day trip through Agra and Jaipur before my onward flight to Mumbai Out of the nine places I stayed at in India The Manor was in the top two by far the top position is shared by Malabar House in Fort Cochin What a gorgeous little place  It really is small   only  to  rooms depending on who you ask  But there is a great sense of space and light  Both of my rooms were airy stylish and extremely comfortable and the terraces croquet lawn and public areas all add to the sense of spaciousness Because it is so small there is a very real sense of personal attention  One example is breakfast  On one morning I wanted to have breakfast included in the room rate really late closer to lunchtime at around h  Expecting a great deal of resistance   most hotels maintain strict quotbreakfast hoursquot   I arrived in the restaurant to find it was not a problem at all  They just served a gorgeous breakfast of croissants and soft scrambled egg and fresh sweet lime juice and great coffee no problem whatsoever On the other two mornings I asked to have breakfast served in my room  Once again no problem at all no extra charge for the brilliant and quick room service  Now many many top hotels around the world insist that a complimentary breakfast must be taken in a restaurant but The Manor is small and friendly enough not to have such archaic rules I was also pleased to have free internet access in my room  A minor gripe is that it is LAN based rather than wireless but its free and fast unlike other quottop notchquot hotels I stayed at in India such as the Taj Mahal in Mumbai where internet access like everything else just costs too much And for those guests who dont travel with laptops there is also a PC available for internet access  Nice Another major plus is the complimentary drive from the airport  I must say this was one of the main initial selling points of The Manor for me  You dont want to arrive in Delhi at am and still have to find transport to your hotel so being met by a driver in the early hours of the morning was just bliss I have two very small problems with The Manor  One is that it isnt very conveniently located   its about a  rupee taxi ride to Connht Place for example  But the flipside of that is that it really is located in a calm tree lined suburb totally secluded from the madness of Delhi The other tiny gripe is that I was charged extra for mushrooms and tomato with breakfast on only one of my three mornings I know that is truly petty but when they get everything else SO right its a pity to spoil it with inconsistency  Either charge me every time or not at all but not randomly To the very dapper Mr Singh who came to offer me a National Geographic to read while I was taking tea on the terrace I say keep it up thats a very good little establishment you have there   it get the visitors it deserves  
P => A wonderful stay After reading many of the reviews on this site we ided to book the Manor during the last part of our stay in Delhi  We stayed at the Hyatt for two nights and then the Manor for four nights  I cant begin to express what a pleasant stay we had at the Manor  The rooms are nice the food is outstanding and the service was incredible  Our driver Jaga was a wonderful guide and made us feel very safe in a city that can be overwhelming for the first time  The owner came and talked to us at dinner and is a very nice man and he even helped us in our purchase of a carpet  This hotel does not have the ammenities of other larger more expensive hotels but it more than makes up for it in service and serenity  
P => design hotel nice and relaxing The manor hotel is placed in a very quite residential part of delhi It is in a quite place no cars no traffic just beautiful and exclusive villas around the hotel is a quotdesign hotelquot very beautiful  I suggest a quotsuperiorquot or quotexecutivequot room beacause it is bigger than the others  comfortable and big bed clean bathroom  the only bad aspect of this hotel is the carpet in the room it looks old and dirty even if it isnt dirty but I think it is very datedThe room service is goodthe breakfast hall is relaxingwe were alone The staff is very polite  good aspect internet place is avalibale  hours and is free  
P => Pefect finish for our holiday in India We stayed  nights in ust   Had suite number  with an extra bed for our  year old dhter  Cost us  USD   USD for the extra bed  Lovely room lovely bathroom lovely hotel lovely restaurant   we took most meals at the hotel  awsome food good complimentary continental breakfast croissants scrambled eggs on toast sweetlime juice     Friendly bar played cards read     Great garden terrace   Swimming pool in club nearby  Free internet  Super helpful and friendly staff  Arranged everything for us  car to aiport complementary taxis henne    Quiet comfortable relaxed atmosphere  Offered us cakes fruits chocolate at night    It was exactly what we needed after  tiring days in Northern India  We hioghly recommend this hotel  
P => An oasis of tranquility amidst urban insanity Delhi from arrival at the dingy airport to the insane traffic was nerve wracking so the contrast when we finally made it to The Manor tucked away in an exclusive enclave in south east Delhi was all the more extreme  a security guard to keep out the riff raff quiet friendly front desk staff who did all the form filling for you while you relaxed and recovered a large glass of freshly squeezed mango juice then a long bath with all the amenities supplied  I wasnt surprised to learn later on that this property is managed by Aman resorts  Complaints  the standard rooms are small and not the same size ask to be shown the rooms before iding  Everything else was fantastic  the service the food the angel hair pasta  excellent    our travel agent messed up the return airport transfer but the staff at the Manor took care of everything with aplomb  Suggestions for improvement Perhaps WiFi access and some attention to ageing fittings  Other than that I know for certain which hotel Ill be returning to when I next visit Delhi    
P => Great stay but not the ultimate We stayed at The Manor for  nights and must say that the hotel itself is great  One must give credit to the small boutique size of the property which makes it really something amongst the big hotel chains in Delhi Service was outstanding from the pick up at the trainstation to the reception and all the staff we interacted with during our stay  Very curteous friendly helpful and discreet if needed  On the downside however I did miss a Guest Directory in the rooms which I regard as a very useful tool for every guest in a foreign city  And it would pay off to train the staff remembering names and whether the guest like coffee or tea to avoid being asked every morning  Additionally the carpets look very tired and need changing  tiled or wooden floor is easier to keep clean  They have a wonderful lawn and roof terrace which is hardly used understand that the temperature was not really inviting for a lunch at C outside this time of the year but the umbrella looked really shabby and the chairs were always left were the guest had placed them a few days earlier  The material on the seats was dirty  the roof terrace is awesome but not inviting since in the evening no one placed candles or some sort of lights  we had to put our own cushions there    Check out was very efficient and the drop to the airport impeccable Overall the hotel is good and definitely worth to stay there if you happen to be in Delhi  
P => Luxury The Manor is lovely  From being picked up in a lovely large air conditioned car and being offered hand wash towels and drinks enroute to the hotel    then to the room to the restaurant and to the time we left    it was all lovely  We had stayed at a few dives throughout our trip and were disappointed but not by The Manor  Service and staff were great  Rooms were of an interesting and modern design and we slept in the most comfortable beds we had the whole time barring Agra Sheraton   which also had lovely beds We also hired the hotels driver amp car for a few hours for some sight seeing around Delhi and were pleased with the service  Restaurant food was also great and a nice change to have something continental ish rather then pure Indian  
P => A great base to call home in India The Manor was apparently Indias first boutique hotel when it opened in   And while it looks like its now in need of its first facelift since  it generously ticks the principal boxes of a great boutique hotel   exclusive intimate experience and fantastically personal service  The Manor essentially became the base camp on our trip   we started off there pre Rajasthan returned pre Varanasi and returned finally from Kerala prior to our London return  In this role it excelled   the team couldnt have been more helpful in organising drivers confirming train and plane times holding onto excess luggage we didnt want to lug around and catering packed meals for us to take on our journeys with us  Always a warm welcome The Manor is a green oasis of tranquility in the madness of Delhi  There is a subtly colonial air about it but its contemporary and efficient  The food is excellent   we particularly liked the authentic Indian food on the menu  The bedrooms and large the beds excellent the bathrooms wall to wall ble  Couldnt recommend a better place to stay in Delhi  
P => Not bad at all but have seen better We stayed at The Manor last tember  It seems to have gotten quite good reviews from a lot of people but I wasnt all that much impressed although I have to admit it is an overall pleasant hotel  It  have to do with the fact that we had stayed at the glorious and impeccable Devi Garh in Udaipur previously before arriving at The Manor  Our room at the Manor was quite small and rather dark  It was the cheapest room  Not much of a view  Found a couple of stains on the wall and carpet though not so obvious  The bathroom looked a bit tired  There was no bathtub and the shower room was a bit small  However the garden was spacious and beautifully kept  Food was a bit costly but tasted good  They have two adorable dogs who are friendly  I liked the neighborhood as well  It is in a high class residential district which is peaceful and calm  The staff are efficient and helpful  The Manager was a very nice person Their limousine services are very expensive compared to the usual taxis which you can catch on the streets  However pick ups to and from the airport were free and they provide a fancy black car with a good looking chauffer  They gave us mineral water and allowed us to pick our favorite CD on the way Overall hotels in Delhi are overpriced  Our personal advice is that you to leave Delhi quickly and go off to the beautiful and colorful Rajasthan area  
P => Peaceful oasis in Delhi Date   th thReviewer Christina and UddyWe had a lovely stay at The Manor  From the moment we arrived which was  a m  as a result of a delayed flight the staff were so warm and friendly  They immediately offered us what turned out to be the best tasting chamomile tea  We think about it still  The rooms while a bit worn around the edges are clean and beautifully designed with all the modern amenities and great sheets  We were even offered a free upgrade during our stay  Breakfast on the lawn was splendid  food and ambience perfect  It was hard to believe that the chaos of Delhi was just a few kilometers away  While our friends in Delhi thought we were a bit out of the way as far as sightseeing goes they certainly praised the beauty and peace which abound at this tiny oasis within Delhi  
P => An oasis in Delhis chaos My wife and I stayed here for five nights the end of uary while on vacation in Delhi Agra and Jaipur  We had rented a car and a driver from Rajputana Holiday Makers first class rental company in Jaipur and drove around the three cities starting and finishing in Delhi  In Agra we stayed at the Hilton and in Jaipur at the Alsisar Haveli The Manor is like a nice big family house  The building is surrounded by a good sized family garden in the New Friends Colony just fifteen minutes from India Gate by taxi or auto rickshaw  The suites are comfortable and well designed while the standard rooms could be a little bigger  The restauarant is excellent  The dining room overlooks the sunlit garden  Breakfast lunch dinner or snacks at the bar are very good being much better that the stuffy overpriced fare at the Oberoi and other big hotels Staff are really helpfull and the manager surprised us with a generous practical spirit that I have seldom seen in any hotel After a day on the road or sightseeing in Delhi this is a true haven  Both of us give top ks to the hotel although there were some small drawbacks but in Delhi you have to accept that the noise from traffic and railways pierces the walls and windows at odd times during the night  Amanresorts manages the hotel with a high standard of professionalism  We understood that they will be moving to a new hotel in Delhi in a few months and that a new hotel operator will take over  This will result in a reation of the building and the rooms the need for which is beginning to show We would make a strong recommendation to stay here in this quite well run small hotel  
P => The Manor Excellent Choice We had an excellent experience here at the end of our two week stay in India  Found the hotel through the internet  The staff was wonderful and assisted us  couples in every way through our last day with a driver meeting us a the train station and shopping and to the airport and mailing boxes back to the US following a wedding  The rooms were clean and crisp and constantly maintained every time we left  The food was wonderful from lunch one day to breakfast  The atmosphere was peaceful with no disturbances for sleep  Having stayed at a larger hotel at the beginning of our stay in India this place was totally different and catered to our individual needs  The three couples felt that we were in a family environment  We loved being at the Manor and recomment it to anyone going to Delhi  
P => A Gem There is not much that I can add to the other positive reviews of the Manor posted on TripAdvisor except to say that they are all true   the Manor is as wonderful as everyone says it is Design comfort service food   the Manor has it all  The small size of the hotel  rooms makes for a more personal stay than at larger hotels  We checked out some other hotels while we were in Delhi including the Imperial and we were pleased with our choice Highly recommended  
P => An oasis of calm If you want to stay in a ent hotel in Delhi without staying in one of the big chain hotels try The Manor  The Manor is situated in a st suburb of New Delhi  The rooms are fitted to international standards  The or is clean and modern if a little characterless  The character is provided by the charming staff  The modern Indian cuisine in the restaurant is excellent One small note of complaint the room I stayed in needed a bit of a refresh as some of the furnishings were beginning to look at little tired I used The Manor as a stop over when catching my flight back to London  The process was seemless I was met from on the platform from my train and delivered to the airport in the morning  Delhi can seem chaotic and intimidating  If you are a fairly well heeled tourist The Manor will insulate you from this whilst you acclimatise and provide a good base from which to see Delhi  
P => Excellent classy hotel This hotel is excellent and very classy  A relief after a  hours flight and no sleep Rooms are spacious   I would recommend the suite though with a modern o  Very clean with impeccable service and very quiet  With only  rooms each guest is treated as a very special guest Although I had read on Tripadvisor that there is a train line passing by the hotel I can garantee that you can hardly hear it  The hotel staff were very helpful picked us up from the airport part of the service and helped us booked our rail journey for the entire trip The Food is excellent amazing curries   nothing like what is served at home of course   the cuisine is very fine blending fresh herbs and spices  Juices are completly made from fresh  The only drawback is its location South of delhi but hence the reason why it is so quiet too as it is located in a posh suburb and away from the bustle of Delhi  And if you like shopping the staff will take you to some special shops  I highly recommend it

P => Who gave this hotel a  star rating In a nutshell very disappointing  At a push Id rate this hotel  stars with its only saving grace being the very good Chutney restaurant thats part of the complex  Apart from one particular doorman the staff were incredibly unfriendly and not overly helpful  Our room had a damp musty smell about it the bathroom was grimy and moldy and all the complimentary bathroom products had clearly been re used that many times that the shampoo bottles label had all but worn off  The hotels hr cafe was also very average   ordered food did not come out as requested with no apologies and and for a  star hotel Id expect the bar to serve gin  This hotel needs a serious overhaul   not just the facilities but also the staff    some customer service training wouldnt go astray  In the meantime can somebody please downgrade this hotel to a  star hotel as its an embarrassment to every other  star hotel weve ever stayed at PS  as already mentioned the Chutney restaurant is excellent   great food and service and very accommodating regarding dietary requirements  My suggestion would be stay at another hotel but got to Chutney for dinner  
P => Dont bother with a  Club Room  We stayed at this hotel for five nights  Overall we were quite disappointed with the hotel considering what we paid  It is not    CLUB ROOMWe ided to pay extra for a club room thinking that we would get various extras as listed on the hotel website  This included access to a Club Lounge with complimentary drinks and according to the website unlimited liquor  What we came to realise however was that a lot of the so called Club Room extras are actually available to all guests  It is not worth the money Our room was on the sixth floor  The or inside was a little dated but no real complaints  On arrival I went to the bathroom and found a live cockroach scurrying across the floor I used a glass to trap it and flush it down the toilet  We had no other insect problems The bathroom toiletries are pretty poor  No Molton Brown or Kama Ayurveda products as we had come across in the Taj  Oberoi hotels previously  The hotel slippers are nice CLUB LOUNGEThe Club Lounge is a rather dank and uninspiring place to be  It is in the basement of the hotel and has no windows  There is a flat screen TV on the wall and quite a large selection of magazines  The staff in the Club Lounge are quite pleasant although requests for drinks were met with confusion lots of discussions amongst the staff and telephone calls presumably to other departments within the hotel   who knows  It all seemed very bureaucratic and slow  It was as though we had asked for some difficult request even though all we wanted was a vodka and coke  The promise of unlimited liquor between   and   was a very awkward affair  On one of the nights we went to the Club Lounge we were told that the lounge was being used for a private function and so it was closed  After lots of fuss we were allowed to use the bar in the lobby  On another night we were told that we were not entitled to free drinks at all as we had apparently been upgraded and were not true quotClub Roomquot guests  I had to complain to the hotel manager who sorted it out  Later that same night we were told that we were only allowed two drinks maximum whereas the website promised quotunlimited liquorquot  I had to go into the Business Centre and print off pages from the website to prove that we were actually entitled to as many drinks as we wanted  The entire affair was frustrating So far as the rooms are concerned Club Rooms are no different to standard rooms  I know this because my parents were staying in a standard room and their room was identical to ours albeit on a lower floor We also found the room very noisy  There was a strange clanking noise coming from the walls  Im not sure if it was the air conditioning water pipes or because our room was situated next to the stair well  We had quite a few restless nights  I would take ear plugs next time  PIGEONSThe hotel is plagued with pigeons which sit on the window ledges of the hotel  When you look out of the bedroom window you can see roosting pigeons looking into your room as well as pigeon poop all along the window ledge  The pigeons also sit on the edge of the swimming pool and drink the water  This makes the pool seem very unappealing  There are only three sun loungers outside  We sat out a couple of times but there was a strong smell of sewage in the air that made sitting out very unpleasant indeed  This is probably outside the hotels control to be fair FOODThe selection at breakfast was very good and we were looked after very well  There is a man who makes omlettes  pancakes and there are plenty of food options choose from  On one occasion we had to wait in the lobby to be seated for breakfast but this wasnt too much of a problem  You have to pay extra to eat at the Japanese restaurant for breakfast The Chutney restaurant is also very good  We ate there three times as we were so impressed with the food  It is quite pricey compared to what you would pay on the streets but the service and ambiance is very good  The air conditioning can be quite intense so take your thermals SPAThe spa is very good with a fantastic selection of treatments  The prices are pretty reasonable  The treatment rooms all appear to be kitted out very well  I had a massage where the therapist used her feet instead of her hands  I also had the treatment where a oil is dripped onto the centre of the forehead the quotthird eyequot whilst being massaged by two therapists at the same time  Everyone was very pleasant in there  I very much recommend the spa  I did not use the gym but it appears to look very well equipped Overall this hotel is fine but it did not exceed our expectations in any way  I really think it is a bit cheeky to say that this is a   hotel and charge   prices  The service and amenities just are not there  The staff overall are very pleasant however and I am sure they are all trying their best  
P => no no NO no NO For the sake of   stay in the Lalit or the Hyatt or even the Ramada Gurgaon or DelhiI travel a lot around India and South Asia with my job and I always try to stay in hotels where I can work its peaceful and it has a certain standard of service  Oh and a good gym  Thats probably the most important  I tend to stay in the Lalit when Im in Delhi but this time I ided to give the Metropolitan a shot   call it branching out  It was the worst mistake I could have made  The staff are generally unhelpful there is a horrible musty smell permeating through the rooms and the corridors the gym is a terrible AC less until you manage to find someone to switch the manual AC on basement windowless cave with no complimentary water towels or anything that you would expect in a   hotel  More to the point the rooms are antiquated in a bad way the plugs are coming off the walls and if you need to catch up with work  forget it  The desks are such that I cant even get my legs under it because the chair is too high so I have to sit in a strange side on twisted position to get on with my work  Great for the back  And the room service menu is limited and small  Just dont stay here  Really  Go to one of the other hotels  I cant recommend the Lalit enough  
P => Average and expensive An average hotel in a good location  I dont think the hotel is  stars in the best option I would give the hotel a   stars  Service is very quotbureaucraticquot  The usual smile but not helpful  Rooms are small and old and they have no character  I would recommend this hotel only if the price was in the range of  per night and not in the range that it is now over  Go there only if you find a good bargain otherwise try to find something else  
P => Great moderate hotel close to Connht Place Arriving at noon I had no problem checking in and getting my room keys The hotel is located min walk Tuktuk ride from Connht Placewith restaurants and Palika Bazzar for shopping  
P => Very nice  Appriciated Ashok from Housekeeping Ashok was very attentive and made sure anything we needed was taken care of  We also appreciated the rooms and the security  
P => Worst hotel I ve ever had to stay at you only get served on tips while it is called a tipless hotel The rooms were below the standard for this kind of hotels the price they charge for the rooms are again too high for what you get  The roomservice was good if you put some money for the housekeeping otherwise your room was not as neat as if you did tip the housekeeping  The towels and usual stuff you find in the bathroom were not replaced if again no tip was left And there is also a lot of noise not only during the day but also at night a lot of noiseFurthermore doormen the bellboy the service all expect you to give them for every move they make even if it is just calling the cab and if you dont tip them also again they the next time they act like you re air while you are polite and kind to them    so dontThe taxidrivers are the worst they make up prices and charge you at least twice as much as an other cabdriver would charge you and almost push you to go to restaurants and shops they have a deal with so they can earn a bonus even if you dont want to it feels like you re being kidnapped So all together the worst stay ever and I have been to many countries and stayed in a lot of hotels of  and  stars this hotel should be given a max of  star and they should pay their employees more so they do better work and dont try to milk the tourists as a cow but treat the tourists as they treat cows holyFurthermore the prices of the hotel differ from the internet so try to pay before you go to the hotel or you will be unpleasantly surprisedSo all together my rewiuw is poor average 
P => Good Hotel The hotel is located in commercial Hub Connht Place of New Delhi  Its very well connected to all means of Transportation  Cozy hotel with good service  Overall experience is good  
P => Gr value  We booked through the hotel website and got a good deal ie  Rs  all inclusive with breakfast for a standard roomnight  the strange thing was the hotel wouldnt themselves give us this rate and wouldnt suggest we make the booking through its website for a lesser rate Perhaps an employee in sales trying to make his monthly quota also check the other online hotel booking sites for a slightly cheaper rate When checking in we were informed that we would have to pre authorise an amount of Rs   When asked why we should do this as they already had our credit card number the staff couldnt come up with a valid explanation  It felt like they didnt trust the guests or was it only Indian guests I wonder They wouldnt give a receipt for it eitherthis was a no tips hotel but it is so only in name  The staff are constantly engaging you in chitchat and there are  of them rushing to open the car door and then hovering around hoping for a tip While i did tip the bell boy on principle its absolutely ridiculousThe room was pleasant enough and so was the bathroom  It was quiet with a view of connht place in the distance  The mattresses needed to be changed as they were really uncomfortable and sagging The hotel is located right in the middle of things and we were a rickshaw ride away from the metro and there were restaurants in the vicinity  The breakfast was average However i have to mention that this hotel cannot be classed as  star deluxe  It is too small and the facilities arent up to scratch  The staff arent that well trained either Apart from the check in episode i would stay in this hotel agian given the stellar value for money  
P => Not bad but not great Read very mixed reviews of this hotel on Trip Advisor but ided to go ahead and book  nights as the price offered was very competitive First impressions when arriving in the early hours of the morning were good and check in was quick and efficient  The room was a good size and furinished in a Mediterrean theme Didnt wake in time for breakfast but had a good lunch in the cafe off the lobby at reasonable cost  As it was a Friday there seemed to be quite a few local business people having lunch there Tried out the gym which was very small relative to the size of the hotel but reasonably well equipped  The changing room was far too small  After comments I had read on this site I didnt have high hopes for the pool area but I think the management have taken some measures to improve it  There seemed a reasonable number of sun loungers and the was clean  There were a lot of flies around the pool though   perhaps unavoidable given the central location of the hotel  What was very off putting was the staircase from the changing room to the pool which was covered in bird droppings and feathers   so many feathers I kept looking for a dead bird  The pool attendant sat at the top of the stairs seemed oblivious to the mess even when I pointed it outTried out the hotel bar but despite it being pm on a Friday night we were the only guests there  Lack of guests was perhaps made up for by the large number of hotel staff watching the  cricket finals on the large screen TVsChecked out in a hurry and I didnt notice that I had been charged for the room which I had already paid for via Expedia  I contacted the hotel on returning home and they quickly acknowledged their error although it then took them over  weeks to pay the refund to my credit card All in all I would say that this hotel is trying hard but does not live up to the international standards it aspires to  All the staff I came into contact with were extremely pleasant and tried hard  What is lacking is attention to detail  I expect that the hotel is struggling as there seemed many more staff than guests during our stay  I would stay there again at the right price but would also pay a little more to stay at an international  or  star hotel  
P => Enticing Its located near New Delhis premier business amp shopping district  It has a beauiful landscaping  The hotel provides good hospitality warmth and exceptional service The hotel has  restaurant which provides Indian Japanese and multi cuisine cafe  
P => Too much noise for a top establishment A very comfortable four to five star hotel with all the necessary amenities and ent service  But if theyre have a private pool party as they do during Delhis wedding and political seasons inthe winter months it can be ridiculously noisy if your room is overlooking the pool  The loud quotthumpa thumpaquot bass n drums went on until  and the staff made noise cleaning up for two more hours after that  Complaints went unheeded and a form filled out and submitted to the manager produced no response whatsoever  I wont stay here again for this reason  A shame really because the Indian and sushi restaurants are great  
P => Best value for money in Delhi Relaxing  No tips  policy We spent two nights there  Very nice place with very helpful personnel   No tips policy which is in place at the hotel is very important feature for Delhi  We stayed in one star hotel in Delhi in two weeks after Metropolitan and the manner of asking and waiting for tips was reaally annoying there  It made me sick    Roomservice in Metropolitan is really good    For exploring the city in the first day we hired a car with the driver from the hotel  My advise guys do the same if you dont know the city well or dont have local friends  Its not an easy task to get a cab a proper cab not a reeksha in the city  Hotel drivers are more accountable  Its safer  Its much more comfortable as air conditioning definitely will work in a car  And at the same time hotel drivers also know a lot of local stuff to show you around if you want  Yes hotel cars are more expensive  But the difference is not that dramatic at the end of the day  Reekshas are cheap  But I didnt want to use them to travel through chaotic Delhi traffic    The same is true for food  In the hotel   the food is more expensive than outside but if you dont know how to choose and what to expect youd better pay more and stay on a safe side  When you will know the city better you can safely explore other places to eat  But hotel restaurant is ok for newcomers  Location  Geographically the hotel is situated really close to central Connht place  Which is good if you want to explore the city by yourself  At the same time the neighborhood seems to be not a good one  A lady at reception honestly informed us that wed better not to walk around by ourselves at night  That sounded scary  But we walked a lot in afternoon and it was ok  I will not downgrade that hotel because of location since all the good hotels in Delhi surrounded by more or less the same environment  Either they are in sterile areas amidst governmental building or close to landks the hotels will be surrounded by high walls and guards  Therefore the close proximity of Connauhgt place is a plus in that case  To sum up  We found the hotel and its service really great especially on the contrast to some surprises and bad experience we got in other places in Delhi  Best choice for new guys in town in my opinion 
P => Fairly good but should be better A well locatied hotel with good sized rooms but what lets it down are the little things  Staff though helpful are predominantly indifferent  The rooms are comfortable and extremely well maintained    the housekeeping being the best feature of the hotel during my stay I felt like I had a personal valet at times  The bathrooms are ok but the shower could have been a bit newer for this tier hotel  The breakfast selection is poor for this price hotel Id stayed at  star hotels with a better selection  Items are not replenished fast enough either and the overall breakfast service in lucklustre  Should you venture to have dinner here you will be charged extortianate prices for things like burgers and club sandwiches   you really wouldnt mind if the food quality and service were top notch but theyre just not  Internet access in the business centre is also extremely expensive so dont waste your money  The hotel boasts a very nice pool but there is no service at all around it so if you happen to want a refreshment youll have to hunt around the lobby for a waiter or go get one yourself  There are only five yes five sunloungers for the entire pool on the weekend its fairly busy so if you want one get up early and nab one  This didnt seem to be an issue during the week though  The location cant be faulted and the hotel was clean secure and felt upket but when compared to other   start hotels Ive stayed at in India the overall service impression was lacking  If you manage a good rate the service issues are bearable if youre paying their full ratecard stay somewhere else  
P => Good experience in Delhi Rooms are fine Breakfast was very nice  Definately staff is an asset to the Hotel I especially like the quotNo tipquot policy 
P => reasonable but left me with a bad taste My girlfriend and I were reasonably impressed by the quality of the Metropolitan on arrival  We found it quite an elegant clean and well furnished hotel   pretty much in line with our expectations  However we left a week later with a distinct feeling of having been thoroughly ripped off  The food and drink was  ridiculously  overpriced  on our first night I had an extremely poor curry in the main caferestaurant and was charged the equivalent of  GBP  On the last night while we waited for a taxi to the airport I ordered a bottle of water at the poolside   it cost me approx  rupees thats  times the price in the street outside  Theres simply no excuse for this its just blatant profiteering  I accept that it was my own choice to pay these prices but these episodes and others created a very bad taste in my mouth  I got an increasing sense that the hotel management was simply trying to fleece us for whatever they could get away with  
P => A comfortable experience I travel to Delhi several times a year and generally prefer to stay at the Metropolitan  It is conveniently located on the Bangla Sahib Road near Connht place but the locality is quiet The staff is prompt and efficient  The rooms are not very large but make up with the soft lighting comfortable bed and seats It has  restaurants which serve Indian Japanese and world cuisine  The buffet dinner is sumptuous with a good salad counter Indian and oriental fare For the price of the rooms in a city like Delhi where the hotels are mindlessly expensive the Metropolitan offers good value for money especially for the business traveller like me  
P => must try nice hotel restaurants and spa     pool should be taken care of and reception is not the best     but rooms and bathrooms are nice   close to the gurudwara and CP so that is also a plus point   nice hotel overall   must try     
P => Disapointing for a  Star Indian Hotel We booked this Hotel for the last night of our India Adventure we stayed in  Hotels in two weeks the previous  absolutely fabulous strongly recommend the Taj Hotel Chain this hotel looked good value in terms of cost and service they even ket as a quottip freequot Hotel which is the case however what they dont tell you is that they add a   compulsary service charge on every service every drink and meal which is far more than any tip you might give The Staff in Indian Hotels are normally very freindly and effcient however in this Hotel they are totally unmotivated probabaly due to the lack of Tips the resturant staff get orders wrong and trip over each other they all appear to be trainees  At checkout time the bill is so complicated with service charges its almost impossible to see what you have or havent been charged for To be fair in your average European city this hotel would be okavaerage but certainly not up to the usual standard for  Star Indian Hotels On a Plus point Japenese resturant is lovely 
P => Good Option In Delhi I had a very comfortable one night stay in this hotel In a city where hotels are not very cheap I through the   I paid for this one was good value  The hotel is in a good position a short tuk tuk ride to Connht Place which was good for a drink and evening meal  I had one lunch and the hotel and the food was quite food   pretty much Westen prices  The rooms were simple but nice and the pool I think is a must  a great way to relax after some the heat of sightseeing in Delhi  In sumy I think the hotel is good value and a very comfortable place to stay in a nice city  
P => poor service This is not a quotno tipquot hotel  The staff is constantly chasing you for tip The staff was rude  
P => Pleasant convenient and clean We spent  nights at The Metropolitan  I travel a lot on business and am picky about sheets and cleanliness  I was a little worried about what a moderately priced hotel in India would be like based on horror stories from others  and we didnt want to pay for a really high priced hotel  We found the rooms th flr pleasant and clean good high count cotton sheets   and the location was convenient  My room had a rather quotoddquot view of a garbage dump and a slum but my co travelers room had a beautiful view  As we also found in Mumbai hotels catering to westerners the Metropolitan is taking security seriously  The staff were helpful  and we especially enjoyed talking to one of the young waiters about current events in Pakistan  I had to have some clothes cleaned and while it was expensive I have to admit the clothes looked perfect when I got them back at the end of the day  The only unpleasant surprise was the high taxes imposed on the room rate something I had overlooked in mentally calculating the cost  
P => very happy with  night stay spent our first three nights in india being eased in at the metropolitan before staring a two week group trip with intrepid though rajastan  easy location to head out to sites and shopping  pleasant staff  great breakfast buffet check out the craft house  
P => Perfect Hotel for Visit to Delhi The Metropolitan Hotel is a five start hotel located about a  minute drive with no traffic  minutes in rush hour from Delhis airport and is a perfectly located gem for both visiting Delhi and just relaxing away from the bustle of the city  Check in is easy and smooth although different in the respect that each guest is seated at a desk with a receptionist as opposed to a long counter like you find in most  star hotels  There was a special on hotels com which permitted us to book at night although our general experience is that those quotspecialsquot usually mean you can get the same rate if you book with the hotel directly  If you do there are a number of airlines for which you can get an extra  airline miles I think American was one I forget the others Your bags are quickly whisked upstairs to your room  The Metropolitan seems pretty reliable about its quotno tipquot policy for employees but if youre a Westerner visiting India it seems fairly stingy not to tip and in our experience the tips are not refused although it is nice that employees do not linger hoping that you will The rooms are spacious and clean especially the bathrooms  Having clothes cleaned or pressed is easy and affordable they do not provide irons and ironing boards  Internet costs about USD per day which is a little pricey but in our case necessary  After checking in we arranged to have a private driver take us to the Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort very early in the morning    the travel desk was entirely accommodating and did not blink when we asked to leave at am we had to return to Delhi by early morning  The cost was USD although that is for the car so if you have a number of passengers its very affordable and well worth it  The trip to Agra took  hours on the nose although there was no traffic  The cost includes an English speaking guide which we did not want but they provided anyway and it was nice to have someone there to help negotiate the entry of a larger camera and its evidently more threatening battery  I probably do not need to recommend the visit to the Taj Mahal    it is as stunning and grand as you think it is  Entry is USD for foreigners although we were told that the Indian government was changing the entry fee so that all who want to enter foreigners and Indians    who now pay next to nothing will pay USD The trip back was   hours heavier traffic especially from Faridabad to Delhi The Metropolitan Hotel is a unit of Summit hotels and caters explicitly although obviously not exclusively to Japanese tourists and businesspeople  Thats neither here nor there except that there is a very nice store located on the hotel premises called quotCraft Housequot at which you ban buy very affordable gifts and souvenirs and they also have a smaller selection of Japanese items  There is also what is evidently regarded as one of the nicest Japanese restaurants in Delhi although we did not eat there The staff were all friendly and helpful and we cannot recommend the hotel high enough it is also in close proximity to the Gate of India and shopping on Connht Place The only complaint I would register is the outrageous cost of printing in the business center USD per page  
P => Good hotel We stayed at the Met Hotel in Delhi for two nights The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly particularly housekeeping We used this hotel as a base for sightseeing which it is very good for We enjoyed the breakfast here  They offered Indian as well as continental breakfast and fresh eggs The cafe for an afternoon snack was not so good as little choice The pastry I had was not very nice artificial tasting and the same for my partners cake but this shouldnt put you off the hotel   just dont eat here for lunch We didnt eat in the restaurants here but I believe they are very good The hotel had a nice pool and we booked the this hotel because it had a pool as after a day of sight seeing it is nice to have a dip however unfortunately for the two days that we stayed at this hotel on both afternoons the hotel was getting the poolside ready for weddings we did go in the wedding season and as such we were unable to use the pool both afternoons which was a bit annoying as we had paid extra for the priviledge had I known I would not have been able to use the pool I would not have booked it and paid the extra Upon checking out I did mention this to the reception staff to see if I could get any discount on my bill but they said that as they had already calculated the bill they would be unable to change it and as we were running late for a train i didnt have time to argue with them  They did offer me a breakfast to take with me for the journey for free but i didnt have time to wait for them to pack it up for me  I would stay here again as the place is nice and we enjoyed a nice drink at the bar one evening which has a dark and seductive ambience but next time if I have any complaints I will maike them heard before they calculate the final bill  
P => Nice stay but Id try another hotel next time Namaskaar  I stayed at the Metropolitan in ember  for three nights over the Christmas holiday  Sorry to be late getting my review on this site  The hotel is located in Connht Circle area  Even though the hotel is downtown getting around Delhi still requires a taxi or tuk tuk  When the new Metro subway system is up and running by  for the Commonwealth Games getting around Delhi will be much easier for tourists  The tourist sights are spread out and are difficult to get to if you wish to walk around  This hotel has a tourist office on the main floor  The staff is very friendly and are eager to book a tour for you should you wish to spend Rs for a four hour tourwith car and guide  For me a tad bit expensive  Finding a taxi driver or even a tuk tuk just outside the gates of the hotel is far more affordable and fun  You can hire a taxi for the day for about Rs and the driver is with you for an eight hour period  I agree with one of the previous comments about the smell in this hotel  Should you ide to stay here get a room in the front of the hotel  There is a factory of some sort see attached photo at the back of the hotel just over the wall from the pool and pollution bellows out from three smoke stacks  When I discovered where the smell was coming from I requested a room at the front of the hotel and I was immediately accommodated  Another negative experience while staying at this hotel was the cleanliness of the bathroom in particular the stand up showers  There was a great deal of mould on the tiling and was in desperate need of scrubbing  The carpets are dirty and old and need to be replaced  There is a business center on the lower level and Internet fees are Rs plus tax for  minutes  Expensive for me  Seeing I was there over the Christmas holiday I guess the room rates were at the high season rates and I found it expensive  I only ate breakfast at this hotel and the foodservice was good  This hotel gets high ks from me for a very friendly staff  Hats off especially to the doormen  Great guys Oh yes there is a nice gift shop near the pool Craft House India  Very fine quality gifts and helpful staff  
P => Beautiful Hotel with Great Staff at the Metropolitan We loved the hotel and all of its staff  The rooms were very nice and large and the staff was always available and very attentive  The one negative I would say of the hotel is the smell just outside by the pool and all the way downstairs near the business center  We could not pinpoint what it was but it smelled awful for the days we were there  It was fine in the restaurants and in the rooms so could have been something just outside but it lasted for three days  I would recommend the hotel and return  
P => Top hotel in Delhi I had a good stay in this hotel staying for  nights and dining there twice   On both occasions I had an excellent meal  The staff were very helpful and friendly  
P => High quality hotel with excellent service Metropolitan Hotel offers a service that you seldom meet even at higher rank hotels in other countries  It seems that Metropolitan gives you the best service India can offer in a very nice manner  The restaurants are excellent with very nice food  The food is not as inexpensive as on other restaurants in Delhi but with European standards prices are relatively low  The rooms are clean and very nice and internet service is available at a small fee  All in all this is a very nice hotel well worth  stars by most standards  
P => My home in Delhi I stayed in many hotels in Delhi from luxury to budget hotels  I didnt find a better hotel than Metropolitan in the aspect of value for money  Its size which is not too big its location near Connht Place its friendly staff and the good looking and comfortable rooms   Makes it the perfect hotel for me 
P => Nice stay but shared the room with a mouse Spent a conference week in Delhi and wanted an upscale hotel  The Metropolitan was a nice place to retreat from the caotic and smoggy Delhi streets  Staff was very friendly  I would recommend eating at the Indian restaurant as food and service was exellent and good value for money  Also the lobby restaurant with changing theme buffet was nice  The concrete paved small pool area was a disappointment as I had thgought about relaxing a bit by the pool  There were also reation people working around the pool every day and only two sun beds awailable and the area just did not look too inviting  Then there was the mouse in my room  One night just when I was about to swich the nightlight off there was a small mouse running across the wall to wall carpet floor  As this was supposed to be a   hotel out of principle I called the reception and asked them to do something about the mouse  After a while the reception called askin had I seen a mouse or a rat I told that it luckily was only a mouse and soon three staff members came into the room and started to mowe the furniture around  I had lots of fun while follwing the mouse chace  The mouse ran around the room for a while and then disappeared behind the huge wooden wardrobe  Some other guest also told me that they too shared their room with a mouse  
P => A comfortable but expensive hotel fine for a business trip The hotels maint strength is a real comfort for a business trip  You will get more or less everything you need for your business  That said it is really expensive even for Dehli and the staff is at the reception really cold and useless  
P => Sakura Restaurant   Shouyu Ramen    Yum The Shouyu Ramen in the Sakura restaurant was as good as the ramen in JapanThis is the first time Ive come across ramen equally as good anyone in the worldI am so impressed amp would come to stay again just for thatNisha  
P => The Metropolitan Hotel New Delhi   Excellent as Always On my trips to New Delhi I have in this year been regularly staying at the Metropolitan and I have found the services offered by them as also the culinary experience at the Hotel exceptional  The Breakfast spread in particular is vast and has something for everybody from every part of the Globe  The In House services are also very good and the Rooms on offer are to say the least luxorious  
P => good option I stayed one night here and started well as they were waiting at airport to pick me up  Id booked through a hotel booking site and paid for a pick up  Emailed hotel direct to arrange this and all done easilly  Room was good and slept well   is very quiet compared to some delhi hotels  Meal in Chutney was very nice and relaxed experience  Overall though I would say that hotel a little soul less but worked well for what I needed for one night to recover from flight   If you want somewhere with a pool to relax by this  not be best option  Pool is in a concrete setting with plenty of pigeons enjoying a wash and no sign of people or service  only two sunbeds in sight  The pool at shangri la a much nicer setting and easy to get drinks and lunch from the poolside  Overall shangri la felt like a more lived in hotel but metropolitan a good option for easy stay and good nights sleep  
P => Worth every penny spent I stayed at this hotel for a night with my spouse and give it   ratings for the money it costed me  This is one of the reasonably priced  star hotel in the centre of Delhi very much accessible by all means of transport  The food was good specially the Japanese restorant Sakura and the indian guess its called Chutney  I stayed at the delux room  The ambience of the room was great the bed was comfortable bathroom and other accesseries were ently fine  The service was good too  Also Id like to mention that while booking the rooms here do it via the hotel website as they usually have Special tarrifs which are quite low than the ones offered by travel agentssites  All in all a place worth spending a weekend getawayBusiness trip  Go for it 
P => Overpriced understaffed very average room  I arrived at the hotel at about pm and there was  person at reception dealing with  people while at the same time answering the phone  The same person was still doing everything at am the following morning when I checked out  It took half an hour to check inout and for  a night they can afford more staff  The room was extremely average and not very nicely finished  Best avoided  
P => Great value for the money spent  nights at the Metropolitan and enjoyed every moment  My room reated on on the th floor was spacious clean and well equipped  Service was great even when I ran out of mineral water at AM and the staff was very attentive polite and eager to assist  They have a no tips policy which is great  Breakfast is good with selection a bit limited though of Indian and Western food I ate at both the Chutney and Sakora restaurants of the hotel  Chutney provides excelent Indian food in relaxing atmosphere  Sakora was good too though I was a bit dissapointed with what I got but this has to do of course with my own selection and expectations I will definitely make the Metropolitan my home while in DelhiI booked through Expedia and got great rate of   excl  taxes for a standard room incl  breakfast 
P => Absolutely thrilled with Metropolitan We had an opportunity of staying there twice last month while touring North India Lots of apprehension while booking as most of reviews were pretty negative  But now we are wondering were we at the same Hotel which we read about Right from the start   Pick up at the Airport   to the end it was the most wonderful experience  Excellent service along with Indian art of hospitality The Drivers were very professional and never honked         someone metioned about Drivers expecting Tip  Interesting as this is a quot No Tip quot hotel  The staff actually wear a Badge mentioning this Space within the room was little tight         but how can one complain when we had a roll up bed for our son  The views of the Delhi skyline were just right with cloudy sky Breakfast   Multi cuisines reflecting the taste buds of their guests  Indian as well as Western dishes changing every day Business Lounge   Internet access and Happy Hour Restuarant   Chutney   chutneys to taste  Went through  of them in an evening  So we will be back for the remaining  Staff   Very professional  The personnel who managed Bell Desk were extraordinary  They did everything possible for our Baggage challenges In sumy a wonderful experience enhanced by lovely attentive staff  
P => The best Ive seen in India great staff and great location Hotels in Delhi are overpriced and dirty  This hotel was still a bit expensive but worth it  Ive been to Delhi  times and this was my favorite by far  The staff was VERY friendly and not intrusive like most highly rated hotels in Delhi  The breakfast was large and well done  The hotel was clean and well maintained  The room was a bit small but very comfortable  The best part perhaps was the location it was within walking distance of the Palika Bazaar and Connht which made getting food outside of the hotel the easiest Ive seen  If youre looking for high end in Delhi I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Nice but expensive  This was my first hotel of three during my stay in India  It was twice the price of the other two and the bed was the most uncomfortable  The hotel itself is quite elegant  I didnt have the chance to avail myself of the spa facilities but the main restaurant was excellent My room was small clean and well appointed  The staff was very friendly but also had their hand out for tips more than anywhere else I stayed  If you are looking for something a bit more upscale and dont mind paying for it I think youll be very happy here  
P => Good value for Delhi I stayed for  nights at the Metropolitan in New Delhi last week and I was very satisfied Firstly I have to say that the rate was very good for Delhi  I paid just under  Euros  rupees per night which is actually pretty reasonable for Delhi The room was very comfortable   quite large very clean and a arate bath and shower which is always a nice bonus I ate in the general restaurant and also in the Japanese restaurant both have very good food and service  The bar is also very nice if perhaps a little too quottrendyquot  I prefer the old bar The pool area is very nice although I didnt actually use the pool  The gym was great   full of brand new equipment with tv built into the eliptical cross trainers etc Business center staff were very helpful internet is very fast and not outrageously expensive about  rupees per  hours Location is very central only  minute drive from Connht Place perhaps a  minute walk for the brave  All in all I was very happy with my stay and recommend the Metropolitan as a good business hotel Just a final note  I have stayed in several Deli hotels over the last   years  Where I stay is always ultimately governed by the lowest rate available to me at a reasonable hotel  I have written other reviews about the Park and the Intercontinental The Grand and have also stayed in the Sheraton the Le Meridien and the Imperial  Overall I would rate the Park and the Metropolitan at the bottom in terms of quotluxuryquot but they are also my first choice in Delhi since they both offer the best value for money in my opinion since they are usually around     rupees cheaper per night than the others  If you get a better rate at the others stay there otherwise The Metropolitan and the Park are perfectly adequate  
P => Pretty nice but overpriced I recently had a  night stay here and found the hotel rather nice  However at  a night its definitely not a great value  The thing I found with India is that you either pay  and stay in a cesspit or you plump for a hotel at upwards of  and get something nice but not nearly as outstanding as what youd expect for the price  That aside the staff especially the the doormen were so pleasant welcoming and helpful  The hotel kind of had a faded imperial glory vibe to it which gave it lots of charm and character  I found the beds way too hard but the room was good overall and the breakfast buffet was enjoyable also  One problem which I encountered a lot in Asia is that there was no ATM in the hotel  I would probably stay here again just because of the warm and welcoming staff  
P => Very nice I was able to get a good rate for this hotel via Expedia at a big discount from the rack rate and the rate I was quoted by a travel agency and it proved to be a very nice choice  The check in process went quite smoothly and quickly  My room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable and it overlooked the swimming pool  The staff was very courteous and efficient and I enjoyed the breakfast in the cafe There are a few things though that prevent me from giving this hotel an quotexcellentquot rating  First there was no room service menu in the room  Now this turned out not to be a huge issue for me as I ided to go out for my meals but the menu should have been there  Second when I checked out the hotel didnt have enough rupees to give me change  By the time I stayed at the Metropolitan I had encountered the change issue numerous times but I expect an establishment of this caliber to absorb the  or  rupee difference rather than shortchange me  When I protested that they were cheating me they did absorb the difference but I dont think I should have had to argue the point Third and most seriously during my stay there was construction work being done on the pool  This didnt bother me in and of itself as I had no plans to take a dip during my stay  However the construction was going on as late as  at night  To the hotels credit when I called at  and complained the noise stopped within  minutes  But again this should not have been necessary  And besides that they started up again before  the next morning Overall though my stay was pleasant and I would stay here again  One tip Metropolitan is the new name of the hotel  It was formerly called the Nikko and that is the name taxi and tuk tuk drivers are familiar with  
P => Definitely not  star Overpriced and not a  star hotel Staff are friendly and helpful and that is all Given a chance i will try other central hotels  
P => Just OK for the category This is a five stars hotel so it is quite normal that it is clean and comfortable  However there is something cheerless in it   the hall has a strange smell and lighting does not favour it  Rooms are OK but you might find just the same in a four stars hotel in Europe  
P => Great Location   Shame about the View The Nikko is one of Delhis better centrally located hotels  Ive stayed in most of them   The only downside is the view   if you face the back onto the pool you have a green park infront but its dark and lacks sunlight  If you stay in a quotCity Facingquot room it looks onto the Delhis skyline   but you cant see much although rooms are a lot brighter The Hotel is clean and the staff are atentive although it takes three of them to do one job  The Buffet breakfast and Lunch are very good and the Sakura Japanese restuarant is fab if you can afford it  The Zen Spa is excellent   the steam rooms are the best I have ever sat in and the gym is well equipped and air conditioned The hotel is within walking distance of Gurudwara Bangla Sahib and a short drive from Birla Mandir and the shopping in Connht PlacepathKarol Bagh If your looking for a five star deluxe where you can spend all day walking around the property why   the Nikko is not for you   but if your like most touristsbusiness travellers who eat breakfat and be dinner there and spend all day out   its a perfect well maintained oasis Its known by Delhi ites as the Japanese Hotel   with lower and harder beds but with good bled bathrooms and erate shower cubicles This was my third stay at the Metropolitan Nikko and I will be coming back  
P => Okay only Stayed one night when I reached Delhi on th y  and needless to say I dont like the hotel  It is quite old  The reception area has this strange odor that gave you a creepy feeling Room We had the deluxe and it was a standard room  Again I can tell that this hotel needs reation to fulfill it as a  star place Breakfast It has nice varieties tried authentic Indian food for the first time too hot for my taste In all for the price that you pay better stay at Le Meridien because this place needs a face lift  
P => Weird Luxury I stayed here for  nights while on a tour of India  I thought it was nice enough with an excellent breakfast but I would probably not recommend it to others  The hotel property itself is small and claustrophobic  The gym is nice though  It is near Connht Place but in a strange neighborhood  Having seen what slums in India look like I would not say it is in a slum but it is hard to walk out of the hotel without being surrounded by beggars  I stayed at another hotel   Le Meridien   at the end of my trip and this was not the case  No one will hurt you or anything but it is uncomfortable  Its worth it to spend a few more bucks and get a better location  
P => Greatly disappointed I was greatly disappointed in this so called   deluxe hotel  I shopped high and low on the internet for about  months prior to booking  At that time the reviews on the NIkko were superb and being a huge family reunion from all corners of the world NY UK amp Papua New Guinea it was going to be something special  Or so I thoughtThe hotel itself is nowhere a    Yes it is clean and has crisp interiors but the rooms were disappointing with stains on the carpets and some of the tiling grout coming off in the bathrooms  The door keys were another issue altogether I had to go down to reception  times because my door key didnt work and they had to reprogramme it  The restaurants were averade except for Sakura which i give   The patio served some sorry excuse for sandwiches  Quite poor really considering this is supposed to be a   deluxe hotel The door staff were courteous and friendly  I cannot fault them  The reception staff however were another issue  They did not seem to go out of their way to make the stay memorable  Instead we got many blank looks when we asked for any helpadvice regarding the shopscity  I have travelled a lot and for the money that we paid for a  night stay   I was so so disappointed  On our last day we went to the airport at the crack of dawn pnly to find out our flight was cancelled and the airport staff told us that they had left a message with the person at the Nikko reception  You got it They didnt bother to let us know  This I thought was disgraceful and highlighted the total lack of hospitality  For a Japanese chain of hotel this experience left me cold  
P => Just OK   Service wasnt very impressive This hotel had a good clean room   and sitting on the comfortable bed I couldnt really tell if I was in India or New York without either watching the TV or looking out the window  My room King Bed was  K Rupees or night which I just didnt think it was worth the expense  Internet access was over night  Still all of the other five star hotels were booked and they generally had a similar cost so obviously they are doing something right  I also stayed at the Hotel Sri Nanak Continental which was night without all of the extravagance and would probably do that again if I could do it all over again  Still this is a good business class hotel that caters towards westerners who have an expense account   and they fit this need pretty well My only issues were around the service in the hotel dining room and at their snackcoffee bar   it just wasnt very good which surprised me given the cost and prior reviews  I coulndt figure out why   as just paying attention to your tablecustomers is pretty basic  You softof feel like just a number versus a guest of the hotel  The Bell staff front desk were all helpful and competent Room service was excellent   nothing like some spaghetti bolognese when you miss western food  
P => The Personnel At This Hotel Were a Pain in the B    Where to begin  Everytime that I order room service I am asked if I will pay cash  No I reply I will bill it to the room  Everytime that I use the services in the business center the girls there ask me if I will pay cash  No I reply I will bill it to the room  I talked to the travel desk on the first floor to see if I could depart from Delhi a few days early  The answer was no all flights were booked  I was accosted seriously by a gentleman from the registration desk asking me when I was checking out  I looked at him and then I told him that when I was ready to check out that I would so inform him  I had reserved my room for over a week but he seemed in a panic that I might check out early  It got worse  When I got to my room I found that my room key no longer worked  I had to go to the front desk tell them and wait for then to reprogram the key card  I called guest services with a simple request for a roll of tape  It took hours and multiple follow up calls for this to happen  I just remembered that I called and asked for a pair of AAA batteries  They never came  When I set the quotDo Not Disturbquot sign on the door the housekeeping boy insisted on ringing the bell at AM to enquire when I would like him to clean the room  I informed him that I would call for housekeeping when I needed it  This happened for three days in a row until I got angry and admonished him telling him that if the quotDo Not Disturbquot light was activated that he should truly not disturb me  It happened again anyway the afternoon of the fourth day of my stay  A girl from the front desk came up with a security guard  Apparently they thought that I was dead or using drugs or something  I was in the shower and they actually opened my door  Unbelievable  In case you are wondering I am traveling on a corporate credit card I wear business suits I am well groomed and very presentable  The service in this hotel is bizarre  I will never return here  The restaurants are hit or miss  They make excellent soups  The beef in the Japanese restaurant is superb  The buffet in Patio their ground floor cafe blows  The sandwiches laid out there are soggy and sad  Great desserts but sickening coffee  They will bring you cream for your coffee however  You just have to clarify it no fewer than three times to the waiter  Laundry service is good  Room service likes to bring you a miniature bottle of Evian rather than a large bottle of Himalayan mineral water apparently because they can charge extortionate prices for it  And since we are talking about water the waiters have a strange habit of showing you a bottle of water like it is a bottle of fine wine asking if it meets your approval  I just look at them and tell them that I would like water  Bottled water  Whatever they have is fine  At  a night I will not be returning  Especially after I went to dinner at the Hotel Shangrila  I will be staying there for my next trips to Delhi  The Metropolitan Hotel is a step up from the Crowne Plaza but it dearly needs help  This is the second ostensibly quotfive starquot hotel in New Delhi that was comparable to a Holiday Inn in the USA  Oh yeah  One more thing the health club is closed  They are refurbishing it  So there is no gym here  Avoid unless you like to be harassed by the employees who mostly mean well but just do not get it  
P => Welcoming hotel nikko The service at the hotel is great  the food is good  the Wi fi hotel helped me stay in touch with my business  The sakura deserves a special mention  
P => Splendid hotel It Was great staying at the hotel  Came for my business trip to delhi  It was my first stay at the hotel  I personally liked chutney restaurants and must say staff was really warm  The hotel is very close to the business districts of delhi and it prevented me from traffic hassles of new delhi 
P => Service is depressingly tip oriented  
P => Central location and luxurious rooms

P => An Oasis in Delhi

P => Good value good location I find international business hotels in India to be outrageously priced for what you get  The Muse is a reasonably priced alternative in a good location  The rooms are modern and clean  Breakfast and Wifi are complimentary  On the whole the staff and friendly and helpful  Yes it doesnt have the facilities of an international hotel and the finish can sometimes be slightly rough on the edges    but for quick business trips it is fine  I will stay here again on my next trip to India  
P => Perfect for a short and comfortable stay in Delhi We stayed in the Muse for one night as part of our tour of India  I had previously been to India  years ago and I was really apprehensive of my stay  The Muse was the first hotel we stayed in as part of our Golden Triangle tour and I was worried for no reason The hotel is very modern for Indian standards and it looks more like a boutique hotel I would find in Europe I have to say I was impressed Upon reaching the hotel the doorman opened the door for us which was a pleasant surprise we were taken to the coffee shop and offered cold drinks whilst we were checked in We had a triple room and it was spacious for all of us and our bags  The bed was one of the most comfortable we have had in India and the shower was divine  The only thing I would mention and this is probably for the ladies there is no mirror next to a power point so this made straightening my hair a bit of a challenge  This is a minor point though overall i thought the hotel was fantasitc value and good base to see Delhi from  
P => Muse a credible alternative to pricey hotels I stayed recently at the Muse  Very modern  Courteous staff  Efficient front desk  Free wifi and breakfast  About   kms from the airport in Nehru Place  It  be a bit far out if you are traveling to Lodhi Road or its neighbourhood but if you plan the day it is a minor inconvenience  The room that I stayed had a king bed  It was spacious delightfully clean no murky smelling carpet with plentiful lights flat TV in room safe and plasma TV  Was there a refrigeratorgt I am not sure  The bathroom has a great shower area I felt relieved it did not have a tub speckless ble walls and floor  The room looked and felt better than most reated       hotels in New Delhi  Beware though that those who only stay in those hotels  not feel pleased to stay here but those who are looking for short stays in an exceptionally clean and comfortable room will find this a deal  You can reach the hotel directly via email reservation  musedelhi com or through their website  
P => 
P => Good Stay It is good hotel with nice AQUA bar at central location in ND 
P => life is simple I like this hotel  Properly maintained clean and neat  The rooms are big enough for a comfortable stay with your loved ones  Offer a good variety of food with a smile 
P => Avoidable like all Park Properties Like most Park Hotels this one is full of noisy teenagers and over dressed local people The hotel website is three times more expensive than any online agent would offer I would suggest avoid this so called brand  
P => just dont stay there We arrived at Park Hotel at   on a Friday and we were just shocked  Since we are hoteliers we asked for an upgrade and they provided us with the super luxurious room which had GLASS WALLS between the bathroom and the room  As you can imagine i could hear everything that was happenning in the bathroom    the bed linen were full of hair stuck on them   the bathroom was very dirty   a lot of hair on the floor and the bathtub   also there was no hand shower  so the water was only coming from the top  breakfast was ok   a lot of variety but still it looked a bit dirty again be because my mind was on the hair i found on the bed  the restaurant was fine too  In general this is not a  star hotel for me I have a  star hotel in Greece and it s far better than this  just UNACCEPTABLE 
P => Please find another place    This is NOT a  or  star hotel   be just barely a good  star  The rooms are very small the hotel looks well worn the meals at the restaurants are much much much too expensive   as are the drinks at the bar close to  for a shot of scotch   please  On top of this the room rates are way over priced  I paid close to  for a room that should have gone for about half that  Beware the photos on the web site look good but do not tell the true story  In Italian we would call it a quotbella figuraquot   in English it would be called putting a good face on       I also found the staff to be too pushy  On the good side   the rooms are clean the upper floors are very quiet and there is a good selection of breakfast foods  
P => OK lot of scope for improvement Having previously stayed at The Park in Kolkata I was eager to visit the Delhi version  Located right in the heart of the city The Park had nothing much to offer  I would rather call it a building with a bar a bakery and a discotheque with some rooms The rooms are ordinary the staff and the front desk personnel behaved in a very snobbish way  For once I regretted coming here  The staff seemed more interested in entertaining the guests at the Bar and the discotheque rather than the room guests The only thing like able was the Flurys bakery their coffee and cakes were just yummy and made me forgot the other negative points  I would only recommend it to people who want to walk around in Connht Place and central Delhi  
P => Please when can I go back  Delhi can be hectic and demanding  The choice of hotel is really important in this part of India  and I am glad to have found The Park  Its brilliant and I would definitely include this hotel on any of my return visits to India   The interior design is very groovy but not cold  The service and smiles have not been painted over in the orating effort  The restaurant at the hotel is pricey but briliant  The food is contemporary Indian with odd and unusual splashes from all regions with modern appreciations  Service spectacular  The pool side is really relaxing  Make sure you indulge daily in the breakfast on the ground floor  
P => Not worth it  Stayed a week at this hotel  The experience was average at best  You know that something is wrong when your asked to wait in the lobby for breakfast  And then made to share a table with someone because quotwe are busy quotThe place lacks the service of a top hotel and clearly is a business thats more focused on quantity rather than providing quality  Simply dont bother staying here  
P => great experience and economical very good facilities clean and in the heart of city having ket at walking distance  
P => Pleased with my stay     Inspite of some bad reviews on the net I took a chance and stayed at the park during my last trip to Delhi  Ive stayed at quotThe parkquot Calcutta on several occasions where I found the room service and food to be top notch   the prices were pretty spectacular too I must add The property in Delhi was pretty good and I guess if one is not familiar with the design amp service philospy of the park group   the rooms amp ambience might seem a tad strange  All the fittings in my room and bath were fine   i was really pleased that my room had atleast half a dozen plug points  
P => Funky glitzy Indian Five star One of the pretenders to being a great hotel in Delhi with an Indian twist The or is utterly modernistic though not arty in my view with the lobby full of glaring shades  However it just cant match the class of the Imperial or hotels like Intercontinetal at Barakhamba Total business friendly Claridges or even the Ashok Excellent value for MoneyThe rooms are very small when compared to the large ones i have stayed at Intercon or Ashok Everything else is quite good at part with any Five star though nothing home to write about  Would recommend this to anybody who has business at CP in delhi though Intercontinental is better in opinion The quotFirequot is a happening Nightspot and pool not heated  Gym is quite good and the staff polite and cultivated   a sea change from the ashok  
P => Love the disco theque  I was staying at The park at cannht place many times  I find the hotel interrior is excellent amp good hospitality  They are having the very good break fast swimming pool amp pub  Try this  Restaurant is very expenssive  INR  for one person minimum for good lunch or dinner  There are recption staff are not helping and asking  INR for one print which is unusual in India  Overall the stay was wonderfull  
P => Chic and stylish in a central location Im a fan of The Park chain of properties in india and The Park New Delhi demonstrates why The hotel itself features stylish rooms great service and an excellent location  Wining and dining on the property attracts the famous and not so famous wannabees to the range of bars and restaurants but for the travellers i have to say that the food is some of the best I have found in any hotel in Delhi The Park New Delhi offers a very contemporary take on Indian hospitality   and one which I am always happy to accept when I am in the city  
P => Functional but unfriendly Excellent location bang in Connht place tar mantar close to offices of Govt and financial establishments good clean area of Delhi  The hotel is hygenic quick but unfriendly  Guests are tolerated because you pay   star facilities provided as entitlement not with a smile of hospitality  OK for a quick business trip

P => Agi Pub Rocks at this Place Rooms are clean and comfortable  The location is excellent and you are centrally located but inspite of this hotel being in CP there is no noise in the rooms  Best part of this place specially if you are a party animal is the pub cum disc   The Agni  The place is live and kicking till  in the morning so for all party lovers and thirsty crows this is the place You can get good food till late hours 
P => Over rated This hotel is very contemporary but not classy  Things dont look luxurious but rather a little on the cheap side  Room furnishings looked a little tired and worn Lobby and bar are not large enough Poolside is okay   nice for morning yoga before anyone gets up  
P => The park again very good hotel with beuatiful multi cuisine restaurant 
P => Its a Ok hotel Visited this hotel on a business visit and was the hotel was ok not that great  Can t have a business meetings inside hotel very loud eating area rooms are too small it s a much compact hotel and can t get clients here for a business deals  Ambiance is not that great but staff and service is very good  Overall for business don t select this hotel but at a low price if you have work outside and just want to come back and sleep in this hotel then its ok 
P => Loved the room Hotel park at Delhi  its loacted at New delhi main city  Very close to cannought place and we had taken a Suit which was the most amazing room I had ever seen   I was in the th floor with perfect ambience and perfect climate at delhi  It was a magnificient room and the bathroom was very beautifully made  I have stayed their for  nights  Hotel also had beautiful restaurant at the top floor with a beautiful view   they have a pub downstairs  shopping is easy as ket is close by   Good Food  Good service and everything was Perfect   
P => Better options Available I Stayed at this property for only one night at their standard room The check inn was a breeze and absoluetely no issues there The hotel is in need of some major maintainence which u notice while walking towards the room  As u see walls chippingpaint faiding dirty carpet e t cThe rooms though very modernand upto date As they were recently reateda couple of years back  The rooms are very clean though a tad smaller in size Afamily with even a small child will face problem The bathrooms again were very clean and were of comfortable size They have a small pool so those who like their pool workouts beter check The biggest disappointment is their spaatrociusly priced and not big enough at all The gym is ok but they dont have any steam and jacuzziplus their sauna was a mouse hole I tried one of their treatments and i was less then impressed While checking out i kept on waiting for the bell boy for an hour to take my luggage to the reception for my settelemnt of billsbut despite calling twice he didn t turn up So with my small child in my lap i had to take my luggage down on my ownThe hotel entrance is very stylish and chic  But overal if u r looking for luxury and leasure there are much better properties available in very close proximity in same prices Properties which are big and comfortable  
P => central place The hotel is located in the central business district of New Delhi and hence is very suitabel for busienss travellers  They have very good club rooms and the or is exceptional Food at the fire is really inative and good  
P => Very accessible and luxurious hotel The Park is situated in the heart of Delhi and thats the biggest plus for a business traveller    Its a nice luxurious hotel nothing much to complain about a typical nice  star hotel with a typically nice Indian hospitality  
P => Comfortable and prime location The Hotel location is ideal being in the CBD and just oppsite my office  The hotel tends to be noisy due to a constant influx of tourists at all times  The coffee shop has a good menu at all times  However the staff is not very efficient  Best part of the coffee shop is the buffet  You have to plan to avoid peak times to get a seat  rooms are very comfortable and well laid out  Cleanliness and house keeping as well as other services are good  The front desk staff is good  
P => Bad first impression The Park attempts to fit itself into the W genre of hotels albeit failing pretty miserably  I will try to make this really short  Night club music audible at least in my room until  am  Not good considering I had just gotten off a  hour flight and had an early call time   The lobby and front is infested with mosquitoes    Understandably even though I have long hair and am male there is no need to be openly making fun of me for looking like a female  at least to the staff I might have  very unprofessional   Rooms are nicely orated but removing  ornamental pillows from my bed before finally being able to go to sleep is no fun   Room had a glass case with relic in it even though it might seem cool at first really it doesnt say so much about the value placed on such important pieces of ones history   No wireless It just wasnt that great especially for the price  If you read my review of the Trident in Agra you will notice I mention breakfast at AM  The staff at the Park were only willing to sell us two day old pastries  So much for the complimentary breakfast Im sure theres better hotels to stay at in Delhi  Unless you like to party until  am and dont want to deal with trying to find your way home stay here  All in one  
P => Not sure about the bathrooms The hotel is of  star standard but trying to be  star and not making it  The rooms are a good size but I didnt like the frosted glass walled bathrooms which wereny very private  The rooms were clean and included TV DVD hair dryer kettle  mini bar etc  The lifts were rather slow and one of the  was out of action  The breakfast was good and there is space to sit outside  Theres a pool but I didnt have time to use it  The bar is very expensive    rupees or   for a small bottle of beer I would consider staying here again but I wouldnt drink at the bar 
P => Very nice Hotel  Clean Hotel Room fine Bathroom   large bath would take a week to fill   Shower a little awkward to work   but of no great consequence  Pool is outside we didnt use it as it was still quite cool for outdoor bathing  The Hotel is located at the end of an Avenue oposite a Conservatory Small park it is   minutes away from a busy shopping area  We only went down this street once found it a little overpowering and crowded also everyone wanted to either sell us something or quotBe our Guidequot for a fee of courseThe Restaurant in the Reception was quite casual and served all kinds of food  The buffet looked very nice indeed we didnt sample it because it was our first visit to India and we were over cautious at first with regards to food  The Breakfast was very nice  self service  The food we were served in the Restauirant was hot and well cooked  The staff in the Restaurant and Reception were friendly and helpfull  
P => Stylish but expensive if work is not paying  The Park was an unusual choice by our tour group which doesnt really want or expect posh hotels like this but it was a good start and end to the trip  The hotel is clearly upket well designed and stylish in the entrance hall and bedrooms  The staff are very friendly and service was always with a smile although felt a little slow on reception I cant say whether its good value but the hotel is certainly popular with the local wealthy kids and they seem to have a nightclub on Saturday nights so be warned not to get a room too close to the ground floor as it disturbed a number of people in our group  Given that a coffee cost us    when we arrived everything was very expensive compared to the rest of India generally and Rs for an hour of internet connection shows this is more a business hotel  Water and food is better found outside the hotel unless you have deep pockets or work is picking up the bill  
P => Noisy Hotel Expensive Restaurant This hotel is in close proximity of Connht Place where my husband had dung thrown on his shoes in an attempt to mug himThe hotel is clean but there are stains on the carpet and a noisy disco  Although the restaurant has a good choice the prices are expensive 
P => dirty and overpriced yes a friendly staff but not very professional Two of us stayed here two rooms on business in early ruary  for six night  During the course of our stay we also went to three other hotels in New Delhi for meetings  All three were better   muchmuch better than The Park so much so that we asked for room rates while at each and found that these others Imperial Taj and one other Im forgetting  Claridges were in the same price range  Ive never bothered writing a review before but this place cost so much and the rooms were so filthy and rundown that I had to warn others  Im not sure if the other reviews here are from real people or from the hotel theyre just too positive  The staff was all pleasant and the area by the pool isnt unattractivebut the loudobnoxious and constant music there made even a normal conversation almost impossible  I was certain the sockets in my room would explode so I unplugged my laptop and other electrical devices everyday  The wait staff was in the hotel restaurant was friendly but there are so many working that they get in each others waysitting multiple parties at one table without knowing theyve done so  We will not return  
P => Nice rooms but noisy We stayed at the Park for  nights  We arrived late on the Friday night and a hotel car picked us up from Indri Gandhi airport   a good call as its a bit much when you step off the plane The hotel itself is nice and central  Security in high force  Room ent size and modern   although not especially clean particularly the bathroom  The rooms are not sound proofed and the road outside is very busy   lots of beeping as with everywhere in India and shouting   perhaps this was as it was Friday and Saturday night  There was also a lot of pigeons and no nails or anything on the outside window sill to stop loads of them landing and cooing constantly  The bar area is obviously party central for rich Indians   and probably fun if you can join in  But we had a am start so we ate in Fire very tasty   lovely pepper chocolate truffles with the bill and headed to bed  When we checked out at am after disturbances in the hallway throughout the night   despite being on the th floor   the bar was just kicking out  Whilst it was nothing compared to London bars   it was still off putting for an expensive hotel and there was a number of drunk men hanging around   even the receptionist seemed embarrassed  On the plus side   the travel centre sorted out some changes in our itinerary and booked some train travel for us   they were very helpful  
P => Wonderful birthday weekend From the moment we stopped our vehicle we were escourted to the front desk and immediately received attention  Due to it being our birthday weekend we were upgraded and treated like a king and queen  The rooms were tastefully orated  The bath tub which an entire family could fit in was the highlight  We enjoyed that thoroughly  The room was warm and comfortable and the bathrooms were tidy and clean  The room service was excellent and food was divine  Our birthday morning was so special  All the staff wished us  At breakfast we were well taken care off the waiters always on the go  Even though it was our birthdays my husband and I noticed that this is the overall treatment of all guests which was excellent to behold  Nowhere did we see such enthusiasm in being so helpful  We admired that about the staff at the hotel  We certainly left with wonderful memories and an unforgetable birthday  
P => Not worth the money Exterior is ugly but in good location  Interior is retro and rather nice but in need of updating due to wear and tear We booked a luxury room and paid a luxury price for it however the room was very small and although attractive there was absolutely nothing luxury about it The bathroom was also very small and the moldy grouting dirty toiletries lack of towels and not at all fresh smelling made me very resentful of the price I had paid The worst part of our stay was the LOUD THUMPING music that was playing until am on both of the nights we stayed at the hotel  Our travel agents omitted to inform us that the hotel has a very renowned barclub that attracts all the young generation in Delhi  In fact it is so popular that the music does not end until am My husband called reception at  am to ask what all the noise was about and he was told that they did not know what he referring to  As we were checking out at am the next day we saw for ourselves exactly what had caused the vibrations that had been coming through our pillows I was fuming As a small boutique hotel they are certainly not equipped to be hosting late night parties and then denying knowing any reason of where noise is coming from when grouchy guests call reception when they are woken upThe service generally was rubbish and we didnt even get a goodbye from the receptionist when we were checking out  The only good thing about the hotel is the location ent food and moderate or  Other than that it is overpriced rooms are too small staff are rude and the loud music is really off putting when trying to get to sleep I would NOT stay there again 
P => Bad services rude staff This is another expensive hotel in Delhi    The hotel itself is nice good well orated rooms  But the service and staff is terrible  Got a wake up call at am that was not required later I discover it was by mistake  Despite telling the operator that I didnt require that wake up call I got a reminder wake up call at  unbelievable  Complained again and to complete the mess got someone coming to my room at  to offer a T Shirt from an ongoing convention  My original plan was to wake up at  and leave for a working day While checking out did complain to the staff who was incredibly rude asking me to wait for the manager   The manager came and with that face and eyes looking for nowhere said quotIm sorryquot and that was it  be that was a very unlucky day for me but Ill never take a chance in this hotel again  
P => Interesting and different Apart from the excessive wait to have our luggage delivered to our room   Tip   wrestle the porter and take it yourself   I can recommend Centrally located and a short walk from Central Cottage Industries  a must Gin and Tonic in the bar is good but at a price that would make you faint   Rooms very modern and lovely bathroom although the glass enclosure would be rather offputting if you were suffering from Delhi Belly and wanted a bit of privacy from your room mate Breakfast is not to be missed with a Dosa and Omlette chef and smoked salmon  
P => OLD and RUN DOWN  NEED A FULL MAKEOVER IMMEDIATELY This hotel is very run down  Everthing is old and run down The lights and stuff is also old and run down and dont always workThe key has to be swiped several times in order to work Food is too expensive and in fact for the condition that hotel is in the hotel price is far to expensive and should not be regarded as a five star hotel  Staff is helpful and friendly but slow Rather stay at the Le Meridien for the same price and get a better new mordern hotel  
P => Where are we We stayed here on two accasions between tour on our India Holiday  I must say that from the outset l felt as if we were back in the s in Australia It is indeed different and somwehat corny  The hotel is fitted out as the s which is OK but indeed different The drinks and food were excellent in fact at breakfast whilse we ate European the staff presented us with a dish of varied indian foods and explained it all to us  Greatly appreciated On our second time to the hotel we were treated like royalty  Tips do work  We were upgraded andcould not have asked for better service Location is good just watch for the Monkeys Next time l would prefer a more Indian Hotel l think  
P => Bad Management The amenities in the hotel some how above the average of most of the other hotels in Delhi  However it shows that its getting old and need a complete makeover But the reason why I wouldnt stay in that hotel again is the StaffStaff is very very uneducated including the managers  Give them any chance they will try to fool you and try to make the life somewhat easier for themselves And the most horrible thing is they dont have any limits when they are asking for the bill  Doesnt matter if you are resting by the pool or exercising at the gym somebody will come and question you about what you are doing there    
P => Liked The Park This is a nice hotel  It is in a very good location for walking into Connht Circus walking to the Bangla Sahib Temple and is directly opposite the ta Mantar observatory  The food was good and the rooms clean and quite civilised  
P => Bad value for money I stayed at the Park for business purposes  It is a modern hotel futuristic meets retro with beautiful rooms    lots of glass and ble and nice amenities  However the fundamentals of this hotel are extremely week  There is a  hour dance bar on the main floor however no matter what floor you are on you hear the pounding beat    I was on the th floor a colleague was on the th floor and we both heard it  It woke me up around  am and you can also hear people from outside  If you want to sleep this is not a good bet  Another poor feature is the lack of expertise of the hotel staff  The front desk is staffed by very young beautiful locals but they are horribly inexperienced verging on inept  For example I was having problems with my room key and went down to complain I could not get into my room  The front desk staff gave me another electronic key I went back up to find the same problem  I went down again and they asked me if I had the right room  I had to argue with them    it was quite ridiculous especially at pm when you just want to get to your room and get ready for bed The restaurant is quite nice and it is near some shopping areas so the location is good but overall I felt this was very poor value for money I think the room was around  USD per night  I would not recommend it  
P => A relaxing end to a hectic fortnight    We stayed here for our last night in India having travelled on the overnight train from Kathgodam  We arrived at the hotel at   a m  and within fifteen minutes they had a room ready for us at no extra charge The staff were friendly and the rooms were clean Yes it wasnt cheap but it was a relaxing last day in India  We found the taxis a few yards away from the hotel better value than the ones that were at the door and we used these for our final journey to the airport  
P => Park Hotel in Delhi close to the airport We had an extra night in Delhi and were given the Park  It is a very nice clean hotel  However it did not have that much character and was overall a little cold atmosphere  The bathroom is huge nice to have the TV in there  Too pricey for what you get however 
P => Nice Hotel Expensive I liked this Hotel  The hotel is themed is earth wind fire water and sky  This is done in a sophisticated way and makes a change from standard hotel chains  All the staff I met were very helpful and were eager to make sure my stay was good My room was lvery clean arge and spacious with a huge bath and a big LCD TV DVD player internet connection and IPOD dock  The best feature of my room had to be the wheat grass growing in trough across the width of my room The food was also very good and I really like the bar The only downside of this hotel is the price Watch out for the luxury tax on top of the rate  I paid  INR a night with taxes on top  
P => A Crazy Place with Some Hope The hotel is not worth the money  The staff was very good and very helpful and my room on the th floor was pretty awesome  ble floors no mats in the bathroom with a large ble bathtub and flat screen TV  Pretty nice  But that was contrasted by dirty carpet in the hallways a dingy front entry and dirty elevators  To use the pool you have to walk through the main restaurant    which is awkward when you are wearing swim shorts and no shoes The spa and work out room are very good  So the rooms on the th floor and the spa are great but the value and cleanliness of the hotel are pretty lacking  Only stay here if there is nothing else available    which is what I did  
P => Overpriced but likeable Hotels in this category are Im told geared toward the business traveler hence the price tag  The price to value ratio has little meaning for the nonbusiness traveler  All hotels in this category are severely overpriced and youll have to look long and hard for a less expensive place that does not have some kind of unhappy or scary story attached  We stayed with a small tour group so I dont know what we paid but Im sure it was a significant price break That said we liked the Park  We stayed three nights  At check in we asked for an upper floor room got one on the th and it was just fine  Yes its a bit shabby and worn around the edges  The hallway floor creaked and bounced and carpets were well amusing  The staff was friendly eager and helpful  I had no problems at the front desk as mentioned in other postings  Its supposed to be a quotdesignerquot hotel and I guess it is  Pink burgundy and baby blue hanging beads cloud photo mural in the elevators  Its no quotWquot but so what a sense of humor is helpful The location is ok within walking distance to Connht Circle reputed to be a major commercial district  Well I guess so and it is the majorluxury hotel district but keep in mind youre in New Delhi not London or Paris New York or LA  Its very noisy and crowded  Like everything in Dehli its shabby and worn out  Anyway Delhi is very spread out lots of different neighborhoods so convenient placement has less meaning The restaurant was pretty good  We had a few light meals and they were tasty  We did not try the more expensive fancier restaurant to the right of the front desk  Service was a bit slow but not unusually so for India  The breakfast buffet was pretty darn good  Very extensive  Even more than passable dim sum with commercial sauces  Some of the western entries cold cuts and cheese were pretty strange  And whats with the baked beans anyway all over India at breakfast  Eggs are very good and tasty  Try the little white rice flour cakes that you sprinkle with ghee and spice mix   yumbo  Bacon is fatty but good and chicken breakfast sausage is a place you  not want to go I did and lived All in all Id stay there again if I could afford it  But next time Ill search out smaller hotels and b and bs an up and coming category  
P => Not what you would expect The Park hotel is situated pretty far from city center at least if that s what you call it in New Delhi  Part of the rooms has a nice garden view visitors of the other part can enjoy nothing but construction works all over around  I ve been to Delhi on a business trip with some important colleagues and had to choose a good place to stay in  Considering my experience I can say that The Park is definitely not a  stars hotel  On one hand it is supposed to be stylish has all sort of bathroom compliments usual for the level requested bathrobe and slippers which I myself was afraid to put on pretty big room and night service  On the other hand what you ll have in reality is dirty towels shabby furniture muddy carpet and very old bathtub  Since I had one evening left from business diners I tried the local restaurant which turned out to be a buffet  It was eatable but not tasty  While leaving one of my colleagues paid for the minibar  For the first time in my life I became a witness of staff checking your minibar in case you lied while leaving  The reception guy told me that one member of our group didn t pay for cola or something I paid it myself  Later on it turned out to be that everything had already been paid my colleague even showed me the bill with that cola mentioned  Be careful while checking outAll and all this was a  hotel  As I understood it s a common situation in New Delhi  There exist luxurious hotels like Tadj Mahal hotel for example  But the average price would be at about   dollars per night  You can use the Park hotel for the short business stay in Delhi although you would definitely be disappointed considering  dollar per night you d paid  
P => Think before you stay here We stayed here for  nights The customer service was appalling until we complained bitterly to the duty manager We arrived at pm the first night had to wait until  am to access our room and the sheets were dirty and also the carpet We ended up staying on the nd floor  Dont do it  It is right above the nightclub  You will not sleep at all until after am  We complained  times from midnight and they kept saying oh it wont last long and it does not happen often  At pm they offered us another room we had to be up for a tour in  hoursWe were moved up floors  days later and we thought we might as well join them in the nightclub and guess what We left at am make sure you stay very high in this hotel The breakfast and Fire restaurant were the good elements of this hotel  
P => Great location but a bit shabby around the edges We loved the location of this hotel   really enjoyed exploring crowded Connht Place make a trip to Fab India had a fun dinner at DV watching cricket with the locals   and its close to most sites but its a bit shabby  The public spaces were a little dirty and the room had a hint of grubbiness to it  The linens have seen better days  I do want to mention that the housekeeping staff was very friendly and always asked if we needed anything when we greeted them in the halls  The rates at this hotel were similar to others in its category so if you are considering a larger hotel like The Park I would recommend you choose another in this area  
P => Rooms Vary I stayed at the Park two nights as part of a tour  The rooms vary my room on the fifth floor was quite nice but those in our group with rooms on the third floor went sleepless because of the noise and reverberation from the disco  The included buffet breakfasts were acceptable  If you dare to leave the hotel you will be surrounded by taxi drivers rickshaw drivers kids vendors etc  This is the worst city I have ever visited  I didnt go to Kolkata  Delhi is a  hour traffic jam 
P => The Park is a disappointment I stayed there for four nights and was almost continuously disappointed by this hotel  Service turned out to be highly inconsistent  Housekeeping was poor no complimentary bottled water was provided after my arrival and I had to chase down the staff every day to get the complimentary bottles promised by the hotel  One day three of the four towels in the room disappeared and were not replaced until I went after the staff  Toilet paper wasn t replaced either  The mini bar was never re stocked throughout my stay  The air conditioning unit was unable to produce anything other than cold air regardless of which settings were selected a nuisance during chilly winter nights  It was also impossible to raise the blinds to let in some sunlight  The bath room did look snazzy but had its own problems there was no discernible means of ventilation and the flimsiness of the shower curtain made it impossible to use the shower without flooding the entire room  The public areas were fairly cramped especially the lobby  The breakfast buffet was adequate but unexciting one morning the staff would not turn on the lights in a large part of the breakfast area for more than half an hour leaving guests to eat in the dark  Admittedly the unreliability of the staff had its benefits on one occasion the waiter refused to let me sign for a coffee and piece of cake which as a result did not show up on my final bill  Even so I would have gladly traded this freebie for greater consistency of service overall  The attached restaurant  Fire  is quite pleasant and the food is good but the incessant self glorification of the staff and their obsession with questionnaires are enough to spoil anyone s dining experience  The airport pick up was a major rip off the hotel charges the equivalent of USD  for a pick up from Gandhi International a multiple of what even the most ruthless taxi driver would dare to ask for  It deserves notice that a genuinely classy classy place like The Imperial a block away offers free transfers from and to the airport  All in all I got the impression that The Park is keen to create a superficial impression of classiness that is not backed up by an effort to provide consistent service and red by brazen rip offs  It is hard to think of a reason to choose this place over others  If you are willing to spend several hundred dollars a night it makes much more sense to pay a little extra and stay at a genuinely five star hotel such as the the Oberoi or the Imperial  Otherwise save some money by choosing a ent place without the feeble five star pretensions of The Park  I would not stay there again  
P => One of the best hotel experiences I ever had I stayed in a deluxe room for  nights  The hotel staff has been the friendliest I have ever seen in any hotel I stayed  The Breakfast buffet lunch and dinner buffet are absolutely amazing  It is a very chique hotel with good looking young employees a stunning bar that is packed with young people during the weekend and a very nice pool not too big thoughI can only recommend this place and if you wanna go party in Delhi this is a perfect place to stay 
P => Good location but definitely overpriced I stayed in The Park in Dehli for  nights in ober  on a holiday tour through India  The hotel is located near Connht Place which is great  However the hotel is seriously overpriced and the service is just average for Indian standards  i e we booked a pick up from the airport and I received two confirmation e mails  Of course there was no driver expecting us and neither was an apology offered at the hotel  The rooms are rather small and the bathrooms are meant to be quotdesignedquot unfortunately   the designer forgot a bit about functionality       so they are rather wet rooms made of glass  Food is also rather mainstream and the breakfast is terrible with very limited variety unless you fancy a curry in the morning Because the hotel is very central in Dehli it is quite noisy too and the hotel certainly contributes with some loud music around the pool at night too  
P => Much better than expected I had read some negative reviews of this hotel but my wife and I   and our two friends   were most impressed   and particularly by the excellent attitude of ALL the staff we met  Smiles and helpful suggestions were standard  We arrived at  a m  but were checked into high quality rooms quickly and efficiently  The breakast room is very large and bright and one can also eat outside in the large garden  The range of breakfast foods is good and eggsomelettes are cooked to order  The pool is great and the bar round the pool stays open till well into the evening  Drink prices are quite high   but this is the case in all the hotels in Delhi  The only negative in The Park is the noise from the disco if your room is near it  The hotel is rated quotthe most happening place in townquot we were told  Our room was immediately above the disco and I but not my wife found ear plugs necessary on one of the four nights we stayed  I made a casual comment about the noise to one of the staff the next day and we were surprised that we were immediately offered a room change   but it wasnt worth the bother of re packing 
P => Carry Your Own Bags If you are looking for the following from a hotel then the Park in Delhi is for you Noise all night including weekdays Lifts not working RECEPTION who say they have called porters to pick up your bags BUT DO NOT COME so advise is build up your muscles before booking  RECEPTION constantly baggering yopu to enquire when you will leave when the know you are there for one sleepless night anyway Poor breakfastSo if this what you desire in a hotel then the Park in Delhi is the one for you  
P => Not that great My husband and I stayed in this hotel after staying in the overpriced Qutab Residency  This hotel was US a night which is also over priced  All hotels in Delhi seem to be overpriced The outside doesnt look like much but the lobby is quite intersting with a velvet ladies washroom beaded curtains etc  The front desk staff are quite nice and speak good english  However it does take awhile to check in for some reason The pool is very nice The rooms look just like they do on the website complete with a plasma tv and frosted glass walled washrooms  The shower is really nice with a lot of pressure  The bed is extreemly comfortable and the room is clean and modern The breakfast is really really good and I believe is included in the price  We had supper here and it was terrible  The restaurant was called quotaquaquot I believe Everywhere in India is expensive to stay  One really bad thing is our last night in this hotel we heard the thumping from the night club all night long that is on one of the first few floors  I actually had to wear ear plugs to sleep  We had to leave the hotel at am for our flight and the music was still blasting at that time  We liked the hotel but didnt like the price but all hotels in Delhi are expensive and you dont get value for the dollar  However at least it is clean  Just try to get as far from the nightclub as possible  It is also pretty discouraging to look out your window and see the poverty from your glamorous suite below  
P => Loved the restaurant pool and staff Park Hotel had a cool swimming pool area which is lively on Sundays  The rooms are contemporary small but filled with all mod cons  The two restaurants are excellent   we went to Fire three times and were treated like royalty by the staff   the chef even came out with a complementary specially made desert for us on our last night  Staff go out of their way to help you have a great holiday  
P => Modern  The Park is a very modern and trendy hotel  It does have a far eastern feel to it  the rooms are small but comfortable  The staff attentive and very helpful  The only negative is the bathrooms which are v v small with a sliding door   with zero privacy  No bath tub pl note The breakfast buffet was very good and its a good place to stay for a single corporate traveller Definitely not for families   
P => Looks great in a magazine Im sure Average to stay at  The Park Hotel in Delhi must look great in some magazine  It must have won some design awards for its hip and trendy interior Which is reason enough for normal people to STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM THIS MESS  Now obviously as a luxury hotel this is better than staying in a van by the river  and truth be told the rooms are quite good we had a luxury suite or whatever  And its not exactly the hotels fault if nouveau riche indian cybertreneurs insist on advertising their coolness by making a habit of standing in the hallway and talking loudly on their mobile phones however some things are the hotels fault  For one the lobby is an unmitigated disaster  its loud as hell  its chaotic  when i asked to schedule a trip with the concierge i was taken into a smoky and ky back office  the front desk staff is overworked and lacks a good communication system   they needed many things repeated our check out date several times  people are standing around with luggage everywhere   its cramped  its just a bloody mess  fair enough   the new park was built inside the concrete carcarss of an older hotel  but it should have been done with people not design awards in mind the restaurants are overpriced  I was charged US  for a bottle of wine that would cost BE  at a wine shop   though the service was indifferent at best  the food at the outdoor restaurant was hardly worth the price    cold pizza  Other food room service was better  The pool is made for looking good in some magazine   not for actually swimming  Considering that our bill with food was over  for  days Id say you can do much much better  A good hotel at this price would have us enjoying all of its amenities comfortably  Instead we found ourselves hiding in our room from the rest of the hotel Next time im in Delhi I will try a different hotel  
P => Tricked by false website images    The website shows a really cool modern hotel with neat restaurant and bar  The truth   Its a run down old hotel with a modern lobby  We ate in a converted banquet room that felt like quotThe Shiningquot  Our room was darker and dirtier than a s Howard Johnson  After complaining relentlessly about the false advertising the manager let us stay in the  and only room that was quotdesignedquot as the prototype and used on the website  Granted that room was cool but the whole experience was a joke  
P => Very Modern and Chic Stayed here for  nights split across a tour of northern India Overall the Park is very clean the interior and theme throughout is modern chic  The rooms are on the small side but still very nice and well equipped all that you would expect  This is not a  star hotel as claimed but would definately give it a  star status The staff were friendly and helpful and I was upgraded to a superior room on my second visit The hotel is also in a good location and very central Connht place is a few minutes walk away  The only minus is that the bar is very expensiveOverall a pleasant experience  
P => Chic but small We just returned from two weeks travelling around India and were unsure where we would be staying our last night in Delhi   we were pleasently surprised to be at The Park   just steps away from the shopping of Connht Place and the Government Emporiums   after an eight hour car journey down from the mountains we walked into a hip and bustling modern design lobby and were greated by young friendly desk staff   the room was also very modern and fun even though we had one of the smaller rooms it was great   the only complaint as other people have mentioned was that the bathroom did not offer much privacy and since we both had a touch of Delhi belly      Having spent the prior three nights in an old world Raj type hotel moving to the Park just highlighted the complex and beautiful spectrum that is India   with its maginifcent history and its current place as an emerging modern powerhouse   India seems to be all about extremes    since elections were going on and the shops were closed during the day and we had done our sightseeing on a previous stay in Delhi we had a chance to relax at the great pool with the giant disco ball and enjoy the outdoor space   definitely would stay here again 
P => Quirky and fun but    Stayed at Park for  nights at the beginning of ch   On enteringthe hotel you are confronted by a bustling lobby that would look moreat home in an art gallery  Very modern very chic  And this modernisttheme continues throughout all of the facilities on the ground floor From the Fire restaurant which I didnt eat at but is said to be very good to the pool bar with its huge disco ball illuminating the goings onThe rooms are very pleasant and well equipped  Dark wooden floors LCD TV DVD player library of discs apparently available on request  Strangely the bathroom wasnt up to the standard of the rest of the room and whilst OK did look a bit out of place  The hotel location is great for exploring central Delhi but does suffer from being a bit noisy as you would expect I found the staff to be exceptionally friendly and couldnt do enoughto make my business trip as pleasant as possible  Overall a very enjoyable stay  
P => Good Experience Finding a hotel room for  people in Delhi is a challenge  We were very pleased with the Park both in terms of the room restaurant location and service  When a complication arose in our schedule the hotel management went out of its way to accommodate our group  They even hosted a reception for the group to thank us for our patience in working through the scheduling issues  
P => Overpriced but comfortable and conveniently located This is a very comfortable hotel but like all Delhi hotels seriously overpriced  This hotel would cost half the price in most other parts of the world  That said the staff were very helpful and responded to all requests for service promptly  The location is good with a park across the road allowing a peaceful walk and only  metres to Connht Place  
P => Deserves a positive mention There is an obvious difficulty rating a property such as this when for the previous four weeks accomodation in Rajahstan has been generally of a much lesser standard  Having said that it was overall a positive experience The negatives   expensive food and beverage but whats new generally overcrowded lobby bathroom not adequately soundproofed from the bedroom generally a problem with sliding doors aggressive taxi drivers just off the forecourt but likely beyond the control of the hotel The positives   lots of staff who were uniformally efficient and courteous good location great beds spotlessly clean dinner by the pool a spacious residents lounge We would go again  
P => It grows on you We stayed at the Park on the first and last nights of a group tour First impressions of the hotel were not good with a brash foyer absolutely packed with tourists arriving and leaving chaotic However the room was super modern and spotless with space age facilities The english buffet breakfast on the last day was superb and very welcome after  days of curry Would recommend highly but re organise the reception  
P => They charge a lot for what you get You cannot criticize the hotel for the rooms  Although they are a tad on the small size the overall impression is very good  The hotel location is really good within easy walking distance of the Tourist Offices and all the fancy shops in Connht Circle  We also walked from here down to India Gate and the Parliament buildings without any difficulty or hassle  The problem with the Park is that they just charge too much money for what they offer  This is a good hotel but not a  star hotel and they want a lot of money  The breakfasts are very good but you will find the bar prices to be absurd  The latter is quite common all through northern India by the way    rupees is common for a beer whereas in Goa the price is    Funny thing Goa is crawling with tourists but you will be surprised at how few tourists you see in the Golden Triangle  Anway we found that the Park liquor prices were higher than the Imperial which is very definitely a  or  star hotel go figure Dont fail to go for dinner at the United Coffee Shop which is quite close  Best food in India and very cheap  The Imperial has an incredible restaurant but prices are way up there The heavy set tuk tuk driver who will press you a little bit as you leave the hotel is actually very good and quite helpful   rupees goes a long way with these guys in Delhi  Beware the touts lurking around Connht place  Virtually everthing they tell you will turn out to be a lie  
P => Really liked the Park Hotel We stayed in this hotel for two nights at the end of a tour of Rajasthan  Contrary to reviews that I have seen we found it to be excellent in most respects the only exception being that in the evening we heard some drilling and banging from the floor above us   presumably where rooms are being rebuilt  We found the ambience including ultra modern furnishings pleasant and relaxing  The room was more than large enough with the largest bed that I have ever seen   over  metres wide  The staff were anxious to please and invariably smiling and pleasant   if there have been service problems in the past then the management must be working hard to address this We did not eat dinner here but found the breakfast fresh and comprehensive I would definitely recommend this hotel  
P => Better than the reviews suggest I have to say that I am quite shocked at all the negative reviews of The Park Hotel it is in my opinion a great place to stay  Its possible that some of these reviewers are expecting the Shangrila or the Imperial but I doubt if they will find a room at the same rate in one of those hotels  The Park is quite different to the standard Indian  star hotel  They have completely reated the hotel to a very modern but kinda funky style which is IMHO very refreshing  Im not an expert on interior design but its kinda like what a science fiction writer of the early s would envision a hotel in the year  would look like  If youve ever seen quotSleeperquot or quotA Clockwork Orangequot youll understand what I mean  RoomsThe rooms are admittedly a little small compares with other hotels in Delhi but in all honesty it really doesnt bother me although I do understand why it might bother some  If you are looking for big rooms this is not your hotel The rooms are comfortable although they are lacking perhaps a nice comfortable armchair but thats probably due to the space factor  There are plenty of pillows on the bed which is perfect for me   saves me having to constantly ask housekeeping for more There is a wide screen LCD TV in every room which is a nice touch and theres also a DVD player so bring some movies with you from home  I undertand there are films available from the hotel but I didnt try The bathroom is a very nice design though as mentioned in previous posts the door is opaque which might bother some  Restaurants and BarsThere are  restaurants and  bars   Fire is an excellent Indian restaurant and Agni is a very hip bar  Mist is the standard hotel  hour restaurant though very funky and Aqua is an outdoor poolside bar  Breakfast is in Mist and is typical hotel buffet breakfast and very adequate LocationCant get much better for location   its right in the center of town  minutes from Connht Place  Its not set in acres of parkland like some other Delhi hotels but those hotels arent walking distance from shopping restaurants etc like the Park is ServiceThis is where I REALLY disagree with the other reviews  I find the service at the Park to be as good if not better than other Delhi hotels  for example I got a phone call at pm one night from the hotel sales manager who invited me downstairs to the bar for complimentary cocktails  He met me in the bar and introduced himself and explained that he likes to meet with the hotels guests  He was an extremely pleasant fellow and was very open about the high cost of rooms in Delhi at the moment and offered some advice on how to get better rates   not just at the Park   He also arranged a pm late checkout at no extra charge for me  Its treatment like this that will gain my repeat business and that is what I call good service  Beyond that all hotel staff is in my opinion extremely courteous and friendly  All in all The Park is not super luxury but it is still a very good hotel especially if you appreciate things a little bit different to the ordinary One thing to take into consideration   The Luxury Tax that is levied on all hotel rooms in Delhi is charged at the rack rate not at the discount rate  This is a goverment regulation and has nothing to do with the hotel  
P => Overpriced by at least   Overpriced  start property pretending to be a  starWhat strikes you the moment you enter THE PARK NEW DELHI s lobby is that the website fooled you into believing what it said This place is definitely not  star  It qualifies for a good  star status  But for sure not  star The lobby is small but clean and modern art o types not my type for sure  The staff I found was prompt and the lady who escorted my family to the room took pains to be courteous and pleasant  Good  The porter who brought the luggage to the room looked menacing dont know whyThe walls in the pathway isle of my floor were having stain ks which I first mistook as ble designThe room I paid for was deluxe premium and it turned out to be quite small  They could have definitely made it much bigger than this at least considering what I shelled out for it The furnishings in the room are good but you really cant enjoy it as the size gets to you  The semi transparent translucentbathroom walls are a radical idea and  not gel well with families The food is way overpriced  I guess prices could be slashed by   to make it feel reasonable  We were not happy with what we got and felt uneasy Another important points  remember to ask if the hotel is undergoing reation  The lady who escorted us to the room when we checked in gave me  bad news     Gym etc  are all under reation and there is repair going on through the day so be ready for some noise  Why dont they mention it on their website I  not have booked in this place had I known that the Gym will be closedOverall a plush  star property way overpriced  At leat from an Indian point of view  
P => Overrated   dont be fooled by the website I booked The Park on the basis of some positive guidebook mentions and the cool contemporary rooms featured on the website  On arrival we were shown a boring outdated room in drab brown amp when I complained was told that only  floors have the updated rooms  I was then shown a contemporary room it was tiny and the soft furnishings were stained  After protesting again that nothing I had seen so far was worth the rate I had paid I was finally transferred to a suite  This was glitzy leopard print rug and gold headboard and v  large but not what I had originally hoped for The staff were courteous and did go out of their way to accommodate us  On the upside the public areas of the hotel were elegant it has a lovely pool area and bar and the location of the hotel is good  
P => check the bedding stayed here at beginning and end of tour of india loved the food and the service in the restaurants was excellent  BUT on both occasions I checked the bedding prior to going to bed and found the sheets were soiled  The second time the soiling was of a masculine nature  I think you get the picture  Ladies be careful  
P => I totally agree with Neil form London I totally agree with Neil from London concerning the service at The Park in New Delhi  I think he gives a perfect description of what it is like  
P => Disappointing The only positive aspect about this hotel is the location  It is a short stroll to connht place but the place is surrounded by unscrupulous taxi drivers and touts people who get a commission for bringing you to overpriced tourist shops who make walking a bit of a nighte  The room was clean and comfortable but very overpriced  The glass shower is ok for couples but can be a problem when used by a family  The serice is terrible most advertised services are unavailable  The travel desk is a joke do not use them as they charge almost Rs for a full day city tour when the going rate is around R in an ac car  I will definitely not be ripped off by staying in this place again  
P => Great hotel This hotel is a haven in the madness that is Delhi We spent  nights here and really enjoyed ourselvesThe rooms are immaculately clean with lovely oration the bathrooms are modern and well fitted with lots of freebies and a great power shower The pool area is small but well kept and well designed   but be warned the pool is VERY cold There are  restaurants and a poolside snack bar   we tried all of them and were not disappointed  The food is of good quality as isnt badly priced considering this is an expensive hotel  Obviously it is cheaper to eat outside the hotel   but definitley give the Fire restaurant a go  Has a great bar too The staff were lovely to us nothing was too much trouble and we were always met with smilesId say this was the nicest place we stayed in India   we were there for several weeks all around the northern region and goa  
P => Surreal experience Quite a surreal hotel due to its ultra modern sterile interior  Great service lovely pool good food  However I couldnt help feeling that I could have been anywhere in the world due to the bland interiors  I suppose it is great is you want to escape the chaos of india outside its walls  Denim clad waiters glass bathroom walls Terance Conran interiors  If you like the above ambience then this is a great hotel  
P => Perfectly Fine Hotel My son and I stayed at The Park for two nights and thought it was a fine hotel   although a bit pricy  Its definately over the top as far as modern or goes including glass walled bathroom and art in our room  In the bathroom both bars of soap had ONE flower pedal layed carefully on top  Good shower but the matress was typical hard for India  Great pillows though  We ate in the casual restaurant for dinner and had very good food pizza cooked in a wood burning oven  Didnt get to take advantage of the pool area but it was beautiful  No issues at all with noise  Service was fine  We found that English is not spoken as fluently in Northern India and this being our first stop up north we thought it was the staff some had a hard time understanding what we were asking for but thats just the way it is as compared to Southern India

P => Cheap mentality management   Tivoli Garden This is bull      resort their spa doesnt work swimming pool is in bad shape they offer membership at a cost with certain facilities like   discount on food and when you go their they say the same has been withdrawn  One of the worst ever experince of my life  They charge membership fee and then go back from their words  Bloody cheap mentality management  These kind of people can not grow in life who cheat people  
P => rooms ent  service non existent Its a fairly large property and the main reason to stay there was because i was having an event there  The rooms are pretty ent in size bathroom is fairly spacious with a shower cube and a bathtub but the bathroom fittings are pretty bad  Hot water isnt always available especially at odd hours  Air conditioning works but my colleague who was in another room wasnt so lucky  Room service is ordinary  My cable didnt work and i had to get a technician in for that  The same technical problem was there with the key card access  The good part is the closet space which is good bed was comfortable it had plug points by the bedside so easy to charge ur phone thru the night and yet have it next to u  Restaurant isnt that great bfast is ordinary and like i said  the service  forgettable  
P => Great if you like cold showers     First impressions of the room were good but after an hour or so you notice the shine has gone  Couldnt guarantee hot water the sunken batch in the bedroom is literally a waste of space  People kept knocking on the door early in the morning too making a lie in impossible didnt have a quotdo not disturb signquot OK for business trip perhaps but found it way over priced even with the discounted price as it was the same venue as the wedding we were attending Ho hum  
P => Good clean hotel with great staff perhaps could do with a bit of a revamp We stayed in this hotel for two nights as part of a Golden Triangle tour around India  Was very impressed with the security at the hotel and the foyer and outside areas were really nice  Service was great throughout our stay  The rooms were very grand we had a bath in our bedroom although there was a rather thin sliding door which opened the bathroom up to the main bedroom therefore little privacy  The hotel was incredibly clean and the restaurant served very good food although at UK restaurant prices  The rooms were very spacious and comfortable but be a little dated I prefer the modern  star hotels we get in the UK and this was more like a traditional uk hotel that perhaps could do with updating   but still very grand  There was a wedding whilst we were at the hotel and reading the other reviews this appeared to be a problem for many we however were not disturbed by this at all and in fact really enjoyed watching it as it gave us an additional insight into Indian culture  
P => Terrible hotel worst service and staff We had a wedding at the Grand Ball Room at Tivoli in ember  The hall was unclean and the stage had very dirty carpet and a broken couch  Please avoid this place at all costs   if you need more info then contact me at this email address   TivoliGardenDelhi gmail comThe Accountant Sudipto amp the Caretaker Kataria just dont know their job  The whole property is poorly managed and the toilets are blocked and there is no water  The access to the hotel is so congested that it  take you  minutes to just cover couple of miles  
P => Not quite value for money We have just returned from a couple of nights at theTivoli  The hotel is new and the service is reasonable  We stayed in two rooms for a family of  with  small kids  The restaurant serves reasonably good food and a buffet breakfast is included The pool is lovely but small  The pool attendant and staff were good with kids and generally quite helpful We paid about   per night  There were double beds and a large sofa bed so a family of  is easily accomodated in each room  The details in the rooms were disappointing for the price  The showers didnt work properly neither did the ac and our airport pickup didnt show up Overall I would say this is not quite worth the money and airport access is poor due to local congestion Alwyn  Leicester UK 
P => Awful avoid at all costs Where to start The rooms arent clean the bedding is rough and uncomfortable the pool is filthy the food is mediocre to poor the front desk staff are rude and its in an awkward location  And because it seems to cater to the wedding crowd the music and running of feet down corridors goes on till the early hours  What makes it worse is that its not even cheap  With tax I paid about  rupees around  for the one night I stayed here and that didnt include breakfast or transportation or even a bottle of mineral water in the room only two opened bottles of filtered tap water in the fridge  Unless youre a guest at a wedding there avoid this hotel like the plague  
P => I liked it I liked this hotel  Hotel is very beautiful and clean and rooms were big enough Hotel staff was nice and polite Food was clean and delicious  The hotel arranges parties fore example weddings birthday parties and business meetings  So it s not peaceful at the weekends but if you wanna see beautiful Indian gowns and see how Indian people celebrate it doesn t bother you The hotel is not a typical tourist hotel  There is not anything for children and mostly visitors spend there just couple of days  The hotel is suitable for adult tourists who are not searching for a quiet and peaceful time but want to get to know Delhi The distance between this hotel and Counnht Place or Old Delhi is quite big and there is lots of traffic  So it might take  minutes to get to those places I was a tourist from Finland and enjoyed the time in this hotel 
P => Great hotel been back twice We stayed at the Tivoli Garden Resort for  week during end ember   This was our nd trip there and we love it  It is a boutique hotelresort  This resort is priily a banqueting place with many weddings functions conferences being held  They have about  rooms   so it is a small ish hotel in terms of   of rooms  The rooms weve stayed in are beautifully apointed and done up The food at the restaurant bella is great  All kinds of Asian AmericanItalian and Continental cuisine is served and the quality is good too  There is a very nice nighclub at this resort called Trafalgar Square  There are very nice beautifully manicured lawns  Very personalised service  The best part of this hotel is that you feel you are out of Delhi i e away from the pollution etc yet you are centrally located and are close to the most happenninghip shopping places  Overall both our stays here have been very good and we definitely plan to return 
P => Terrible time at the Tivoli Garden Resort I would avoid this quotresortquot at all costs  We stayed for a week and based on the fact this is advertised as a  star resort expected a high level of service  Things were bad for so many reasons I will bullet point them in order to keep it short  This is more of a banquet hall than hotel    there are  arate function rooms that seem to be constantly booked and the noise is unbearable  Indian parties dont tend to start until around  pm so dont plan on sleeping before  am  And you better be ready to be up at  am when clean up starts  Granted it depends on where your room is located but this is unacceptable in ANY room   The front desk staff had trouble understanding basic questions in English    The pool located next to one of the banquet areas had a layer of greasy film on the top from the food service and cocktail sticks on the bottom  Additionally it looks as if the pool bar has never been used  And we were excited about the pool bar   The room construction is shoddy  We could hear the people next door to us pushing their chairs backforth on the hardwood floors  Also the showers didnt drain properly and constantly soaked the entire bathroom floor This place was simply awful  I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone

P => Satisfying Experience This hotel is near Airport providing complimentory Airport Transfers if Roompackage is booked  Hence its good for Air travellers who end up paying very high charges for transport in Delhi  Staff is very co operative  Initially I was allotted a room where A C  was not satisfactory and upon requesting the staff they alotted me a room o higher category and with better A C  Cooling  During my period of travel hotels some part was under reation that has effected menu of the coffee shop  
P => The place is a plain and simple Rip Off  I stayed here for two nights  The food choice was terribly limited food was nothing to write home about and food prices were exorbitant  The food quality and service was bad too  In the price of laundering a days set of summer clothes you could buy a fancy cotton linen shirt The place is poorly connected and miles from a public area where you can find transport  Their official travel desk is again horribly expensive  On the second night there was virtually no water in the hot water taps   just a trickle  The fake period bathroom fittings are so bad that if you open both the hot and cold water taps the cold water starts backing up into the hot water line  Id stay away from this place  Yes and please go over EVERY item of your bill and double check  In my case the travel bill was added twice  The staff made a commitment about complimentary pickups and drops then denied it and only agreed with great reluctance  
P => Best Eco Hotels  Very Good Eco Hotel  Best part of the property is there Ambience  Services and Food  They have huge lawns  a good swiming pool  Hotel only lacks in the View of the hotel and Rooms are bit to small  Rest all the things are in order  Very good property located near the Delhi International Airport  
P => Great Hotel This is one great eco friendly hotel located very close to IGI airport New Delhi  The entrance and approach of the hotel is very nice  The service is also excellent  The only problem was theat my Airtel mobile was not getting signals except in the lobby  It was not working even in the restaurants  Secondly for a business traveller is it quite far from the city center  However over all its an experience in itself to stay in this great property  
P => Nice and Quiet a few difficulties I stayed here on a business trip for a total of  days  days left for  then returned for  more  The hotel is very quiet and well kept given the dusty area and closeness to the airport  Every morning there were several workers sweeping the floors and watering the plants  The gardens and pool area was beautiful though not very enjoyable in the extreme heat  The few difficulties I experienced wereThe first room I stayed in would only play the sound from the tv through the speakers in the bathroom  When I asked the hotel staff they said there was nothing they could do  Also the internet access was extremely difficult to access though I found it was similar at every hotel in India as it took several phone calls to the front desk and  employees visiting my room to get met connected  
P => Terrific airport hotel What a pleasant surprise A quiet airport hotel very close to the airport with the most beautiful gardens and swimming pool and an excellent breakfast too  We very much wished we could have stayed to enjoy the pool and gardens which contained a wide variety of trees shrubs and plants  Walking in the gardens after breakfast was a total delight  
P => convenient airport location Good rates available if you book via the website We used this hotel as its a stones thrown from the airport  We arrived at the crack of dawn and booked a room so we could do straight there at am and sleep until check out time  It was great in this respect especially as there are free airport pick ups and drop offs  It saves you lots of hassel when youre arriving early The facilities at this hotel are great   the restaurant is suprisingly good Chef amp I we were quite taken aback by the quality of the cuisine The pool is huge and really nice   we went for a swim late afternoon and had the place to ourselves I was disappointed that Id paid extra to have a room with a balcony  We arrived on our way out of India for  nights stay here to find the door to the balcony couldnt be opened until  hours after we arrived  When it was opened it was covered with mess from the pigeons  Housekeeping did clean it while we were out but it was still unusable  The hotel manager came to find us while we were staying and I did mention this to him but he didnt suggest compensating me for the inconvenience  I also mentioned it on checkout at am in the morning and the woman at the desk said shed mention it to the manager but still charged me the full rate  I will definately email them and follow this up but am disappointed that the staff werent pro active about it The rooms are comfortable spacious and clean and its definately worth booking in if you arrive on an early or late flight  We left a bag here while we travelled in India which they were happy to store for us with no charge  We used the hotel on the way in and out of Delhi  If its in your price range I would definately suggest its worth it  
P => excellent Fantastic stay we were only there for such a short time and really never got to enjoy the grounds    about  km of gardens and a great spa with gym access  If you are staying it is a nice resort  The restaurants were really good too  Rooms were nice  It is really in the middle of no where    near to the domestic and international airprot and that was our reason for this hotel People were very friendly    also remember one thing they all expect huge tips    We also rented a car for the day which worked out just fine  We got a driver by the name of Jitu he was great  Enjoy I would recommend this place  
P => Three Weeks in New Delhi I just returned home from a three week business trip to New Delhi  My stay at the Uppals Orchid was rated as above average solely based on the kindness and courtesy of the staff  Although there was a language barrier often times taking two or three tries before communication was clear for both parties the pleasant personalities and willingness to try made the experience a positive one  Every staff member I met in those three weeks was friendly and helpful with one exception   always one rotten apple right  They all learned my name they learned my schedule    so if I was late to breakfast one day or home late from the office they knew it and showed concern for me  That is a good feeling when traveling alone in India  The room was nice with two exceptions    The bed was rock hard and the shower was set up so that you had to climb in literally and turn the shower on while in the tub    the cold blast of water each morning was     well more powerful than a cup of coffee  At least the water pressure in the shower was fantastic  The climb out of the shower was quite challenging also slippery and I always pictured myself breaking my leg or head on the hard ble floor of the bathroom    take it slow if you go There was always at least two bottles of complimentary water in the room one in the fridge and another given with turn down service along with some nice chocolates  Try to request a room overlooking the pool  My co worker was on that side and enjoyed peaceful nights    I on the other hand had the court yard side of the building    Well on the positive side I got to see two beautiful India weddings and what I believe to be a huge Bollywood party    but as for sleep I had a few occasions where some event was taking place and music was blaring through out the room  It didnt really bother me since my hours for the office were late anyway    and the weddings were an interesting experience I had issues with the food in India generally    In the beginning I enjoyed the local cuisine but it got too hot amp spicy for me and when I just wanted the basic American style food there was nothing that really satisfied me  Even the basic Club sandwich at the hotel was not you average American Club sandwich    I guess I knew that it would be like that but three weeks was too long for me to go without the comforts of home  All of the service people in the restaurants and room service were wonderful and efficient and so friendly so meals were enjoyable in that way    and the India food was good for the most part  I learned about chicken Tikka in the third week which was prepared mild and tasted like basic roasted chicken    I ordered that a lot of the time towards the end    The Samosas were not too bad some spice but tolerable    and the Bruschetta with a side of fries was just enough to satisfy me most daysThe breakfast buffet was good  They had an omelet station that made eggs to order and pancakes too  That was good for me    they also had both continental and Indian breakfast items in the buffet  I did not really use the pool and other facilities but everything looked nice  The grounds are beautiful and quite pleasant to take walks    and as their hotel guide book says they have quotfoggingsquot twice a day    I didnt really find insects to be an issue  The pool was quite large and had a swim up bar     And the spa facility had reasonably priced services but I did not partake  It was a little Garden of Eden  and if you are a first timer to India as I was you feel guilty after driving around Delhi with the tent villages and beggars dust amp pollution etc only to return into this little oasis of a hotel  
P => Very very nice quit hotel During the beginning of ruary  I did stay at the Uppals orchid  I was very happy with the servicefood and specialy the very friendly staff  The people at the restaurants do an excellent job  They make your stay extra nice  The food at the two main restaurants is very good  After  years visiting India I did not have a single problem with my stumic The hotel is absolutely on  star level  Some people where negative after they stayed at the Oberoi in Agra  This is something you should not compare  The Oberoi in Agra is close to six stars and very expensive One point of comment  At the lobby coffe bar with nice sweets the is a small band playing  Normely you give them something when they play  This band is not touching any music notes  So I give them some roepies when they agreed in stop playing I compare this hotel with the other  stars in Dehli  Absolutely OK try also the small golf court nice      I will go back there    
P => Outstanding property near the airport We stayed here for our last night in India because of the location close to the airport  This is a lovely hotel set in large grounds with every amenity you could need  A huge swimming pool gym choice of restaurants and nice bar  The room was lovely well appointed great big bed air conditioning that worked nice bathroom with a lovely shower  They claimed that the tap water was drinkable but provided plenty of bottles anyway  The bistro type restaurant had a buffet in the evening with many different types of Indian food and non Indian too  The quality was excellent  The hotel has a car and driver service if you need it  every bit the   hotel they claim  They also claim to be an Eco hotel although I am dubious about that because it did not seem to be any more eco than any other   hotel and importing Evian water from France certainly isnt  That aside   highly recommended  
P => Quality Property This is a beautiful property  Our room was well appointed and in line with  star rating  Only regret is that we only could experience it for one day  
P => An oasis in India Amazing service and friendly staff  Loved the property Especially the quotChef amp Iquot restaurant  Thanks for a great two weeks 
P => Close to the Airport The main reason for staying at this hotel is its proximity to the airport  Most international flights arrive and depart in the wee hours of the morning  Being just   minutes from the terminal is convenient whether youre arriving or departing The rooms are centrally air conditioned are large enough and are well appointed TV mini bar desk and chairs small sofa  About half the rooms look out on the hotels nice gardencourtyard  Bathrooms are good sized have all the toiletries found in better hotels and provide ample hot water for showering or bathing The restaurant is nothing to write home about but its breakfast and lunch and dinner buffets are ample and an a la carte menu is also available The business center has several computer with high speed connections Check in is quick and efficient as is room service Unlike other luxury and near luxury hotels Uppals Orchid rarely has taxis or tuk tuks lined up waiting for fares    and one can wait a long time on the road in front of the hotel for an empty vehicle to come by  The concierge however will call a taxi and one will appear   minutes later  
P => Good hotel Stayed at Uppals Orchid for  days on a business trip ch through to il  Overall the hotel was very good rooms where very nice and clean serviced every day and they turn you bed down at night and leave chocolates on your bed The restaurants were also good overpriced for Delhi but cheap compared to UK prices  The food was of a high standard with a varied menu the only criticism I have would be the service could sometimes be a bit slow you would wait quite a while for your starter and getting your bill could be a bit of a nighte The pool area was really nice gets quite busy at the weekend as families from the area come here they have memberships for non hotel guests Getting the complimentary car arranged to pick someone up from the airport was hard work and they charged them for it so watch out for this  Some of my colleagues also had some bother with their rooms they put them in a deluxe room as they did not have any other rooms available even though they had booked  This would not have been a problem but they could not unpack for  days as they had been told that they could be getting moved any day to the normal rooms they told them after  days they would be staying in the deluxe rooms  The hotel is not far from the Airport and about a  minute drive from Gurgaon My company has regular trips to Delhi and I would recommend any other colleagues to stay at this hotel  Some of my other colleagues stayed in the Raddison and Uppals was much nicer its a lot smaller than the Raddsion and quieter  
P => Good hotel excellent service good food above average price I stayed here for almost two weeks on a business trip ch il  with several other colleagues  The Uppal Orchid is about  minutes from Delhi airport and another  minutes from Gulgaon which is host to a lot of off shored and outsourced operations including corporates such as Microsoft Citibank and Sapient  Its no surprise then that you see a lot of business people here air crews and airport transfer passengers  So not exactly the place youd stay as a tourist  Its   hours to central Delhi depending on the chaotic traffic and  Id question your reasons for staying here if youre not on a company expense account  Thats probably the reason for the high prices  The Hilton further down the road costs the same or slightly more and caters to the same kind of traveller Having said that if youre here for a business visit this is a comfortable well maintained hotel  Staff were falling over backwards to please and to the Western traveller the attention is almost startling Here are some pointers for you if youre considering staying here  Internet connection   costs about USD  GBP a day but has been very reliable and never let me down  There will be a network cable in your room that you plug in and once you are given your access code youre up and running   Environs   not a lot to do around the hotel which is an oasis of greenery in the midst of dusty suburban neighbourhoods  Even so if youre a keen shopper youre a  minute taxi ride away from the malls of Gurgaon where you can find cheap bargains of almost anything  If youre back from a busy day at the office youre much more likely to stay in and have a nice meal or sit by the pool  The   acres of grounds are also very well tended and green   and youll have a good jogging trail if youre after one   Food and drink   the restaurants in the hotel are excellent and the bar provides a good selection  Prices are more Western than Indian   so not at all a cheap eat but quality is very good  Their Sunday brunch buffet is excellent with unlimited alcoholic drinks at about USDGBP   Rooms   there are premium rooms facing the poolside with little garden balconies some of my colleagues got those and standard rooms I got one of them  I have no real complaints about the standard of the room  Theres a safe a TV with plenty of channels and the usual international provisions such as mini bar and coffe making facilities  It could have been a hotel room anywhere in the world for all I know  Beds are comfortable and firm   Monster mosquito alert this is not specific to the Uppal but beware if you leave your windows open mosquitoes will get through and you  be eaten alive  Being paranoid about Malaria I kept mine closed some of my colleagues still have bite ks several days after    This is especially true for the pool side rooms where close proximity to water sources is a godsend for mozzies  The hotel sprays the grounds every night at dusk to try and help a little   Electricity   my Indian colleagues tell me that they are used to power cuts in Delhi every day sometimes for prolonged periods  The sheltered guests in  star hotels here including this one only experience a mere second of a flicker before the generator kicks in    Water   the hotel claims the water here is safe to drink but I havent tested this claim  You are still provided with a free bottle of mineral water every day     Gym   theres a small gym next to the pool  I wouldnt say it was cutting edge but did the trick for a workout   Getting around   at Indian prices it will probably make sense to book a car with a driver for the day or if youre a corporate guest get your hosts to arrange it  It seems ok to get a cab to take you away from the hotel but not so trivial to get back  Drivers will often not know where the hotel is and will have to ask random rickshaw drivers several times on the way  Addresses are not straightforward in India and saying that it is quotOn National Highway quot is not too helpful either  If youre in Delhi proper its even worse because most yellowblack taxis dont have a licence to travel to Gurgaon   so you  find yourself a little stuck  If all else fails and you cant get back   get to the airport and find a taxi that will definitely know the way  And whatever you do   dont drive here yourself  Unless youre suicidal that is    Eco credentials   The Uppal Orchid claims to be an quotEco hotelquot with much fuss about how it is environmentally friendly  It does recycle its water and tries to encourage its guests to save energy but the general impression I got was that this is more a keting spiel than a mission statement  All in all I enjoyed my stay here  It is worth remembering as you drive down the dusty roads to take you wherever youre going from here that maintaining this kind of Western make believe standard must be hard in all the chaos around it  
P => Near the airport   OKish  stopovers  days traveling in India staying in   Oberois etc our travel agent dumped us in this dump for  nights before we left Delhi  I forgot to check here if this hotel was OK The rooms are tremendously overpriced US and not clean  They were noisy outside traffic  neighbouring room and felt run down  Very depressing after a glorious  week tour I can tell you  We upstixd and stayed in a downtown Taj hotel for ltUS  Negotiated directly with hotel As another reviewer said the only redeeming features are the airports proximity but then again if you have an early flight transfers from most hotels are lt mins and some of the staff are genuinely service oriented Avoid unless you have a good  deal and need somewhere to freshen up for a few hours before jetting off  
P => Wonderful place We turned up at this hotel after having booked a  star hotel somewhere in the depths of Delhi that was terrible and that I couldnt bring myself to stay in I must say that on arrival at this hotel I was left without doubt that this hotel is  star in everyway possible  The grounds are beautiful and the swimming pool and pool area are perfect to relax in and unwind  Our room was very beautiful and the shower and bath both immaculate and with good water pressure  All staff were so nice and polite I actually found they tried too hard When walking down a corridor in the hotel one day there was a staff member vacuming  When he saw me he turned off the vacum and almost stood to attention as if I was some form of royalty  I cant fault this hotel After reading some of the reviews I am quite shocked that people have found so many negative things to say The TV had a good range of channels we exprienced one power outage for a couple of seconds but thats India The food was good room service very goodIts location was fine and we were tourists and we managed to get about perfectly well  The hotel has high charges for tours to the Taj but then what  star doesntI dont feel that there was anything poor about this hotel at all and after staying in about ten  star hotels this year I would definately say this was the best without a doubt I loved it Its definately  star luxury 
P => Excellent experience I was surprised to read some of the negative reviews of Uppals here as my experience there was nothing short of fantastic  The staff was extremely attentive and friendly rooms were well maintained and the restaurants were above my expectations  As an example of the quality of the staff I stayed here for two weeks on business and the restaurant staff offered to make meals for me off the menu so I wouldnt get bored of the food  Also when I suggested that they add breakfast items to the late night menu this was taken care of within days As mentioned before the hotel is convenient to IGI Airport and most of the office parks around Gurgaon  Probably not where to stay if you are a tourist but perfect for anyone doing business in Gurgaon  The gym is basic but rarely crowded so would meet most needs  There is also an outdoor tennis court very nice pool and the small  hole putting course  The business center offers internet or there is broadband in the rooms  Showers had good water pressure and hot water availability  Short power outages were fairly common but that is pretty standard for India and they only last about  seconds so it wasnt a big deal to me To address an earlier reviewer the TV has quite a few English stations BBC Star Movies HBO Star World ESPN Discovery etc so no complaints there All in all this is a fine place to stay where you will be well looked after  
P => Problems at UppalsOrchid I used to like Uppals Orchid because of nice facilities friendly staff and competitive rates  However since luxury visitors to Delhi have increased by leaps and bounds all hotels are always overbooked  So they can afford to command a higher premium because visitors are desperate to get rooms at whatever price  Uppals has unfortunately embarked on this tendency and is getting as expensive as the Oberoi Grand in Delhi but not as nice  Whats worse they are doing such price gouging with loyal repeat guests as in my case  So if I must pay a higher rate and if rooms are no easier to get at Uppals than at the Grand usually means booking months in advance during winter peak Id rather stay at the latter with the satisfaction that yes Ive paid through my nose but Im staying at the very best  
P => Modern Hotel Close to Airport We stayed at Uppals Orchid upon arriving in Delhi  It is a short drive from the Indira Gandhi International Airport and is located in a secluded estate  The hotel has the feel and atmosphere of a modern four star Western hotel  Our room was lovely with a spacious bathroom  We had dinner at the Indian restaurant in the hotels lower level    excellent entrees with the choice of a buffet as well  Breakfast the next morning was also very nice    a very well stocked buffet although the eggs were a little cold If you are staying in Delhi for several days and want to be close to the citys center this  not be the hotel for you    you  want to try hotels at Connhts Square  Note however that Delhi is a very dispersed city and you are never really close to anything  However if you are arriving from or departing from the airport and want to stay close by this hotel is an excellent choice Our only complaint involved a lengthy wait for a cup of coffee at the hotels cafe next to the lobby NOTE Try to avoid flying into or out of Delhi in the latter half of ember and the first half of uary  The city is afflicted with heavy fog that creates major flight delays and cancellations  We had to adjust our schedule and lose a day in Delhi on account of the fog  
P => 
P => Good location clean but noisy Location  nice  min from India gate  Safe area quite green and not on a main street   The overal area is mostly residential Room  relatively large around  sqm and clean  Wifi is a great advantage  Hot water and electric supply at all time which is an advantage in India  Includes safe iron air conditioning    Price  around  EURnight including breakfast by the way really nice and sufficient in quality  A daily bottle of water is also complimentary The major issue I encountered is noise  rooms are well isolated from street and from neighbour room  BUT the doors are extremely thin which makes that you can hear anything that happens in the corridor or inside the room right in front of yours  Really incredible    I had to use hearplugs to sleep which is unpleasant This is really a pity as the staff is quite helpful and rest of the accomodation fine Smaller disadvantage  rooms on the ground floor have strictly no view on a dark backyard so far from website pictures 
P => Velvet Apple   A good stay We stayed at the Velvet Apple hotel for  days in early ober   The hotel is located in one of the better areas of New Delhi and is close to the M Block ket M walk and other small shops The staff were very obliging and very pleasant for the duration of our stay  The room that we stayed in had ice cold air conditioning and a really fast ceiling fan  The hotel is located in a very relatively quiet part of GK New Delhi  This is due to the fact that there no intersections within close proximity of the hotel  This is an important consideration in your hotel choice as people constantly use their horns in New Delhi especially at intersections There were many channels available for viewing on the in house TV channels  We especially liked the Australian Network channel  One one the outstanding features of this hotel was the complimentary Wi FI offered by the hotel  This proved to be a God send as calls from our mobiles cost approximately   per minute  We used this service and communicated by email for the duration of our stay  The WI FI connection was fast and reliable at all times  The breakfasts and room service in the hotel were good  In sumy the hotel was good value for money and we would stay there again if we needed to go back to Delhi  
P => Great hotel in Delhi perfect for both business and leisure travel We spent  nights at this fabulous new hotel in a convenient part of Delhi near enough to shopping and restaurants but far enough to be feel like we were going home at the end of a busy day  The staff is courteous and prompt  Because Velvet Apple is a small boutique hotel the staff gets to know you and is very willing to meet your individual needs they made us custom breakfast and lunch daily  The property is clean with tasteful room orations and all the right amenities small fridge flat panel HD TV great bathrooms  Right across the street is a local park which gives you a glimpse into how real people live  Although we were traveling for fun plenty of business travelers seem to make this hotel their regular base given how familiar they were with the staff  It is definitely close enough to the downtown business areas  Seems like a much better alternative to the large impersonal chain hotel options  
P => 
P => Value   Travel to delhi often and not on a very high budget  Its basic and clean I think they are refurbishing so ask for the newly reated rooms   Its got a nice restaurant and is centrally located   cant ask for more for the amount I paid  Cheers   
P => Great for backpackers    We stayed in a so called luxury room which was ok to stay at  It was clean had tv a fridge and ac  You could also use the internet for a few rupees and book a tour to the Taj Mahal in the hotels travel agency for a good price  The hotel is located in a busy ket street near Connht Place  There you can get anything what a tourists heart desires   from saris to henna tattoos  However I would recommend not to eat at the hotels restaurant and instead look for an alternative e g  at Connht Place  
P => Good for a cheap central stop over The location is good and we were picked up by taxi as promised  We had a club room with a quite new bathroom room  but it did not have a window  The check in is slow but the staff were helpful  Sams cafe on the roof was a good place to eat and it is being made bigger  I think this hotel is a safe bet for quick stop overs in and out of India I stayed for the first and last day of my trip only  If you want to chill out in your room go somewhere with a window but pay more  
P => Value for your money A number of previous reviews seem to be very upset with this hotel and i think that is mainly due to people not expecting what they find in Pahar Ganj     a wild whirling mass of people smells shops and food It sounds fantastic but be warned this is most densely populated part of Delhi in a city  country with existing population problems The Bad news  Almost all the hotels are old and score very low on cleanlinessThe Good News  The entire area is geared to the foreign tourist so you shouldnt have any problem getting things to eat wear and show foff Also you have a lot hundreds of choice in this area  So if you have the time book into any hotel for  nights and then shop around and youll find something perfect for your budget Oh wait i forgot that this is supposed to be a review of the hotel  The hotel itself has seen its days but if you can afford one of the newly furnished rooms Rs  then you should be quite comfortable The rooftop restaurant is very good as long as you stick to good ole Indian fare    although they do have a wide choice of palatable western dishes too And despite the previous reviews i found the service to be warm and friendly  In fact I had booked online for  nights but arrived  nights late  I thought the money was down the drain since it was too late to ask for a refund but they quite willingly upgraded me to a better roomI think the previous reviews have made them change what they can     for the better  
P => Value They gave me one of their reated rooms and I loved it  Spacious clean and well furnished  Service is good and the Hotel houses a cafe called Sams exceptional food  You would be pleasantly surprised  Thumbs up 
P => Good basic hotel with great restaurant I had read a lot of bad things about this place on here but it was the only hostel recommended by both the Rough Guide and the Lonely Planet  I was pleasantly suprised with the hotel  It was basic but the service was friendly the room was good and clean we went for deluxe and the beds were perfectly comfortable The restaurant was good and you got nice views over the rooftops  
P => Better than many of the reviews We stayed at the Vivek Hotel  weeks ago il  After reading many of the reviews we were pretty skeptical but as it turned out despite pretty hard beds which are common in India we had nothing to complain about We arranged an airport pick up months ago  No problem The pick up price was what they said  We booked a CLUB ROOM that was clean and the bathroom was fine As regards the criticisms dont book any standard under a club room or you will get what you pay for from what I hear Sams bar on the roof makes the whole thing worth it believe me It is a real oasis  Ice cold beer  Great service  Good food The location right in the middle of Pahar Ganj on the main bazaar was exactly what I wanted for my first time in Delhi  Exposed and in the middle of the madness No it is not the Ritz The hallways and stairwells are still undergoing a developmental process dont worry it was still quiet and it is not a standard comparable to ent motels in the west but if you just want a ent clean air conditioned and what we felt was a safe lay over for one or two nights in the middle of Delhi it was fine especially with Sams Bar restaurant on the top  
P => I thought it was ok   Ok fellow travelers  this hotel is a ok   its clean and the bathrooms are CLEAN   hard to find a clean bathroom in budget hotels in India  The restaurant is ok too its inexpensive and the kitchen is an open one so it seems clean too  I have been traveling for  months in India and would recommend this hotel  I paid about  Indian rupees for my room for a night  Nice ket outside and the metro station is around the corner but beware of people coming at you to sell you stuff you dont need    oh and there are cows on the road too     
P => Unfriendly Upon arrival on uary st all the staff could offer two people was a small room with no window   at  rupees  Asking for a room with a windomw the next day just gave us a cold shoulder and upon checking out we had to haggle for a refund of the deposit paid for the second night  
P => Good value budget hotel Booked a room with them weeks before with several emails between us but when we arrived they didnt have a record of us and our room  But we were able to check into a double room on the third floor for rs   ac fan TV double bed clean towels and toilet paper new bathroom which was very nice and clean   but hot water had to be arranged with them rather than just turned on with the tap  They are doing up the hotel so the hallways are full of wooden doors being varnished and pots of paint  It needs orating as in parts looks very old and run down but our room looked good  Only had a tiny window in it so didnt get any views but it was light and smelled ok Hotel had room service and a restaurant upstairs   food seemed ok and cheap  No alcohol but the man in the hallway would offer to go and buy you some for a small fee and then bring you back a warm beer  minutes laterThere is an internet room downstairs which takes a copy of your passport before you can use it as part of the security due to bombings in the area and the link to internet cafes  The check in also includes copies of your passport and a photo of you on their security video Location of hotel is good on the main bazaar with some very cheap shopping  Its close to the station and they can arrange a car to the airport for rs other places in the area will do it for rs  The main bazaar has a strange security system at either end with police will make you walk through metal detectors and then search your bags but if you are in a rickshaw you just drive straight through  It really depends on how they feel that day whether they can be bothered to search you The hotel was a good one for the one night we stayed there in the right location and cheap enough for an ac room  
P => Clean rooms and great location Having left the Rak International we moved into the Vivek hotel on the Main bazaar  We were shown various rooms of various prices on the first floor  We were shown cheaper rooms on higher floors but went for a nice room with AC  All of the rooms seemed recently reated and had clean bathrooms  In fact this was one of the cleanest hotels we saw in India  However the AC had a strange smell possibly because of dirty filters The hotel is right on the Main bazaar which means it s close to the New Delhi train station where you can catch the all important trains to Agra to see the Taj Mahal and Jaipur  Both trains leave early morning and this hotel is literally minutes away from the station  Incidentally go straight to the international ticket office on the st floor to buy these tickets  It opens am pm pm on Sundays and ignore the people that tell you it s closed downbeing reated and direct you to their friend sbrother s travel agent The hotel has Sam s Caf  on it s roof with great views of the city  It serves various dishes including breakfast but beware the  hash browns  they are not the American version but boiled potatoes cut into cubes and mixed with onions and peppers  Also recommended is the Kitchen Caf  not far away on the same street Hotel staff ranged from polite and helpful to surly and business like They did arrange a taxi for us to the airport for  rupees  They also have internet We paid  rupees for a double room with AC and en suite bathroom  There was no breakfast included  
P => Loved the WiFi in my room   Stayed at the hotel for  nights  They have a wide range of rooms ov different cost  had a nice stay the staff was friendly  I had issues with the Taxi i took from the airport to the hotel the staff was helpful enough to deal with the overcharging the driver for me  The food is nice you can catch a bit ov sun on the roof   The have WIFI which was nice i used my laptop in my room which was a plus All in all it was a good experience   I would recommend the hotel for a cheap place in delhi   
P => Schmuddeligstes Hotel unserer Indienreise  
P => Fotos geben unrealistische Vorstellung  
P => 
P => great I couldnot forget my stay with hotel york  I had a good time over there  I felt myself so much comfortable during my stay over there  All the staff are nice and polite and hospitable in each and every way  I have visited so many hotels in my life visiting the mostly all places in India  But never been such kind of amenities and services what I found in hotel york Indeed I will definately recommand my relation and all my colleages to visit hotel york at least once in a life Girish parwar 
P => Hellhole Arrived late at night and accepted room in a bit of a hurry  Big mistake  Found a small lizard scurrying around the room what looked like bedbugs in one of the beds dust bunnies under the bed battered walls in bathroom dirt on many surfaces  Neighbor in next room was blasting TV at am and walls were quite thin Gathered up my stuff returned the key to reception and got the hell out walked into the street at am and hailed a rickshaw for Clark International  
P => ent place by Delhi Standards Before I start this review let me tell you something about myself  I was born and raised in India allthough have spent the past  years in the US and travelled to many countries  So I am used to certain things while in India and have certain expectations in other countries   so my review  be a bit skewed but not really  First of all if you intend spending something below  for a room in Delhi   expect the worst  Delhi is expensive and every hotel is looking to cash in on tourists  To expect western standards for something below   bucks is almost impossible  If you go to a  star or sometimes a  star you will get what you expect  Any hotel that says it is  star is generally a sham as there is no clear ation on what is a  star or  star in Delhi or for that matter in india The reason I chose York was for the location    It was on the Outer Circle of Connht Palace    right in the heart of Delhi    so there was always a lot of Hustle Bustle  Close to the railway station and almost central to everything that you would want to see  Pricing is a bit Expensive  including tax but most things were ok  The room was clean the sheets towels blankets were clean  The mattress was worse than a  mattress  The room service was ent    the waiters do not keep knocking on your door asking if you need anything  They only come if you call and that too promptly  The hot water was good pressure excellent bathroom overall reasonably clean  The area is safe and plenty of restaurants around  Overall I had no complaints  Just remember   most  motels in the US would have far better amenities  But this was Delhi    and I had lowered my standards before I even started looking for a place  If you hunt well    you can probably get a cheaper place with better amenities  I was a little lazy and this was only the rd motel i looked at Just as a note of caution do not book any hotel in Delhi before hand unless it is  star  star and unless you are going during peak season and chances of finding a ent hotel room are bleak  Take a pre paid cab from Delhi airport and keep hunting till you find a good place Pay the cabbie a couple of  bucks around   and he will oblige  Look at the rooms before you ide on the hotel  The cabbie will generally take you to a place where he gets a commission for taking you there so be careful Overall York worked well for me since I had to stay for  nights  If you are going to stay just one night just bight the bullet    and go for a  star Hotel Vikram is another good hotel alltho more expensive which was recommended to me by a couple of friends  The only reason I did not choose it was because it was in South Delhi and travelling would have been a pain  
P => Raised rates at checkout When I checked out the hotel raised the rates by   over what we had agreed on when I checked in  So I got screwed and obviously will never return  
P => for budget stay only The hotel looks more like a motel than a hotel  Was expecting at least a  or  star hotel due to the price i paid booked online and the lonely planet put it as midrange  What a dissappointment Overall its okay and clean although looks a bit run down   friendly staff and an overally helpful tourdesk to wakes you up in the morning while youre having a peaceful sleep to ask ifyou would like a car for the day The place is safe and located at the heart of budget shopping  Just  min down the road is Costa   thank goodnessTips   bring your own toiletriesSo if youre planning to stay there remember to be modest in your expectation 
P => Basic We stayed here in uary with our two children  and  for  nights as part of a round the world trip  It was my and our childrens first trip to India my wife had visited when she was young and first experience of a developing country The staff were friendly and helpful tipping is mandatory and the hotel is quite central which was a key feature for us  The hotel was very basic though and Connht Place is generally fairly run down except for inside many of the shops The hotel is situated in K block which is in the northern part of the circular Connht Place  The nicer hotels in that general area tend to be on path which runs south from Connht place  There is a brand new metro station in the middle of Connht Place When we arrived at the hotel we found that our room only had one queen sized bed and one single bed despite clearly setting out by email when booking that we required a room for  people   and being quoted a price on that basis with not enough room to fit another bed  Rather than pay for two rooms if we had known we  have to do that we would have chosen another hotel in the first place we ended up having to sleep three people on the queen sized bed The room did have a TV hot water a shower and a toilet that worked but apart from that it was pretty sparse and was fairly dusty as is most of Delhi  The hotel has room service but the choice is very limited  The sheets were clean but the blankets were very old and dirty with Delhi dust and cigarette ash The hotel has a man who organises toursdrivers who was fairly helpful although a bit on the pushy side  We booked a driver for a day trip of Delhi through him which was okay but it would have been better to have a guide or to do a guided tour   we did a guided tour to Agra through Ashoka tours a government agency situated in Connht Place   which was much more informative and enjoyable The hotel was reating its facade while we were there as well as doing up the adjoining restaurant which was closed  Even so I dont think we would stay there again  On reflection it would have been better to pay more and stay in something a bit more upket in a nicer area eg on path for our first experience of Delhi  
P => 
P => Reasonable hotel We spend few days at Yuvaraj Delux and stay was pleasant though the hotel is located in a not so good place  The roads are narrow and congested The hotel management and staff were well mannered  It was worth for Rs  per night  Donot expect the kind of facilities and ambience that you would expect in a Budget or long stay hotels in US in any Budget hotel in India  The travel desk people were good but I learned that their role in arranging trips are limited to collecting their cut on the trip cost and they have no role for rest of the trip  I booked  trips with them one for a city tour and another one to Agra and was not satisfied with either Single day City Tour The places they include as part of the tour cannot be completed in a days time at all  An advise for anyone visiting Delhi is to travel by Delhi Metro and get down at nearest tourist point  Delhi Metro is a stones throw from Yuvaraj Delux  at Ajmeri Gate and for that matter from any hotel in Paharganj or Arakashan Road   Metro does not have a reach to all of Delhi but can take one to the nearest point and from there other conveyance say a taxi or auto can be availed  I think metro is operational from  AM to  PM  Metro takes you to places within Delhi cheaper and faster and it is clean and well maintained  The max ticket in metro from one end of city to other comes to around Rs   There are tourist passes in metro which comes at one day pass for Rs  and  days pass for Rs   With these passes one can make infinite travels for one day or  days in metro  These passes are meant solely for tourists Single Day Agra Tour This was horrible  They charged Rs  per head  Never ever avail of this tour to Agra   hours will be consumed commuting itself  The bus operators donot know how to operate tours  For lunchdinnerbreak fast they stop at the worst restaurant where the bus staff gets the best cut   You start at  AM from Delhi and reach Agra by  noon and will be taken to Red Fort and will get hardly  hour there  Then they take you to some Handicraft emporium which is a waste of time If you buy something from the emporium the bus guys get the commission  Then you are driven to TajMahal   TajMahal is too crowded during   and it takes around  hours in the queue to get into the Taj  Avoid a trip to Taj during    if possible  You get hardly  hour in Taj and by then its time to start off to Delhi  The bus will next take you to Mathura and Vrindavan which are holy places of birth of Krishna and then to Delhi  By the time you reach Delhi its around  AM next day  Its a tiring trip where you spend hardly  hours seeing places and is NOT AT ALL WORTH IT  A better option is to book a Hotel in Agra take a train to Agra from DelhiNew Delhi railway station is walkable distance from PaharganjArakashan road stay for a couple of days in Agra see Red Fort and Taj  Never take the one day trip option provided by travel desk of any hotel in Delhi  Its a waste of money and time and is tiring  All in all I would recommend Yuvaraj Delux to anyone looking for a budget accomodation in New Delhi  
P => what a mess I arrived at midnight  The staff are not so welcoming  After waiting at reception for  mins with my backpack the bellboy asked for it only when I was given the key for my room And I did not hear a thank you for the tip   All the staff tried hard to sell me some drinks even tough my refusal many times There are no pillow covers  The bed sheet was so dirty  There was no towel or soap in the bathroom  It is very basic  This hotel is the worst I stayed in India 
P => Nice Service Thank you for your hospitality and support  I feel very comfortable all staff were very friendly  
P => Total misrepresentation and disgusting Firstly my booking was supposed to include a free airport pick up but the hotel owner insisted I paid RPs  I booked a room for  adults   my son myself and my husband so naturally expected a double and a single bed or  singles but there was only one double bed  When we asked what had happened to the bed the porter arrived with a damp mouldy stained mattress and plonked it on the floor at the end of the bed   needless to say my son refused and sat up all night  I also sat up all night as i couldnt bring myself to sleep in the dirty bedding  The outside of the hotel doesnt look too bad but the rest is like rising damp  The room was disgusting and bore no resemblance to the photos on the internet infact I do not believe its the same interior  It was grimy curtains hanging off the rail paint peeling off the walls and a filthy antiquated bathroom with no hot water  I would love to know where the recommendation by Loney Planet came from and love the bit about quotdeluxe hotel at budget pricesquot If I had stayed here at the beginning of our travels it would have put me off India for life  This was a very bad end to an otherwise lovely holiday  
P => Really bad hotel in a bad part of town Looking at some of the previous reviews I do not see how anybody could use the word quotexcellentquot to describe any aspect of this hotel  It was among the worst places I have ever stayed  The difference between the internet description and pictures of this hotel vs  reality is like night and day  The bedsheet yes thats bedsheet singular because there is no top sheet looked dirty and the towel was worn and dirty looking  The hot water in my bathroom did not work  A room with a western toilet was not available  It was an extemely noisy area with constant horns honking  I did not find the staff friendly or helpful  My advice to anybody staying in New Delhi is to splurge and go for one of the better hotels even if it means breaking your budget because the low end hotels are worse than you can imagine  
P => Value For Money Hotel Yuvraj Deluxe is an excellent hotel  The staff was friendly and helpfull  Connht Place and path are  min  walk away  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel 
P => best value for money along with best friends I had a very pleasent and enjoyable trip to india recently  I not only enjoyed the indian food also liked the city of Delhi very much  I had a very wonderful experience at the hotel Yuvraj Deluxe where i stayed
