N => This place doesn t compare with the Park Plaza Last year we stayed at the Park Plaza down the road  note there are   Park Plazas in Beijing  and unfortunately this year we booked late and the Park Plaza was full  We tried Hotel Kapok but it compares badly  We booked the fashion suite and while it looks pretty   the shower had holes in the silicon around the base and it leaked all over the floor  they offered a kettle in the room but you needed to pay if you wanted to have tea or instant coffee satchels to use with the boiled water  thank heavens for the all night   Eleven type shop in front of the hotel   there was an oil burner in the room but you needed to pay RMB  for a candle to use it     They also made a mess with our booking and had only   night registered instead of   and before they even allowed us to check in and go to our room after a long drive  they made me go to the business centre downstairs and print out my reservation  Overall not impressed with the service and I have seen a lot more stylish hotels  I continue to recommend the Park Plaza in Beijing  
N => Generally a good boutique hotel but some carelessness nonetheless  
N => First class in Beijing  
N => Der beste Deal in Beijing  
N => Modernes Hotel in guter Lage   
N => A relaxing stay enhanced by the attention given by the staff  What a wonderful introduction to Beijing  This was a memorable place to stay and how fortunate we found it  We were welcomed at   o clock in the morning by e who was welcoming and spoke perfect English  This was followed by meeting Sandy who was equally conversant in English  he not only looked after us daily recommending various places to visit  but also booked and arranged our onward flights to Xian and Shanghai  We spent a memorable evening with e  Sandy and Su who we named  learning about their way of life enjoying their company  Thanks again to you all  
N => Good Hotel We stayed at this hotel for   days in a king size standard room  The room was generously large to accomodate   extra adult size beds for our   kids  Although the hotel was not quite new  we were happy with the facilities  Every hotel staff could manage some English although we had to repeat rephase our enquires to clarify matters  A supermarket is located within the Lufthansa Youyi Shopping City  just next to the hotel  where we could buy our daily supply of mineral water  We also liked the Korean restaurant there  next to the supermarket  as it served authentic Korean food  The hotel is also conveniently located for our sightseeing trips  
N => Bad location good staff good kitchen Furniture is old  the first        in Beijing for all that   Good breakfast  good restaurants in the hotel building and good  not so expensive on the streets around the hotel  Good staff  very good staff   rooms  business  mail  to change room   no problems  Personal is from Germany  Holland  England  Very competent Chinese staff  Toll    m  door   keeper  very pleasant  Very bad location         minutes by taxi to the center        RMB  But    minutes to airport    There was like a city in the city  There was music in the bath room TRIPLOVEJOY 
N => Nice but noisy Stayed only for an overnight  Location was great due to the nearby restaurant brewery biergarten  Room was comfortable but the construction noise vibration due to  quot renovation quot  was a disturbance  Temporary lobby is very small and crowded but staff was friendly  Concierge was very helpful  Once the renovation is complete  I think this would be a pleasant place to stay while visiting the city  
N => Excellent Choice in Beijing  
N => A Real   Star Hotel  
N => Not up to   star standard  
N => Ausgezeichnetes Hotel guter Service  
N => No better than last time I once again stayed for the weekend and unfortunately the Hotel has dropped even further  From the moment we booked in and the reception asked if we wanted seperate rooms even though this time I booked as Mr and Mrs beerfreind the reception was cold and uninviting The room   on executive floor was clean and comfortable  Room service banging on our door at      wanting to clean was not appreciated on any of the three mornings  The breakfast was average and cold  We stayed at Raffles on our previous visit and after this last effort we will return to Raffles in the future  Sad that a hotel could fall this far from grace 
N => Nice but room too hot Very nice hotel  good beds and a nice buffet breakfast  My only complaint was that the air conditioning was not working  and it was too hot in the room  Fortunately the window would open  and it was fall so I could get some cool air into the room Breakfast buffet had a good selection of Asian and Western dishes  The menu for dinner seems to have a lot of  quot fusion dishes quot  on it  food was good  but don t expect Chinese food here  You could listen to the TV in the bathroom  and you could control the volume  The bathroom was very luxuriously  and everything worked flawlessly  The wired Internet worked well and was very easy to get into  No extra charge for it  Landry was quick  cost was reasonable  and my clothes came back in good condition  Room safe is large enough for a laptop computer  Excellent chocolates in the downstairs lobby Entire floors are non smoking  
N => Good spot in Beijing I was in Beijing for business and spent two weeks at the Kuntai Royal Hotel  It was chosen for me by my employer  but I had no complaints  especially once I discovered the breakfast buffet on the second floor  which as far as I could tell was complimentary with my room  I m not sure if a special business rate was negotiated  but the final bill was surprisingly low for such a nice property  My only complaint was the temperature control  which mostly didn t work  I spent most of the nights with the thermostat turned way down  both windows as wide as they would go  and was still too hot  The  quot fancy quot  restaurant was disappointing  but the dinner buffet was reasonable  and one of the beverage options is refillable beer  Good free internet service  and the laundry service was not too expensive either  
N => Great Service  I was genuinely surprised at the modern  spacious  amp  clean room  The room was made more than twice a day on some days  Hotel staffs were also extremely helpful and efficient  Most of them spoke English  The location was great too  A short walking distance    min  to a train station  a huge supermarket was   buildings away  one fashion shopping mall diagonally across the road  I think the mall s name was  quot Yueshow quot  Mall  Similar to  quot Silk ket quot   but I found this one much cleaner  and more relaxing to shop as not as crowded    There were also few other shopping malls around the hotel  including an upper end mall with starbucks cafe  
N => Amazing Hotel   would definitely stay here again  We booked our trip through our local community center  They were going through Collette Vacations  At first  I was a bit disappointed that this hotel was a bit far from the city  but it turned out to be centrally located to all of the sites on our trip  The hotel was just beautiful  There were doormen that greeted us each day  The staircase in the lobby was remarkable  Our rooms were perfect   I just can t say enough about how wonderful this hotel was Room   The bathroom was black marble  with toothbrush  toothpaste  everything you could need  We used our room key to turn on the lights  The room was spotless  They had cans of Coke in the minibar  the kind with the  quot pull off quot  tab  I typically do not hit the mini bar   but I had to have one   it reminded me of when I was a kid   before the new fangled tabs that do not come off the can Dining   We had the breakfast buffet each day  We had PLENTY of western dishes to choose from   omlets  cereal  fresh fruit  hot cereal  the list goes on  There were also Chinese options  The Chinese do not eat eggs pancakes for breakfast  They eat lunch and dinner type foods for breakfast   and there were a lot of those options as well  We even had a Western Night dinner with Chocolate Cake and ICE CREAM  It was great On the day we flew to Xian  we had to leave before dawn  and the hotel had boxed up  quot breakfast quot  for us  They packed yogurt  a delicious apple  that tasted like a pear  a hard boiled egg  a sandwich  etc  so that we did not go hungry We had    quot fancy quot  dinners at the hotel  One was the  quot meet and greet quot  dinner  Lots of chinese cuisine served on lazy susan s  Mostly appetizer types choices   but very good  The other was on our last night  We had a lovely sit down dinner with choice of entrees  Service   The hotel delivered and picked up our luggage for us  we did not have to transport our luggage at all  They were very helpful with exchanging our money and mailing our post cards  The staff spoke plenty of Engish  I did visit the business center to send email to my teenagers who stayed behind with their dad   calling and emailing hit my wallet the hardest  I cannot say anything bad about our visit to this hotel  It was truly an amazing visit  
N => Amazing Hotel with best service We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour group based out of Hong Kong  Have to say it was so luxurious  downside is amenities had to be paid for so couldn t really do anything else once you got to the hotel  Rooms were superb and breakfast had a great variety  Rooms were very large with a spacious bathroom  Felt like home  Great view of back terrace  Had nothing to complain about  Very remote location  About    Yuan Taxi ride to city center   check out the silk market but be prepared to bargain ridiculously   D 
N => Service Challenged The hotel is quite beautiful inside and the rooms are furnished well  but it is a typical Chinese business in that the service is non existent and they do not attempt to proactively provide assistance  In regards to meals  don t even attempt to order room service in English unless you have a sedative and alot of patience  I stay here for business due to the location  but after spending several weeks on site I will be staying downtown in uary and paying the extra cab fare to avoid the poor customer service  
N => Excellent Service from staff but a little far I had a tour group of children and the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us  The facilities were fantastic and we especially liked the swimming pool which was free and supervised  The hotel was a little far from Beijing but that didn t spoil our enjoying being there  I would certainly recommend it to anyonw  
N => Nice but not a Crowne Plaza Any longer Booked by a friend and found out upon arrival it is no longer a Crowne Plaza  It is called Loong Palace Hotel and Resort  Could not believe all the recreational activites available  even a movie theatre  not open though   Weekend BBQ in the garden was super I would recommend this hotel to anyone  Nice big clean rooms and good price value  
N => Luxury serviced resident cheats people    be careful We have booked this hotel through booking com and cancel the booking   weeks before the booking date  According cancel condition this should cost   USD  After our trip to China we discovered the Luxery serviced resedent has charged us for   night even the booking com has confirmed the fault of the hotel  The hotel will not return money at once  The manager said it will take   months to refund the money  After a lot of communication the Luxury serviced resident stops communcate with us     So what can we do     the booking com will not take the responsibility as well  We can not do any thing else than just wait    That why  don t ever ever give your credit card information to this hotel  They will cheat you and don t care any thing about customers satifation 
N => just okay We stayed in this hotel last ober  We had some mixed feelings about the place   some good  some bad  but none fantastic or horrible First impressions were mixed  We were arriving late at night and once we navigated into the city and onto the street of the hotel it took us    minutes to actually find the place  It s not directly on the road  but off in a plaza  with no well lit signage at night and no direct driveway  Our poor taxi driver didn t know where it was either  and we just kept circling around  Finally we spotted it  and had to lug our bags over a grassy median and through a parking lot to get to the hotel The reception staff was extremely friendly  a young woman who was very enthusiastic even at the late hour  Her english was pretty good The hotel itself feels old and creaky  but it s not necessarily a negative thing  The main halls and lobby all seemed quite clean and well cared for  There are two elevators to access the rooms The room itself was a one bedroom loft  A split level with living dining kitchen bathroom on main floor  and bedroom shower bathroom on top floor  It s rare to find a one bedroom two bathroom hotel room  The shower is a wet room style   you shower over the sink and among some grimy looking pipes  The furniture seemed clean but not new  the rooms were the same  They were definitely not spotless  lots of dust and grime in the bathrooms  cracks along the walls   but they were not filthy enough to make us uncomfortable   no bugs or real causes for concern  just well worn  The bed sheets were relatively clean  I had a black smudge on my pillow case   Generally we were happy with our choice   great location  good service  rooms were okay  I could see that a place like this would be great for a family  or to have a space to hang out  the split level made it feel more like a home rather than a hotel room   We enjoyed it for what we needed it for   a bed to come home to at night  and a shower The hotel is located on a side street  Jianhua Nan lu   just off the main strip of Jianguomenwai Ave  There is not a ton of stuff right around the hotel  but there is a    hour      store  great to buy water  snacks  etc   and Jianguomenwai gets you to all the attractions in a flash  If you are traveling alone you might want to taxi it to the hotel at night as the side street is not well lit There was also a great cafe right around the corner   breakfast was included for hotel guests there every morning  which was quite tasty  a mix of continental and chinese fare  Also we d go there late at night for some tea  to use their free wireless internet and listen to their great jazz music  The staff at this cafe were so friendly  and they made a mean cup of tea I d probably stay here again if I were on a budget  If I could splurge a few more dollars I d probably stay elsewhere  
N => Can be better The   bedroom apartment we stayed in was great in design  we loved loft  But the large apartment was not very clean  We have to wear disposable slippers to walk around  Mineral water was only given on first day  All other hotels we stayed in during our trip gave us   bottles of mineral water every day every room  The toiletries are also not properly replenished  We had to use one roll of toilet paper collected from a previous hotel  But our apartment was serviced daily  Problem with the air con remote control was speedily remedied  Front desk staff have to be trained to greet guests  many just ignore you  Bellhop  some open the door for you and greet you  but not others  Assistant manager was helpful and courteous throughout  from reserving room to checking out  She even called to find out how we were  If only all the staff can be trained to be of her quality  It was the same with the MCS coffee around the corner  which provided breakfast for the Luxury guests  Helpful  obliging  but could do with more smiles  Food was o k   my only worry are the occasional flies  But there are covers for the dishes  But I didn t take the jams  The security in the hotel is assuring  but the laundrette room is outside of the security door in the carpark in basement    A bit scary to go there  I zoom in and out as soon as I can each time    washers and   dryers    more out of order  were inside the room  each machine require a bronze coin from the front desk costing RMB     Washing powder is provided free in the room  There is a   eleven in front of the hotel  very useful  YongAnLi subway station is    mins walk away  From there you can reach Tiananmen  forbidden city  wangfujin street  tiantan  etc  easily  Fast food  small eateries  restaurants abound in the vicinity  some just round the corner  some    minutes walk away  I recommend De Tai Lou  restaurant  which is   min walk away  Chinese food  cheap and takeaway allowed  Traffic in the vicinity can be quite heavy at times though  
N => Overall a nice hotel I stayed at the co Polo Parkside while I was in Beijing  The hotel is conveniently located to the technology zone  I was easily able to take a quick    minute taxi ride each morning to the office Finding a taxi might seem difficult at this hotel but it really is not if you just ask the doorman to call one for you  They have radios to call while you wait in the comfort of the hotel lobby The hotel is fairly new and well kept  However  I experienced the same shower problem mentioned by another reviewer  Water does leak out of the shower stall and when I reported the problem to the front desk they offered to move me  I soon learned to not point the water where the glass corners meet as that seemed to be where the water leaked I called housekeeping for extra towels and for laundry service  They did not seem to have anyone answering the phones who could speak English so that was somewhat of a challenge The Chinese restaurant also did not have anyone who spoke English on my visit  This resulted in an extra dish being delivered to my table because of a language mix up  It did not matter since the food was delicious and I enjoyed what I had been served My room included a daily breakfast buffet which had a nice variety of food  They can cook eggs to order but you might have to track someone down to do it as the cook does not usually offer to do so unless you ask On     mornings  it was very difficult to find a clean table  I think they might have had staffing issues as this was not the case on the other   days that I was this hotel The Beijing Olympic village is a     block walk from this hotel which will be nice during the summer games Overall  my stay at this hotel was very nice and I would consider staying there again  
N => Comfortable Hotel   But the area is not great Billed as a   star  it s a perfectly comfortable hotel with really generous sized rooms   Staff are charming with a good command of English  Dining options are alright but they need to be more than that as there are no decent restaurants in the area  Stayed in West Beijing for a conference but would prefer to stay more centrally if travelling for leisure as the area is not very interesting  But taxis are cheap so it wasn t a huge issue  National obsession with swine flu meant frequent temperature checks which was a bit bizarre  
N => one of the hotels compared to the other   star hotel  the lobby is not that impressive  otherwise  I have no other complaints 
N => A Hidden Treasure We stayed in this hotel as a family of four from ruary   to    during the Chinese New Year holiday  Even though the price of the hotel was attractive  I hesitated before I made the reservation because the location was a little odd and Beijing s traffic was notorious  However  this hotel turned out to be a very pleasant surprise for all of us  The room was HUGE by any standard  All furniture and bathroom amenities were very well maintained  The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful  Everybody paid attention to details and was ready to reach out and make their guests happy  This type of service attitude is not very commonly seen in China  One example is  during our stay  we felt the air was too dry and I asked for a humidifier which they didn t normally provide  They instantly gave us one that looked like it was being used in their office by themselves  The only down side of the hotel is its location  Not only that it is located on the west side of the city while most other  quot high end quot  hotels are on the east side  That was not a noticeable problem for us during the holiday when traffic was light  The problem was  the hotel s main entrance was in the back of the complex  Cars must drive around the buidling to find the hotel  That leaves all guest rooms facing the northeast and not exposed to the sunlight during the day  If riott was the landlord of the buiding  I would think they retreated into this subprime part of the buidling to give the sunny spots to their tenants for higher rental yield  I asked the hotel staff if that was the reason  They told me no and explained they made the change years ago because a Fengshui master told them to do so for better luck and fortune  Well  maybe the Fengshui master was right  The weird half hidden entrance makes this hotel a hidden treasure in Beijing  
N => Loved this Place  I booked on marriott com  It was my first time to Beijing  but the front desk made me feel at home  I went there last week for   nights  and I was tired from the time change  The front desk associate offered to help me with my bags becuase there was no bellman in sight  They were all presumably busy  The breakfast was fantastic  and the room was spotless  I called to ask the front desk for some toothpaste  and a housekeeper delivered it in   minutes  Great hotel  
N => Excellent Hotel We booked an executive suite in order to relax at the end of a busy tour round Inner Mongolia  The hotel is excellent  the building and rooms immaculate  the staff   all the staff   speak English  The executive lounge was great  the staff were charming  This is the second time in    months we have stayed there  the last time we had Chinese guests  The hotel treated our guests in exactly the same professional and courteous manner as ourselves  this is not always the case in China in my experience   I have often found that Chinese staff in other Chinese hotels can look down on Chinese guests compared to Western ones The staff here have that rare ability not only to say the right thing but to seem as if they genuinely mean it  They truly go out of their way to make you feel welcome The only criticism if I was forced to make one was that the carpet in the room was synthetic which meant I got electric shocks from everything I touched until I changed my footwear An excellent hotel  well deserving of its   stars  
N => Excellent Hotel   Location not great Our stay in Beijing was all part of our package holiday with Airtours  The riott hotel was excellent  The room we had was amazing   huge  Some people in our party ended up with suites There isn t a great deal to see around the hotel   there is a Pizza Hut next door and then a few shops but nothing else  You would have to get a taxi to the main parts of Beijing   but the transport is very cheap  It s worth staying here for the hotel  Breakfast was buffet style   with a huge choice  There was definately something for everyone  
N => Very Good Hotel Stayed at the hotel for   nights  Booked the executive floor with lounge access  The rooms are nice   the suites even nicer  My shower was not hot enough in a standard room after   days and was I moved to a suite with no additional charges  The lounge was good  English was at a pretty good level for the hotel staff  Food in the restaurant was good and they provided several  quot western quot  choices that were tasty  I m told the Chinese restaurant provided more Cantanoese style food  The hotel manager was very nice  friendly and humouous  Over all very good place to stay  
N => Nice hotel   Bad location The hotel room was nice  Generally the hotel staff was very nice especially when it was my birthday when they sent a cake  There were two complaints that I had of the hotel    The bathroom was not very clean    The location of the hotel was not in the best area 
N => Beautiful clean and excellent customer service Our family stayed at this beautiful hotel for   days  The staff was excellent and tended to our every need  Because we had a group of    we were upgraded to suites  The suites were two levels with two bedrooms  including a jacuzzi tub  The tour group they booked us with was excellent  The shows they recommended were outstanding  It is centrally located  not too far from anything we wanted to see The food in the restaurant was delicious and safe to eat and again the staff was very accomodating  We truly enjoyed our stay and hope you will too Frederick  yland  USA 
N => Four Star Hotel Five Star Service This hotel offers competitive rates as its location in the West of the city caters heavily to business travellers  Most tourists would probably find hotels in the center and east of the city to be more convenient The hotel offers adequate facilities  including a Bally s Fitness Center connected to the hotel  But  it is yet to install new mattresses  linens and towels and the air conditioning system seems to have a mind of its own  Food ranges from acceptable to very good  What sets this hotel apart is the service  Not only do the staff react quickly to your problem but they are great about following up to see that it was done promptly and correctly  This cannot be said of most hotels in Beijing or China  for that matter  
N => Good Hotel Bad Location Our party of six had reserved two rooms and was upgraded to a nice two bedroom suite instead  The room was big  but somewhat dated  The restaraunt was good  although a little expensive for the quality  The service was ok  but not great  The concierge service was not good The location is the opposite side of the city from the airport and not near any attractions  Staying near Wangfuijing street would be a better idea for tourists  
N => Would stay again Although slightly out of the way  not by very much   this hotel was great  The rooms were spacious and very well decorated  and the bathrooms were fabulous  The staff was extremely courteous and pleasant  Buffet breakfast was very good  My only complaint was that the rooms were slightly overheated  When we inquired  we were told that because it was Spring in Beijing  the hotel did not have the air conditioning running in the rooms  The main areas and hallways were cool  While the hotel was apologetic  there was nothing to be done  
N => Beatiful hotel but they need to work on the cleaning customer side I recently stayed at this hotel  the location is great  the rooms are large and nicely decorated  great bedding  however we had to wait four hours before we got our room due to the lack of cleaning people after a large group left  we were told that they only had    cleaners and therefore we had to wait  After we got our room the bathtub nor the shower was cleaned  the next day our room wasnt cleaned  we called on the   day to get clean towels  most of the people we talked to did get the same treatment   no room cleaning   the front desk people told us all kind of excuses as why the rooms were not cleaned  shame  that riot reputation will be tarnished by lack of quality service but I guess once you are there is nothing you can do but put up with bad management 
N => Nice One I did not expect it to be that good    The hotel was very clean  Rooms were neatly designed furnished giving it a modern look  Food quality was great  Full marks for a    rating  
N => A New Star in Beijing We booked at another riott in Beijing  and when we arrived it was not what we were looking for  The location was far out of the city and not in walking distance to any restaurants or sights  so we asked them to transfer us to Beijing City Wall  The other riott was not helpful at all  and upon arrival to our new local  we realized they had not even made the booking  The front desk was extremely helpful once we found someone who could speak english  They even upgraded us to a suite once they heard of our problems with the other hotel  We were travelling with our   children and they gave us   extra beds with no additional fees  The hotel rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed and the staff does everything they can to make your requests possible  The executive lounge was great with a good variety for breakfast and nice canapes which we thought were good enough for dinner   A couple low points  but nothing serious       Restaurants were good  but not into food for children    Jacuzzi in women s locker room not working for the whole week    Long lines for taxis High points      Excellent customer service  Treated our children excellently     Everything brand new  high quality surroundings with the asian flair    Great location  near restaurants and not far from sights    Nice toiletries    Great executive lounge Overall  we were very happy we stayed here  
N => Bad Service problematic location and bad smell in rooms  This hotel is very big with over      rooms  At the same time it is understaffed so be preapred to wait a lot of time for any sort of service We experienced numerous problems at the hotel    Check in took    minutes as there are many guests and few staff  Check in is Chaos as there are no queues and everyone seems to be standing around and jumping at the first available front desk person  No order with people pushing and shoving    Waited   minutes to get very basic info from the COncierge    Whe we needed a taxi we had to get one ourselves  There was no staff or bellboys to assist  I had to ask a passer  by to assist us to explain to the chinese taxi driver were we wanted to go since there was no hotel staff to assist    The hotel is at a terrible location and taxis find it difficult to find  One need to circumvent the are to reach the hotel due to its unique and bad location for transportation    The restaurant staff is completely indifferent  Even when the retaurant was not busy you would find   servers standing and talking with no interest to provide service to the guest  Talking with supervisors did little to help    Most hotel staff are young college students with poor english and virtually no hospitality and service training or experience and theis is why the service was bad    Various room problems  The water fluctuates between scolding hot to cold so taking a shower is  quot dangerous quot  and unpleasant  Terrible smell in the bathroom due to suage problems  The rooms have a hole in the floor where the suage passes so you get terrible smells  These issues are not room specific since we changes rooms and in different floors and the problems remained    The hotel made mistakes with the reservation  It took many repeated tries to get assistance to resolve the hotel s mistakes  We talked to fron desk  executive lounge reps  duty managers and others many times but the kept promising to solve the issue but refrained form doing so which made our experience tense and tiring   The hotel is like a chaotic factory  with too few staff which is extremely undertrained     Main restaurant the riott city wall bistro has very few options for western dishes and the dinner buffet is primarily chinese with precious few western dishes  Do not try to expect some flexibility in the restaurant as they will only say no  CANNOT There are much better hotels in beijing for this price range with better service so I would not recommend this hotel  
N => Great experience at riott City Wall We just returned from a few weeks in China  and our first stop was Beijing where we stayed at the new riott City Wall  We found it to be very comfortable  and the staff more than attentive and helpful  Since it was only   weeks old when we arrived  obviously everything was beautifully done  Very well equipped room with every amenity  The staff couldn t have been more delightful  We worked with several different concierges  and they were all as efficient as possible  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast each morning  and the staff remembered us each morning  The guys out front of the hotel  helped with taxi s  etc  were terrific also  We found the location to be convenient as anywhere  although a taxi ride is necessary to get to all the main historical sights  We had a wonderful guide for two days  Johanna  and unfortunately  we do not have her email  If you need a guide  ask the concierge  they can help with setting that up  We highly recommend a guide  car and driver  It is a MUCH better way to see everything very efficiently  She took us to Mytianyu to hike the wall one day  The second day we went all over Beijing to the main sites  including lunch with a family in a hutong  All in all a terrific first visit to Beijing  
N => Room for Improvement I liked the location of this hotel  close to Beijing Railway station  and the room itself was lovely  comfortable bed  great shower   but there is certainly room for improvement Upon check in  there was some confusion about what kind of room I had originally booked  as well as the late check out time I had arranged previously  In the end the problems was solved  but it took much longer than it should have  This hotel seemed to have attracted quite a few large tour groups  so there was always a huge crowd at the breakfast buffet early in the morning  The staff were often confused about where to seat the customers  e g  seating a party at an  quot available quot  table  but the table was actually already occupied by people who had just gone to get food from the buffet   The selection and quality of the breakfast buffet itself was good though  and servers were courteous Checking out also took a long time because of a mistake made with the breakfast billings  While waiting to have this sorted out  I saw an angry tour guide complaining to the front desk staff because they had failed to give morning calls to his tour group   days in a row Overall my experience at this hotel was still pleasant  because I was satisfied with the room itself  However  there is definitely a lot of work to be done in terms of better organization  management and service to bring it up to par with other   star hotels  
N => It s A Thumbs Up All The Way  Since the Summer Olympics  I decided to visit Beijing and see for myself what it s really like  It was my first visit there so I didn t know what to expect  I chose this property because one of my friends is employed with the riott chain and could offer me her Family  amp  Friends discount for rooms  Unlike the other reviews posted  I can honestly say I was not disappointed at this property  Although  I did encounter some problems in the rooms and had to move three times  I was satisfied with the results because the management staff upgraded me to a suite due to the inconvenience  The breakfast buffet in the City Wall Bistro is somewhat on the pricey side  approximately        US  but there s enough to please anyone s palate  As they say  when you re in a foreign country  you need to be open minded and experience the culture  as well as  the food  Don t be afraid to try Chinese dishes  as long as it doesn t crawl off your plate  then you should be fine  The Provincia restaurant offers a Tapas type menu so you re able to share your dish with someone  Just be sure to order enough dishes since they aren t full fledged meals but smaller to feed two people As for the staff  amp  service  I thought they lived up to the riott name  amp  beyond my expectations  If you re going to rate them based only on their language skills  as noted on the previous reviews   then you should be prepared and learn to speak their language beforehand  I m sure that if you travel to different countries  you should expect English to be the second language and with some difficulties understanding However  I had no language problem with neither the Concierge  Bell Desk nor Front Desk  As of a matter of fact  they clearly understood any questions I asked and carefully pointed out tourist sites on the map  You just need to speak to them slowly  amp  carefully so that they understand you completely  I should also note that I thought it was impressive to see the hotel GM greeting  amp  assisting guests in the lobby area  It is uncommon since they re normally at their desk or in meetings  I must ve run in to him almost daily  If he treats his staff with respect  amp  kindness  it was surely a reflection of their guest service   
N => Poor service and tired rooms No attention to detail at this hotel  Spoke to Michael Lucas who I found pompous and condescending in his approach I can only hope that this General Manager falls victim to the ever expanding recession  be a back to basics realisation is what this Manager needs  
N => A Fantastic Place To Stay In Beijing We spent   nights in Beijing as part of a tour and this hotel was fantastic  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and there were enough people who spoke English to make it easy to communicate  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning along with the beautiful view overlooking the garden behind the hotel  Each night when we returned to the hotel  our room was clean and comfortable  My only complaint was that the bed was very hard but that was the case at every hotel we stayed at in China  I think that s the way they like their beds  There were also a couple of days when they forgot to leave our   complimentary bottles of water but that was quickly rectified after a call to the front desk  The exercise and pool areas are second to none  I especially enjoyed the giant hot  very warm  tub with its many stations to water massage different parts of the body  I took lots of pictures and I ll try to upload as many as possible  I enjoyed the free Internet access while I was there and the desk area in the room was laid out very nicely for my laptop  
N => Fantastic Hotel Our stay at the Mercure Wanshang hotel in Beijing was a great experience Being of a more than reasonable price to start off  we were expecting our hotel in China to be ok with a bed and hot water  all we thought we needed   however we were surprised to find that our hotel was magnificent  Every need was catered for  from a full business lounge where you are able to make photocopies to faxing etc  to a massive gymand heated pool  to beautiful bar and dinning areas  to stunning rooms  The hotel staff were friendly and helpful  especially when explaining to a taxi driver where we wished to go The General Manager makes his guests feel like a million dollars and is a fountain of information regarding the ins and outs of China Thank you to all the staff for making our stay one never to be forgotten    
N => Best hotel experience ever My groups had the opportuntity to stay at the Wanshang Beijing for    nights during the Olympics of       From the minute we checked in until the early morning hour we checked out  the entire hotel staff did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible I d like to give a special thanks to Michael Lucas  the GM and to Alan  one of evening bell men  And also a thanks to the bar tenders for staying up with us until all hours of the night I highly recommend this hotel and hope that if I make it back to Beijing one day  I am able to stay here again

N => Magic   Michael s Unfortunately only stayed one night wished it could be longer  Everthing from internet booking to checking out was more than a positive experience I am disabled and the staff went up  amp  beyond expectations to assist  The staff of wonderful young women did their tasks in such a positive manner   astonishing  Thanks again to all   
N => seen be back to home I stayed two days in the hotel  seen to back to home  The staff are very nice  and good service  They are very helpful for my trip in Beijing  The hotel looks great  new equipment and comfortable bed which made me have a deeply sleep  I would be back to there if i go to Beijing next time  Michael s house is my first choice accomdation in Beijing  
N => A Great Hotel in the Hutong We recently stayed at Michael s House in a small hutong in Beijing  Before we even arrived  I had emailed the hotels to book a Peking Duck restaurant for us that came highly recommended  Upon our arrival  the restaurant was reserved and we even had our own private dining room   wow  what service  The   deluxe rooms we booked were great  very large and accomodating  We also had a safety deposit box in our room which is always a big plus  To top everything off  we had massages arranged at the last minute the night we arrived  A    minute massage after a long day of traveling made our stay at Michael s House one of the BEST of our entire trip  Penne from Memphis  Tn  
N => Wonderful experience  My friend and I stayed at Michael s House in early ober for   nights  We simply couldn t have made a better choice Our room was clean and quiet  Our beds had nice linens and were very comfortable  Breakfast was more than adequate  The staff were friendly and helpful  Michael and his wife were charming  Actually we felt quite pampered All in all  it was a great place to stay and we loved Beijing  I wouldn t hesitate to recommend Michael s House to anyone  
N => Nice enough place but some improvements needed  I stayed in this for   nights during my recent trip to China  I decided to book it after reading great reviews on tripadvisor comI agree with others that this hotel has a lot of charm and character  I found staff friendly and helpful  I did not however see any other staff apart from the reception staff I stayed in the tatami mat  twin  room  which does not have a bathroom  In order to use bathroom or toilet facilities  I had to parade through the communal area where other people sat  This area also has a reception desk  I guess due to the layout of the building  there is not much that could be done about it  but it can be a bit intimidating My room was facing the street and it was sometimes noisy with some people walking by and talking loudly late at night My room has quite small  but pleasant and clean  It did have a phone  but the phone did not work  I was told by reception staff that I could receive calls at he reception desk  which I did  It did not however allow me to have my telephone conversations in private  I would have been much nicer of them to swap my faulty phone with one another room  Breakfast was ok  There was a decent selection of food on offer  although it was a bit slow in coming  Breakfast was served as of   am  but some dishes only started to arrive half an hour later There is a computer with internet connection that can be used by guests Upon check out  I was presented with additional charges for   bottles of water  which I did not have  When I raised it with staff  I was told that I must have had it  as it was written on a sheet of paper by someone who cleaned my room  When I said again that this was incorrect  this was removed from my bill  I have stayed in   different hotels during my stay in China and this was the only one that did not provide free bottled water  For those who may not be aware  you cannot drink tap water in China The person who was dealing with me during check out did not know how to operate the credit card machine well and rather than cancelling my pre authorisation  she charged it on my card again and then said that she could not cancel it and would cancel it later that day  The location itself was quite nice  The hotel is located in an non touristy area with plenty of night food stalls in the close vicinity  It is within a walking distance from a metro station and a bus station  from which you can catch buses to see the Great Wall Despite some of my comments above  I would recommend this hotel to my friends and I would probably stay there again  
N => Thank you to all the staff   If we come to Beijing again it will be to  Michaels House  best two star acc  ever been to Helpful friendly caring  clean                 nothing negativ to say about Sean Edward as well as Michael and his lovely wife hope to see you again  
N => Could be better Michaels is located on the north fringe of the city  close to bus  amp  metro  The neighbourhood does not have any charm  amp  we spent a lot of time catching taxis to the eastern area of the city to eat  amp  sight see  Fortunately taxis are very cheap  Their breakfast is barely acceptable  The common room has a classroom feel to it with the manager sitting at a desk overlooking everything  The rooms are basic but comfortable  The bed was good  
N => Fabulous place to stay  Recommend this hotel to anyone who prefers a more personal experience to that of a large hotel  The staff particularly Sean were extremely helpful and helped us out with transport  visits  nothing was too much trouble  We got restaurant recommendations  directions written in both Mandarin and English which was extremely helpful  Michael the owner and his wife were extremely welcoming and interesting to talk to  Rooms were cosy  nicely furnished  beds very comfortable not hard as is usual in China  The central courtyard was a great place to sit and have a snack or a drink  Free internet access is also available  The hotel very kindly kept one of our bags as we travelled around China when we returned to Beijing ready for our flight home   lots of shopping  Hotel isn t situated in a touristy area and you get the chance to experience more of a local lifestyle  A thoroughly enjoyable stay  Thanks to evryone at the hotel who made us feel so welcome  
N => The place to stay in Beijing Good location  awesome staff  The staff went above and beyond  I know zero Chinese and had a few ideas of what I wanted to do when I got there  They helped us put it all together  On our first day Mike  the owner  took us out to the Summer Palace himself  Nicely decorated  good size clean rooms  
N => No better start to make We started our   week stay in China at Michael s House in Beijing  We made some arrangements before leaving like airport pick up etc  They did one hell of a job making ou stay as pleasant as could be  Punctual concerning the made arrangements  friendy as they try to do just everything needed to make you feel at home  advising as they take time to give you good advice to make your stay very pleasant  Not big but best in class   
N => Clean Convenient and Cheap Price Just at Wangfujing Street  near to subway  room was clean  service was OK  and most important    gt  rate was not expensive    
N => Nicely remodelled executive floors but toxic burning rubber smell made us think twice All in all this is a pretty good hotel  the public spaces have been remodeled very nicely as well as the executive floors  The rooms were very nice on those floors  comfortable and clean  The only real problem was an extremely strong burning rubber smell in the hallways of those executive floors  It was so strong we had to run to the room covering our mouths  It was present in the room as well  but not too bad once you stuck a towel under the door  We brought it up to the staff  but as expected  they just shrugged and said it s not a problem  That worries me  they really don t seem to be concerned about details like toxic smells  
N => New experience that gave me a bit of a different view Last  I stayed in the New World hotel again  This time I stayed in one of the   room apartments on the  th floor  First time I stayed on one of the executive floors and was very pleased with that room This room was very different  It was not refurbished for a long time  Although the rooms were clean  they looked a bit dusty  Both rooms had  working  airco  The little kitchen was OK  I only used the fridge  Also the bed room was OK  The only minor point was that the internet connection was in the bedroom and not in the living room  Both rooms had a new television  On my request they also placed a dvd player in the room The only major negative point was that the power outlets were UK style oulets  while I brought the new Chinese plug converters  EU   gt  Chinese   The hotel only wanted to supply me one converter and no extension cable The bathroom was big and clean  Only the warm water regulator in the sink was not working in the way it should  But that was not a big deal In general the service was OK  
N => Hotel room advertising photos must have been taken when they first opened   don t reflect today s condition I was horrified that our   star hotel was about the same quality of a no name motel you might pull into in the middle of the night on the side of the highway  The lobby is nice  but we had to change rooms   times  They first put us in a   bedroom suite on the  th floor  HA  I can t even begin to explain this suite  Definitely not one of the renovated ones  We re talking a fridge from the late   s maybe and thread bare blankets  So we moved into another room  Just a regular room  It was filthy  Nail clippings and food on the floor at the end of the bed  Not just little specks but food chunks  The a c was broken  The carpet may as well have been green shag  it was so old  It reeked of smoke  They came to look at the room when I called to complain and didn t even apologize for the dirty room  Called a maid in and when she argued with the manager that she had cleaned the room  he pointed out the floor  I was horrified  They moved us to the top floor  supposedly executive floor  and the room was tolerable  Same carpet  semi updated bathroom  extremely stale smoke lingered  just disgusting  ent breakfast buffet with wonderful service at breakfast  Concierge was helpful and polite  Front desk girls were slow and unhelpful with the rooms  Check in took a long time  We might as well have thrown money out the smoke sealed windows  it was such a waste  I would never stay here again  
N => OK business hotel Stayed at this Asian businessman type hotel at the suggestion of the Chinese tourist agency who arranged for our family of   first trip to China  The lobby is on the  rd floor of an office building  You need to change elevator banks on that floor to reach the rest of the building  A little odd  but you get to interact with office workers as they go in to work   The week we arrived  y         they were renovating the lobby and it looks lots better  The rooms are clean and new  though far from luxurious  The hotel  as most others in China  provide free bottled water in the bathroom  still can t drink the water yet if you are not Chinese      We opted for the breakfast plan   which was good since otherwise we would have walked a long while for breakfast  or gotten something on the road   a vendor sells breakfast at the corner   The breakfast buffet was very good   providing both western and Asian food including made to order omlets   The big plus to the breakfast  we also had two good dinners there  at the hotel was the view    the upper floor restaurant overlooks the magnificent China TV tower    a six million plus square foot chair like building that was just being completed as we ate our breakfast   Unfortunately I do not know how convenient the hotel was to the sites as we were picked up by our tour guide and driven from place to place  However  since the hotel is close to Beijing s World Trade Center  I can imagine it is a good location for business people The staff speaks English fairly well   but it took   of them to check us in  blame the complicated Chinese regulations requiring laborious copying of passports and filling out of forms   Everyone was gracious and perfectly groomed with uniform like outfits  
N => Not quite   stars but    My stay in this hotel had good and bad points   As some people have said here  the room was the low point  The room was generally clean but the carpet was badly in need of replacement  matted and soiled probably beyond any cleanability  The bathroom was generally clean but not all the rust stains were gone from the tub corners  The sheets were clean so that was good The service was generally good  we really appreciated the business center s fast  efficient work in getting us air and train tickets for the further legs of our trip  a big help since we had had trouble negotiating the process for getting Chinese air and train reservations on our own  it s a weird system where a credit card can t get you a guaranteed reservation      That s where the hotel lived up to its five star rating The hotel offers a great wall tour service that it seemed to be the bellmen s job to sell  Consequently  they weren t very helpful in advising us about other ways to get to the great wall  e g  the public bus service  Some of the charges in this hotel are definitely up to five star caliber  drinks from the mini bar were       RMB  and getting   T shirts    pairs of jeans    pairs of socks and   pairs of underwear laundered cost me a whopping     RMB  about US     
N => skanky flophouse with a marble lobby OK  I travel a lot  and I stay in a lot of hotels  and I m not particularly hard to please  But this hotel  which was booked for me by a customer  was one of the most disappointing I ve ever stayed in  You would expect a good experience from a Nikko hotel  wouldn t you  With this  quot property quot  you can probably expect one or more of the following  a   dead bugs in the bathroom  b   stinky plumbing  c   matted hair in the drains  d   filthy mirrors and surfaces that you don t want to touch  e   stained carpet  f   poor  stale  smoky ventilation  g   thin walls  h   banged up furniture  i   TVs that don t work  j   burned out light bulbs  k   surly non English speaking service  l   holed  cracked  gouged  chipped  scuffed walls that don t even meet up with the moldings  m   cracked and mildewed tiles missing grout  n   a strange  inconvenient location  o   banged up furniture  p   do you need any other reasons to NOT STAY HERE  Let s just imagine one of your typical interstate motels with a big fluorescent sign out front for        per night with  quot color TV quot  and  quot air conditioning quot   You take that  you add like    floors to it  throw a fancy lobby on to it  put it in China and there you have the Nikko New Century  There are gazillions of other options in Beijing that are way better  If you have to go with a tour group  fine  But for heavens sake  don t stay here if you don t have to  
N => Worst   star hotel Hotel is definitely about     stars  Public areas OK but rooms small  and carpets dirty  Our first night there  when we first turned on the water in the bathroom sink  the color was yellowish and had sewage smell with no hot water  The water eventually cleared out but the stinky sewage smell was still there  We had to switch to a different room  The breakfast is ok but the worst we have seen for a   star hotel  We would not stay there again  
N => Good Not Great Our tour group stayed there the first three nights of our trip  While not a true   star hotel  this is certainly a nice place with comfortable  though fairly small rooms  The beds were good and the bathroom was adequate but there was no comfortable chair and the television only brought in two English language stations  The lobby was magnificent  The breakfast was about average for Chinese hotels serving western food  The hotel was not centrally located though it made little difference to us since the tour bus picked us up in the morning  
N => Seen better days     Hotel has seen better days  Public areas OK but rooms shabby and small  I still have no idea where exactly this hotel was located  it did not seem close to anything  Took cabs everywhere  Plenty of good five star hotels in this city that you can give this one a miss  Wde would not stay there again  
N => Not a five star The hotel stay at the new century was a part of the cruise line operational package  Service is resonable  but I would not call it a five star  Three is more appropiate When our bus arrived  there was absolutley no bell service  we had to drag our luggage from the bus to our room  I cannot recall any hotel staff ever come up to greet us during our entire stay  As the room was rather stuffy  we turned on the air conditioning only to find out that the chiller was not operatiional that time of the year  We only had air circulation and was told to open our window if we need more  
N => Good location wonderfull breakfast  A mistake occurred with our booking  but it was no problem  we were up graded and we had   great rooms    of them  suites  It was the only place we truly enjoyed in Beijing  breakfast was great  if you are a foreigner in CHINA  you need to get a good breakfast because you dont know where you might find appropriate food again  Beijing was cold but when we walked into the hotel  it felt like heaven  great service  
N => Great location but dated stuffy rooms My husband and I live in China and came to Beijing with his parents who are visiting from Canada  We arranged a private tour with CITS and were booked at the otel Beijing Peace  You could not ask for a better location  walking distance to the Forbidden City and the Wangfujing Night ket  snack street  and if you are a shopper  Louis Vuitton and Burberry are just a stones throw away  The lobby was large and grand and looks like what you would expect from a   star hotel  After a reasonably quick check in  we headed to our rooms on the   th floor  our room was a fairly large corner room with a spectacular view but this is where the stars started to fad  The room was very dated with bad carpet  an uncomfortable and well used love seat and a brass and glass table straight from the    s  The bathroom was disgusting    The toilet seat was so old that it had yellowed and the fixtures were ancient and decrepit  To top it off the rooms were stuffy and hot and the windows did not open  In our room there was no A C but we were able to turn a fan on to get some of the air moving but my in laws were not so lucky  My husband then went down to the front desk to complain about the air conditioning and to get different room for his parents and was told that the hotel was booked and there were no other rooms available  They also told him that no rooms in the hotel had A C at this time of year and that it was like that in all hotels in Beijing    Please  this is not our first trip to Beijing and we have stayed in countless hotels during all seasons  don t give us that crap  After some negotiating the in laws were moved to a new room   better but still no A C and the room stank of smoke even though we were on a non smoking floor  The next morning we headed down for a delicious buffet breakfast which was included in our stay  The food was very good for a buffet and the selection was abundant  The hostess that brought us to our seats was friendly enough as were the many chefs and cooks but the waiting staff were in need of some serious customer service training  We were half finished our breakfast before we were able to get someone to bring us some coffee and even then it seemed like we were bothering her  It looked like none of the waiting staff were happy to be there  moving slowly and never smiling I would also like to say that the cost of the internet in the room is outrageous at     RMB for    hours  although this is not exclusive of this hotel  Anyways  long story short   I will not be staying at this hotel in the future and I would not recommend it to anyone  
N => A bit of a disappointment If you re searching for an affordable hotel within walking distance to the heart of the city  otel Peace is not a bad choice for the price BUT don t expect much  The lobby is deceivingly well furbished but as soon as you re shown to your room  you d be a little disappointed  The first three days were were in a twin room  It was a pretty good sized room but it was oddly shaped  facing the backstreet  and worst of all  there must have been some plumbing problems because part of the carpet was wet all the time  We didn t complain because we were barely in our room  but on our  rd day  half the room was soaked  We received a note from the reception saying that they would like to reassign us to an  quot upgraded quot  room on the   th floor  They should have done this a long time ago but we should also have complained  It was a nuisance packing our stuff and moving on our last evening knowing that we d have to re pack the next day  The  quot upgraded room quot  was a twin Queen room with a nice view of the surroundings but there was mould living in the bathroom and its condition was worst that our first room Besides our rooms  the facilities and service is a meager  quot ok quot   The swimming pool cannot accommodate more than two serious swimmers  breakfast  if not included with the price of the room  is pretty expensive for Beijing standards     Euros per person  and although the variety of food is great  you d get a better deal at local restaurants  Service  There wasn t quite much besides organized tours which was overpriced  My mom and I paid     RMB for a driver to take us to the Great Wall and the Ming Courts  We sorta regretted later as the driver was always rushing us  We decided to go for this option in the first place to AVOID the hectic of tours  One word of advise  take a whole day for the Summer Place  It s worth it and you can get there easily by taxi  Check out the option of taking a ferry from the zoo My mom and I decided that we would split up our week s stay in Beijing first staying at a traditional Hutong courtyard hotel    minutes from the city center and then move to a more conventional hotel for the swimming pool and travel convenience  All our knowledge about Beijing stemmed from travel guides and internet sites so we didn t really know the layout of the city  Although otel Peace is really close to the Forbidden City     minutes walk  and to the shopping district of Wangfujing    minutes walk   our Hutong  Ji House Courtyard Hotel  www jihousecn com   situated close to Gulou was a much better place to stay in terms of sight seeing and nightlife  It gave us a more authentic feel for Beijing  whereas Wangfujing area is over priced  over westernized  and not too exciting  However  the second day of our stay at otel  we discovered lots of small  wonderful local boutiques behind the hotel great for shopping  Verdict  I d will most likely try another hotel next time  If the price is right  we paid    Euros per night which was really cheap   and if you don t plan to spend too much time at the hotel  sure  it s not too bad of an option  
N => Affordable luxury in the heart of Beijing I was impressed the minute I walked in the lobby  We were immediately greeted by a bellhop who took our bags  My daughter and I arrived at midnight and were told that my son who had arrived at      a m  had checked in at that time  I assumed he would have had to wait until the afternoon to get into a room  My request for an extra blanket was immediately met  The room was very clean  The concierge was always very helpful  When he made reservations for us to see an acrobatic show we arrived expecting to be shown to the cheap seats that we paid for  but we were taken the center of the front row  The free buffet breakfast was great  The only thing I disliked was the smoking in the lobby and bar  Unfortunately that seems to be the norm anywhere in China  
N => not so nice hotel and not a nice staff This hotel was a bad experience  I am a A club goldmember that is a card where you get some extra s  You can get a free upgrade when the hotel is no full and also you can get late check out  With the booking i asked the hotel to give me a upgrade from the superior room to the excutive room  When we checked in the staff did not know anything about the request of our upgrade  There came a lady to help and she told me that next time that i want mine upgrade i need to call the hotel  But in the reservation form of the hotel you can put a text for the hotel  She sad to me that she will give us a upgrade because the hotel was half full The upgrade was nothing just a bigger superiorroom and not what the website of the hotel told us a room with free internet and a apple dockingstation They also made a mistake with the internetconection  You can by internet for    hours we did that for   days  When we want to settle the bill they charged us   days of internet  When we explained to the reception that there was a mistake the girl did not want to listen because she did not understand us  After    minutes complaining and explaining she charged us   days  But she still did not understand us The rooms are not very nice and very old the really need to upgrade the rooms The breakfast was a real party a great buffet with a lot of choice I will never stay again in otel Peace Beijing because of the service the don t give  
N => Initially disappointing got better Arrived late at       pm  Although we have booked and paid for in advance by many months and advised them we were going to arrive late they hadn t pre allocated us our requested rooms   two adjoining rooms as we were a family of five in the main block preferably higher up with a view towards the Forbidden City   I had read other Trip Advisor reviews to ask for this     Instead they gave us two old rooms on different floors in the adjoining tower   room numbers start with   if you are at reception and they try to give you one of these rooms  They said they were fully booked that night and that there was no other option   letting us inspect the rooms to see if they are suitable  After a    hour flight what could we do   say they weren t suitable and go to another hotel     remember we had pre paid  Anyway they promised to move us the next day  In the adjoining block the carpets were very water stained and smelt musty   the hallways had low ceilings and the rooms looked like they hadn t changed since the      s  The beds very very very hard   so it was better to lie on your back to try and spread the pressure of your body over the mattress rather lie on your side and know where all the pressure points are  Anyway they did move us the next day to the main block to Level     We did have a distant view to the Forbidden City and to the back of the otel where they was still a cluster of Hutongs  The beds were much better here  Rooms were spacious and about average   we have been to better otels in other countries  There is free wireless internet at the lobby bar   room internet is exhorbitantly priced and although they had two free Macs in the lobby one was down and the other one was lways being used  Breakfast was nice although a bit pricey  Cheaper good food at the mall   minutes walk down to Wafujing St on the  th floor  Bottled water in the rooms a rif off considering you could get it for     RMB from the local convinience store   why pay    RMB in the room  Stayed    nights   great central location   walked the second day to the Forbidden City   would have been better to take the taxi as it was    degrees Celcius  
N => Alot to learn about guest expectations Outstanding location  poor service  A weekend treat away from Bangkok to Beijing where the worst service we had all weekend was on the executive floor of this hotel  Staff are surely poorly trained if they cannot offer you a glass of water in the lounge rather than give you a lecture on how they will charge you for a bottle of water instead  Thankfully all the other places and service we encountered in Beijing contradicted this poor impression  
N => Reasonable Hotel great location The hotel was good  It was within walking distance to the Forbidden City and the shopping district  There was a subway station within   minute walk which meant you can get around Beijing without much problems  Downsides   the bed in my room was unyielding hard and could not get a strong wireless signal for internet access which was supposed to be free  Staff were generally very helpful   I would stay there again  
N => A very pleasant stay    We stayed for   nights on         room      and       and would say it was a pleasant stay at the hotel  Upon arrival  we were given suite rooms but we didn t like the idea of walking to the other wing of the hotel when we were brought to the rooms  So the reception staff was very helpful to make changes to give us executive rooms instead  Though we wished the rooms were on higher floor and non smoking  we believed the staff had tried their best to accommodate to our request  Anyway  it was already very nice of the hotel to give us complimentary upgrade to executive rooms  Room      had strong smell of smoke when we entered the room  but the housekeeping staff on duty were very helpful too  they sprayed air refresher and it helped to get rid of the smoke smell   The concierge staff  Mr Stephen Mao  was commendable  He spoke very fluent English and helped us identify the tourist attractions which we should visit in Beijing  He also helped us to arrange for an English speaking taxi driver to bring us to the Great Wall  Mutianyu   The free internet access at the lobby allowed us to check our e mails and be connected with our loved ones back home  Excellent  On the whole  we enjoyed our stay at your hotel and will look forward to staying there again  
N => A pleasant stay First of all  I arrived mid afternoon from Shanghai and was surprised that at     pm the room wasn t ready  I then found out that the internet in the room wasn t complimentary  I brought it to their attention that when I made the booking through Expedia co uk that they had phoned the hotel to check and that the hotel confirmed it was so  The receptionist  reluctantly agreed to honour this promise  I was offered a drink and asked to wait till the room was ready  They had no King size beds available and I was put in a room with   queen beds even though I was down for an executive room   bed  By the way  the queen beds looked like large singles Nevertheless  the room was comfortable and spacious and there was a comfortable sofa to sit on  Nice floor to ceiling windows which were in need of a clean  though  I missed the bathroom I had in Shanghai and the wonderful shower at The Bund Riverside  The phone in my room was turned off which I only discovered on the last day when I asked for an early morning call and the bell boy had to come upstairs and knock on the door as I wasn t answering  Fair dues  not their fault  previous tenants must have switched it off  I chose not to eat breakfast there as it wasn t included  The man at the tour desk was very helpful and I chose to book a tour on a small bus with a small group to the Great Wall and Ming tombs which was fine On the whole  aside from the early hiccups  it was a pleasant stay  But the moment you step out of the building be prepared to have to deal with all the soliciting and massage offers  You get used to it after a while     
N => Could be better During our stay in Beijing  we stayed in both the otel Peace and otel Xin Qiao  To be honest  I enjoyed the Xin Qiao better  The Peace building seemed to have older rooms  Until we got our upgrade to the premium floor  which is what we were supposed to have in the first place  it wasn t great  Luckily it was only one night    but I felt the regular rooms were dirty and during the night  the ventilation kept making a high pitch sound  I thought it was something in the halls but it wasn t  Breakfast at the Square near the lobby was a lot better than breakfast in the premium lounge  Way more selection  and fresher food  however  it isn t worth whatever they charge  about    RMB or so  All in all  if you can afford it  stay in the premium suites  Cleaner  newer  free breakfast  and Happy Hour  which was great    free drinks and snacks between  pm and  pm  As an aside  the subway is about a   minute walk    not far but when compared to the otel Xin Qiao  Xin Qiao is steps away from the subway  If I had to choose  I would go Xin Qiao over Peace  
N => Great Location Needs Better Maintenance As mentioned in previous reviews  the location of this hotel cannot be beat  Easy walk to Forbidden City  shopping  restaurants  etc  But the rooms  or at least the room we had  which was booked as an upgraded room  do not recall the exact term  but a higher price than their standard room  was sadly in need of care  The room was large  the bathroom was very large  the bed was comfortable  but the carpeting was worn  the draperies were dangling off the hooks  the TV was old and got poor reception  the bathroom shower curtain was stained  the marble in the bathroom had mildew stains  the towels were small and thin  In sum  the room was shabby  and gave off an atmosphere of poor maintanence  With just a bit of work the place could be brought up in standard and to us  this speaks of poor management  how difficult can it be to put the draperies back on the hooks  to replace a shower curtain  to scrub the mildew off the bathtub caulking   Too bad  because the hotel is so well located and has such potential  but we would not book there again unless assured that the rooms had been refurbished  
N => Loved the otel Peace Beijing We have just spent   days at the otel Peace and it was excellent  my son stayed free as he is only     I had read good and bad reviews but decided to stay there  the buffet breakfast was the best we have ever had  even better than the Sofitel in Xian  freshly made crepes while you wait  I had been advised to upgrade to an executive suite which we did  we had a   room suite with   tvs  my son had a rollaway bed in the other room  the only fault I could find was the bed was a bit hard  this was the only hotel we came across with free internet in the lobby    large apple macs  it was great  The service was excellent  Stephen was our porter when we arrived  he speaks good english and wrote down some names for me in chinese for the taxis  we loved the otel Peace and wouldn t hesitate to recommend it to anyone  it was even better than the otel in Shanghai  
N => doesnt quite live up to   star rating stayed at this hotel from agent recomendation  and it doesnt quite live up to a   star reputation  I only had a superior room booked  so didnt expect too much  but when checking in to my room i have to say it was very dissapointing  the room just could fit a double bed  not much more  and it was dark  dank  old i asked to change rooms  and to their credit swapped me into a twin room  bigger  even with two double beds  it had a couch  great view from    th floor  and was clean  about what i would expect from a   star hotel breakfast was included   and for the   days of my stay  we ate brakfast everymorining at hotel  which is a buffet style  and is one of the best i have seen  lots of choice  all hot  fresh hotel is in wanfujing area  and is very close to everything  you can walk to forbidden city  its close to   different metro stations  and is very well located  hotel has a currency exchange desk  and concierge were helpful at all times    they have their own security who were abit overbearing most of the time  stopping us   nighs out of    when coming back to hotel late at night  to check if we had a room for   people    other wise a very nice place to stay  but i think     star at best 
N => Modern hotel in great location    with a few mishaps We decided to book this hotel based on the otel name  consistent  mid range quality  and location  convenient for the main attractions  and overall we were not disappointed  It was modern  felt safe  seemed well maintained and was clean  The room was spacious and well appointed and the staff  all of whom spoke excellent English  were very helpful I would recommend the place subject to certain caveats Hard bed  Our bed was mind bogglingly hard  I personally don t have a problem with that  but it drove my wife nuts and she hardly slept the whole time we were there  Something to bear in mind The food  The restaurant tries to do a bit of everything  food court style  and doesn t really manage it at all Great Wall trip  The concierge organised a car and driver to take us to the Great Wall  On a previous trip  I had just hired a taxi for the same quite inexpensively  but this time  I was lured into it by the apparent ease of the arrangement  Wrong wrong wrong  The trip was organised round the driver s schedule rather than ours and involved in addition to the Great Wall and Summer Palace that we wanted to see  several stops at jade factories and the like run by his mates that we did not want to see  The first place we played along with  but he was not amused that we did not want lunch at his friend s restaurant  we broke sandwiches  and distinctly unimpressed when he did not get a kickback from the second factory since we didn t buy anything  We were rewarded with the most dreadful driving you can imagine    we re talking narrow hilside roads  on the wrong side and when he took the key out of the ignition when we were moving to start messing with his phone    at   mph    I had to make him stop  Not a pleasant experience  but at least the arrangement was only cash on safe arrival back at the hotel Why do I relate this story  Well I do hold the hotel responsible for recommending this lunatic and his downright dangerous driving and interest only in  quot commission quot  from the unwanted stops is something that reflects badly on the hotel The surroundings  The area in which the hotel is located has been massively re developed in recent years and whilst it is indeed a convenient walk to Tiananmen Square for example  around    minutes   the surroundings lack any charm and whilst I personally didn t mind this  if you are looking for an  quot authentic quot  Chinese experience  you may be disappointed  
N => nice place We stayed there for   nights  The hotel has a great location  perfect breakfast  good clean room  The service could be better but it s not a   stars hotel  right  Be honest  I don t have complains  I had a good time  
N => Does the job Stayed for a few nights in this hotel and overall it was decent enough  Booked a double room and there were none available so we were upgraded to a suite which was appreciated  The room was spacious and unfortunately a little grubby in places but not bad  Bed was hard but I had no issues sleeping on it  The actual d cor was a little     s  brown colour scheme  not in a classy way either  with cheap upholstery Breakfast was buffet style and pretty good The location was fine with a ready supply of metered taxis driving past that you could flag down  Get the hotel to write on a piece of paper where you want to go and the hotels name as well so you can get back Booked my holiday as a package and had two days pre booked sightseeing with a guide and driver  They were ok but we got dragged to the usual shops factories and fed pretty poor food  For the last two days I got in touch with Sophia        an independent guide  She charges about     per day and is well worth it  She ll take you to see what you want  take you to proper Chinese restaurants and not drag you round shops or factories  If I had one piece of advice for tourists going to Beijing it would be drop the travel agent  Book your flights and hotel  Get a taxi from the airport  really easy  safe and cheap  and book an independent guide  You ll get so much more out of your holiday Other than the usual tourist stuff we also visited Chuandixia village  From what I read on the internet I thought I was going to a real Chinese village off the beaten track  After a     hour drive I got to a village where farming has given way to tourism  Its pretty and the buildings are original but it s all catered towards tourists and really not worth the drive  I would also recommend Beihai park  Much much quieter than the forbidden city and in my opinion more interesting  
N => An average hotel with a nice lobby We picked this hotel because it was close to the Wangfujing area  walk takes    minutes   We stayed here in il       Right behind was a Hutong like area  but it did not catered for the tourists  Around the hotel  there were places where you could buy food and provisions  and some restaurants  We saw interesting things  like a man setting up a business by the side of the road which repairs bicycles  The hotel has a very nice marbled lobby  and it was quite busy when we were there  Check in was efficient  but when we were assigned our room  we asked if it was a non smoking room  It was not  and it took a while to change it to a non smoking one  Our room was OK  but light on furnishings and decor  There was one problem with the sheets  which were soiled and not washed properly  Service was as you would expect of a otel hotel   good  Apart from the lobby  the corridors were narrow and looked tired  Breakfast was not included with out room and was pricey for our budget  so we got ourselves fresh baked breads from a shop round the corner  We asked the porter where could we go to sample the famous Beijing duck  and he directed us to a famous restaurant chain in Beijing  We had the duck there  and it was pricey by Beijing standards  Not surprisingly  it catered for the tourists  On our last day  we found a restaurant right next to the hotel which served Beijing duck for half the price  All in all  we had a good stay at the otel Peace  but there were arguably better choices around  
N => Terrible service and management I stayed this hotel for my marriage anniversary trip this month  My experience was terrible though I am not sure if I was just unfortunate or the hotel s service is problematic  My room was executive room that has nice plasma TV and free access to executive lounge for breakfast and early evening snack drink  Breakfast and snack drink are both terrific  Further  executive room guest has two options for breakfast  either  st floor main restaurant or   th floor lounge  Anyone staying over three nights  having two options make breakfast experience much more enjoyable  The hotel has a terrific location too  Very easy access to Wangfujing  Tiananmen  Lama Temple and Temple of Heaven through newly opened subway      Throughout Dongdan and Dongsi street  less than a quarter mile east from the hotel   travelers can find many interesting small  independent artistic shops for ethnic cloths  bags etc  Hotel facilities are somewhat outdated but acceptable  You can see that the hotel tries very hard to keep up with new facilities  Executive rooms are recently updated and have many comfortable features  Nevertheless  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for following reasons  in order of minor to major problems     If you arrive  you will receive a letter that indicate variety of executive room previliges  including newspaper every morning  Strangely  they never deliver newspaper to rooms on the   th floor  I had to complain to recieve it     Do not use hotel s tour service  I went to the Great Wall and Ming Tombs through their service  A group of   left    mins after the promised departure time  After about   mins visit to the Ming Tombs  the bus stopped by two shops wasting more than two hours  Then  we went to lunch to have the worst Chinese food in my life  Due to earlier  quot forced quot  visit to shops  our lunch time was less than    mins  Then  it went to the Great Wall  The guide gave us less than one and half hour  After busy picture taking  the bus visited another shop    this time  a ridiculously overpriced tea shop in the middle of nowhere  When the group finished the shopping  quot obiligations quot   Beijing was already full of traffic jam  The guide and driver asked me and my wife to take taxi to go back since others  hotel are located in different direction  It was gruesome even though the tour guide found a taxi and paid in advance for our return trip  From   am to      pm  actual cultural experiences at Ming Tombs and the Great Wall lasted less than two and half hours  Considering re direction and others  forced shopping at three different shops costed us about four hours  For this terrible service  they charged     RMB p p  For some cheap group tour  usually         RMB  to Great Wall  my experience may not be unacceptable  Nevertheless  for the price offered by the hotel  this is simply unaccetable disgusting  horrible experience  I strongly complained the hotel manager and offered two tickets for Peking Opera next night  The only reason I did not complain further and accepted their offer was because my wife did not want to see any disturbance during the trip     The bathroom had two problems  Water drain in the shower booth did not work well sometimes  but not always   I guess it tends to flood when other rooms are using shower booth together  I sometimes had to stop the warter until it drains  Glass wall of the show booth was not fully water proof  After shower  the whole bathroom floor was wet  I complained these problems a couple of times  For the first problem  I got the answer that they could not find any problem  I suggested my theory   drain problem occurs when many rooms are using shower booth at the same time  Then  they said   quot we cannot control other rooms  use of shower booth  quot  Quite compelling explanation  They never attended my second problem until I leave     I booked this hotel because I believed that this hotel is eqipped with bidet  many websites listed it including expedia  someone here also mentioned it   I needed it because of medical reasons  Hence  I cancelled my original reservation at Park Plaza and booked this hotel though this hotel was about     per night more expensive  I could not see a bidet in the bathroom  I went to the executive reception desk  They did not know what bidet is  After a few phone calls  the attendant explained that the hotel used to have it but not anymore  I though I was just unlucky  Two days before I leave  I went to meet an assistant manager to complain three problems I mentioned above here  At the end of the discussion  I briefly mentioned about my disappointment about unavailability of bidet in the room  The manager was surprised  He said   quot actually some rooms have it  quot  I was dismayed  If some rooms have it  why they did not offer an option when I checked in  I was really furious and protested seriously then  Next morning  I met a guestroom manager to protest about this  He apologized and offered a new room  I did not take it as I did not want to pack up and move for just one night  we had some baggage   He instead offered     discount  That was meager considering all my troubles  But I just accepted it  My stay could have been happy ended if my next experience did not happen         When I checked out  the executive floor manager said that  quot we are giving you     discount because of your troubles with water drain and newspaper delivery  quot  I replied that  quot no  I did not receive discount because of newspaper and drain  That is because of  quot bidet quot  quot   The manager said   quot what is bidet  quot  I was entirely lost  It seems people in this hotel is not communicating each other  I guess that is the source of all troubles in this hotel  Did I have to explain all over again why I was unhappy  The room rate was slightly over      after  quot generous discount  quot  I found that this hotel has a serious problem in terms of communication and management  It seems the hotel is mainly for group tourists and Air France employees anyway  It is not for an individual traveler for sure  
N => Good location Travelling in business I stayed four nights at this hotel  It has a good location close to Wanfujin St and within    min walking distance to the Tianamen Forbidden city entrance  I got a good reception and was able to check in early     in the morning   My room was at the second floor and had an immaculately clean bathroom  In spite of having signs warning for the noise disturbances due to the reconstruction of the hotel nothing was heard  The view could had been more exciting but the service offered with the early check in was worth not seeing the Tianamen sq  The concierge desk was very helpful with practicalities as maps  shopping info  directions etc The breakfast was very good and offered av variety of things I would definitely stay here again  
N => Regular guests My husband and I live an hours drive from Beijing CBD  We attempt to regularly have a weekend in Beijing and the Peace otel is our favourite hotel  We have now stayed on five occasions and each time was a pleasant experience Twice we were fortunate to be upgraded to lovely   th floor suites but just the standard rooms are pleasant enough  We will continue to treat the Peace otel as our  holiday home  In order of priority  the main reasons we stay are the  cleanliness  meals  comfort  pool  staff  location  price  coffee  wine selection  
N => Great stay in the Centre of Beijing We wanted something in the centre of Beijing and this fitted the bill perfectly  it was a few hundred meters from the night market and the main shopping pedestrian area  this may not sound much but Beijing isnt the easiest city to walk around so having places to walk to in the evening was great  Room was quite small but nicely  and newly  fitted out and facilites were good pool  small gym etc  Breakfast buffet was great as well  Staff were v friendly and concierge came up with great restaurant recs nearby  
N => A Good Base As we booked our stay through a travel agent not sure what we paid  It was called at Superior Room  Room       but was very much like what we would have expected for a Standard Room  maybe they call standard rooms superior there   and then you go up to deluxe  etc  Anyway  couldn t actually fault the room  It was comfortable and clean with a good bathroom  But as it was called  quot Superior quot  I was disappointed at the size   not even a table and chair   and certainly no outlook  However  the Hotel itself was otherwise faultless  Right from the time we checked in all staff were most obliging   with the Conceirge staff being outstanding  As we were determined to do everything ourselves and not join any tourist groups or take on a guide  without the help of the Conceirge staff we maybe wouldn t have managed so well As an example  we wanted to go to the Great Wall somewhere where the hoards of tourists don t go to  They arranged for a car to take us to Simatai  and our climb on the Wall there was about the highlight of our whole stay in China  Only cost     Yuan for a full day The location of the hotel is spot on  We walked to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City  and the adjoining two gardens  Good shopping  small restaurants  the night food markets  etc  are all nearby  To go further afield  taxis are ever so cheap  The Hotel provides a card with their own name and location written in Chinese  and overleaf the names and locations of about    sites also in Chinese and English  Invaluable when you are out and about by yourself  The Hotel also provides a good map  Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them Breakfast was excellent  It took ages for the hot water to come through  sometimes   minutes   When it did come it was perfect  However the Hotel must have the most enormously excessive water usage because of this Would definitely recommend this Hotel and stay there again  
N => No good This is another bad otel hotel  Stayed in one in Paris  otel Eiffel    we should have known better  Supposedly   stars   what a stretch  Service is so so  Its only saving grace is the western asian breakfast Bathroom was moldy   room       While true that others in our group were upgraded  we were not  I am guessing that was done selectively  I will not elaborate further  
N => Good deal I would return I stayed at this hotel in ch       and found it perfect for my needs When we first arrived we were placed in a smoking room  being from Australia I forgot that you can smoke in some hotel rooms overseas   we however asked to change to a non smoking room and had no problems The buffet breakfast each morning was excellent   plenty of variety and the food was fresh The staff were quite clueless  but from my experience this quite normal in China  Don t expect them to be able to answer your queries should they deviate from the obvious  and be reminded that most of them do not speak english The rooms were very clean and were serviced daily We only had one problem and that was with an international phonecard  that we bought from a shop outside the hotel  to call home  The phonecard did not work on the hotel phones  the staff could not explain why and seemed surprised that it didn t work   International phonecards do not work on public phones either  they only take domestic phonecards   This resulted in us having a    AUD phonecard that we could not use and could not return  The hotel assured us that this problem has not occured before I suggest that if you buy a phonecard to call back home  which is much cheaper than using the hotel s rates  that you buy it from the shop in the hotel  and get them to assure you that you can return it should it not work  
N => Great rooms and location shoddy service The otel Peace was our first stop on a two weeklong trip to China  The hotel has a very impressive lobby and spacious rooms  All areas in the hotel were clean and maintained  which was a relief to come back after a smoggy day in Beijing  There was much variety available at the breakfast buffet  though this it was rather overpriced  However  service is another story  The bellboy had his own agenda and tried on several occasions to persuade us to order an all day touring taxi through him  The Business Center attendant seemed to hate her job and will make this very obvious to you on each visit  The tour to the Great Wall  Mutianyu  arranged through the hotel was small and the site did not disappoint  However  the guide babbled in the beginning and was stone silent when we reached the site and afterwards  If you would like an informative guide  do not book tours through the otel Peace  
N => No windows  Location was good  very central  Room was awful  First room didn t have a window  we moved to a room with a blank brick wall   cm away from the window  then moved to another room but the toilet was permanently blocked  Toilets in the lobby were also blocked  obviously a problem with the plumbing  Bed was typical Chinese   hard as a rock  I am sure there are better options in Beijing  
N => Good location but very old and dirty rooms The Hotel is very well located and practically everything is accessible from there  We had problems when checking in  because theycouldn t find our reservation even with our receipt and Ref  Number  poor performance of the staff on this section  The first impressionat the lobby was great but not once we entered in our room which was old  dirty and with a terrible view of old houses s roofs  The bath was not enough clean  specially in the shower area Heating was not working properly in the room  so it was cold  The person in charge of the Business Center  a chinese lady was very rude and lacking of customer focus  Her initial words were  quot if you want to use Internet be aware the cost is   yuan          per minute quot  The main Restaurant was good  Excellent buffets The main value of this hotel is just its location  but it doesn t have the quality service of the otel Hotal Chain  This is the first time we are highly dissapointed by a otel Hotel  and it was not cheap  
N => Nice lobby great buffet dumpy rooms and you ll want to know    All the reviews about this hotel are spot on  however I feel compelled to share my experiences in doing business and traveling in China  If I can help just one person avoid some of the hassles and mistakes I have made  I will have accomplished my mission  The most important thing to remember about traveling to China is that the culture is such that honoring a reservation is a distant second to trying to get you to pay more for everything  Don t worry  they don t specifically single out the tourists   they spend the same amount of time doing this type of thing to one another as they will you  I have booked mutiple reservations  Shanghai  Xi An  Beijing  over the course of several years and many times they have claimed to  quot lose quot  my reservation  even the prepaid points reservations from American Express  and I have to fight to get what I have already paid for in some instances  This hotel  quot lost quot  my reservation as well  The rate I had for two rooms  prepaid through American Express  was      US per night  Oddly enough  they confirmed that I had paid the full price for both rooms and yet claimed to only have one room for me and a full hotel  Long story short  two calls to american express  four to the hotel and they promised to  quot accomodate quot  me when I arrived   only after complaining   a lot  When I arrived they tried to make me feel guilty about getting what I paid for by saying they had to kick some other peope out  Imagine the audacity  The rooms are only adequate  When we finally got into our rooms the second room had big stains on the carpet and the first had a broken safe  The beds are stiff as a board  You can walk to the Forbidden City in about       minutes or take a short cab ride  The hotel will arrange for a car service to take you to the great wall  ask for Ba Da Ling  for about      RMB  I highly reccomend using a car service to go anywhere  Hotel in room massage often includes  quot extra services quot   use your imagination  and they quoted me     RMB for a massage  When the person arrives  the price might double or triple so hand them a pen before they start and tell them to write the price down  General advice for traveling in China    Bring all of your documents of proof of reservation   If you book through a third party  like a travel agent  and the third party gives you a confirmation number  don t assume the hotel will honor or recognize that confirmation number   Whenever I can  I ll ask someone local to call the hotel for me and confirm     If you want to arrange for a car to pick you up  highly reccomended  use VOIP to cheaply call the hotel and ask them to do it for you     Be prepared to haggle for almost everything  Above all  try to keep your cool and understand that this is just part of doing business in China  Usually  if you put up a big enough fuss  they will give you what you deserve  
N => Good Location Stayed ust     t       A     for   nights   wed thurs fri Booked directly through hotel website as they were cheaper than all other avenues   hotel websites  agents etc Location GreatFacilities GoodStaff  PoorFound staff to be below average  the porters very pushy  I wasnt even out of the cab before the guy was trying to get me to book a car with him to go to the wall  When I said it was to expensive and I would want to check around for prices  he said he knocks off at  pm  and if he hadnt heard from me he would come to my room  Then a few hours later another one started on at us Reception staff were clueless  I had communicated over email several times before my arrival saying that we fly out of Beijing at   pm on the  st so require the room only till  pm  so a half day rate applies  We were charged the full days rate but I didnt argue as they were kind enough to check us in at  am on the day of arrival  When we did check out at  pm they kept asking why we were leaving early  I handed over my frequent flyer card and the cashier said I couldnt use it as I had booked with an internet agent  I explained I booked direct with hotel  She took my number down but its yet to appear on my account    I know these things can take time so I will wait Room was in old wing and we knew we would be getting an old room for the price we paid  Wasnt expecting a filthy bathroom though  the orange mould in the bathroom and shower was pretty horrible and easily wiped away by myself with a towel so not sure why a housekeeper couldnt do it  I have stayed in some very basic accomm in my time  but would never have expected that at a otel The resturant wouldnt let us order off the menu at breakfast and insisted its buffet only and we need to order room service if we dont want buffet  We ordered continental for room service following day and several things were missing  However did order early dinner room service on day of departure and food was great  huge portions and fast service  
N => over rated hotel  two levels of accomodation which they don t tell you   We were a party of   adults and had two rooms     couple in one room and   singles in another  The couple got  upgraded  to a superior room whilst we   had a triple room in the West wing  Well  the west wing rooms left a lot to be desired  Our room in the west wing was in bad condition with peeling wall paper  well worn furniture and carpet which badly need to be replaced  The whole wing was in desperate need of refurbishment to bring it up to a   star standard  The bathroom was old yet clean though water pressure was poor  It was a big contrast our friends  the couple  who were upgraded to a  superior  room  Their room was what one would normally expect as a  standard room  in a   star hotel  definitely not of superior standard  It was what you would expect of a NOVOTEL hotel room  Whereas our triple room in the west wing left a lot to be desired  I m surprised NOVOTEL are not embarrassed at the condition of the rooms in this wing  it is not what you would expect of a NOVOTEL and am surprised at the lack of consistency as usually when you go to a NOVOTEL hotel you know what level of standards to expect 
N => Gotta be kidding Had a conference in Beijing on Friday and decided to stay the weekend there at the otel  At a corporate rate of RMB    or USD   including breakfast  all taxes and charges  I stayed at what was supposed to be a deluxe room on the   th floor  The room was  at best  equivalent to a three star hotel in the US  featuring quite worn carpet  a small television  an old couch and a hard but huge king size bed  The bathroom however left a lot to be desired   shower had little pressure and experienced an initial shortage of hot water  Breakfast on the other hand was quite good  especially when you stick to the western selection   fried eggs  bacon and salmon  Chinese pastries and fruit proved to be ok  not great I think Air France and Aeroflot put their crew up at this hotel so it gets a fair share of airline thoroughfare  AS WITH EVERY SINGLE HOTEL IN CHINA  BE PREPARED TO FOB OFF PIMPS WHEN YOU ENTER AND LEAVE THE PREMISE AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN  I did not think the location was that great  it is definitely close to the Wangfujing Pedestrian Mall but you have to walk the entire length of the Mall to get to the metro stop  AGAIN  BE PREPARED TO FOB OFF THE PIMPS A local taxi from the hotel to the airport will set you back USD    or USD   if you opt for a hotel car transfer  Pick the latter  it s worth it  Beijing taxis are a complete bloody disgrace  Overall  an okay experience

N => Very Firm Mattress ruined what would have otherwise been an OK stay Superior room in the third floor of Building B with a king sized bed  Room was of average size  not large but not so small that you couldn t move around  The room looked to have been recently renovated  It sported an LCD TV with a decent selection of English language channels  CNN  BBC  Discovery  HBO  Channel News Asia  etc   and a view of an inner  quot courtyard quot  filled with detritus from the buildings next door  In other words  there was no view at all  Room had some additional amenities  bottled water replenished daily  good set of toiletries  iron and ironing board  in room safe  but no slippers  bathrobe  or laundry bag  Not sure if laundry is even available   The in room safe was to small to fit my    inch laptop  Bathroom had a separate bath featuring both a hand and a rain shower  There was no bathtub  However  I could not get the rain shower and the hand held to work separately  Not so bad  actually  as the extra water spray was welcome Breakfast was average  Good  not great  ent selection with some variety from day to day  Location was good  Just outside a subway station on the  s   and   lines and two major shopping centers are a walk away One thing  however  ruined the entire stay for me  The very firm mattress   it had absolutely no bounce to it   made sleeping quite uncomfortable  I guess one can get used to a firm mattress but if you like your mattresses softer  as I do  the otel Xinqiao is the wrong hotel to stay in  And what good is a hotel and all its bells and whistles  really  if at the end of the day  you do not get a good night s sleep  
N => A very good hotel in a convenient location We had a lovely stay at the hotel  didn t have to wait for check in or check out and to our surprise they upgraded us to a superior room  The room was very clean and modern  You must remember it s only a four star hotel  so don t expect a       star decor  We have no complains whatsoever with the service or the staff   they were all very accommodating  The subway station is just outside the hotel making it very easy to get anywhere  We took train to almost everywhere  even including to badaling  great wall of china  All train rides only cost   yuan  There are many local restaurants and bakery near the hotel  
N => Disappointing Stay Prepaid and got a nice deal via Expedia with written request to have a room adjacent or near one female family member who was traveling alone   Upon arrival  the  check in  staff informed us that they had given us a  quot free upgrade quot   However  once in the room  we realized that the  quot free upgrade quot  had a tiny bathroom with no tub and not even an alarm clock in the room  Had the feeling  but couldn t prove it  that we were given lesser rooms than what we reservered  The bed was very uncomfortable  It felt like we were sleeping on boxsprings  We were also surprised to learn that we needed to place a         deposit on our credit card for the room in the event we used laundry services  etc  For us that was approximately      day  At the desk  we asked again if we could have a room adjacent or near the one family member who had traveled alone  We were denied that request and told we could not have that because we had been given a  quot free upgrade quot   I asked if there were rooms available near our room  She stated that the rooms were full but if we wanted to pay more we could get rooms near one another  Altogether  we required five rooms and each room was on a different floor  Concierge services were also not very cooperative  For example  we made prior arrangements to meet with a specific tailor in the city  We asked questions about how to get there at the desk  They said they couldn t tell us how to get there and they had a tailor in the hotel  Aside from shirts  the hotel tailor was significantly more expensive  We also thought we would be able to get tours transportation suggestions easily via concierge services  That was not the case at all  It was more difficult than we thought it should have been just to arrange to get a car van via the hotel  In hindsight it would have been more advantageous for us to have made all of our sightseeing tour plans with outside agencies prior to our arrival at the etel  I was very frustrated and disappointed with this hotel  I would not stay there again  
N => felt like a cruise on the exec floor We stayed here for several days in y     on the executive floor  We thoroughly enjoyed both the room  amenities  and the business lounge with its attentive English speaking concierges  afternoon snacks and drinks  and the included breakfast  both on the main floor and in the more intimate business lounge  Not only did they have many different kinds of fruits  baked goods  various beverages  cereals  Chinese and Western dishes  but in the executive one  some lovely smoked fish and aged cheeses too  It was a little longer than we anticipated to walk to the forbidden city  more of a short taxi ride  but the subway stop was just outside and was an intersection between   lines at the Chongwen station  so access to anywhere we wanted to go was very convenient  The only thing that was unpleasant was a urine smell on the main floor outside the elevators  which I suspect had to do with a flaw in ventilation since it never really went away  Not a problem anywhere you actually spent any time  The exec floor upgrade included use of the spa which didn t open til  pm  so we never got there  but the room showers were supplied by the hotsprings and showers were very comfortable  The exercise equipment in the health center was good  but the room was a little small  
N => Bearly correct Forget about what websites say about location  Nothing is  quot walkable distance quot   You can just take the subway  across the door  The noisy big avenue has plenty of taxis  but the otel porter sometimes gives a wrong direction to the driver  be careful We wondered what  quot superior quot  the room had  compared to a   standard    Classic otel furnitures in a normal size  I called the reception to check  but everything was OK  that was a  quot superior quot  room  Non smoking   As well  whatever if the bathroom ventilation was bringing smoke smelling  
N => Nice hotel I stayed there for   nights and it was really nice  The rooms  tha breakfast and the hotel overall was very nice  But I experienced also something bad  I got my makeup stolen from the room  it was impossible to find and buy the same in China  and I m sure that it was from the room service  I informed the reception but they didn t seem to be really concerned  
N => Nice location nice room but lack on details The hotel works well  typical otel  not much to say  What generated insatisfaction was the A C that did not work in the room  so was extremely hot inside  Also breakfast is expensive considering that you are in China and that variety is not impressive  e g  only one kind of cheese  cold chocolate drink not available   
N => Terrible service  We ve seen a lot of hotels in Beijing and we did not have the experience we ve expected from a novotel  world wide chain   The staff was terribly rude  no smile was spared  When we booked we stated that we wanted a non smoking room  They accepted the reservation but on arrival there where not any non smoking rooms available  When we complained house keeping came in our room and sprayed something in our room to remove the smell but that did not prevent smoke coming in from the other rooms  The staff at the reception refused to help us when we needed to look up some phone numbers  Also we were booking some airlinetickets by a website  we had problems fixing the payment and we needed to call the company to sort it out  At that time we where at the reception and asked if we could make the call there  The receptionist accepted but insisted that she would dial the number  after she dialed  she hung up and told us that the company was closed     BUT if we wanted airline tickets we could arrange it tommorowmorning at the touroffice in the hotel  We didn t trust her answer so we called ourselves in the room  It was no surprise when we got through to the company and where able to sort things out  Because we made a domestic flight the next morning  we asked at the reception wheter our one entry visa would cause problem s at the airport  The girl at reception first laughed at us  and then slightly irritated asked us why we would think such a thing  Spa and sauna have to be payed for although not stated on the bookingwebsite  Overall  a non pleasant experience  Do yourself a favor  spent    dollar s more on an other better hotel with better service  
N => Average   star Hotel Stayed at otel Xin Qiao in ember  Close to subway which was just outside hotel  Rooms smallish and dark but nice bathroom  Central heating only and not able to cool rooms so had to leave door open room till we went to bed at night as rooms very hot  There was a cool switch on the wall control but house keeping said this did not work  Our room in B tower faced into lobby and coffee shop so was a bit noisy  There was a nice LCD TV  Breakfast ok but not able to get ggod coffee  No smoking in hotel apart from toilets Two bottlles of mineral water given daily  Can walk to Tianamen Square  about       minutes depending on how brave you are crossing the street Free WiFi internet in lobby  Apple Macs  and coffee shop  Otherwise about   yuan hour or    yuan day in room Taxi about    yuan flagfall   concierge stands outside hotel and flags down one for you Starbucks  KFC and Pizza Hut about   mins walk away  Also very busy  crowded supermarket Average hotel but would stay again because of    good location    free internet and    breakfast  which was much better than most of the other hotels we stayed in China  
N => Great hotel in Beijing Stayed at the hotel for four nights  Booked a Superior room  one up from their Standard room  The room we got was in A tower and it was nice  clean  non smoking and BIG  I was pleasently suprised  because some of the reviews on this site made me think that the hotel was going to be bad  but it turned out to be excellent We did not eat at the hotel as there were a lot of pastry shops around the hotel  There was a McDonald s nearby        minute walk  Several shopping centres were really close to this hotel The entrance to subway was right in front of the hotel  so we took the subway everywhere  It cost only   yuan per person to go anywhere in the city We were able to go the the Olympic Stadium  Forbidden City  Wungfujing St  and many other places in the city by just using the subway  Highly recommended You can exchange money at the hotel  as money change places are not that frequent around town  and the rate they give you at the hotel is pretty good  Cab ride from the airport to hotel cost us    yuan  while the ride back to the airport was     yuan  The ride takes a little bit more than    minutes  but that will depend on the time of day and traffic conditions The hotel exceeded my expectations and was much better than described in reviews below  The concierge at the hotel speak English and will recommend where to go for supper or shopping  Other staff is not well trained in English  so be patient Go to the Silk ket for some cheap goods  purses  shirts  watches  but keep in mind that this stuff is fake  Never buy at the first stall you check out an item as you will find tens of stalls selling the same stuff  They always initially offer you poor quality items  ie  purse  so make sure to ask for a good quality knock off  The good quality one s look like the real thing  The Pearl ket is another place that sells knock off stuff  Worth checking out if you are in a shopping mood Try and get a chinese massage while you are here  Look for a cheaper  but clean  place  You ll find them  but not close to the hotel  
N => otel Xin Qiao Beijing Good location  average Hotel  while we did not have any problems because we hired a local guide  the lack of staff who understood even basic english caused real problems for many at reception  In A tower  the room was ok  beakfast was ok but they keep running out of items  If in Beijing again will look for another place to stay  
N => Warm room Stayed in this hotel for three nights in ruary      The location is not bad  about    minutes walk to the Tianmen square  My economy room without a window was clean and decent enough  The problem was that the room was very warm  A couple of friends stayed in a separate room  They had to call for plumber service I expected this hotel to be better  
N => too busyand not enough service We stayed   this hotel   nights Location is central Caters to tour groups check in was dismal  Could not understand with so much cheap labour they could not have a seperate check in and check out lines as the wait was    minutes Staff were too busy to be helpful as there were lot of residents once again not well trained staff most of them standing around rooms were clean and bed comfortable After hongkong otel Citygate was severely disappointed by service good buffet breakfast  
N => Good location    but lacked atmosphere Stayed here for five days on tour  prior to the Olympics  everything was a buzz with the preparations so probably saw a different Beijing   Hotel is ideally situtated for visiting Tianamen Square and Forbidden City as both within      mins walk  We ventured further on foot and within one hour reached Jingshan  amp  Beihai Parks Free internet access is available in the lobby with two PCs  just wait your turn  Several restaurants to suit most palates  Cuisine Gallery  French  was great however lacked a bit of atmosphere as empty other than one other table  Food excellent though and could not be faulted  fish dishes superb  Coffee Bar was good for quick snacks or buffet and excellent breakfast  The Bar was relaxing but somehow missed out on atmosphere  Complimentary water on first night only however small shop next to hotel selling bottled mineral water very cheaply  Rooms were of a good standard although perhaps a little small  Would definitely return to this hotel  
N => Convenient location good price clean and comfortable An excellent location to stay in Beijing close to the subway and very easily accessible  As in other places in China  it is good to carry the hotel name and address in Chinese   otel Xinqiao  Beijing             Ask for the hotel card in Chinese once you reach there  Very clean and comfortable like other otels in the world  Room has a nice shower  beds  crib provided on request  coffee tea maker and decent food menu Forbidden city  Tiananmen square  Temple of Heaven are all a short taxi ride        Yuan  We got a taxi ride to the Mutianyu Great Wall and back with a decent English speaking taxi driver for     Yuan  The hotel was charging     yuan and you need to book a day in advance  We were prepared to take the bus  but we had an infant and hence decided against it  Negotiating hard and refusing to budge seemed to give us a good deal   but you never know  may be we overpaid  The cable car at Mutianyu takes you up in a few minutes  good views and a total   hour visit including travel We travelled with a   year old infant boy  Travelling with the baby stroller was the wisest thing we did  Even though getting it into the taxis required extra effort and something that the Chinese were not used to  it was a boon as you need to walk a lot within most tourist sites  Most places are wheelchair friendly  else people were ready to help in lifting the baby buggy when required  We didnt take the stroller to the Great Wall and that was wise as there are some steep steps  even if you take the cable car or chair lift  
N => Service was terrible  This Hotel has good facilities  althought he staff were as rude as you would get  English was a non event and the staff at reception had no idea of service  places of interest  tours and just did not want to help I would never reccomend this Hotel to anyone  They state they are close to most attractions but really you need to take a taxi  There are pleanty of Hotels near by and I would suggest one of these If you want freindly staff and service you would exspect from a   star hotel  DO NOT STAY HERE  
N => Better than expected We stayed here for   nights over Chinese New Year  Front desk staff speak fair English  compared to other friends  experiences in China   Rooms are a comfortable size  clean bathroom  air con seems to work well  Concierge advised shopping malls open on Chinese New Year s Eve  but were actually closed   also advised massage facilities were open and no booking was required  when the massage place was closed for over a week for the holidays   post office was closed over Chinese holidays which made it difficult to send parcels home  Japanese restaurant service was a bit stroppy on New Years Eve  staff didn t want to serve us at     pm and requested that we finish by     pm   Buffet breakfast was a highlight  good range of western   Chinese   Overall  the building and rooms were a pleaure but service is still a but on the average side  
N => Nice place Dates of stay       Room Type  Double roomNon smoking room   yesRoom number  A    Room price     euros nightBreakfast  noLocation  great  oposite to subwayTransport  taxi from airport   min   eurosRoom size  big enoughBathroom  bathtub clean soft towels with hairdryerBed  hard but comfortable king size Other Amenities  tennis court WIFI  free in the lobbyWe recommend it 
N => Save your money and stay at the Chong Wen Men across the street The hotel is in a pretty good location  I ve stayed there before  but I won t stay there again Apparently when I booked on line this last time  they tried to charge my credit card to make sure it was valid  and the amount they tried to charge was an exorbatent amount  My credit card company automatically saw that something wasn t right   I live in China and charge things often but not as much as the hotel was trying to charge   This was all without me knowing about it  The day before I go to Beijing  I received an email from the reservations department telling me that I had better give them my credit card number or they would change my room rate or give my room away to someone else  And they were serious  Two thoughts      there s no way I m giving my credit card number to someone named  quot lily quot  at the reservations department over email in China      What the lady didn t understand is that their hotel continued to try to charge my credit card over and over and over so much so that the credit card company wouldn t let them do anything  I think their actions could be intentional in order to resubmit your credit card number and allow the possibility for others seeing it  There are all sorts of scams in China  and this is one kind  Morons  Then they threaten me by telling me they won t hold my room  Please  It s not like there aren t other hotels in Beijing I speak pretty decent Chinese  Their English is awful My recommendation is that your stay at the Chong Wen Men directly across the street for about half the price  Yes  it s a Chinese hotel  but it s just as nice as the otel Xin Qiao and at least the staff are nice  
N => It was fine no problems My husband and I stayed at the otel Xin Qiao ober        A friend traveling with us stayed in a separate room  At check in we were offered the opportunity to upgrade to a suite in the A building for    RMB more per night  We declined and they told us they didn t have our economy rooms available so they had to upgrade us to a suite in the B wing  Good news The suite was not fancy  but more than adequate  The living room had a sofa and chairs  with some staining   a desk  tv  The bedroom was large and clean  The bed was hard  but that seemed to be the norm in China  The bathroom was on the small side  but again  that seems to be common in China and it was clean  We had an issue with our toilet one night and spoke with someone in English and it was resolved quickly  We didn t wait more than    minutes to check in or out  but there weren t long lines  I can see how it could take a really long time if there was a line  The hotel was about a    minute walk to Tian an Men Square  It s about a       minute walk from the Pearl ket  It s easy to have the concierge write down your destination for a taxi if you don t want to walk If we go back to Beijing  I would probably stay there again  
N => Pass on this hotel We were quite disappointed with our stay at the otel Xinqiao Beijing over the weekend of               If you are looking for ahotel with American standards skip this one  The rooms were very small and rather dirty  The bathroom was tiny   the smallest I have seen at a hotel and I have seen a lot  The hall ways were loud and you could hear a lot of noise through the windows that faced the open atrium  The room lighting was quite dim  probablyto hide the dirt  as was the bathroom lighting  We had a long wait atcheck in as well as at check out   close to an hour each time  The temperature controls didn t work in either of our rooms  One of the features from the website that attracted us to the hotel was that it was within walking distance to a number of key attractions  That was far from the truth   you need to take a taxi to the Forbidden City and Temple of Heaven  Not a problem since it was only    rmb each way  but not within walking distance  The one positive was that the hotel breakfast buffet was quite good  
N => Worst Hotel I came back from Beijing yesterday and spent    days at this hotel and it was the worst experience  I was with   other friends  The problems started when we arrived  They stated that they did not have our my reservation but had my other friend s reservation  After showing them the confirmation I had printed after booking  they were able to find it  We were first given rooms in the B building  The rooms there were dark  the tiles in the bathroom were cracked  we found hair in the bathtub  the carpet was dirty  the bed was hard and uncomfortable  there was no closet to put our clothes so we had to leave them in our suitcase  The toilet was dirty  The couple in the room next to ours were beaten by bed bugs and checked out of the hotel  Staff didn t seem to care much about that  We were going to change hotels when we learned that for        more  there was an A building with better rooms  This was never offered to us and we were not even aware of it  It seems like Chinese were given rooms in the A building while foreigners had to settle for the dirty B building  We complained and requested to be switched to the A building  We changed rooms and it was much better  The rooms were quite spacious with lots of sunlight  clean and more comfortable  There was a closet for our clothes  What bothered me about this hotel however were a few things   the staff did not speak much English and was not helpful at all  Whenever we would ask them basic questions  they did not even understand us   Do NOT GO TO THE SPA  We decided to get massages  We paid for    minute massages  After    minutes  the therapist told us it was over  Not only that  I was placed in a room with a friend  The two therapists arrived and asked us take our clothes off while they stood watching us  We gestured that they should leave since they did not speak English  They massaged us over our robes with no lotion or oil  They had the lights on and were talking to one another during the massages until I asked them to dim the lights  One of the therapist s phone rang and she stopped massaging my friend and went outside  leaving the door open and we could hear her talk and the noise from the hallway  Not relaxing at all after a long day of walking at the Great Wall  My sister and another friend were getting massages in a different room by   men  One of the men therapists told my friend   times while massaging her how beautiful she was  This made her very uncomfortable  At the end of the massages  they tried to overcharge them by stating that they requested   hour massages instead of   minutes  They never did such a thing    Except for the bell men  the rest of the staff was not very friendly and helpful  Even at the breakfast buffet  the waiters and waitresses were not nice and pleasant  One night we decided to go to the Gallery Bar  which is the bar at the hotel  I ordered a  pina collada  and it was disgusting  I then returned it and ordered a  white russian  and it was even worst  If you go to the bar  order basic drinks like wine and soda Overall I hated staying at the otel Xian Qiao Beijing  If I go back to Beijing  I will NEVER EVER stay there again  
N => Not up to otel Standards Needs new Manager    We stayed at the otel Xin Qiao for   nights in tember  The room was adequate  however  there were a few troublesome details that marred our experience The premium facilities in biz floors  while nice and clean  were staffed in a mediocre manner by apparently overworked staff  This was best exemplified on a certain evening when we arrived at the business floor lounge for drinks and nobody approached us to offer any service  while the hotel manager was sitting on the adjacent table being waited on by the staff  All the while we were ignored and instructed to help ourselves to the canap s and drinks available  The attitude of the manager towards this behavior was exemplary of the service at the hotel The buffet breakfast in the ground floor was adequate enough  although one could notice how hurried and overworked the staff were  one did not quite feel like a welcome guest  rather more like a nuisance The staff was also rather unhelpful when trying to book a tour to the great wall  the quotes for the taxi were over priced the concierge also insisted on us booking an over priced cab  to the extent that he went up to our room to ask if we were booking the cab    minutes after we had left the concierge desk hmmmm I wonder if he was getting a chunk of that rate   the organized tour was more of a shopping experience than a cultural one  they were also very unhelpful in pointing out alternative options  
N => B better than A I was there in il         stars hotel just near the Subway  Close to the city center  the center is easily reachable with a short walking  In il expensive room     in building A was NOT comfortable  cold  the window opens on a ugly backcourt  if you open the window bad smells come in from the kitchens  I also stayed a night in a room in cheaper building B  better price  less space but more comfort than room      Safety boxes in rooms are not fixed to the wall  theoretically everybody getting inside the room can steel them away  
N => Doom and gloom  We were booked at this hotel for   nights at the end of an    day holiday in China  The hotel rooms are in two different parts  A and B  with the rooms in part A being much newer and brighter Our first room was in part B and was an  internal  room with no natural light  The corridors to this room were dark and gloomy  We changed to a room with a window but this room s bathroom was not nice   dirty grouting and a cracked toilet seat  One hour after arriving we checked into a room on the executive floor that cost us     extra  This was on the   th floor and had its own breakfast area and unlimited broadband connection  We could have upgraded to a superior room at half this price in the same area but breakfast was was all the other guests and a fellow traveller said it was awful   no choice and cold food The only good thing about this hotel is that it is in walking distance to some of the main attractions such as the Forbidden City but it is on a very busy main road and you can hear the policeman blowing his whistle from  a m as he tries to direct the very busy traffic I wouldn t want to stay there again as the overall standard was nowhere near as good as our other   star hotels in Shanghai and Xian  
N => Very Nice Hotel Booked by our tour company  Our first stay in China   we were delighted to stay in a Western style hotel  one of the few king beds we had in China  comfortable mattresses  excellent in room amenities  decent buffet breakfast  both Western and Asian   Impossible to dry clothes using the over the tub clothesline as it is too damp in the bathroom   hang wet clothes on hangers in the closet or around the room  Metro station is right outside the hotel  as are plenty of cheap taxis  and walk to shopping  grocery stores  bank  next door   and food  all types   Kids room across the hall looked directly at the tennis court  which afforded NO privacy if someone was on the court  Good soundproofing  Long waits for elevator in the morning  Only negative was that our arrival flight was postponed   day  by airline   first night s stay was to be payed by us  Non refundable  but they let us use the   value of the night s stay in other hotel expenses  which was a little difficult  since our breakfast was already included  and we wanted to eat meals out in the city   
N => The worst service ever otel Xin qiao took      dollars from my credit card  quot by mistake quot  I left my card for the fee that I had to pay when I checked in  but they must have saved my card number  cause the next day  another      was withdrawn without me knowing  When I found out about it  by checking my bank account via Internet   I confronted the staff who called me white trash       and other stupid things   quot If      dollar is that much money for you  maybe you should stay at a hostel the next time quot  was what they said to me when I wanted my money back   quot It s not our problem quot   I was lucky  my bank believed me when I called home and said it was a mistake  and I got my money back a couple of days later  They made my vacation a nightmare  I had no money and they treated me like I wasn t worth anything  I will never live there again  
N => It may be Beijing but it could be a otel anywhere  This hotel was booked by my travel agent so I don t know the exact price  I was able to check in early  which was very welcome after an overnight train journey from Beijing  The location is good and the hotel was comfortable with helpful staff  It seemed to be an  quot identikit quot  otel room  similar to ones I have stayed in in Europe and doutbless similar to the one five minutes walk from my office  If you like your western style comforts this hotel fits the bill My only minor gripe was waiting an eternity for the lifts  
N => Happy with the otel We were happy with the Xin Qiao otel  The rooms themselves were very clean  as was the bathroom  one of the downlights was falling out  but we hardly noticed it   The room was a pretty good size  our main gripe was that we ended up with a twin room instead of double   but the  single  beds were really somewhere between a single and double  We were asked to shut our curtains once it got dark every night   which I thought was a little wierd and somewhat disappointing as we had a pretty good view of the streets below from our window The breakfast was pretty good  with a good variety of food to choose from  The fitness centre was OK but nothing special  The toilets in the lobby were immaculate   probably the best I saw anywhere in China although thats not saying much  The location of this hotel was also excellent  being a       minute walk from Tian men Square and Wangfudjin St  and with a metro stationright out front I would consider staying here again if I ever return to Beijing  
N => novotel in name but not in quality The hotel location is great  Was an easy walk to tianamen square and forbidden city  Plenty of cheap places to eat near the hotel  and they have a great bread shop at the corner The room was rather worn out  The bed was comfortable   not hard or too soft  Shower was functional but rather dated The main complaint I have of the hotel was the aircon didn t heat the room at all  It was   deg at night and the room was always on the chilly side  I had to always wear my jacket in the room  
N => Not what you would expect from otel    This particular otel is not up to otel s usual standard  The whole ethos of this hotel was clearly about the needs and requirements of the hotel   meeting the needs of the customer definitely came second The hotel room was pleasant but the bathroom was cramped and potentially hazardous  
N => good value but far from perfect Stayed here in mid ember with my husband  On the plus side  the hotel is in a convenient location  right next to the subway station  walking distance to Tian anmen Square  etc   The room was fine  nothing special   the room service pretty good and the hotel food in general not bad For me the main negative was that everywhere was smokey   par for the course in Beijing  I m afraid   but I found the hotel lobby  corridors and dining room  including the small  no smoking  section  often very unpleasant In summary  this hotel really does show you get what you pay for  If you re not too fussy  and trying to stay somewhere convenient on a budget  it does the trick  If you re looking for a perfect hotel  look elsewhere A final word of warning   we wanted to extend our stay in Beijing by a few days and asked at reception if we could stay on in our room  The new rate they tried to charge us on reception was significantly higher than that which we had been paying  so we went back up to our room and used the internet to book again through the hotel s website for a fraction of the quoted cost  
N => ok but smelly Room was large and comfortable but smelt A LOT of cigarettes  They don t have non smoking rooms  Breakfast wasn t inclued in the price but the bakery across the road sold some excellent food options  opens at  am   
N => even if it was free      Stayed for   nights in ember over Christmas  Worst service ever experienced  and I have travelled a lot  Breakfast gave us food poisoning  We asked for non smoking section of coffee shop  where breakfast was served  and was laughed at by floor manager  Wait staff were rude  unhelpful and indifferent  BUT dinner time was like a different hotel  Wait staff were excellent  Weird Room had to be changed as booked for non smoking and got a room that was so smoked out it was uninhabitable  New room was better  but not by much  Mattress was wood  No joke  Fell onto mattress after long flight and gave myself whiplash Reception staff were indifferent and off hand  Messed up receipts and charges   times  Housekeeping was so bad  Rang for a hairdryer   times and finally got it after   hours  Same goes for an extra pillow  They cleaned our room and threw away my expensive toothpaste that I need  Replaced with a little hotel Chinese brand tube  They had no English ability to understand this was a problem and then the housekeeping manager who did speak enough English couldn t have cared less Just a really bad hotel that otel should know better than to put its name to  Chuck it now Even if it was free  I wouldn t stay again  
N => great hotel Excellent location  okay restaurants  free internet  Room was clean  staff was very helpful but their english is rather bad  Hint  Go to the  quot Silk market quot      min  by taxi  for cheap clothes  souvenirs  replica watches and so on    
N => ok but I stayed in the Hotel with my   kids and my wife during a week holiday in Beijing  We had two rooms and the rooms where ok  the location of the hotel was very easy wrt the subway and several markets  However since we have stayed in other hotels in Beijing we where suprised over the high price for the coffee shop  the foot massage  the exchange rate  We will not use the hotel again for our next trip to china not that we have lots of complains but we are used to better prices and better service from other hotels  
N => Nice hotel at a reasonable price I was a little concerned about this hotel due to some negative reviews  but I was overall very pleased with my stay  I got a deluxe business suite for myself  my husband and my    year old son  The room was large and comfortable and my son enjoyed having his own space in a adjoining room  Room service was fast and reasonably priced  The included breakfast buffet was nice  The coffee was great  The hotel staff spoke English pretty well   it varied  The service was not real friendly compared to four star hotels in the US  but for China the staff was pleasant  
N => a bad hotel We  my    year old son and myself  stayed for   days in otel Xin Qiao hotel in e       I booked the hotel partially based on the good reviews from tripadvisor com  it was ranked as one of the top ones at my booking time based on reviews   I was greatly disappointed by the hotel  It is easiely among one of the worst places I stayed    the bathroom was small and dark  The shampoo soap container on the wall was half falling off  No one tried to fixed it during our stay    the towel and bedding in the room were VERY old    the carpet in my room was taped together using   pieces with different color and texture    the room was not serviced on time  sometime not until late afternoon    I forgot to bring my shaver  I asked the front desk for a shaving kits and was told that they did not have one I would certainly never go back to this hotel  
N => A good deal but lacking in service The hotel is centrally located and very convenient for busy tourists  The rooms are quite large and relatively clean  However  the mattress was very hard  a common problem throughout China  i ve since discovered    The staff tried to be friendly  but the language barrier was practically insurmountable  thank goodness for our translator guide   We had asked for a non smoking room  but our room reeked of smoke  We ran the AC at full tilt during our stay to try to get rid of the smell  The elevators are just insufficient for the number of rooms  we often waited in long lines to get up down to our room  The cafe s breakfast was quite generous  included with the room price   with good bread eggs fruit  
N => Terrible Hotel This is a really lousy hotel  I booked a king deluxe room but was given a rather unsatisfactory twin  It was in the A wing but was not what I d class as   star  The bed was extremely uncomfortable  you could feel the springs digging into you  and the facilities were quite threadbare The worst aspect about this hotel is the level of service  Every member of staff I came across was totally uninterested in helping me  That is if they could speak any English at all  Having stayed in   and   star hotels across Asia this was probably my worst ever experience  
N => Has the potential to be a good hotel but work needed to bring to    level     
N => good hotel but beware of extra charges  
N => Biz Floor was fantastic  
N => otel not up to par   
N => Would recommend to anyone  
N => Top in citt   Ottimo rapporto qualit  prezzo     
N => If you are looking for hotel quality service stay away  I booked Oakwood through Expedia due to the description  and thought it was going to be not much different from other hotels  Well  the rooms are large but the front desk service is poor  It took me more than an hour just to check in  If you are a foreigner  they register your passport with the local police  and the process takes   hours  It was a unpleasant surprise  
N => Comfortable rooms great view of city Comfortable rooms and beautiful hotel  However  not up to   star service  The reception staff were completely unaware of restaurant services and opening hours  including the evening duty manager  Room service brought us one set of cutlery for   meals and by the time the second set arrived the food was cold  All staff do not have a good grasp of english  We could not book dinner in any of the restaurants and had to eat out on   nights  The reception stafff are unhelpful with simple requests  Breakfast was fine but not up to the standard of a   star hotel  Still nice to stay here though  
N => Comfortable well appointed  Good food selection  Rooms and beds were very spacious  Concierge service was useful for booking taxis etc  Not much of a view from our room   we looked out onto a bank s offices but the noise levels were fine Good choice of both Chinese and Western food for breakfast but did not experience any other meals as we ate elsewhere due to arranged tours  
N => Looks nice from the outside and lobby rooms are so so hotel looks great from the outside Location is reasonable The first room I got had a leakage in the ceiling with water drops over the sink  brushed my teeth when drops of water fall straight on my head Toilets were smelly Had to change rooms AC didn t work   so had to sleep with an open window until it was too noisy concierge service was great Breakfast was horrible   not fresh  especially the bread and pastries Although the price was low  I will not come back   there are so many other options near by  
N => A very nice Hotel This was the second hotel we stayed at on our China tour  The hotel is located on the  rd ring road of beijing i believe  its right next to a metro station so its easy to hop into Beijing central The hotel itself was very clean  as was the room and the bathroom  we had no issues through our stay Nice breakfast but not as nice as our first hotel JC mandarin in shanghai  but you made most of the choices of food  western foods  oriental foods  healthy options  The tea was wrong  it was wrong all over china  just couldnt get a decent cup anywhere we stayed three nights at this hotel and it was a pleasant stay the bar in the lobby is quite nice  as is the    hour restaurant  which serves western and local food The swimming pool was under repair for the period of our stay which was dissapointing as it was sparkling swimming pool view from the hotel wasnt all that as we were facing the ring road  but we didnt go there to peep through hotel window summary  nice and clean hotel  rooms feel fresh and new  superb location    mins to central Beijing on the metro which is on your door step  
N => Great     star hotel The Oriental Bay Intl  Hotel was a very nice large hotel  A great place to start our trip in China  The decor was nice  The rooms were nicely sized  The hotel s ammenities were excellent  Be sure to check out the workout room  amp  pool    even if just to take a look Breakfast buffet was also superb  Plenty to choose from in both Western  amp  Asian food Everything seemed brand new except the hall room carpets were a little worn or stained in places  but other than that  everything was top notch  
N => Dont if its warm weather  All was what I would have expected given the low price except the TV reception was vey poor but most importantly there was no a c  Having asked the staff numerous times I was told every time they would have someone check the a c  Being my inquisitive self I discovered the had it entirely turned off to save money  I woke wih little sleep this morning to a sweaty hot and    degree room and right now   pm  its     Staff have advised to  quot open a window quot    in noisy polluted Beijing right  Besides  its made no difference  We are moving out tomorrow  
N => Poor Air Condioning in il We stayed in this hotel for four nights in il       Weather in this month in Beijing changes from mild to hot  The hotel administration did not turn on the centralized air conditioning though it was much needed for comfortable sleep in the night  Later on I heard it is typical of many other local hotels in China  On this account the visitors are cautioned to check whether they provide air conditioning  Apart from this there was construction taking place in the next building it also caused noise at night  Other than this hotel was neat and clean and relatively newer interior  The price was also reasonable  
N => Clumsy staff and poor maintenance On the surface a beautiful and nicely located hotel  but unfortunately we ran into a few problems there  The toilet in the room we were given was clogged  The staff called a plummer who quickly arrived on the scene with a plunger  He did not fix the problem  but apparently told the staff that he had  We had to complain a second and a third time before we finally got to speak with the assistant manager  She said we could switch to another room on the afternoon of the next day    am the next morning she called to reconfirm our agreement  that yes  we would switch rooms that afternoon  An hour later she called again and asked us to switch rooms immediately  She generously gave us   minutes to pack and get ready to move  The rest of the stay went by without trouble  but there still was a few things we were not happy about   The new room had a non smoking designation  but smelled of cigarettes     Old condom wrappers lay behind the bed side tables of both rooms    One of the two main elevators smelled like a public restroom  Standing close to the entrance you could even smell it as it came down the shaft towards you     The staff s English skills are limited to simple hotel related matters  They behave more like robots with preprogrammed responses than actual human beings  but this is normal in China  The Chinese try hard and they build beautiful things  but they fall short on maintenance  cleanliness and what I like to call common sense  Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel is a good example of this  but it is also a part of what makes China such a fascinating destination  
N => They need to learn what the word  service  means I have just checked in to this hotel and had a horrible experience at check in  The people said they gave our room away because we were one hour late in arriving to the hotel  due to a flight delay   Moreover  they were extremely rude and not accomodating  Instead of upgrading us to a better room  they have put us in a cheaper room with no window  They screamed at us and would answer the questions of the Chinese before dealing with our issues  The staff is rude and racist  A terrible first impression and if I were you  I would pay the additional few dollars to stay in a better hotel  
N => Perfect for Families but a bit far from downtown We joined my husband on a business trip to Beijing and Shanghai  Wanted something bigger than a hotel since we have   young boys  We got a   bedroom   a den and it was great  The rooms were huge with   full baths and washer dryer  They were clean and there was a pool a short walk away  They had buffet breakfast each morning and we usually found some decent things to eat  Cereal  toast  fruit in addition to the  quot Chinese quot  breakfast items  The staff was very nice and was as helpful as possible  Just keep in mind they are not conceirges  The only complaint was that it was far from downtown and very few restaurants close by especially for an American family  
N => The rooms look nice but they were musty and smoky We booked this hotel thru the assoc rate from a Chinese hotel  We were not aware that they had lower rates for Chinese guest and checked in upon arrival  Once we left our room we were confronted by several managers who told us that were could only stay if we agreed to a higher rate  I told them we were going to keep the rate that we checked in under because I had no desire to pay  xs the rate of our reservation  They eventually sort of apologized but still insisted they were going to raise the rate because the computer made a mistake  I explained that the reservation was a contract and they accepted it once we checked in then we left to get dinner  when we got back to our room it was apparent that someone had been there and when I called downstaris I was told that the only thing that was to be discussed was changing the rate and we could do it at that moment or in the morning but either way the rate would be raised  We only checked into that hotel so that we could cookin the kitchen from the markets and do our laundry since were suppose to stay in Beijing for    days  We also asked for a non smoking room which we didn t get  We decided to have them comp the night and arrange for transportation to another hotel in the morning  I did the laundry we had that night and my husband and I both woke up extremely stuffy nosed and congested from the dust and smoke  It was definately the low light of our month long stay in China  There is nothing interesting in the area except for the restaurant across the street and you have to take a cab to the subway  The area is quite depressing in the evening We checked into the Beijing Renaissance the next morning and they had a drop off laundry around the corner for our future use  Checking out was the best experience we had at this hotel  Good Riddance 
N => Good stay but not exactly what I expected My family  husband  mom  two twenty something year old nephews and I  stayed here for four nights in ember  I was very disappointed in the fact that this was listed as a  BR  BA apt  when in reality it was only a  BR  BA  As another poster stated  the third room is actually a study  If the sofa in the room had been a sofa bed  than listing the room as a bedroom would have been okay  but that was not the case  The sofa was not even big enough for someone to sleep on  When I called Guest Services they initially told me I would be charged for a rollaway bed if one was available  My husband and I walked back to registration to complain and were told the first bed was free but there would be a charge  I think    USD per day  for another rollaway  One of my nephews was forced to sleep on the sofa in the living room  The rest of the apt  was pretty luxurious  The master bedroom was enormous and the second bedroom was also nice and had a bathroom in the bedroom  The kitchen was fully equipped and there was a full sized washer and dryer in the unit We never found the supermarket across the street and did not think that many other restaurants and stores were within walking distance  It is not that easy for taxis to find the riott so we got dropped off at the front gate and walked back  Luckily I had hired a car and driver for the time we were there so we did not take taxis that much Compared to other hotel breakfasts the riott was so so  The number of hot items was limited  Other Chinese hotels have had a much bigger spread and a variety of dim sum  
N => great place this was first rate  The problem with cab drivers not knowing where it was was never a problem  we always carried card with address   It was relatively close to the airport  Our only real complaint was that the staff was not all that knowledgeable about museums  etc  
N => Disappointing Stay The room was pretty  but unfortunately that was the only positive part of our experience  All   whirlpools have been broken for over a month  Dining staff and concierges were rude  Service would have been disappointing at a budget hotel  but at a Park Hyatt it was ridiculous Stay someplace else  
N => Terrible Terrible Terrible Hotel    I stay there from tember    to ober         for   th Anniversary of PRC We purchased our hotel nights via Park Hyatt Official website  Their website was advertising  quot City Gateway quot  which included a bottle of red wine  mooncake and CNY    Spa coupon  However  after few days of staying when we asked about this offer  Park Hyatt staffs were saying that they never had such a promotion Later  they came back saying it was their aggressive promotion from their marketing team and their internet system has some problem Due to this confusion on their end  our feeling for staying their place was completely ruined If you want peace of mind  it is not worth to deal with their inexperienced hotel staffs Horrible experience   PARK HYATT should know how terribly this place is running    
N => Terrible experience at Xiu Whilst the hotel itself seems ok  the service and management of Xiu is definitievely not  even though managed by Park Hyatt  Together with   business partners we wanted to have dinner at China Grill  It was fully booked  Fair enough as we did not have any reservation  We wanted to make a reservation for the following day but wanted to see the restaurant first  That was refused by the hostess who mentioned that there is no show arrounds during dinner service     The gentle British Restaurant Manager corrected that and let us have a look  so we booked a table for the following day Thereafter we went down to Xiu and were waiting on a cocktail table to get one of these marvelous terrace tables when a huge fight broke out between clearly intoxicated locals and   or nine women  Apparently one of the guys pushed a pregnant woman so a huge quarrel began and security rushed to the scene and we hoped  they would remove the drunken and loud incubents  We got a table in the meantime but the quarrel was far from over and security did nothing but standing around as they were clearly afraid to interfere  The trouble makers were shouting and yelling  so police arrived    man only  He disappeared    minutes later and the discussions as well as requests from the women group continued to get these guys removed  These guys looked dangerous  the ringleader having bandaged both hands from previous fights already  was clearly a sign that they would insist on their right to continue drinking  So   the manager decided to sit down with them  have a drink and a smoke to get them cool down  But after an hour  still no action  the manager sitting with the trouble makers  smoking  drinking and yelling guys around us  In the meantime  all tables around them were emptied except ours as we were in the middle of the dinner To our surprise  the waiter came to our table asking us to pay the bill and leave  In the middle of the dinner       The reason he gave  that security wanted to empty the restaurant first to remove these guys by force      At the entrance were over    people queuing for a table and around    security guards standing by  How could you get these guys removed I went to a Western person  who seemed to be the superiour of the Restaurant manager as he was still sitting with the trouble makers  I asked him  why we were refused being served but the real trouble makers were not even asked to leave or pay  No answer and refusal to give his name or position was his only reaction So we insisted of service continuation and got finally  another drink  Then we decided to leave and never come back In brief  Extremely rude service  a management clearly not able to handle such a situation and the senior management hidding behind the backs of the security guards  All existing customers were asked to leave instead of getting trouble makers instantly removed once the brawl broke out Well done  Park Hyatt team  You showed me on this evening that you did not train your employees properly in crisis response but chose to anger      people rather than doing the right thing Arrogance seems to be a common practice at Park Hyatt due of the daily crowds at Xiu  I kindly invite you to have a look on best service practices at your neighbour China World or at your big brother Grand Hyatt  The manamagement team there  seems to have better ways to service customers and it s ranking far above your hotel at Tripadvisor reflects the real situation  apparently  
N => Watch the world stream by This hotel is brand spanking new     weeks old LocationOn the top    floors in the Yintai building opposite Guo Mao with lines    and   at your doorstep to bypass the rush hour jams  Taxi drivers have no clue whaere this place is so just tell them  quot Jianwai SOHO quot   The entrance faces SOHO Public spacesBlack  very avantgarde  Still a few loose ends to tie up  I walked out of the lift towards a stunning view of Changan Jie just to step straight into the little waterpool that lines the barriers  The lights were not on so it was impossible to see the water otherwise really stunning and spacious  The Bar is expensive   HK prices  but not that exhorbitant A pain to have to change lifts   the first from      then change to the local lift to get to your room       floorsRoomStunning  Not the type that you would like if you re a traditionalist  A little fussy and too many little drawers and holes with things in them  Very Sino japanese  Integrated living space with shower and limestone bath  HUGE  looking onto the a beautiful view of the  rd ring road  The other side of our room looked onto Chang An Jie There are heated floors and heated toilet seats  excellent water pressure  good ventilation and no noise whatsoever Everything was spotless and everything worked as advertised  Comfortable beds and plentiful towels and supplies  Nice smelling toiletries  Nespresso machine  Pu Er tea and Long Jing  Fruits  Get it  lots of really nice touches Try the toilet  Space age contraption that lifts the cover automatically and flushes automatically ServiceStill needs a bit of work   the personnel try hard to be helpful but obviously do not have experience  One of my friends said she was given a sneer when she asked the street level concierge to call a taxi for her  until he realised she was a guest at the hotel OverallOne of the newest  coolest and serene places to stay in beijing   at a price  Let s hope it continues to improve  
N => Great Hotel Only good things to say about this hotel  The place seems to run like clock work  nothing from check in to check out could be faulted  All staff from reception to doormen were all pleasant and helpful and almost everyone seemed to be bilingual in Mandarin Chinese and English  The female concierge was priceless  We had our own itinerary and she not only arranged transport but re confirmed our reservations so that everything would run smoothly  Upon returning  she immediately greeted us and inquired if everything had been satisfactory  as indeed it had been  The hotel is fairly big and seemed full to capacity during our stay  with an international conference  tour groups  assorted business and leisure travelers  However  the staff always seemed to have a warm greeting  leading to a very pleasant environment  On site noodle restaurant was convenient and good value  Would definitely recommend and stay at this hotel again  
N => Amazing Stay I cannot say enough great things about the staff at the Park Plaza  Aside from great rooms  comfortable beds  perfect location  easy access to tours  what really stood out at this hotel was how wonderfully helpful and genuinely friendly the staff were  They consistently provided honest advice about where to eat  what shows to see  tours to take and at one point walked us around to a restaurant in the hutong behind the hotel that they frequent  The food was really good  When expedia screwed up our flights and we were stuck fighting with them on the phone at   am to no avail  Catherine  our amazing concierge  offered to call the airline and had us booked on another flight  no charge  She saved us a ton of money and was incredibly helpful  I would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anyone who asks  If you re planning on a trip to Beijing  give yourself more than   full days  There s way too much to see  
N => Will definitely return  My wife and I stayed here for   nights in ust      as part of our China honeymoon  Before Beijing we were in Hong Kong and Shanghai  The hotels we stayed in in the previous cities lived up to our expectations and we were a bit dubious about our last hotel  the Park Plaza My wife in her correspondence to the hotel after booking it had mentioned that we would be on honeymoon during our stay so when we were checking in we were told that not only were they upgrading us but also thay would be delivering a cake to our room once we got settled  When we got to the room there was rose petals laid out on the bed in the shape of a heart with an arrow going through it and within the hour we got a chocolate moouse cake with happy honeymoon written on it  We felt this was a really nice touch that alot of work went into In regards our stay  we could not fault this hotel  Of the   hotels we stayed in I have to give a mention to the staff here before the others  They were exceptionally polite  attentive and their English was excellent The location is perfect  The hotel is attached to The Regent Hotel which has a subway stop directly underneath so getting around was fairly easy If we ever return to Beijing  which hopefully we will one day  we would stay here again without question While I realise this is a glowing review  there is one thing that I was not fond of  The tour to the Great Wall  In order to get there you have to also visit a Jade factory  a traditional Chinese medicine school and the Ming Tombs with the Great Wall as the last stop  Both the factory and school were awful  It felt very much like a money spin  The Ming Tombs were disappointing in that we were hurried around the grounds and then put back on the bus in less then an hour  This is probably the norm for tours like this but you would prob be better off researching around to see if there are tours available that go directly to the Great Wall instead  
N => Nice big room good service It was our first trip to China  I was accompanying my husband on business  and we didn t know what to expect  It was such a relief to encounter such a clean  well run hotel  with a nice big room  we were upgraded to a suite   Very clean and comfortable  and the one minor problem we ran into  an AC unit that stopped working  was quickly fixed while we were out at dinner  Great breakfast options  friendly and helpful staff  overall a great experience  
N => Excellent Hotel Rooms  and bathrooms  are very clean and spacious  English speaking staff  free internet       minutes walk to get to Wangfujing street  delicious buffet breakfast plus there s a subway station just outside the hotel     highly recommended  
N => Excellent     Great service  great rooms incl internet connection  good location  subway station   mins away   close to Wangfijing shops Door staff always gave directions to taxis and I never once got lost Use the hotel cards to show directions in Chinese to taxis or get any work site address in Chinese to enable taxis to understand Most likely to stay here again 
N => Great location average service    If it s your first time to Beijing  the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing is conveniently located just a few minutes walk to the Wangfujing pedestrian shopping area and a    min  walk to Tiananmen Square  The Park Plaza seems to cater to organized groups which is what I noticed during my   night stay  Having said this  service is under par of what you would expect in a   star Chinese hotel  the staff just seem to be  quot doing their job quot  and not really customer focused  The rooms are well appointed  the internet connection is fast and the buffet breakfast has many Western style dishes to suit all tastes  I would have expected more from this hotel  considering the high ranking on trip advisor  but in comparison to other hotels I ve stayed in China  this one falls short on service    
N => Pretty darned good   just one issue My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Park Plaza  The hotel was nicely appointed with modern amenities  the most comfortable bed we had in China  this isn t saying much though    fast internet access and a large bathroom  We arrived at the hotel around  pm and were told our room was not yet ready  The front desk staff invited us to go up to the club lounge for a cup of coffee while we waited  so we headed up to the   th floor  The temperature in the room was stifling   at least    degrees F  I was miserable up there but delighted when  over an hour later  we were told the room was ready  Unfortunately  our room was just as stifling at    degrees C  the air conditioning did not work and the windows open about   inches  We gave the air some time to kick in  then called the front desk who sent a maid to check it out  She suggested we open the windows  Hmmm  Thankfully the    weather in Beijing turned to    degrees which gave us some relief from the heat  but our room never dropped below    degrees which is way too hot for this Seattle girl  Other than the temperature  though  the experience was positive  The location can t be beat   we enjoyed walking to the night market to check out all the interesting foods and we were able to walk to the best duck dinner one night and great foot massages another evening  Very easy cab rides to the Forbidden City  Summer Palace and Temple of Heaven  The staff was helpful and we used the Bank of China money exchange at the front desk more than once   a good value and so convenient  The breakfast buffet was included in our rate and the food was delicious  I would certainly stay here again but would be more forceful about the temperature  Perhaps we should have demanded a fan  
N => Better than I thought it would be We booked this hotel mainly because of the rev ews here but were still very pleasantly surprised because of the rate we paid Check in was very quick and our luggage was waiting for us in the room The room was very spacious and very well decorated Breakfast was excellent with very quick service and the food was always replaced immediately on the buffet We also had a very good dinner at the hotel  We don t usually eat at hotel restaurants but we would definitely return to this one The concierge were probably the best we encountered in China  they booked all our internal flights for us while we were at dinner and were helpful with regards to taxi s making sure we knew what we had to pay before getting in the car This will definitely be where we ll stay again on our next trip to Beijing  
N => Exceeded my expectations We just came back from our trip in China and we have stayed at the Park Plaza at Wangfujing for   nights and had the most wonderful experience  They have a very fluent English speaking concierge staff  We have a Chinese speaking driver for our stay while in Beijing  We used the concierge staff to explain our daily iterniary to him each morning before we leave for the day and call them to translate if plans changed while we were out  They were so eager to help it completely exceeded my expectation  The rooms are spacious  comfortable and clean with free internet  I know that I could not have stayed in as nice a facility paying the same rate if the hotel were in any major US city  I personally would stay there the next time I go to Beijing  
N => Wonderful Hotel Experience Spent four nights at the Park Plaza and enjoyed every minute that we were there  Major highlight was the incredible conceriege service who we not only consulted with before heading out each day but frequently called while we were out to ask for help scheduling tours  making dinner reservations  etc  Additionally  the nicely decorated  clean rooms and the hotel s proximity to Tiananmen Square  the Forbidden City and the popular Wangfujing shopping area contributed to a most pleasant stay  I d recommend this hotel for anyone taking a trip to Beijing  
N => Best hotel EVER I cannot get over how wonderful this hotel was  After a long walk from Beijing railway station  we caught the bus from the airport to the station since we were told it was apparently  quot close quot  by  we were greeted by a friendly doorboy  who we later found out was Byron  who immediatly came over  cracked a joke and then helped us with our luggage and got us ready to check in The front desk service as we checked in were wonderful  polite  friendly and extremly helpful and spoke in fluent english  The staff were amazing and made our stay wonderful  The door boys were extremly funny especially Byron who kindly helped us with any enquiries we had about getting to places and always warmly greeted us when we came back from our daily adventures  When we were about to leave Park Plaza to our next hotel to Xi an  I asked if the staff could translate our next hotel in written Manadarin  and they happily went onto the internet to get all the details for me and were so friendly  Conceirge were great in even getting a maxi taxi for us since we were going to catch the train to the airport Our room was fantastic  The beds were big  bathrooms were clean    water bottles were provided each day  and the heating system was great since it was very cold outside  TV also had lots of english shows such as HBO  MTV  Discovery etc  The restaurant was clean and very nice to eat in although the price of the drinks were very pricey   I think they were almost the same as the food  Other than that  the staff were great and remebered us sicne we ate there almost every night for our   night stay Overall Park Plaza was the best hotel I stayed in  We stayed in the most terrible hotels in Xi an and Shanghai and funnily enough our hotel in Shanghai was  quot   star quot  and was horrendus   it wasn t even half as good as park plaza again the staff were so friendly with all their smiling faces  and they made it very enjoyable for us  definatly will be coming back here  
N => Not sure why this hotel is so popular Not sure why this hotel has been so popular with TA readers  We chose it because of its popularity and was quite disappointed  We were there for   nights during ober  There was a mess up with our booking when we arrived and by  nd day  it developed into a  quot Faulty Tower quot  drama  all due to their poor internal communication  There were so many issues with the room  long story   The final straw came on day   when we returned to the hotel after a full day out to find our luggage etc were no longer in the room  Instead someone else s luggage was in our room   While the whole episode may sound funny now  it was such a shock to us at the time  finding our things gone   We had their buffet breakfast everyday  included in the tariff   Quality of the food was generally poor  They could do a lot better in their Chinese food selection  After all  we were in China  
N => the BEST place to stay in Beijing  My husband and I booked this hotel based on the wonderful reviews here on T A  We were not disappointed  I asked the hotel to send directions in Chinese  which was very helpful to the taxi driver  The hotel is not easy to find for most drivers as we found out  We arrived late    pm  and check in went smoothly  We were asked if we would like to pay for breakfast or an upgrade   we declined both  but were upgraded anyway for free  The staff spoke excellent english  which was a huge benefit as we do not know much Mandarin Chinese  In fact  the whole staff was beyond wonderful  from the bellboys  to the doormen  to the waitresses in the lounge  Thank you    We booked a private driver for our trip to the Great Wall  which I would recommend doing  When you need a taxi  the doormen help with everything and make sure the taxi knows where to go and that we have their number in case of a problem  Our room was very comfortable and spacious  There are many TV channels in English and the bathroom was large and modern  We enjoyed having the Starbucks right across from us as well  We did a lot of walking   the hotel has a great location with an easy walk to the Forbidden City  etc  If you need ANYTHING  the hotel is eager to help  We would not hesitate to stay here again  Side notes We took   different taxis and   were good    tried to take advantage of us  One taxi thought we wouldn t notice if they demanded we pay for the toll  there is a toll both after leaving the airport   We had been through this toll before and knew better   the taxi driver should pay  He also took us in circles before we started to argue about his driving  After arriving at the hotel  we had the doormen of the Park Plaza translate for us and the taxi driver gave us our money back  Be sure you take official taxis as well  We took one from the Summer Palace to the hotel that wasn t an official taxi  but we thought we could handle the driver  He drove us within a block of the hotel and parked  refusing to go up to the doormen who would recognize a con artist  and his meter was way off  We negotiated a lower fare because we knew what the taxi should cost  He accepted  but gave us fake currency for change  which we discovered after getting back to our room  So  do NOT take an unofficial taxi  The official ones are black  Do not be afraid to negotiate rates   this is expected in China  The subway is much better than taking a taxi   it is modern and fast and convenient and there is a subway stop right behing the Park Plaza  
N => The BEST hotel in Beijing I m still staying at the Park Plaza Beijing as I write this  I m sending this on complimentary in room broadband  I just had to write this review after the most recent reviewer trashed this great hotel  BEWARE the disgruntled reviewer  I guess you can t please everybody  The majority of reviews speak for themselves I booked this hotel weeks ago online and although we arrived early  we were able to go to our room right after finishing a leisurely latte at the Starbucks across the way  We had a wonderfully pressured hot shower which was great after the red eye flight Headed out to explore Beijing by hopping on the subway which was just round the corner ober is a good time to be in Beijing  the weather is mild and conducive to walking from Wangfujing  the main shopping and dining district to the Park Plaza  
N => Out of Rooms  We had a travel agent book this hotel only because of the rating on Trip Advisor  We were on the last week of a two week business trip to China and checking in after midnight  We just wanted to go to bed when the front desk informed us they had no more rooms even though we did pay upfront to make sure we had a room  They moved us to their sister hotel The Regent  which was very nice but we could have picked any   star in Beijing  we did not need them to pick it for us  We picked Park Plaza for a reason  Beware  confirm they have room  
N => modern hotel room We stayed here in y      as part of a stopover that unfortunately only allowed one night rather than two  due to flight delays  The hotel room was very comfortable and had all the mod cons  Unfortunately our Aussie credit cards  both visa and mastercard  did not work in this hotel   Ridiculously  we had to pay cash on arrival  which meant that we used our spending money all in one go on the bond  Then as we were leaving  we had all this cash to spend and no time to spend it  The staff were friendly  especially the concierge staff who went out of the way to help us  Can someone please tell us where that close train station was   We walked for kilometres to find one  We do believe you all though     Just make sure you get good directions from the hotel or catch a taxi so you don t end up hot and bothered by the time you get there like us  We thought the     surcharge to have a few drinks from the bar was ridiculous  so much for their happy hour   
N => fine to stay I stayed two nights a week after Olympic Games were over  The city is not crowded already at all  The location is good  room is clean  staffs are good  There is ntg to complain If you insist me to complain even one point  I would say I can not believe this is a two year old hotel  There were already some places to be fixed in my room  that makes me think this hotel looks seven year old hotel If you read my review and dont want to waste your time to find a hotel in BJ  just pick this up  You have nothing to lose as long as the price is around USD        However  pls be sure that there are plenty of hotels that you would prefer to stay  
N => Good price great location Was there during winter in       Price for a double room was only RMB      which was half the price you d pay in summer  Location was great   just    minutes walk to the famous Wangfujing street  while a new subway station is a mere   minutes walk  Exterior of the hotel was great    looks very much like a good business hotel  Room was fantastic  Room size was just right  beds were comfortable  tv has many international channels  bathroom was just nice   they even have anti mist built into their bathroom mirror We spent Christmas in Beijing  Was glad that the hotel did not force us into taking their  compulsory  christmas dinner   I know many hotels in Bangkok do that  where they charge exorbitant price for very mediocre dinner I ll definitely choose ParkPlaza Wangfujing again if I go back to Beijing in the future  
N => Excellent hotel with soft comfortable beds The best hotel we enjoyed during our month long journey through China  I give it the best rating primarily due to the comfortable beds  as most beds in China have such  quot Firm quot  mattresses that it feels like you are sleeping on concrete     Our room was very spacious with a comfortable king size bed plus a sitting area with a couch  chair  amp  table   a desk  The bathroom was filled with all the amenities we could wish for and new toothbrushes where supplied each day  All was kept spotlessly clean  We actually got a non smoking room a huge bonus in China There was the usual fridge  safe  writing paper  postcard etc We did not check out either the pool or the weight room However the cafe was great Breakfast that came with the room was a large buffet with both hot and cold offerings  There was everything on the buffet you could possibly want along with a chef standing by to cook your eggs for you to your specifications Two evenings we enjoyed a wonderful American Dinner of steak in the restaurant  I wanted to share the meal with my Dad as neither of us wanted a full dinner  When we explained this to the waitress it was not a problem and the kitchen actually split the meal and it arrived on   plates beautifully presented The non smoking area was approximtely half the size of hte restaurant  It was a real bonus after being in Asia for a month to actually be able to enjoy a meal without having a smoker light up at the table next to ours The staff at the front desk were very accomodating about exchanging money There was a Starbucks next door and a neighbourhood shop just around the corner to buy inexpensive pop and junk food at About a   block walk brought you to a shopping area and there were lots of restaurants close to the hotel The only glitch as a very slow check in and I had to argue to get the room which we had reserved and paid for  They wanted to give me a room with   single beds instead of a superior room with a king size bed  However this is not so unusual when one checks in late at night    I would definitely recommend this hotel as a good place to stay for anyone heading to Beijing  
N => Fabulous Staff We stayed at this hotel from the   th to the   th of   I cannot say enough good things about this hotel  particularly about the Concierge Department  Their command of the english language was fabulous  they were extremely helpful and could not do enough for us  assisting us with booking our train tickets to Xian  booking day trips to the Great Wall as well as a fabulous Hutong Tour  They also took care of our luggage when we went to Xian  We received a lovely welcome back on our return from Xian  The reception counter  although were helpful  were not able to assist us quite as efficiently due to their lack of command of the English language  The hotel was set back off the street and was therefore very quiet  it is the sister hotel of the Regent Hotel which was right next door  The Starbucks across from the hotel was well utilized as was the ATM machine in the same building  The rooms were great  beds were comfortable and a good size and the bathroom was great  We were very sad to leave this great hotel  I can see why it is rated number two on trip advisor  We would definitely stay here again  
N => unexpected upgrade not much to say about this place  we had booked an executive level room and after a long flight from AU were unexpectedly upgraded to a great room at the Regent next door  No idea why  the foyer looked deserted and the hotel did not feel booked out  On a subsequent flight we met a traveller who had had exactly the same experience  Worth asking for   
N => Great Hotel We thought this hotel was great   a modern  well run   star hotel  as advertised  We stayed there with our   year old   our only complaint was that they tried to charge extra for bedding for our   year old  which we are finding if often done in Asia  but we haven t encountered this in other regions  We used a great driver  John  to take us to the great wall at Mutiyani      rmb for the day  including a trip to a temple and a drive by the Olympic stadium   He came recommended via a friend  who got the original recommendation from tripadvisor  HIs email is     He also recommended a great guide who showed us around Beijing      rmb for a day   She is young  but amazingly knowledgable   a University student majoring in French and English who is also a trained guide We upgraded to the Executive Floor  which included an extensive buffet breakfast  and drinks and a small range of snacks in the evening  Don t go to the Executive floor for the breakfast as the choices are limited  go to the restaurant which is also included in the upgrade price  The upgrade did not get a bigger or better room   to upgrade to a  suite  was approx     rmb  plus     tax per night  The upgrade to the was     plus tax  If you don t want a full breakfast  I wouldn t bother and go to starbucks accross the way  
N => Very nice hotel I was very impressed with the hotel  Room was large  Shower was great  The hotel was running a special when we arrived  For an additonal fee you could add the business center that included appetizers  drinks plus a computer to access the internet  
N => Lousy front desk service    I stayed with a friend  who was on biz trip  for   nites        il She booked directly through the hotel  requesting for a twin bed However  when we arrived  we were shocked that the front desk staff told us that the booking was not confirmed hence there s no room for us  The hotel expected us to contact them before we arrived to confirm the booking  when they have already accepted our booking with credit card details  Meaning  by not calling them   non confirmation  This is a great shock to us as being frequent travellers  we have never experience such regulations So  after dragging for half an hour  they finally found us a suitable room  meaning a queen bed plus a sofa bed  Apparently that s the only solution they can offer  We accepted reluctantly since we were both tired On our check out day  we realised another western guest had the same experience as us  Hence  I do not think ours is an isolated case  And we certainly do not expect this from such a well received hotel Plus  I think there are nicer  more centrally located hotels around  Like the Regent  Hyatt or Raffles  However  we heard that most of them are booked till Olympics  Good luck  
N => nice upgrade this hotel is located near a subway station and walking distance to everything  we arrived late at night and the hotel is fully booked  they gave our room away  To our surprise  they upgraded us to Regent  which is connected to this hotel  Regent is a nice   star hotel     loved it  
N => Loved Park Plaza   EXCELLENT SERVICE My girlfriend and I recently returned from our stay at the Park Plaza in Wangfujing  After being seriously disappointed with the conditions of our hotel in Tokyo  Akasaka Yoko   we decided to stay somewhere a bit more expensive  This was the greatest decision we made  The hotel room really made our trip much more enjoyable  The staff can not do enough to help you while you are staying there  They courteously greet you as soon as you come through the doors and really enjoy small talk  When in need of a taxi  they radio one for you and write down the license plate in case of any scams  They also have really convenient cards with popular tourist attractions listed on them to give to the cab driver  Make sure you have the address of the hotel written down on paper before you go  We didn t and cab drivers aren t familiar with the hotel  and don t speak any English  As for the room  it was fabulous  More than enough space  giant bed  nice bathroom  and great room service  The room service was a decent price too  I recommend the western style breakfast  The only complaint I have was that the bar was a little overpriced  but that was okay because we just left the hotel to drink  They also tried to talk us into upgrading our room for      which included a free dinner buffet with alcohol included every night  We didnt do this and were happy about our choice because we looked at the buffet  which appeared to be mostly snack foods and cheap alcohol  Food is really cheap outside of the hotel  so this is a waste of money  The room also had no view  which we didn t come to China for STAY AT THIS HOTEL  IT IS GREAT  
N => fantastic would recommend We had a fantastic stay at this hotel  The rooms were comfortable and the staff were extremely helpful  We wanted to go on the overnight sleeper to X ian and the staff went to the station to book the tickets in person  The breakfast had a good variety of both Chinese and Western dishes served in a buffet style The major sites were about a       min walks away  although it was worth it for the service and price of this hotel  
N => Very Pleasant Stay at Beijing Park Plaza Following the trip advisor rankings of hotels in Beijing and trying to stick to a budget  we decided to book our   day stay at the Beijing Park Plaza   Wanfujing  We were not only pleased with the staff and the service at the hotel  but the location was also excellent    only a few blocks away from one of the most popular shopping  amp  restuaruant areas in the city    gt  Wangfujing Street ServiceThe check in and check out process was flawless  The concierge was very helpful  He gave us directions around town  helped us book a day trip to the Ming Tumbs and the Great Wall  and promptly got us taxis whenever we needed them  On Site RestaurantOur rate included breakfast  which had a good mix of eastern and western foods  The staff seemed to be a bit moody at times  but after realizing they worked shifts from   am to past    am  we understood why     We had the same waiters for breakfast as we did for dinner RoomThe room was clean and had a good view  The bed was a bit hard  but this doesn t seem to be uncommon in China  Everytime we called housekeeping for anything  they would have someone come to our room in less than   minutes    which we thought was outstanding  The day before we were supposed to leave the hotel  we were sent a complimentary tray consisting of fresh fruit and a bottle of wine   a nice touch and a great way to end our trip  
N => Excellent Hotel Stayed at the Park Plaza for   nights during late   Actually decided to stay here after seeing the reviews on tripadvsior and I m glad that we did After arriving from a long flight from Australia and also realising just how cold it is over there in winter we were glad that it was a swift and easy check in and that we had been upgraded Our room was on the   th floor  top floor  and it was lovely  It all looked new and clean  The beds were abit firm but we got use to it and the bathroom was quite small   however our friends in the next room had the same set out but their bathroom was quite alot bigger  The only issue I guess was that there was no space to put our toiletries which was annoying Breakfast was excellent  It was sooo good to have scrambled eggs or omlets made up for on the spot  We generally didnt need to have lunch because we filled up on the breakfast There was also a starbucks opposite so that was handy also We pretty much caught taxis everywhere because it was so cold and the doormen was great in telling the taxis dirvers where we wanted to go and then giving us a card with the taxis numberplate and the chinese names for places In terms of location it was good it was about a      minute walk to Wangfujing Street  the concierge tried to tell us it was  minutes but I m guessing he must run it or something  One thing to be aware of is that in Beijing just because the pedestrian crossing flashes green doesnt mean cars stop On our first night we were nearly wiped out by a bus  after the first couple of times we learnt to keep up with the locals We also booked an acrobatics show through the hotel  It was ok but probably not worth what we paid for the seats but it was something to say we did On the day we had to leave we had an early flight meaning we would miss breakfast so we let the front desk know and whilst leaving were giving a packaged breakfast which had cold meats  yougurt and pasteries which was a really nice touch Overall I would recommened the Park Plaza to stay in  
N => Nice room We stayed here for   nights during first week of       and had a wonderful stay  The room and the king bed was very nice  Being tired walking around Beijing  a firm bed was enough to mend our aching back by the time we got up in the morning  We did not accept an upgrade when checking in  The US     extra each day for the upgrade had a free breakfast   its not worth it  We used to go a couple of blocks away from the hotel every day to the Taiwan Hotel where they had a great buffet breakfast for just     for two  Otherwise the hotel is conveniently located next to the metro stop and a street with many restaurants  The bell desk recomended us to an acrobatic show but did not find it worth it  They must be making a commission on the tkts  They even wanted us to use their services to book a trip to the Great Wall but we got a very nice trip elsewhere at less than half the price  The Hotel lobby is tiny and the front desk is the only thing which is not impressive at all  
N => This is a wonderful hotel with friendly staff I recently visited Beijing from       nd with my finance who happens to be Chinese  I decided to book   hotels just to keep the week interesting as we were only going to stay in Beijing  We spent a bit more time IN the hotels than sightseeing as it was VERY cold in Beijing the week we were there  Anyway for me especially  I loved the Park Plaza hotel  When we first checked in a friendly staff member tried to get us to upgrade to a suite from the deluxe room we already booked  Though the suite sounded good   included the Breakfast buffet plus a free   hour happy hour I still declined the offer Check in was very quick and very friendly  We got to the Deluxe room and immediately I noticed it was VERY clean  smelled clean  and was rather modern  However after a few hours I felt the Deluxe room was just a bit small   The other   hotels we stayed at also offered rather small rooms  so maybe this is just the way it is in Beijing  say vs a hotel in NY  We contacted the front desk later that day and asked to be upgraded to the suite the next day  When we finally moved to the suite   it was in a quiet corner of the hotel I felt wow  this feels like home  So the next   days we stayed in the suite  and it was just wonderful  Modern electronic thermostats in   rooms    bathrooms    tvs etc  All this for about     more a day  but you get free breakfast and the happy hour  If you like to drink  I don t  you can get as much Johnny Walker Black or Chivas as you can handle plus some finger type foods  I only mention this because I happen to be a wine liquor salesman and Johnny Black is NOT cheap  So if you like to eat  and drink a little  the upgrade more or less pays for itself  The Breakfast buffet we felt was pretty good   and I felt everything was rather tasty and fresh overall Basically I was most impressed with the cleanliness and overall FEELING of being VERY at home rather than in some cold strange hotel  There was just a good vibe about the Park Plaza I did not at all feel about the other   hotels we stayed at very nearby  I think for the money  the Park Plaza is a VERY nice friendly place to stay  When I got home to NY I was asked to fill out a survey that the P Plaza asked if I would do for them   I gave it good grades  and shortly thereafter received a personal letter of thanks from the hotel manager  they seem to genuinely want to please  Overall I think most people would have a nice stay here   if you can afford it  the Suite to me was a big plus   
N => A Waste of Money  Spend a Bit More and Relish Their Sister Hotel My fiance and I stayed here during our Christmas holidays from        The reviews of this place had us thrilled and excited  but the only thing we left China with was a polluted taste in our mouths and an assurance if we ever go back to Beijing  PPW s sister hotel  The Regent  will see our business before this   star establishment ever does again  We booked our reservations online through the goldpointsplus program and were guaranteed the best rate bar none  When we checked in  the desk clerk offered us an upgrade to a junior suite   which we took   but as we later found out  we were charged for the breakfast upgrade twice  After several complaints the manager offered us a     discount off our total bill  to which we refused  In the end we were offered a free nights  stay  but to this day we are still waiting for the refund we ve been promised  We ve been told it could take as long as two months for the transaction to process  so I suppose we ll just have to wait and see  The check in girl was nice enough to notice my Christmas Eve birthday and offered us a free birthday cake which was really thoughtful  With our upgrade we had access to the club lounge  but checking in from there took more than TWO hours before our suite was ready and available for us   We were told there were cleaning issues  lightbulb issues  etc   The lounge access was a constant issue and we were often denied use of the internet until I became angry enough half way through our stay that it never became an issue again  Having lounge access made us feel more like thieves than privleged guests  The room itself was wonderful and I have zero complaints about it  other than heating issues  but after a day or two  the thermostat was fairly easy to figure out   Our bedroom was spacious with tons of storage and even the plasma screen tv was enjoyable  The bed was a dream to sleep on and the bathroom was clean  spacious  and inviting  I wish I could say the same for service and staff  Our breakfasts at PPW were the one thing I dreaded every single day  Breakfast ran from  am    am  seems to end early by  star standards  and things were rarely  if ever  tended to  Hot dishes were greasy and clearly re used from the day before  stations were cramped and poorly maintained  We came late and the food was terrible  We came at  am and the food was equally terrible if not more so  The chef working the egg station showed me obvious and continual contempt when I asked for egg white omelets  cheese was left to dry on plates  and cold cuts looked old and unappetizing   If you re going to do a buffet in a small space  do it small and do it fabulous  don t fill it with terrible foods poorly prepared and easily forgotten   The morning of my birthday we came down late for breakfast and were told we couldn t eat any food that was still out from buffet service  When we asked if we could have some of the cold dishes we weren t allowed to do so  even though numerous tables were still eating and helping themselves to the clearly open buffet    We were forced to order off the menu and our eggs benedict was the worst thing I have ever tried to eat in my life  The eggs were hard boiled and sat on spam and soggy toast  then broiled    My fiance and I are absolute foodies and this was an absolute travesty  The waitress clearly saw I was upset and refused to do anything about it  We politely voiced our complaints to the manager  and the first thing he tried to do was quiet us with the fact that a birthday cake was due to arrive in our room  He also told us he d refund our breakfast  but we never heard back from him and the refund never did come  Room service food was mediocre at best  and the infamous birthday cake was left in our bedroom for FOUR days  despite numerous requests to have it removed  We tried to be subtle at one point and destroyed the cake with our cutlery and smeared the plates to make it look like we d eaten the thing  which we did not   The cleaning staff actually replaced our cutlery and plates but wouldn t remove the cake  It took three separate phone calls to housekeeping  room service  and finally the front desk  to get the offending dishes removed  Christmas Eve was spent at PPW s sister hotel The Regent  Let me say it right now   pay the money and stay in luxury  The hotel is in much better condition  PPW s lobby is dated  dark  and dank  just like their in house restaurants   The Regent staff have smiles on their faces and look to truly enjoy their jobs  They are helpful  the atmosphere is one hundred times better than anything PPW had to offer  and their Christmas Eve seafood buffet was a dream worth waking up for  We even won two prizes that night and were lucky enough to come back for a FREE Christmas Day lunch buffet and high tea in the lounge area  I could go on and on about more  but judge for yourself I suppose  I was thrilled by the reviews posted here and all my fiance and I experienced were disappointment after disappointment   Bottom line  The room s at PPW are up to par but everything else  staff  surroundings  service  food  are WAY below a  star rating  Again  pay the extra    or    dollars and upgrade yourself into a real hotel  
N => Greatly Exceeded Expectations We were delighted with our stay at the Park Plaza and felt that it greatly contributed to the quality of our stay in Beijing  The room was really lovely   all the decor and amenities felt like a   star hotel The staff  especially the concierges  were more than helpful  They not only gave us excellent advice but offered to obtain our train tickets from the station  saving us the hassle  and did not charge for the service    only for the cab fare  We were also delighted with the door service   helping us into cabs and giving directions to the driver as our Chinese is quite elementary  Also they made wonderful suggestions  But best of all we noted the cheery greetings from all staff in the morning and when we returned or just passing in the lobby  Although other hotels gave similar service  none compared with the  quot desire to please quot  attitude of the staff  We felt this not only reflected the excellent hiring skills but also the training of the staff  
N => Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing was our oasis of comfort in Beijing Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing was wonderful  My husband and I stayed for   nights in late ember  The service by the staff was excellent across the board  The room was spacious and the bedding comfortable  There is a lovely lobby with a comfortable lounge to sit and relax and have a drink after a day in Beijing s pollution and crowds  The concierge  there were a few in the days we were there  were all helpful to us in figuring out how to get from A to B  We were very pleased with our stay and would go back if we were to ever go to Beijing again  
N => Loved the location Hotel was a little difficult to find  would recommend that you download the hotel name and address in Chinese characters to show your driver Booked a superior room and was upgraded to a deluxe room upon check in  Rooms are new  clean and internet access is free Its walking distance to Wangfujing shopping area and forbidden city  Eating places are also accessible and more importantly they cater to non chinese readers like myself with pictorial menus Overall a great hotel to stay in   superb value for money  
N => Be very careful staying here  promises get broken The four of us stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing in ember  from the   th to the   th  four nights  I paid for both rooms  I cannot stress how crucial it was to have non smoking rooms  so instead of simply booking through the website where one room didn t allow me to choose smoking or non smoking  I decided to call Carlson directly via the toll free number on their site  Things went down hill from there   Pros  Rooms were spotless  housekeeping was very thorough  Spacious rooms meant room to relax and have our local friends over for evening coffee in our suite  Walls were a little thin  but the comfy beds meant that we slept well anyway  Porters  bellhops  all wonderful  Breakfast buffet selection excellent  congee to omlettes and lots of variety in between  very good quality  Service at restaurant also good  although the coffee was weak  Since there was a Starbucks accross the way  we just bought ground coffee and made nice strong coffee in our rooms using the coffee pot provided  Concierge arranged taxi service for us to the Great Wall  which was very reasonable at     RMB  or at the hotel was relatively modern and comfortable  muted earth tones throughout  The staff all spoke passable English  even though two of us  myself included  were fluent in Mandarin  If not for the front desk staff  I d be a convert  near St  Regis quality at better than half the price Cons  After a year  I really would have expected this hotel to have worked through its growing pains  The US reservations call centre thoroughly screwed up our reservations that were so critical to us  so after a few calls to Corporate Customer Service  one free night  of the eight I was paying for  was offered  This was compensation for my hours and hours of calling both US and Chinese Carlson offices locations trying to get this resolved I was reassured twice by staff   at the local hotel   that this was all taken care of  however upon check out I was told by the morning staff that they knew nothing about the issue  feigning ignorance  They conferred some more  all the while not realizing that I understood all that was being said  I am caucasian   Not fun  Finally  one particular representative  and I m quoting here  concluded   quot This was the US call centre s problem  and they never contacted us  Since it s not a local problem  we are not going to honor this promise  We are separate and the US can t control us  We are not giving you one night free  quot  I realize that Beijing is   h behind the US call centre  but basically what happened here is that no one in China was willing to get the job done  to confer and make arrangements behind the scenes The US can t control us   What s that all about  This hotel chain made a promise that they broke  They gladly accept reservations arranged courtesy of the call centre  but when things went awry  they decided that they were a separate entity  when it was convenient    We had a flight to catch  travelling on to Hong Kong  so I was stuck  I had to pay Be very careful  these people don t keep their promises  The assistant manager has also since informed me that they still aren t going to honor the request  and that they don t even guarantee non smoking rooms when requested  This is one of those places where you just might not get what you bargain for  so I d be very reluctant to recommend staying here  even with all the positives  I m sure that other American hotel chains in Beijing are much more willing to put their customers first  The front desk staff here needs to go back to charm school In the end  the US folks are mailing me a cheque for the one free night  but would I stay there ever again  Nope  It s a matter of trust  that when things go wrong  you can count on the people in charge to make things right and fix the problem  Not the case here  
N => Excellent service  This a hidden gem of a hotel  tucked away behind a bigger hotel and therefore shielded by the sound of inner city traffic  Excellent service  We arrived in the afternoon and they told us our room wasn t ready so they were upgrading us to a suite for our   day stay  Amazing suite on the executive club floor Just a few wee problems    the air conditioning didn t work very well and the food was a little average  Would not hesitate to stay there again though as the service was excellent and very friendly  
N => Excellent hotel I was in charge of the arrangements for a group of    people traveling to China in tember       Not only was I extremely impressed with the beautiful rooms  facilities  and location  but the service as well  particularly for the price  Our reservation was complicated  not just because we had so many people  but we had several participants who arrived and departed on different dates  needed special airport pickups  etc  I had communicated these needs to the management for the   months leading up to the trip  but was still worried about potential problems given the complexities of our visit  I m pleased to say that all went off without a hitch  The manager of the hotel was amazing  He was waiting for me when our group arrived  and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed to contact him at any time  I felt the hotel management and staff truly wanted our business and were happy to assist us in any way possible  I would stay here again without question  
N => i luuuuuuuved it  park plaza is an absolute MUST  i could not say enough about this place  very friendly and helpful staff  front desk  concierge  maid service  everyone was eager to help us   great food for reasonable price  main restaurant has a variety of food  also  try the noodle place  it s great    clean and spacious room bathroom  and excellent location  i ve been to many   and   star hotels  but this   star rated hotel  i m not even sure why this has only   stars  it far exceeds the quality of a   star  i must say  the only thing that is similar to other   stars is the price     was actually a lot better than an average   star hotel in europe  there is no doubt  i will definitely go back to park plaza in beijing  
N => One of the best  We stayed a week and LOVED this hotel    Clean and spacious rooms  Staff bent over backwards to be friendly and accommodating Everything was   star  Concierge was a great help  Food in restaurantwas good  especially breakfast  and we normally closed down the restaurant with snacks and drinks late at night  They even boxed up our lunch for the trip to the Great Wall Oh  and there s a great restaurant across the street where you order a pot of broth  it comes to your table on a hotplate  amp  you add your favorite ingredients   yum   not sure the name  There s a Starbuck s right there  too  and a Bank of China around the corner  Couldn t askfor more  Close enough to all the attractions without too many crowdson the street   Out of the way  but in a GOOD way   For a couple bucks  you can get a metered cab anywhere     Be careful downtown   we almost got suckered into an expensive ride late at night   only use the METERED cabs  We walked from Park Plaza to Tienanmen Square one morning at sunrise but I wouldn t recommend it for most people   we are walkers and we got winded  Better to take a cab or even cab to the subway  It was quite a hike   Even the staff looked at us like we were a bit crazy when we said we d walk  The maps are deceiving  I would highly recommend Park Plaza  We will stay again without a doubt    
N => Terrible experience Given the extremely laudatory comments  I must have been quite unlucky I arrived in the room at    pm  nice room  but when I tried to connect to Internet  I discovered that the plug was broken  It took   hours to have it repaired Then I went to bed but the room was next to the elevator  terribly noisy  I slept   hours  At   am I discovered that rain was pouring in the room thru the window  I called and was told I would be immediately transferred to another room  which was the case   hours later The new room got cold in the afternoon  I called and was told that indeed heating was not any more woirking but that it would be repaired asap  Three days later  it has not been  in spite of my repeated requests  But they were kind enough to bring a tiny heating device  I am still freezing  but at least it works   I w lt ill be delighted to leave to morrow My conclusion and advices   I must have been quite unlucky  in many other aspects the hotel is pleasant  there is obviously problems of maintenance  be sure to have goos sweaters etc   in case of heating problems  do not come if possible for business purpose  any problem will take hours of your previous time to be solved  do not use the expensive business center  one photocopy will cost you     US    so      for a memo of    pages Good luck    
N => great location very good hotel We got a very good deal on this hotel  and after the positive reviews we read on tripadvisor we decided to stay there  We were not disappointed  It is an excellent location  to where you can walk to the Forbidden City  In and of itself that was great The central location also lends itself to cheap taxis for other sites  The rooms were a good size  and very clean  I would not say they have   star appointments by any means   more like   to     star style rooms  Free high speed internet was very nice  The food was decent   mostly western food and japanese it seemed  And there is a Starbucks right acroos the driveway  which was nice  The staff were all very helpful with maps and directions  The best thing they helped us with was a driver to take us to the Great Wall for the day  For       this made everything really easy for us  We even had enough time to go to the Summer Palace on our way back  the car hire was for   hours   as well as stop at a convenience store for snacks and water  The driver they got us was great  One tip   on our way from the airport our driver was very confused as to which hotel it was  There are several hotels of similar names  And just saying it in english or pointing to the name and address in english was not helpful  I would recommend asking someone in the airport who speaks english to write the name and address in chinese on a piece of paper for you  We were lost and finally had to ask people on the street for help  
N => An OK hotel with some significant lapses Its an OK hotel  but lets not get crazy  Some things that bothered me include the following They do not respect the  quot do not disturb quot  sign  which here is enacted by pushing a button which enables an illuminated sign by the doors entrance I stayed on the sixth floor  and tended to want to relax in the afternoon  and on three consecutive days a  cleaning staff knocked on the door  asked if they could come in  I said no  Then    minutes later a maintenance guy actually OPENED the doorb  the next two days in a row  they CALLED and asked if it was OK to enter  You see  they did not want to disturb me by knocking and thought it would be OK to   call on the phone  Does this staff receive any training at all        The buffet breakfast is OK  not great  but certainly OK  My beef was that the price of the buffet was not shown on the menu or anywhere else  It actually costs more than the American breakfast as served by a waiter  but there was no way for anyone to know this The poor waiters are not at fault  nor were they prepared to explain this situation         The hotel is clean  the staff is nice  despite the above   and I would stay there again  But I cannot understand the above lapses  
N => Very nice hotel Very nice hotel  Still seems very new  Room was big and clean   very glad to see after a long flight  Bed nice  great pillows  Was a little worried about the sign that said   quot do not drink tap water quot     they provided   bottled waters everyday  Not much of a view  but who cares  Front desk was a little standoff ish to me  but they were very talkative to our guide  Getting money was easy  Breakfast was very good  with many choices    filled up and only needed dinner afterwards  Concierge and other staff nice  Location is good   Wangfujing Mall is nearby but walk seemed to take forever    probably because it was so hot  Overall  very nice  
N => This is a wonderful hotel We spent our last night in Beijing in this hotel  We d just spent two weeks in Tibet and this hotel was a welcome oasis  The rooms were exceptionally clean  modern and comfortable  We enjoyed room service ordering a late night snack and breakfast in bed  We found the service to be prompt and curteous and the hotel rate of      a night to be a great value  This hotel is approximately    minutes from the airport  without traffic   A great find  
N => Great clean and good location  Stayed at the hotel for   nights  The beds are very comfortable  The rooms were very clean and the service was excellent  Room service was a little pricey but well worth it  Had dinner and breakfast in the room and all was very fresh and good  The staff was very helpful  Got lots of good info from Jeff Zhang who works at the concierge desk  The tours are pricey  You can find your own a lot cheaper  Set up a tour to go to the great wall at Mutianyu and had the driver all day  The charge was     RNB  We probably would have negotiated that but we were flying in from Datong that day and our plane was delayed so the driver waited for us several different times at airport as no one really knew what time our plane was arriving  Our driver  Yong  was there waiting when we arrived as our flight was   hours late with cold drinks in hand ready to take us  Yong spoke english but was hard to understand sometimes  We got to Mutianyu around   which was perfect as it wasnt crowded at all  A cable car takes you up to the top and you can walk down or have a choice to take the cable car or toboggle down to the bottom  Of course  I took the toboggle  So much fun  Next morning went to see the Summer Palace and Forbidden City  If you are pressed for time I would recommend the Summer Palace over the Forbidden City  The Forbidden City is just a bunch of buildings and museum stuff  Best to go across the street on the back side of Forbidden city  Looks to have more interesting stuff  If you want to do local shopping  Go to Hutong where the locals go and live  Wangfujing Street is overpriced  TIPS  Best to take your hotel info written in chinese so that the taxi knows exactly where to go  When arriving at airport use the Taxi Station where all drivers are legal  The taxi station is right outside the airport and clearly marked  Almost got hustled by a women stating she was the controller and could get us a taxi  Some guy pops up out of nowhere and starts to direct us elsewhere  Probably would have paid triple if I had gone with that person  Chinese people can spot tourist easily and try to hustle them  If you ignore them and dont pay attention they will leave you alone  If you respond to them they wont leave you alone and follow you for as long as they can  
N => Fantastic service Staying in this hotel was a fantastic experience  The staff were so friendly and helpful and the concierge was wonderful  Nothing was toomuch trouble   anytime we wanted to go out  the concierge had a taxi arranged in minutes for us  The hotel room was very well equipped andwas much bigger than I expected  Breakfast was excellent   there was so much to choose from every morning  I would definitely stay in thishotel again and would have no hesitation about recommending it for anyone staying in Beijing  
N => Great place to wind down after a day of walking Location   Convenient as hotel is located   bocks from Wangfujing St  Aaround the corner  there is a    hour convenience store here you can buy water and snacks from Room   Fantastic as we had a suite on Corporate rates  No issues with water pressure and heating  Plasma tv was a bonusConcierge services   Nelson provides A grade service  He tells you the local hot spots bars and places to eat and shop  Also  when we were out once and having trouble translating our destination to our taxi drver  we just called up the hotel  spoke to Nelson to help us translate to the taxi driver  Spotty service from the rest of the concierge staff Breakfast buffet was good  Omellete man was there too Overall   I would stay there again if I am in BeijingK amp G  Australia 
N => Nice  This is a nice and relatively new small   stars hotel in a central location    but it is not yet up to standard  I have   major complaints during our stay    Central heating does not work properly  The temperature could not be adjusted therefore it was all the time very hot and air is very dry  We had to open the windows to get fresh air to cool down the temperature but we could not sleep at night having the windows opened due to the contruction noise from the building site next to the hotel  These poor people work through the night     hours   In genreal  there are many new building sites in the center and its surrounding  so pollutions and noise are really a big problem    Breakfast buffet is bad  The food is cold and not much varieties comparing to other hotels we have stayed in Beijing Overall I would still recommand this hotel to others if they don t mind the above mentioned problems  
N => Nice Hotel But    Got a little  Lost in Translation  I m pretty picky when it comes to hotels  The two things I look for in a hotel are the aesthetics  modern hotels are a plus  and the cleanliness  Well this hotel met expectations for both of these areas  The hotel was very modern  the rooms were a very nice size and the room I had was very clean  Now to the service  which is really not a big deal for me as long as the aesthetics and cleanliness meet my expectations   the service could use some improving  or perhaps it was just the front desk person who assisted me  Service issue     My reservation was booked by my company and clearly requested a king size bed  When I arrived to my room  I found two twin beds  So I go back down to the front desk and graciously ask the same gentleman who checked me in to honor my reservation and to place me in a king bed room  He changed me to a different room  but of course with a little attitude  So I go to my new room and before I walk in  I notice the door of the room across from mines had what appeared to be a large amount of mold growing on it  I dismissed it to possibly being caused by a recent flood  but when I walked into my room  it reeked of this mold smell  I immediately went back down to the front desk and told him about this and requested a different room  Well  at this point he was extremely agitated by me and immediately told me that there were no other rooms  w o even looking in the computer   So I told him to just put me back into my original room because the smell of mold was unbearable  Growing even more agitated now  he snatched my room key away from me and exchanged my room  I dismissed it because at this point I was exhausted and I just wanted to get to a decent room  Service issue     The first night in my room I noticed that it was extremely cold  I tried adjusting the thermostat but the room never got any warmer  The next day I informed the front desk  so they sent housekeeping to my room  to adjust the thermostat for me   despite my telling them that I had already tried this    Housekeeping adjusted the thermostat  same way I did the evening prior  and told me to just wait  Well after a few hours of shivering I phoned the front desk again  They told me   well sorry nothing we can do  we can bring you more blankets   MORE BLANKETS    It s ember in Beijing and very cold outside  I wanted heat  not extra blankets    I told them I did not need more blankets  I needed maintenance to come up to fix the issue  They finally sent maintenance up and the heating was soon fixed Despite my mishaps with the service  all in all this is a very nice hotel and I d still recommend it to a friend  Just the whole language barrier can get in the way at times  as I m sure can happen at any hotel when you re in a foreign country   
N => Park hotel modern Stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing ober  oth   th  New Hotel but Taxi drivers did not seem to know it even with card from hotel given to them  Hotel is hidden away a bit from the main road  Staff and reception good  Would stay at the atel rather than Park  only because no one could find it  Went to Great wall at Bandalang  Hated the crowds and the funny pulley cars that take you up the mountain  Glad I have seen Beijing but have no desire to visit again  
N => Nelson the concierge was excellent Our stay at the Park Plaza was excellent  We had a little trouble getting there as the hotel is quite new and perhaps not all the taxi drivers are aware of it  Location wise it is excellent    blocks from the top of Wanfujing walking street  The rooms were nice and very clean  Everything had a brand new feel to it The breakfast was fine  but we usually went somewhere else to have a more  quot chinese quot  meal The best thing about the hotel was the concierge Nelson  He put us on to some really nice places  he wrote down the address in chinese and made sure the taxi driver knew where  One place was for dim sum  and it was so good we had to keep going back We found it wasn t very easy to change money in China  I d recommend just using an ATM  I ve read a lot of reports about chinese ATMs not accepting cards but I had no trouble  try the Citibank ATMs We saw a not very good acrobatics show that there were brochures for at reception  Get the cheapest seats only  it seemed that westerners all got put in the front row whatever they paid  We also saw the Shaolin monks show  that was very good We stayed for   nights  Other reviews talked about construction noise and there was construction going on across the road  but it didn t disturb us All in all the Park Plaza was great  
N => Fantastic Hotel I loved the fact that this hotel was only one year old  All the staff spoke very good English especially one of the Concierges  Jeff  who was very helpful in organising tours etc  It was a    minute walk to the Wanfujing pedestrian mall  but an easy pleasant walk     minutes walk to Forbidden City  Set back from main road so no road noise  Very modern  loved the toilets on the  nd floor  Only problem was there was no pool but this is not uncommon in Beijing  
N => Fantastic   Highly Recommended  
N => The Park Plaza was fabulous   
N => Fantastic First Experience   
N => Exceeded Expectations  
N => Klasse Lage Service und Preis  sehr zu empfehlen  
N => Okay Hotel Pro s  InexpensiveCon s  Poor location  far from most areas of interest        minute taxi ride to most major city center sites  Uncomfortably hard beds  like most Chinese state run hotels  
N => Liked it very much Stayed for three nights as part of a tour  Had two room keys so it was handy if two of you needed to come back at different times or to leave one in the room so that the air con stayed on  Rooms were very warm even with air con  think some one moved rooms because of this   A thick duvet on the bed  as with most of the Chinese hotels we stayed at  Room not particularly big but clean  Kettle and tea coffee sachets provided  Lighting quite dark  various spotlights  no main ceiling light  Slippers even replaced  Fun to watch the ten lanes of traffic or so if you re on that side  Had a massage card put under the door Didn t see many shops of interest  but there was a handy petrol station   turn right up the same side of the road   selling a few basics  The off licence the other way seemed to want to rip tourists off   told us bottled water was about   times the usual going rate  Go to the petrol station instead  fixed prices and they sell beer  KFC right outside the hotel Breakfast room was very busy  food was nice   excellent banana bread cake Can send postcards via the concierge by the front desk  although always dubious when you hand over the money and they say they ll put the stamps on  most arrived but one didn t Had a few goes at trying to change travellers  cheques at reception as the person who dealt with the exchange was away from the desk on other business  but managed to do so in the end   but thought a    sterling charge on a     cheque a bit steep  
N => Lovely hotel but chaotic breakfasts Lovely hotel  great room  pleasant staff  free bottled water in room every day  but breakfast times were chaotic to say the least  Staff unable to cope at breakfast time on both days we stayed  They ran out of cutlery  plates  glasses  food on both mornings  staff were running around like headless chickens  lack of any managment seem to be the problem  
N => An OK Hotel When I was in Beijing  I was supposed to stay in other hotel  but my travel agent changed in the last minute for this one  stating that this one was better located No doubt about that  an excellent location in Beijing  but personally I didn t like the hotel  Very old furniture  bathroom didn t look fresh  the bed sheets had some dust on it   I had to close my eyes and try not to think and notice in these things  so I could have a pleasant stay in Beijing The only things that I liked was the breakfast and again  the location But I would recommend other hotel  Not a  star hotel like they announce it  
N => OK first class hotel We chosed this hotel for our first three days ever in China  All in all  we were not disappointed  This is a good chinese first class hotel  and we got a good price  far below the      USD night as advertised on Tripadvisor Some problems  There was a slight smell of sewer in the bathroom  and all meals at the hotel was extremely expensive  The pool was a bit to cold to be enjoyed  The location is OK but not perfect as you have to walk some blocks to get to the main shopping centers  Many in the staff only spoke Chinese One big applause toes to the concierge team  Spoke good English  helped us in any way possible  always positive and expedient  Well done  
N => The Prime Hotel    Prime Location   Disapointing Hotel The Prime Hotel had big rooms and a great location within walking distance of the Forbidden City and the Wang Fung  but those were the only perks  We changed rooms several times upon our arrival  in an attempt to find a room that did not have a mildew problem  before finally settling on the first room we were given  Even this room had a shower that was unusable because of the mildew problem  In addition the food in their restaurant was only marginal at best  Next time I go to China I will only stay in American brand hotels  which seemed to be held to much higher standards  
N => Better than expected Stayed on the Executive floor for   nights in mid ch  Hotel as said by others has a great location close to forbidden city  other downtown sights  Breakfast Buffet was good  not great but most of the time I have been to China was on business and typically stayed in Hyatt  Shangri lai  riott hotels that market to western business persons  Staff on excutive floor where very nice and helpful  English not the best  but my Chinese was worse  Rpome where clean and room service good  Mattress s where up to western standards As mention before check in process was a bit tiring after arrrving from    hours flight  Something about the computer being down  Once they understood we where staying on   th floor it magically worked out  In fact I would highly recommend staying on the executive floor as their prices through expedia where very good and competitive with other higher rated hotels on the TA boards Breakfast area was not crowded and eggs made to order where the highlight  Evening free cocktails     per quest  where a nice touch I would say that the pool and work out areas where a disappointment but after       hours of exploring we   family of    where too tired to be concerned Security in the hotel was good With traffic and all the cars and trucks in Beijjing being heavy  the locfation of this hotel worked out great No problems with cabs finding the hotel  
N => Nice Hotel  Close to sights My wife and I stayed here for   nights as first time visitors to tour China before heading on to Hong Kong to meet up with other adopting families  After a nonstop redeye flight from LAX we arrived in Beijing to a very quiet airport at     am  Grabbed a taxi with a non english speaking driver and off into the rain and fog we went  Now this driver since he didn t read or understand english took us to another Hotel popular with western tourists but it wasn t ours  after getting him straightened out by the management of the Hotel we arrived at the Prime blocks away  They immediately checked us in to a deluxe room that I booked thru Expedia without a problem  The Hotel lobby  restaurant  and rooms were elegant and nicely styled  Front desk staff speaks adequate english and housekeepers also enough to serve you  We had a pleasant experience and everyone was more than happy to take care of your needs  The hotel is located     blocks from a brand new indoor   story shopping mall located on a fashionable street  Cheap eateries located nearby too  Taxi s are cheap and ask Hotel to write directions in chinese for cab drivers 
N => Good hotel let down by management This hotel has the basics right  Good location  Very spacious  comfortable rooms  ours had a great view over the city to the mountains to the north west  Absolutely charming staff  Competitive room rates  BUT   we were not advised in advance that health club and swimming pool were closed for renovation  was this booking agent Expedia s fault   and these facitlites were fundamental to our requirements  nice foyer and lovely pianist every night but no seating  pushing you to expensive coffee shop or restaurant or  for most  not stopping in at all  rather steep charges for late check out Just feel it could be a very good hotel if management were a little less focussed on revenue generation and a little more considerate of guests  
N => Service could be better I agree with much of the previous reviews   the location is fine but it depends on where you want to be as the city is quite spread out  It s        mins walk along a main road to get to the main restaurants and shopping sections  Some other hotels are closer to that if that s what you re looking for I also found the staff not at all willing to put themselves out   if anything was not straightforward they generally just ignored you  Partly it may have been because few spoke English but I don t think that was the only reason  The hotel seems to cater largely for Chinese businessmen   virtually all of whom seemed to smoke     so the chain smoking can be an issue in every area of the hotel  We even found that it came through the doors The rooms were comfortable although not grand    but for the price they were ok  Like some others  we couldn t adjust the airconditioning at all    we needed the window open and it was the middle of winter  Finally we thought that the restaurants ranged from average to poor and some did not have English menus  pictures or English speaking staff    fine for normal restaurants but strange for a hotel which is supposed to cater for tourists All in all  it was ok but not brilliant  I m not sure how it compares with other Beijing hotels but most of the others I ve stayed in elsewhere are considerably better  
N => Hidden costs and horrendous check in and out HAving booked a executive suite   single bed for me  my wife  friend and baby we were surprised to se our room had just   king sized bed and a cot  We changed rooms because the room was not a suite either but the only one they had  from      was a twin room which we had to pay extra for  This took about   hour  On check out we were stung again for the cost of a camp bed though we understood this was part of the new rate  Unsatisfied we complained but we got no help from the selective mute on reception  in fact she tried to charge for some food we hadn t actually taken  The pool is not available unless you have or buy a swim cap and the pool shower costs an extra   pounds per visit  I actually liked this hotel but these few incidents tarnished it  Visit beijing after      as it will be much better then  
N => Overall Comfortable Hotel   Good Value for Money My partner and I spent   nights at this hotel  We had experiences both similar to and different from those of other reviewers on this site  First  the negatives      air conditioning throughout the hotel functioned  but it was inadequate  Sometimes even hotel staff were fanning themselves from the heat      It is impossible to escape cigarette smoke  There are smokers in all of the restaurants  The non smoking sections are not effective      Hardly anyone in the hotel could speak much English  which was surprising for a   star hotel in a city the size of Beijing      The  Executive Lounge quot  was not very impressive  though the staff there were very friendly  The lounge usually filled up with cigarette smoke  Now  the positives      The staff truly have a  quot can do quot  attitude  They do try very hard    despite poor English    to make the hotel experience pleasant for guests      I stayed on the  quot Executive Floor  quot  which offers larger rooms  This is worth it      Restaurants  I had read several reviews stating that the restaurants were overpriced  I did not find this to be the case  The breakfast food was predictable but adequate  However  the Chinese restaurant in the hotel was fantastic  And what a good deal it was  Whenever we ate outside of the hotel  we became ill  We never became ill from eating inside the hotel      Location  This hotel is a walk away from the Forbidden City  Tiananmen Square  the shopping areas  and many parts  It truly is convenient  It s not perfect  Perhaps there are better hotels in Beijing  Given the issue with the air conditioning  I would prefer to stay at this hotel in the winter and another hotel in the summer  However  I found all buildings in Beijing under air conditioned  So this might not be an issue unique to the hotel  Overall  you can have a very pleasant stay at this hotel  And definitely try to the restaurants in the hotel at least once  The Chinese was my favorite  The Japanese restaurant was not as interesting as the Chinese restaurant  though it was pleasant  
N => Enjoyed Our Stay Seeing as how we normally stay in Hampton Inn type hotels when we travel in the US  we thought the Prime Hotel was great  The lobby is very attractive  the front desk staff have acceptable English skills  We somehow ended up on the VIP floor with a large room and king size bed  There is an Internet connection in the room but you need your own computer  The bed was firm  but better than some of the others we d slept on in China  Air temperature was under our control  so we were able to stay very comfortable  Beautiful bathroom  with glass shower and tub with shower  ble floors  countertops  etc  Breakfast was included with our room and had an ample sampling of Western and Chinese items  Service at breakfast was impeccable  Located on the main shopping street of Wangfujing  but about     blocks from the busiest section so noise was minimal  Able to exchange money at the desk  We were taking an overnight trip to Xian during the middle of our stay in Beijing  and they kept our luggage stored for us  Overall we were very pleased with our stay  
N => Prime hotel beijing Just returned from Prime Hotel  Beijing  We stayed on the executive floor  which was well worth paying that bit extra  Room was spotless  but the hot breakfast was always cold so we lived on bread  fruit etc  Hotel provided my wife with birthday cake  which was a nice touch  Service was good  location excellent  The only real problem we encountered was that the staff spoke very little english and it could be very frustrating trying to explain  but got there with sign language etc  We would certainly stay there again  
N => Excellent Our four night stay here was part of a tour package so I cannot comment on the cost but the hotel itself was excellent  Our room was spacious and well appointed  The bathroom was luxurious  The breakfast buffet was extensive  The staff was courteous  the doormen especially helpful with securing and directing taxis  It might have been more convenient to be closer to a metro stop but we could walk to shopping  the Forbidden City and some restaurants  Taxis are cheap enough to get anywhere else you want to go  
N => Extremely Disappointing Extremely disappointed with my stay  I found that it failed to suffice a   star rating  Mold was definitely an issue  We were immediately confronted with the moldy odor as we entered the room  Uncertain of the source  but somewhere within the cabinet where the fridge is stored  or maybe the fridge itself   I would guess  because the odor became unbearable once you open the cabinet  amp  fridge  Checked out after   nights  but originally booked it for     The service was inadequate  I did not expect the staff to be fluent in English  but spoke adequately to minimally assist you  which was more than I expected  Expect the hotel to charge you a little more of the room  including the service charge   When I made the reservation  the price was quoted in USD  Upon check out I discovered that it is the  hotel s policy  to charge you in USD and convert it to RMB according to hotel s designated conversion rate  which was more than hotel s actual selling rate or the current conversion rate   so they actually charge you more RMB for the room  thus more USD  I found this rather aggravating  given that I was already unhappy with my stay  Prior reviews have indicated that it was a good value  but I found that      night was a steep price to pay for a very disappointing stay  Although it is in a fairly central location  I found the immediate surroundings  to be a bit rundown  and there are many other hotels within close proximity that are in better locations  We stayed on the Executive floor at the Tianlun Dynasty hotel      star hotel  for less  and received significantly better service and accommodations in a better location  I was astounded by the disparity  
N => The Prime is primo I stayed at the Prime Hotel last year and agree with the positive reviews  but am not surprised at the moldy room complaint   The rooms were spacious and well appointed  The buffet breakfasts were cheap and the food was jsut fine  You walk outside the Prime and you know you are in China  unlike the more upscale hotels  which could be in any city  any country   It is a    min walk to the Forbidden City  And best of all   the price was excellent  I don t think we paid more than     per night  Our only  quot complaint quot  was that we were unable to make the staff understand that we wanted to go to any section of the Great Wall except Badaling  After two days of trying to explain that preference  we resigned ourself to going to Badaling  and it was as congested as we had read   Next time  I ll arrange it ahead of time I d stay at the Prime again in a NY minute  
N => A moldy place to stay We stayed for   days in the Prime because we wanted to  quot reward quot  ourselves after an exhausing three weeks trip across China  It was not the reward we expected  The rooms were terribly moldy and the service was bad  Whenever we entered the room we started to cough and our noses were congested   although we are not allergic   Imagine an asthmatic    Unfortunately the room was not an exception but all four rooms they showed to us had the same problem in various intensities  We had enough time to investigate the source of the mold  There is obviously no water barrier behind the wall tiles of the bathroom  Humidity enters the walls and then it gets moldy in the main room  especially behind the cupboards  Since this is a systematic problem you can expect that for all rooms in the Prime  In our country such a threat to health would be closed down The  warm  breakfast was cold and we did not get coffee or tea even after four requests  Despite all these difficiencies they ask for  quot service charges quot  for anything they do  You have to spend a whopping    Yuan basic charge for local calls  which in fact costs     Yuan if you use a public phone  or    Yuan for a flight confirmation  the first time I have been charged for that service anywhere in the world   Annoying that you are not informed about prices in advance  You have to ask the reception or you get a surprising invoice at the end Summary  Definitely not a five star hotel  And keep away from it if you want to stay healthy  
N => Good service A nice   star alternative to large multinational chain   but do not expect nothing special or local  Service is very good  Location is excellent Worth a stay  
N => A Nice Experience  
N => Good hotel  
N => The Prime was Wonderful  
N => Simply amazing hot  
N => Only fair If you can book this hotel for     or so a night  then it s probably a reasonable place to stay for a few nights in Beijing  Unfortunately its impressive exterior and its name   a socalled  international business hotel    are not matched by the interior which reminded me of the     s in Beijing  The corridors  we were on the  th floor  smelt musty  as did the room  The room was OK  the hardest bed I ve slept on since I was a student in China in the     s   though the carpet and chairs were grubby  as was the shower curtain  which one needed to put across the glass wall if one wanted a bit of privacy   The heavy glass door to the bathroom was difficult to open  particularly from the inside  Some people have commented on the good location   there are plenty of restaurants around  as there are in many places in Beijing  but it s around a    minute walk  maybe    if you hurry  from Dongzhimen metro station  underground or inexpensive taxis  We actually chose this hotel for two nights   on a short return visit to Beijing from Tokyo  before flying back to the UK  because we thought it would be closer to Dongzhimen   where the airport express train goes from  It was actually almost as cheap to take a taxi from the hotel direct to the airport  it s not far from the airport expressway    which we did  There are plenty of hotels in better locations for sightseeing etc   whether you choose to use the underground  which is modern and efficient  or the inexpensive taxis   Also  the hotel may not be as economical as it seems  While any hotels offer free internet access  with your own computer   we were charged around     a day   the alternative was to move to a more expensive room with free internet
