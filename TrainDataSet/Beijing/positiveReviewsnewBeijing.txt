P => Good hotel  great location Modern and Design hotel in the heart of Beijing       minutes walk to the forbidden city    minutes walk to shopping area  My room was clean and the service good  Obviously the staff speaks poor english but that s common in China  I would recommend a room on the court side as they are much more quieter  I tried the local tourist agent  and took a tour to the great city  If you don t mind the attempts to forced sales  again common in China   it s a good deal  I will stay there again  
P => Great Hotel Stayed here for   nights in e  The hotel is in a great location  the Forbidden City is at the end of the road  about   minutes walk  Tianamen sq is also very close by as is the shopping area     minutes walk  The staff were friendly and helpful  the room  fashion room  was spacious and modern  everything was also very clean  We tried the breakfast for one day  it was a buffet with quite a large variety but at   rmb it is quite expensive compared with what you can buy outside Overall the hotel is excellent value for money and I would definitely stay here again  
P => Unbeatable  We had two nights here on our own after a three night paid for stay at the plush Beijing Shangrila  This was just what we wanted  In the heart of the historic centre  with the Forbidden City a   minute walk away and Tiananmen Square not much more  Also minutes away was the upmarket shopping area of Wanfujing with excellent malls and great food  including the not to be missed Quanjude Roast Duck restaurant  The famous Snack Street is just around the corner with snake  dragon fly  scorpion  silk worm  and run of the mill fish and fowl  fruit and vegetables on the menu The hotel is shiny  clean and modern  Our twin room was spacious with lots and lots of cupboard space  large bathroom  robes  slippers  electronic safe   all the mod cons  Only minusno free tea and coffee in the room  The facilities were there  from kettle to the sachets of milk and sugar  but all chargeable  Luckily we knew this rom previous Tripadvisor reviews so we carried our own  Oh yes  While the bathrooms and cupboards lit up very brightly  the light in the room was a little dim  not good enough to read comfortably  But no matter  We weren t in Beijing to read  The staff was excellent  With passable English  always attentive and smiling and helpful with directions  Previous reviews suggest they aren t too forthcoming with nearby restaurant recommendations  No wonder  We found the Chinese eateries across the hotel rip offs  Definitely charging more than double for the English language menus The exception being Grandma s Kitchen for a European menu with free delivery for a minimum order of    yuan  Try them for breakfast  The hotel s rate is    yuan for middling fare  The Reception gives out the hotel s card with its address in Chinese and a small list of phrases one might need to use  English for us  Chinese equivalent opposite  Very handy  I loved this place  Hated leaving  Made our trip to Beijing a happy one  
P => Pleasant Hotel in Amazing Amazing Location Hotel Kapok is in an unbelievable location  Its just a   minute walk to the Forbidden City    mins to Tiananmen Square  and   mins to one of the longest shopping streets in the inner city district  Very affordable at just    US a night  the American restaurant downstairs offers delicious food at great prices  Check in was seamless but concierge is a bit brisk in patience when asking about recommendations for restaurants to eat at outside the hotel  or asking about finding certain places  A tour company has a stand by the elevators so arranging tours is efficient and relatively inexpensive although I negotiated with them on prices for a   person personal tour  saving    rmb each  and later realized that other companies in the area are still      rmb or so cheaper  They were very prompt and accomodating when we wanted to make fequent and sometimes lengthy stops for photos though  so it all worked out in the end Rooms were quite large and everything was clean  Basic amenities such as soap  shampoo  toothbrush comb  vanity set and hair dryer are provided  Internet is complimentary and house keeping is meticulous  although I was upset when they  quot put up quot  some of my clothing and personal items and I couldn t find them around at first   The bed is slightly on the hard side  but after sight seeing and walking all day  you barely notice it The hotel seems older compared to the new hotels around  but for price and location  it simply can t be beat  Do note that many of the taxi drivers did not seem to know where it is located  because so many are new to the city   so be sure to bring a visual map around for them when out and about or when coming from the airport  Or simply have them drop you off at the corresponding gate at the Forbidden city and walk the block or so back  
P => Mysterious but Elegant The exterior of the hotel is a bit mysterious as it seems to be an overlay of a greenish glass lattice over an older concrete structure  The entrance does not look like a hotel entrance but an office entrance  That said  once inside it is quite nice  There is a simple and elegant European flair to the interior design  dark hardwood floors  Single room was smallish but very clean and comfortable  Suite size room was great  Service was very friendly  Lacks a real restaurant or even a functional coffee shop  but as it is near Wangfujing there are many choices nearby  Glad I stayed and would certainly stay again  
P => Shhh don t tell anyone about this place    I ve been very fortunate over the years to stay in a lot of very nice hotels with work  all over the world  This time it was my own money  However  I can honestly say that this is one of the nicest hotels i ve ever stayed in  It s very very rare that i m sad enough to take photos of my hotel room  but i was blown away at how cool it was  Very modern design  glass throughout  and a glass bathroom  Everyone that s seen photos has been agog  and these are friends who work in design media and are used to  trendy   Plus  it s close to Wangfujing  and close to the forbidden city and Tiann men square There s free wifi in the lobby  the food is excellent  the staff very friendly  I was beaming for most of my stay there    The best thing is i paid     a night for a courtyard room  For the quality of the hotel  i d pay      happily    I overheard a number of other guests raving about it as well   Very very pleased indeed  
P => Great Location Great Style After getting a great deal on Expedia for a Fashion Suite  US       we where so happy to find a hotel that lived up to all the hype  The room was huge  with a great walk in robe and huge bathroom with a very large round bath  As written in most reviews the beds are hard  but after all the walking you will do  you will tend to sleep on anything  The computer in the room was great for looking up travel sites whilst in Beijing and searching for directions to places The staff are all very friendly and helpful  I probably would not bother with the breakfast as there are so many local places to eat in Beijing for next to nothing  The location of the Kapok is possible the best in Beijing  You can actually walk to the Forbidden Palace as it is only about     metres down the road  The main shopping strip of Beijing and the night food markets are also very close by Overall if you are thinking of booking here I would say do it before word gets out and everyone wants to stay here  
P => Ready for the Olympics I travelled to this hotel with my husband and    month old daughter  We booked directly with the hotel to ensure we got a cot for the baby  and they were prepared to match the lowest available price we had found  we paid    RMB for a double  no breakfast   We could have paid extra and gotten one breakfast thrown into the price  but there is no need   there are so many little shops and restaurants around   including the standard fast food places in a busy shopping mall about   minutes walk away We were very pleasantly surprised when  on arrival  we could check in prior to the usual check in time  and were upgraded to a suite for no extra cost  The suite was on the second floor and I worried about the street noise  but there was no problem in the end  While you can hear a few cars  there is very little noise at night The suite was comfortable and spacious  One thing I was concerned about was the glassed bathroom   but there are two sets of curtains  block out on the inside and privacy curtains on the outside of the glass wall of the bathroom   so if you are travelling with someone who needs privacy  this can be assured  We used the curtain at night when we didn t want to wake our daughter with bright light Another bonus was a free internet connection in the room  the suite provided a computer   There was tea and coffee making facilities but no free tea or coffee   so bring some  or buy some in the many tea shops  if you want to save some money  There is a little shop just across the road where we got drinks and milk for the baby The staff are friendly and all speak some English The only downsides were  a very hard bed  I am getting used to this in this part of the world  and the fact that our credit card deposit had been lost when we were checking out  So far there has been no unexpected charge on our credit card  but I am keeping my eye on our account  just in case  
P => Excellent location   modern hotel I can only subscribe to what the other travellers have said about the KAPOK  The location is great if you want to tackle all sightseeing spots in central Beijing  Forbidden City  Tienanmen etc  The Hotel rooms have nice and modern furnishing  bathrooms are striking  Downside is the WLAN connections not working and the PC available in each Room only being able to display Windows messages  boxes in Mandarin  The beds are hard    as others have mentioned which is the only downside If you plan to leave for business trips to areas outside the first   rings in the early morning  expect heavy morning traffic and bear in mind that your taxi trip from the KAPOK may take quite a long time due  We ended up taking the METRO at WANFUJIN after havint been resufed by several taxis to take us to Ring   due to the congestions  
P => Excellent Hotel Great Value Amazing Location We just finished our   nights at this hotel  and it is really top notch excellent  There are many factors that make this one of the top hotels in Beijing  First  the location is outstanding  just   minute walk to Forbidden City and      minutes to Tiananmen Square  In the opposite direction  you walk for   minutes  and you re in the commercial center of Beijing  Despite the central location  the hotel is on a quiet street with not a lot of noise  There is a bicycle rental place just across the river    minutes walk   so if you want to do a bicycle tour  it s very easy  Also  there is a really great massage place and spa just   minute walk towards the Forbidden City  where you can get anything from Chinese to Foot massage at very good prices  we payed an equivalent of US     for   hour Chinese massage  which by the way is kind of harsh but interesting to experience  Second  the rooms are spectacular  We booked a basic double but got upgraded to a suite on the  th floor and it was completely   stars  including a computer with connection to fast internet  flat screen tv  a large spa sized bathtub  and an overall clean and deluxe finish  The bed was maybe a bit hard  but that s not much of a complaint  The hotel overall is very clean and stylish Finally  the staff are very helpful and friendly  They helped us arrange a car to the Great Wall  and the price they gave us was actually the same as what Lonely Planet quotes as a minimum  By the way  if you re planning to see the GW  go early in the morning  we left at  am  and head south on the wall when you get to Badaling  We did this and had the wall all to ourselves for   hours  It was magical  By the time we were coming back  the tour buses have just pulled up  and there were literally thousands of people there  Overall  I highly recommend Kapok  In fact  if I ever came back to Beijing  I would not stay anywhere else  This one is a gem  
P => Good boutique hotel in BJ I recommend this hotel to fellow travellers  Very good location for seeing the main sights  Friendly staff whose English is a lot better than my Mandarin  but not perfect  We had our  yr old daughter with us and the hotel provided a  baby bed      standard collapsible baby cot w  bedding     without hesitation  Rooms are decent size  good shower  very clean and modern decor  Really nothing to complain about  so perhaps I should give it    s  On making the reservation  I called the hotel and negotiated the quoted rate down a little over      Our rate strangely included breakfast for   person per day although we were   adults  As we were staying for   nights I asked at check in if we could have our breakfast for   persons on the same which was readily agreed to  There is a collection of small shops and food shacks across the road where we took our other breakfast  I feel the hotel provides very good value and a pleasant experience  I stay at the Westin when in BJ on business but if I came for another holiday weekend I would stay again at the Kapok  
P => Couldn t Find Fault I ve just spent a week in the Kapok Hotel in Beijing and would highly recommend the hotel to anyone who wants a peaceful retreat in the heart of the city  The staff all spoke good English  very unusual but extremely useful over there  were polite and cheerful and went out of their way to be helpful  It s a boutique hotel with    rooms and would suit couples  single travellers or buisiness people I was upgraded to a deluxe room free of charge  without asking and would recommend this grade if you can afford it  The room was huge and contained a relaxing area with   sofas and a coffee table  a long desk with a computer  flat screen monitor  there s fast  free internet usage in all rooms in the hotel  and flat screen TV  a refreshment centre  well stocked fridge  glass shelves  kettle and an area to make drinks etc all enclosed behind double doors   a huge bed  a bedside table and   other low tables with large table lamps  The bathroom was amazing  It was separated from the bedroom by a wall of glass and a glass door  no problems with privacy as there were curtains on the inside and outside of the glass   It had a circular  freestanding bath measuring     metres in diameter  a matching circular wash basin and circular toilet  plus a separate shower unit  There was a linen basket to drop towels in if you want them changed  weighing scales  seems standard in China     stools and the bathroom was large enough to need   waste bins  Everything  without exception  in the room was modern  stylish  carefully designed  spacious and well thought out  It was a pleasure to spend time in the room and in the hotel in general The lobby  bar  restaurant  gym and other areas were similarly stunningly designed and I m sure feng shui was high on their list of priorities when the hotel was built  Breakfast and other meals in the hotel were excellent too and  of course  the service was impeccable I ve thought hard  but can t actually think of any ways in which the hotel could be improved  The hotel is in a quiet part of the street      metres or so from the side of the Forbiden City  has a famous night food market at the other end of the street   minutes  walk away and is   or   minutes  walk from the main shopping area of Wangfujing and the Oriental Plaza  so it s not far from a lively area with plenty to do in the evenings  I felt very safe walking around the area at night I can highly recommend the Dragonfly Spa  a   minutes walk down the road towards the Forbidden City and open until  am  It s also mentioned in various travel guides and I was glad to have had massages there  They re very professional but very cheap compared with British prices If you re wondering where to stay in Beijing  don t hesitate to book this hotel   you won t regret it  
P => Cream of the Crop Kapok rises to the top  This review is fresh off the oven  having returned from china only this morning  Kapok is without doubt  a great hotel  situated minutes from the forbidden city and tianamen square  It is one of those boutique hotels which break away from the norms set by bigger chains  so if you re looking for something like the sheraton or the crown plaza etc  this is not the hotel for you However if you re looking for a complete and might i add  positive change  then Hotel Kapok is the place to stay  From outside  it has a modest appearance  but the minute you step inside the hotel  you know you ve made the right choice  Built by a famed architect  its built on minimalistic lines  and the use of cubes and spaces and lights is brilliant  We stayed in a fashion room  and had a balcony as well  not that we ever used it  but it was there  and aesthetically pleasing it was  The washroom is another one of kapok s trump cards  being built entirely of glass  and that too see through  so watch out  somebody s watching you   In general  there is a massive problem of communication in beijing if you don t know chinese  and kapok was no exception  However  the staff was very helpful  and did whatever we asked of them  without much fuss  the only issue was that we had to patiently explain to them what we wanted if there is one thing we missed at the hotel  then it was a buffet breakfast  but that s not a point deducted  just a point not won To cap it all  kapok is a brilliantly designed hotel  and a great place to come back to  after a hectic day s walking  sightseeing and shopping in Beijing  
P => Okey hotel to stay I chose this hotel  cause I was very interested in     ranking hotel among over     hotels in BJ at the rather economical price Pls dont expect something like Penninsula or Regentwhich are ranking below this hotel at Tripadvisor combecause you dont pay that much For those who travel very often worldwide can accept this hotel but for those who prefer fancy things would feel this is NOT a right hotel to stay It is clean  but since the hotel is based on white color andhas already been years since open  you might find it shabbyjust after you enter the lobby But you have to recall that you are not paying enough moneyto overcome your expectation The room is okey as well It s not big   but since the bedroom and bathroom are devided with glass  it looks bigger than it actually is The bed is very hard  and the pillows are very poor Free internet is an advantage if you bring along your own pc Oh  by the way  I dont know why they dont provide tissues The staffs are friendly  but not so much as hotels in BKK The breakfast is also okey with variety of dishesfrom chinese to western The location is good  close to sightseeing spots like Palace or Peoples Square  and close to shopping area After all  the hotel is average  considering the price Am I too severe  I would choose other hotels if the price gets higher  
P => Excellent hotel in great location MY TRAVEL STYLE  I hate business hotels and strongly prefer resorts that resemble the Four Seasons  Aman  and Oberoi but try to find similar properties at lower cost  I seek out the  wow  experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews  by clicking on my name  LOCATION  Perfect     minutes walking distance from Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square    minutes walking to a very high end mall  Restaurants surround the hotel  TYPE OF ROOM  Fashion SuiteBED SHEETS PILLOW  Bed is on the hard side with good quality linens that were brand new and should hopefully get softer with use  Pillows are medium thickness and fine LIGHTING  Tons of lighting in both bedroom and bathroom  Didn t like that the light switch lights  so you can see where they are at night  light up too brightly when trying to sleep BATHROOM SHOWER  Incredible in the suite  Round tub is excellent and the shower has medium shower pressure with the hot water never running out  Towels are of excellent quality TOILETRIES  Good  nothing too special  but fine CLEANLINESS  The entire room and hotel is very cleanA C  A C and heat works quietly and quickly would get the room warm or cool CLOSET SPACE  Walk in closet is one of the most impressive seen in any hotel  Huge STYLE OF ROOM  Contemporary and beautiful  Wouldn t change much here  The room has floor to ceiling windows and runs for wall to wall  impressive QUIET MORNING LIGHT  The room was very quiet with the exception of music that would play during the daytime from across the street  Almost sounded like being next to a nightclub but not as loud  If you require complete silence  you may have better luck asking for a room away from the street that is in front of the hotel  Curtains would block out all morning sun light FOOD  We only had room service which was mediocre  pizza  amp  soup   Would suggest ordering from Grandma s kitchen one block away with free delivery TV INTERNET  TV is flat screen and of good size for the room  About     channels in English including a few movie channels  Internet is very fast and included at no charge  via wire only   There is a computer in our room if you don t have laptop with you  SERVICE  Staff are very helpful with good enough English to answer any of your travel questions  We were very disappointed with the housekeeping that wouldn t replace towels  clean very well  and replace toiletries often enough COMMON AREA  Exterior of building is not so nice but the lobby is good with a semi hip feel to the environment  There is a bar in the lobby and places to hang out but I would rather spend my time in the beautiful fashion suite or some of the nicer bars in Beijing with better atmosphere  No pool  The gym equipment looked new  but the location is strange since it is out in the open in the dark basement below  but the gym is lighted well   ROOM  amp  CITY TIPS  There is a travel agent in the basement that can provide tours and airline train tickets  Definitely splurge for the fashion suite as it is a very worthwhile upgrade  If you don t have breakfast included  Grandma s kitchen is a   minute walk away and has western style breakfast  they deliver at n c too   Also  there is a starbucks at the oriental plaza mall  basement of the mall on the right side once you cross the main pedestrian path   Booking through a source other than the hotel provided us with half price rooms  
P => Amazing Hotel in perfect location This hotel was unexpectedly AWESOME  Our suite was amazing  large  dark wood floors  contemporarily decorated and furnished  computer w  internet in our room  flat screen TV  and a bathroom to die for      all glass walls overlooking street  glass walls in bathroom  and a soup bowl bath tub    about    round  amp         deep and a great shower   even the standard rooms are very nice  the breakfast was interesting with both local and western selections  the staff was helpful  the location was the reason i selected the hotel  thank you trip advisor  as it is only   blocks from the Forbidden City and about   blocks from Tiannenman Square  Several cafes on both of the streets to choose from which we did    with interesting and pleasing results     
P => Winner  Stayed at Kapok from ch             and we loved it  The Hotel is modern  sleek and very stylish  It has a unique sense of style not typical of a Chinese hotel  Hotel staff can speak a bit of english and are friendly  We booked through the internet and got a fashion room for     CNY per night   The room has a king sized bed  fits   guests of asian built  and a see through bathroom made of transparent glass  No need to worry though  they made sure curtains are available to cover the whole bathroom and give privacy to the user  The best thing about this hotel is its location  Positioned in the middle of Wangfujing and the Forbidden City  both tourist spots are walking distance away       minutes   Night Food Strip is also nearby for the adventure eaters  Scorpions and silk worms are among the most exotic ones I saw  
P => Great hotel  When we were in Beijing we started by staying in a typical old fashioned court yard hotel  However our second day walking around the city we accidently walked by Kopac hotel and were intrigued by the interesting facade of the building  We asked to see one of the rooms and decided directly to leave our other hotel and move to Kopac  The rooms are new  modern and clean  The bathroom in my room was pretty  quot cool quot  with only glass walls  There are curtains to give you privacy however they are still see through  So if you are not comfortable sharing  quot private quot  moments with your room mate than ask for a room that has a bathroom with at least one  quot real quot  wall   The beds are very hard  I love hard beds however my travel companion was having a hard time sleeping   The staff spoke sufficient english and were friendly and helpful  The location was great with walking distant to many interesting parts of the city This was probably one of the best hotels I have stayed in  
P => Really nice hotel      Stayed here in uary and thought it was a great hotel  We had a suite and it was a really good size with lovely sofas and big bed  albeit a bit hard    The bathroom was fabulous and had the biggest bath I had ever seen  Location was great   walking distance to Forbidden City and Tianamen Square and frequent taxis to take us anywhere further Staff were really helpful in helping us with directions etc  
P => Great location This hotel is an excellent choice for tourists  The location is right in the center of all the activities for active travelers  Wangfujing street is the main shopping area for tourists and it is right next to the Forbidden City   My wife and I walked to Tianenmen Sq  Forbidden City  Beihai Park  and several other parks in the area   The hotel is unexceptional on the outside but inside it is very modern and clean  The rooms are unique with all the glass and mirrors and lights  A real treat    Broadband internet was free also  along with one complimentry buffet breakfast   The staff were very helpful getting me a taxi to the Great Wall at a good price and an excellent driver  The same driver took me to the airport for an early departure also  The bottom floor has an excellent gym and travel agency which got me overnite tickets to Shanghai  The staff at the hotel desk even let us leave some of our baggage in their storeroom while we were gone for a few days until we returned  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Great stay at the Kapok This was a generally pleasant stay for us  certainly different in character to the otel Peace Beijing  where we stayed for the earlier part of our trip  The location is excellent  in a quieter area  yet a stone s throw to the Forbidden City and Wangfujing shopping areas  Although sitting in an older building  the hotel interior is totally refurbished and spanking new  The modern  boutique style will sit well with younger travelers and those averse to the overblown and faded grandeur of the older hotels  Reception and related service was excellent  very friendly and helpful although we did have to speak in Chinese to be very effective  The business centre was terrible however   the staff was un knowledgeable to the extreme  and although polite  lacked any sort of initiative and helpfulness The rooms are clean cut with modern layout  interesting all glass bathroom   and space was adequate  Overall very comfortable and squeaky clean surroundings  Contrary to previous reviews  the heating in our room worked extremely well  unlike in other hotels in Beijing we stayed in  Some of my fellow travelers complained that the lighting was slightly too dim  sacrificing functionality for design   Opposite the hotel are several local food shops  which are great for an early and authentic breakfast  The Donghuamen Night ket just down the street is a great evening experience  Spa lovers shouldn t miss Dragonfly Spa just a few doors away   fantastic massages at a very reasonable priceI would recommend this hotel for younger travelers and those who are pretty self sufficient  i e  do not need the huge breakfasts etc of hotel chains   Do remember to bring the hotel card everywhere you go  and use the Donghuamen night market as a reference for taxi drivers who will not know this hotel     of the time  
P => Fashionably Fabulous Date of Stay  ober    to ember       Room Type  Yard RoomUpgrade  noneAmount Paid Per Night  RMB                Reservation Method  Tour Operator in BeijingLoyalty Card  noneAirport Hotel Transfer  Didn t need hotel transfer because I m just moving from the Grand Hyatt to join my friends here Location  Located at the end of Donghuamen Road  Almost at the eastern wall of the Forbidden City and about   blocks away from Wangfujing road and if you re hungy at night there is the Donghuamen Road foodie stalls Check in  Quick check in  only very few staff speaks English but they do get by  I came in at  am and they were able to get me a room immediately  Room  Quite big  it had its own garden to your left when you enter the door  there is a door but in winter its really not a good idea to stay out  A long narrow hallway opens up to a nice bedroom with an illuminated headboard  TV is quite small and channels are VERY limited  Free Broadband Internet  good closet space and glass enclosed bathroom  with curtains if you want some privacy Bed  The bed was HARD  in fact hard might still be an understatement  The pillows were hard too  But after a long days worth of walking its still a good place to sleep on  Breakfast  Breakfast was okay  they had traditional Chinese breakfast and some sausages  and toast very adequate  Check out  Check out was fast  I forgot something in my room and the housekeeping staff was quick to take it down  Overall Evaluation  A good hotel to stay in if you re on a budget  It s very chic but some cabbies don t exactly know where it is so you might have some problems getting back to your hotel  
P => Kapok was great   After reading the reviews  I ve booked this hotel on sinohotel com   seemed to have the best rate for this hotel  We ve reserved   rooms at this hotel  they ended up upgrading   of our basic room to a courtyard room  The hotel and the rooms were very clean  everything is new  modern trendy  free internet and at least   staff knew how to speak english per shift  The bathroom is a see through window  however  there s curtains you can close around the bathroom  looks very trendy   The staff there were all very helpful  My family just loved this hotel for the price we paid

P => Highly recommended   what a great place  On the recommendation of a friend  I stayed at Kelly s Courtyard for two nights after a business trip to Zhengzhou The place is quiet  clean and comfortable  Comfortable rooms  great staff  a nice rooftop terrace for relaxing  and free wireless  Though a little hard to find for the uninitiated   have the Chinese address written out and ask locals if you are having trouble   it s well worth seeking out  When I return to Beijing  I will return to Kelly s Courtyard  
P => Small  We checked in at Kelly s courtyard in the afternoon of      The location is a bit hard to find but once we got inside the place we felt it was worth it  This   rooms accommodation is tastefully decorated  quiet and really cozy  They put jazzy ambient music on all day   which is lovely  For the bedrooms  they re rather small yet they re all clean and tidy  good enough for what we paid for  What best about this place is their hospitality  The staffs  especially e I must say  treated us like a family rather than hotel visitors  My partner fell ill when we first arrived so later that night I had to go up to e  asking for some medicine  What I m impressed is that she took this matter very seriously  We discussed for long about the symptoms  and finally e decided to bring me to a pharmacy nearby  helping me in every possible way to get the right medicines  for the fact that I don t speak a word of mandarin  it s such a peace of mind to have some local assist like that  So thank you e  I can t thank you enough  Next time we visit Beijing  I m sure we will meet again

P => A haven of tranquility We stayed for a week and can only reiterate what the other reviewers have said  The helpfulness of the staff in pointing us towards the required buses and so on was a big contribution to our enjoyment of Beijing  It is a five minute walk to the main street  buses and taxis  and a subway line from t       but that just adds to the experience  You are a bit away from the main touristy areas  thought they are easy to get to  and can get a feel for ordinary Beijing life  if that s what you want  
P => Unexpected Oasis  This place was obviously designed and furnished with great love  care and attention to detail  You could imagine someone who s an interior designer or architect thinking one day   quot I want to transform a siheyuan  courtyard house  in a hutong  blending traditional elements with modern comforts  showcasing all the great pieces of art  handicraft and furniture I ve accumulated from all my travels   and I want to share this place with visitors to Beijing  quot The rooms surround a glass covered  tree shaded courtyard filled with chinoiserie  a carp filled pond and potted plants    it s a really nice place to take your breakfast or read  World music is sometimes played played unobtrusively  A spiral staircase leads up to a mezzanine reading TV internet lounge  through which you ll find the sunny roof terrace complete with deck tables and umbrellas My room was not large but well appointed  with a contemporary glass walled bathroom  Like most of the other rooms  it looks and opens into the courtyard  Included in the room rate  breakfast is a simple affair    a spread of toast  pastries  milk  yogurt and juice  with coffee and tea  But it became quite pleasant because it is taken in the courtyard  plus I thought the coffee was particularly good The staff was really polite and gracious  but what struck me the most was their consideration for not disturbing guests  I arrived early at   am  and they welcomed me in hushed tones  asking me to speak softly as the other guests were not up yet  You might think this is hardly worth the mention but if you ve stayed in a siheyuan  or similarly a riyadh in Morocco   you ll realise that sounds carry very easily in such confined spaces Although located in a hutong  it s not too hard to find and a shopping hub  with shops like H amp M and a cineplex  is just   or   bus stops away near the Xidan subway station The only small issue I took was the common toilet which I used on arrival at the hotel    it was smelling pretty funky  Perhaps they hadn t cleaned it from the day before  but in any case  they should clean it more regularly  Also  laundry charges are pretty steep    they don t actually handle it but just help you send it to a nearby laundromat  
P => Small but perfectly formed  Stayed here for five nights in il and can t recommend it highly enough  Whilst not too near the underground  though there will be one nearby soon  you can easily get around to all the major sights by bus  and the owners will helpfully point you in the right direction  Its a short walk from here to The Forbidden City and the Beihai Houhai area Rooms are spotlessly clean and well equipped  and the roof terrace is lovely for drinks in the afternoon  evening Having been to Beijing before and stopped in uninspiring five star hotels it was lovely to stay in somewhere more atmospheric with staff  owners that genuinely care that you have a good stay  We will be back again  
P => Nicer Than Home Our family of five plus sister in law stayed at Kelly s Courtyard during the Olympics  As it is located in a hutong area  you have to walk down three alleys to get there  Until you see the front door of Kelly s you are wondering where in the world you are going as two steps past the door is a concrete wall with nowhere to go  But the place is truly charming  Highlights include a glassed in courtyard  an outdoor deck and an upstairs lounge   quot John quot  and Kelly are very friendly and very helpful  It is an easy walk to the Xidan shopping area  There are many  many buses which you can take down to the main subway line     or    for that matter  if you don t want to make the    minute walk We had done a lot of planning in advance as to how to get around Beijing to the various Olympic venues  But John always asked where we were going and usually suggested a better way to get there We couldn t have found a better place  
P => One of the worst hotel experiences ever Fair warning  this review is going to run long  I checked into Kempinski Beijing with my girlfriend in late ober because the price and location combination offered through Gtahotels com was pretty good  We have had breakfast at this hotel once before and my girlfriend like it  So we expected a decent stay  However  the nightmare started as soon as we started checking in  Since the booking was done online  the front desk staff couldn t find the reservation  and we were told to comeback in a few hours  I didn t make much of this  and went off shopping with my girlfriend  When we came back later  we were given a room on the non smoking floor   th floor to be exact   As soon as we sat down on the bed we knew something was funny  The room seemed dated  and the carpet looked old  but the bed and everything else seemed clean  Well  not so quick  The bed literally sank  And as you run your hands on the bed  you could feel the springs popping  This is one saggy bed that has seen its day and should have been retired a long time ago  The girlfriend tried to lay down  and it sagged further  There is just no way this bed is going to do  not for any hotel  not to mention a   star hotel  At this point the girlfriend is starting to get agitated  I promptly called the front desk and was told all the beds in the hotels are of the same quality  but they would despatch a housekeeping staff to look into it Upon arrival  the housekeeping staff informed us  yes  this is indeed an old bed and confirmed the rest of the hotel is going to be no better  It was clearly an attempt to dissuade us from switching rooms  She then suggested perhaps they can bring up a piece of wood board to fit underneath the mattress to reduce the sagging  I reluctantly agreed  So a few minutes later a big piece of plywood board shows up  But the board is only big enough to fit half of the bed  and it would mean one of us will still have to sleep on the sagging side  The board helped a little  but it was far from desirable  The housekeeping staff left without offering anymore help  Needless to say my girlfriend was not pleased  and it turned into a fight between us  By this time  it was already late in the night  and I wanted to be able to sleep  So on a lark  I decided to reserve another room to see if there is indeed as the hotel suggested  all the same  Of course  this meant online reservation and more waiting for the front desk to confirm  As it turned out  the hotel was fully booked  and I was given a room on the executive floor for the same price    th floor   As soon as I waked into the room  I set down on the bed and felt an immediate difference  While not the best quality bed I have experienced  but it was firm and seemed ordinary  at least befitting a   star quality hotel  You can imagine I was furious at this point  I would have no qualms of paying more money for a better bed or a better room  but it took me booking another room just to find out  The staff at the hotel either didn t care  or simply lied  At this point  my girlfriend was even more upset  She called the front desk and asked to speak to the manager  The front desk manager Ms  Dun told her once again that all the beds are the same  and there should be no difference  My girlfriend demanded the manager to come up to the rooms and compared the beds for herself  Ms  Dun reluctantly showed up later  but she simply refused to even touch the bed  and continued to state that as staff  they don t sleep on the beds  so therefore there is no way for them to tell the difference  As far as she was concerned  they are all the same  My girlfriend was not going to let her off the hook  and she demanded to speak to Ms  Dun s boss  This is now almost  am in the morning  and miraculously some lady got on the phone  She was apologetic  and she offered to cancel the reservation on the room with the bad bed  and suggested she would like to apologize in person the next day  Of course  no one contacted us the next day  Although we intended to stay for only   nights  I had to head back to US for business after   nights  and my girlfriend wanted to stay for   more nights  Due to the fact Gtahotels com reservations are all pre paid  which means I have already paid   nights  I thought a simply reservation change for the dates would do  But after numerous phone calls  and much discussion with the hotel front desk amounted to nothing  As part of the challenges of traveling in China  if there is changes for hotels or flights  it is incredibly difficult or frustrating because the hotels and airlines in China follow a very rigid reservation system that cannot be changed on the fly  To keep things simple  I offered to leave and pre sign a credit charge slip with the front desk with my credit card so when my girlfriend checks out there would be no problems  All the charges would go on my name  I explained this to two different front desk managers  Mr  Dun and Barry  And I was told there will be no problems whatsoever  my girlfriend would be taken care and treated with respect I think you can guess by now what happened next  When my girlfriend was checking out  she explained the situation to the front desk clerks  And she was told flatly no  that she would have to pay  Regardless the fact they even have the pre authorized credit card slip with my signature on it  After back and forth for    minutes  the clerk yelled at her and told her  quot you have to pay  quot  in front of other guests  She was made to feel like a thief  Seeing she was going to be late for her flight  she stood her ground and left  Kempinski is a worldwide chain of luxury hotels and resorts  and it operates two properties in Beijing area  But this kind of rude and inconsistent service is appalling  I understand and expect lousy and subpar service from some Chinese operated hotels  but for a western company  this is utter unbelievable  I will not quibble with the equipment and hardware with a hotel if the service and attitude can make up for it  But for an older  rundown joint  this is simply acceptable  I travel to Beijing and China on a monthly basis  and have stayed in Grand Hyatt  Regent  China World  Kerry Center and the Pennisula  but none is as remotely bad as Kempinski  I wonder if the fact that I a Chinese American that has led them to treat us this way  Regardless  I will never ever stay at a Kempinski property again  and I will keep telling others this story so they will stay away as well  
P => Great hotel with very friendly staff I went to Beijing to visit a friend and to explore what Beijing has to offer I decided to stay at the Kempinski Lufthansa Centre after my friend s recommended me this hotel Considering the fact that it is an old hotel it still has it s charm and with the service from the staff  it s great As I arrived to the hotel I went directly for Brunch and wow  I had so much food I almost felt sick  Food ranging from Cantonese BBQ to German traditional Bratwurst and a huge dessert buffet  I didn t know where to start  They also offer a huge breakfast buffet for those who enjoy a nice breakfast in the morning  like me  They also have a Kempi Deli  Paulaner  German food   Dragon Palace  chinese food  and a japanese restaurant  The staff were very polite and friendly  if you think that they don t speak English in China then you are wrong  atleast in this hotel  More or less all staff I ran into spoke english and if they didn t they said  quot Just a moment pls quot  and asked a fellow colleague to help me  Much better than the staff at Westin who were unfriendly and couldn t even smile   I mean they make an effort to help me which should be appreciated The hotel is located close to the subway and is in a nice district  Plus if you need to do some shopping you can just go to the Lufthansa Shoppig Centre which is  quot attached quot  to the hotel I stayed   days    nights and I truely do not regret it  If you want value for your money and friendly staff with quality service then you should stay here Highly recommended  
P => Nice hotel amd good location The room and bathroom was good but in need of some renovating  The staff spoked  for China  good English  The breakfast was ok  very busy area and hard to get a non smoking table  The location was good even tho we had a personal driver through all our stay  Close by the hotel there is a shopping mall and a couple of restaurants  Across the street you can find a subway station  Since there is a lot of business travelers the bar is a frequent meeting point which is good  
P => Good hotel shame about the internet Like a few little stones in your comfortable walking shoes that spoil a beautiful walk  there are a few things that are highly irritating about this place  Overall the Beijing Kempinski is a pretty good place to stay  the   bedroom we re in is spacious  The decor looks pleasant but lived in  The beds are large and comfortable  the towels large and plentiful  A definite bonus is being able to open the windows  In room dining brings great meals from the various restaurants in the complex  which up to know have always been fresh  tasty and plenty big portioned  The buffet breakfast is literally a smorgasbord of east meets west  Service is occasionally a bit patchy  after   times a week for   weeks having gone for breakfast there they still ask you wether you want to sit in the smoking or non smoking section and that is on entering with   year old twins  The top floor swimmingpool    gyms and the supermarket  shopping mall and various service businesses could cause you to never leave the complex  If you want to leave however  the entrance to the efficient  but busy  Beijing metro is next to the hotel or a lot of entertainment and shopping can be had within walking distance  And for a bit of fresh air the courtyard garden is lovely  nearby Chaoyang Park is a    minute walk for as much space one could want in a city of    million  Now to those stoney irritations  The internet  The hotel positions itself as great for business and leisure  Having a good broadband connection is a prerequisite for this I think  All I am getting is excuses and dial up speeds  After the initial pause chinese censors perhaps   the pages take a long time to load  When running a broadband speedtest  by Ookla  I get download speeds as low as    KB sec transfer rates and upload speeds that are   times faster    I m used MB s per sec so this simply unacceptable to me  The hotel keeps increasing my theoretical possible speed  in reality nothing improves Our apartment has   showers  two are poky and one is over  a smallish  bath  None will let you have a shower without flooding the bathroom floor  If humankind can get astronauts into space and back easily then a leak free shower shouldn t be this hard  
P => Did I miss something other reviewers didn t    This hotel needs a renovation and is overpriced for what you get  the rooms are older  bed needs upgrading  amenities non existent 
P => one of the best Hotels in Beijing During our lovely honey moon trip in China we have spent   days at the Kempinski Hotel Lufthansa Centre  Me and my wife have enjoyed our stay very much  Very helpful and friendly employees  nice atmosphere  cozy apartment and excellent food We could highly recommend the hotel restaurant   Dragon Palace  were we have experienced a very tasty trdaitional food and wine for competitive price  accomponied by the traditional chinese music  Quite interesting was to try original German food and beer at the Paulaner bar  Sitting outside in the garden  drinking very good beer after a tasteful meal we almost felt like beeing at some  quot Biergarten quot  in Germany   The breakfast buffet at Kranzler Restaurant had big choice of international and local dishes The staff of the hotel made us feeling like VIP guests  helped us with anything they could do and made our stay unforgetable  For business or vacation we do recommend this hotel to anyone who goes to Beijing and we will for sure come back again  
P => Closest to Airport Good amenities Beautiful lobby I arrived the Kempinski around  pm  after a short       minute    RMB  ride from the airport  Perfect since I was only staying there for a oine night layover Was greeted at the entrance by the bellman  who took care of my luggage  Check in was quick and the staff was friendly  The bellman immediately accompanied me to my room       and explained to me the various facilities on the way My room was on the ninth floor with a view to the south  nothing really to see   mostly construction   The room was very spacious and has a desk  The furniture felt new and clean  There is a good selection on TV channels     Chinese     International incl  CNN  TV   ESPN     I walked around to the Lufthansa Shopping Center  which really is a department store  not a shopping mall   The store carries mostly European and US brands  Armani  Ralph Lauren  Nike     so that was a disappointment for me  The swimming pool is located on the   th floor  nice swimming pool but the locker and shower facilities could use a renovation  AGain  the staff was very polite The hotel offers    hr room service  The meals I ordered arrived after   min and were excellent  The next morning  the breakfast in the Kranzer restaurant was excellent  They carried a mi of western  eggs  bacon  fruit  and asian  dim sum  congee      The price for breakfast was around    RMB lt  which is very expensive in my mind  but the excellent food made it worth it Overall  the hotel is very well run  Staff is friendly and speaks english very well  relative to the general chinese   The room was spacious  and the bed was equipped with a control for all the lioghting of the room  great night light below the bed   The hotel offered complimentary water bottles too  which was a nice addition  My only recommendatoion would be for the swimming pool facilities to be renovated  
P => Disappointing I have stayed in many hotels in Beijing and this is my first disappointment in a long time  I picked it mostly because it was convenient for what I had to do  not convenient for tourists  This hotel is not   star  Probably    It underdelivers for the price  I previously stayed at the Hilton in this part of town and it was much better  Essentially this hotel is old and doesn t offer what you expect from a   star hotel today  Old bathroom  inadequate towels and pillows  uncomfortable bed and very average food I had much better experiences at the Inter Continental or Westin on Financial Street for half the price  
P => Very convenient and a good place to stay for business When I am in Beijing I normaly stay in this hotel  It is only    minutes away from the airport and also close to our offices  I am normally here on business  The rooms are very clean and spacious and well equipped  For me the beds are a little too soft  Service is welcomming and I like the different restaurants in the hotel as I like to eat in the hotel when I am travelling  I can recommend the Bavarian restaurant as well as the Italian restaurant  Also the breakfast is good  wide selection and good quality  It is not cheap but a convenient place to stay I would like to see WLAN in there  it is a bit inconvenient not to have it Overall I will return to this place  
P => Good Hotel   Though I Expected More I found the Kempinski to be a good hotel  Very good facilities with a shopping centre next door  The choice of restaurants in the hotel is excellent and caters for every taste  Staff is friendly a efficient  However the room itself was a bit disappointing for a hotel that calls itself a   star property  Rather run down with outdated decor and in visible need for renovation  This was a surprise to me for a hotel in asia that usually offer very high quality  Never the less due to the otherwise good quality and it s very convenient location to the airport and many corporations I would probably stay here again  
P => Excellent Hotel We stayed at the Kempinski Hotel tember             The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful  Most had a very good knowledge of English  The concierge was most helpful in recommending restauraunts in the area within walking distance The breakfast buffet each morning was the BEST we have ever experienced  The variety of food was remarkable  It was so good that I made it a point to personnaly thank the food service manager AND write a letter to the hotel manager You cannot go wrong staying at the Kempinski Hotel  A shopping center is connected to the hotel with a super market in the lower level for extra bottled water and snacks  
P => Solid hotel well located I went to the Kempinski on a business trip and found a conveniently located hotel  with nice and well equiped rooms and friendly professional service  It has three restaurants in the property  so you can choose between italian  german and chinese and international food   So if you are not a fan of new flavors  as myself  you can find your all time favourites here  The area is surrounded by embassies  and the Hard Rock Cafe is one block away  It is close  relatively  nothing is too close in Beijing   to some of the city s best known attractions and markets  Taxis are available at all times and the bell boys can translate to the drivers your destination  It is close to the airport     minutes cab ride   The rooms are of adequate size and have the amenities for hotels of this category  The hotel has a swimming pool where you can relax enjoying a nice view of the City  Breakfast is very complete  with local and international food  
P => Solid international hotel I stayed in this hotel several times over the last two years and never had any reason to complain  Service is professional and almost everybody manages a few words in English  Those at the front desk speak it fluently  so you will always find help when you need it  The breakfast buffet is splendid  I do not understand the complaint of the first reviewer about it  I know the breakfast from many    hotels and this one is one of the best of them all   if not the best  The Paulaner beergarden brews its own German style beer on site and is a great feature for German travellers  such as myself  longing for something familiar  even if the Chinese waitresses in their Bavarian dresses look more weird than familiar  On the downside  the rooms are nothing special and somewhat small  In the lobby you will find nowhere to sit except some stone benches around the potted palms  The location  on the third ring road and close to the airport  is convenient for business travellers  but a bit out of the way for tourists  In heavy traffic   that is  almost always   it can take    minutes or even more to get to Tiananmen  This might improve when they open the new subway line right outside the hotel next year  For me  transportation is no issue since my company s local office is located across the street  If it was not for this  I might try another of the now manifold options in Beijing  but I will happily return to this one on all future trips  
P => Not what you expect from a          I stay a lot in Kempinski hotels in Asia and Europe  Just arriving from another Kempinski in the Middle East here in Beijing I have to say the contrast could not be any bigger  Although the overall quality is still OK  the rooms need a refurbishment in the next time  Yes  they are clean  but you have to wait until   PM for the cleaner to begin the work  There is no shower in the very small bathroom and you have to stand in the bath tub  behind a plastic curtain  There is a cooker for hot water  coffee next to the TOILET  The Aircon works  but smells funny sometimes  if it was turned off for a while  The staff is aways willing to help  but sometimes it feels like they are still learning their job  After all  this feels all a bit run down and more      stars as like a   star with under the Kempinski management  which is normally excellent  Unfortunately the price feels   star    
P => My favorite in Beijing The Kempinski Hotel is my favorite hotel in Beijing  It s very comfortable  the location is good  and the other retaurants and stores in the hotel and connected lufthansa complex are great  It s the best place to be when the weather and air in Beijing is bad and you don t want to go outside  The service at the Kempinski is good    even if there is a problem  I recently was given the wrong room and they corrected it promptly  incidentally    the rooms with   beds are NOT good    the beds are very small singles  In contrast the king sized beds are GREAT  Don t miss the deli or the wines selection in the lufthansa center grocery store  basement level   
P => Nice Business Hotel  
P => A pleasurable return  
P => Good location for Beijing  
P => A solid option  
P => H tel tr s correct  
P => Germany meets China  
P => Utter bliss in the big city From the moment we set foot in this little gem  we were treated like royalty  From the elegant lobby to the plush rooms  everything was warm and welcoming  Great beds  beautiful decorations  great bathrooms  Breakfast buffet had something for everyone  Our only negative was the coffee in the  nd floor breakfast room  even at opening at  am it was bitter and tasted like it d been cooking all night  The workout rooms  pool  and two hot tubs are awesome  Lots to do in the neighborhood  great hot pot restaurant close by  Tao Temple Cultural Center across the street  open to the public  Stop by Yashow ket a few blocks away  much better than the Silk ket  less pushy sales people  and better prices  
P => Better than Beijing Holiday Inns This review is based on   or   stays at this hotel Fine  polished  literally  lobby  Check in service is slow  writing details down manually The best aspect of this hotel is the rooms  which are very comfortable including high quality bedding  good climate control  and fine bathrooms with excellent showers  baths and soft towels The rooms are not completely soundproofed so if you re noise sensitive  ask for a quieter room  perhaps on a higher floor  There is some street noise outside from traffic The coffee shop buffet at breakfast is very good  except for the coffee  so so   but I recommend going out rather than eating the dinner buffet which is mediocre As is usual in China  the hotel only distributes poor quality state run newspapers  but you can get real news via fast free internet connection in every room The hotel is    mins  walk or   mins  taxi ride from Sanlitun  an evening entertainment area with a series of bars featuring live bands  some from the Philippines All in all  this is a reasonable and comfortable hotel for a short stay in Beijing  and better than some of the branded chains  
P => Five star room three star service two star food This is a nice new modern hotel and the rooms are really comfortable and nice  However  they food is dreadful  I ordered a chicken dish for room service and they brought up something that was     hot peppers and     tiny chicken pieces wrapped around bones  I ve eaten plenty of Chinese food so my problems weren t cultural  When I complained I was told that I just didn t like Chinese food  I asked for something else and they brought it up  But  they expected me to pay for the bad chicken dish  I complained that I shouldn t have to pay  The women said she would check with her manager  She called a little while later to say that  quot just this time quot  they would make an exception and I wouldn t have to pay  I was made to feel as if I was some crazy westerner  This is not what one expects in a five star hotel  The Internet connection here is also extraordinarily slow  I need a fast connection for work so I had to go to a nearby Internet cafe  If they could bring the service and the food up to the standards of the rooms this would be a nice hotel  For now  I say stay at the nearby Sheraton  
P => OK hotel with good sized rooms but food  I stayed at the KunTai on business and thought my room was really good  very spacious and clean with all mod cons  The things that didn t really impress me though were the food which was really quite mixed i e  some things were delicious and others inedible and the Spa where I got an awful massage that left me quite uncomfortably sore for a few days  The hotel is really well located though for most things so as long as you avoid the Spa and eat out where possible it probably is not a dreadful choice for visiting Beijing  It is worth noting it isn t remotely  authentic  though  just like any western chain hotel really  so if you were on holiday and wanted something a bit more  Chinese  I wouldn t recommend it  
P => Good Stayed here    days on business The basics here are very good  very spacious room  clean  comfortable bed  and excellent soundproofing between rooms  The bathroom was large and excellent  finished entirely in marble The pool is very nice  but be sure to bring a bathing cap  you can buy one there  but it is very overpriced  Within a few minutes  walk are numerous restaurants  several ATMs  plus one in the lobby   a large supermarket  a Starbucks  and a clothing bazaar  The Forbidden City area is about    minutes West by taxi  or about    minutes by foot  One serious problem  the  free  wired  internet connection worked OK for Chinese sites  but varied from slow to useless for US sites  The problem appears to be with the hotel s choice of ISP  as I had no such problems from the office building across the street  There is a internet cafe one block east  I did not try it  Quibbles  most of the furniture seems to have been designed for a much smaller room  Given the size of the room  a larger desk work area would have been appreciated  The electrical outlets are too few and too artfully hidden  My room was too hot  and the thermostat temperature setting and heat cool switch don t do anything    only on off actually does what it says  You can open the window  but with Beijing pollution that isn t ideal  The plumbing fixtures look nice  but are not of the highest quality    I had to request maintenance on them several times  
P => Convenient Location Good   The hotel is new   Free internet   Location is good  for shopping  A large grocery  name is WONDERFUL  is a one minute walk away  There is a fashion mall diagonally across the hotel  and silk street bazaar is abour     minutes drive from the hotel  Easy to catch a taxi in this area  and if youre feeling adventurous  there are many buses that pass infront of the hotel as well  There is a bus stop in front of the hotel   Breakfast is plentiful  Buffet choice of congee  wonton noodles  dimsum  fresh juices  cereals  cold cuts  fresh fruits  rice  sausages  eggs any way you want  etc etc etc    although they serve the same things everday     Staff is very helpful  Most can understand and speak English    Bathroom is roomy   separate shower and bath areas  Enjoyed the bath tub  Hotel provides usual toiletries   soap  shampoo  bath gel  lotion  toothbrush  shower cap  Usual generic hotel toiletries  No bath salts or bubble bath  Very helpful staff at the business center who helped me compose a letter in chinese   Room not so big by asian standards  Not so good   There are only three     non smoking floors in the hotel  We were given a smoking room  Not happy with that  And the room was fully booked when we arrived due to some conference being held at the hotelso they couldnt transfer us to a non smoking room  Good thing the room had windows  We left them open during our entire stay    Electricity acting funny  Our lights suddenly went off in the middle of the night  probably due to some short circuit  Staff was able to fix it in    mins after we reported it in the morning  However some of the lamps continued to be unpredictable  Some wouldnt turn on at times  Strange Overall had an enjoyable stay  
P => Quite Nice well  it s worth it  I would recomment to everyone  Most of the staff are nice and friendly The HEALTH SPA area is quite nice and you could even ask for a massage lady to your room  You should try it 
P => Great hot in a great area Great new hotel in an great area with lots to offer  I stayed there    days and loved it  Excellent service  perfectly clean  very comfortable beds  outstanding pool gym    I only wish more of the staff spoke english  There is a latin bar lounge arround the corner   quot Mojito quot  that s very convenient    
P => it was perfect     My friend and I stayed at the Kuntai for only one night at the end of   I had booked online for a double room for approx     CAD  Every experience with this place was fantastic  The porters and the clerks were quick  thoughtful and most importantly fluent in English  When you want to leave the hotel  there is already a line of taxi s waiting on the street  The concierge waves one over for you and translates for you where you want to go   The silk alley   now relocated to one single building of super shopping fun  and the friendship store was only   RMB away  Our room was not small  however  with all the furniture in the room  which included a desk  a large armchair and the whole t v fridge storage unit  the space was a little tight  Still  the linens were all crispy clean  pillows were balanced and fluffy  bathrobes were white and new   Air conditioning was in good working order and it was quiet and comfortable   The bathroom on the other hand was enourmous  The shower stall and the giant bathtub were separate  The decor and the dimming lights gives the right atmosphere for a relaxing soak  There were plenty of heavy towels and little knick knacks of shampoo  lotions  toothbrushes etc   Of course  being a relatively new hotel  everything was also very clean  no sweaty pipes  moldy grout  or stained porcelin  I would recommend this hotel to everyone    
P => Nice new hotel Great bed and bathroom Beatiful new  modern hotel  Very nice bathrooms and linens  Super comfortable bed  The room we were given        was on the small size for Chinese hotel rooms  The size was comparable to an NYC room  The breakfast was ok  nothing spectacular  Business center computers are not in private rooms or cubbies  Location is convenient  
P => Good new adress in Beijing This is a brand new   star rated hotel that is located very conveniently within the inner ring road  close to Worker s stadium and Sanlitun Lu  Subway is a   minute walk away  Two fake markets  KFC    are opposite the street Rooms are large   gt     sqm   well decorated and all of them have the same size  Very comfortable beds  marble bathroom with separate shower and tub  Few English TV channels Try out the Spa  you ll find probably one of the biggest indoor pools in Beijing We only tried the breakfast  which was standard Western  amp  little Chinese  Nothing special  but also nothing to complain about Nice bar  but expensive  
P => OK hotel past it s prime The hotel seems fairly old and could do with some renovation  The rooms are clean and reasonable size  Although a serviced apartment with a kitchen there was no crockery or pots and pans  Location is good      mins walk from nearest subway station and   mins to central shopping area and   mins to Forbidden City 
P => Loved it   We    friends  stayed in a   bedroom apartment and thought it was fantastic  The apartment was nicely furnished and very clean  The location was excellent  well situated to Wanfujing area  markets  and restaurants and easy taxi ride to all sights  The staff were great  The pool and restaurant were also excellent  I would easily stay here again and recommend it to friends  
P => Happy Days  All Good My wife and I spent   nights at Lee Gardens and had a fantastic time  The location was fantastic being very close to the main pedestrian areas downtown and also close to the subway  Th rooms were very tidy and fully self contained  Best of all the staff were brilliant  If we were to return to Beijing we will be staying at Lee Gardens  
P => Great Option in Beijing for Families and Excellent Value Stayed at Lee Garden for a week in the summer  The location is right in the Wanfujing area which makes it very convenient to hit the key spots around the locale  Rooms were well portioned like a comfortable apartment and it s great to have a quasi home to come back to with a separate living area  dining table  kitchen  washer dryer  etc  all within the apartment after a long day The staff was helpful  especially the guys manning the doorway to get cabs for you  There s a convenience store around the corner to stock up on drinks  food  snacks  etc  And the dining options are abundent in the whole Wangfujing area  You can walk to the Forbidden City s east gate entrance fairly easily Fantastic value for a   bedroom unit especially when compared to getting   rooms in a regular hotel in the same area  Would definitely stay again  Would recommend shopping around various travel sites and contacting the hotel apartment directly to get the best quotes  The quotes we got were significantly different between Expedia  ctrip  etc  
P => A Good Property   Certainly Worth Considering I stayed here during the Olympic Paralympic periods and was quite pleased  It s about a   star property  the staff are very nice and accommodating and the hotel s location is fantastic I stayed in the studio apartment and was comfortable enough  the beds are terribly firm  but this is quite common in China   The kitchen was tiny  but had everything I needed  the washer dryer was puzzling at first  but easy to use after the first try  and the internet connection was fairly strong  I was staying for about five weeks and found the closet area a bit cramped and poorly designed  or perhaps the room was poorly arranged because one of the closet doors swung open into the couch   For the most part  it s a clean hotel  but the carpet is my room was quite stained  so it gives the room a certain worn look Some colleagues were staying at the same property as me and some of them had one  two and even three bedroom apartments  These are much more spacious and well kept it seems  If you are considering the studio  I recommend looking into the cost of the one bedroom The hotel gym is very good   lots of equipment to choose from  There are yoga pilates classes and a pool  too As mentioned  the location is excellent  Lee Gardens is just steps from the Wangfujing area   AMP Mall is a block away and Oriental Plaza is about a   minute walk  There are several high end five star properties in this area  Peninsula  Regent  Legendale   as well  It s a pretty dynamic area of Beijing  there are plenty of places to eat and shop   I certainly recommend the fifth and sixth floors at AMP Overall  Lee Gardens Service Apartment Beijing is a good choice for the business traveller or vacationer who is looking for a cheaper  yet more spacious alternative to the typical   star accommodation   without having to sacrifice location  amenities or comfort  
P => Good but has some weaknesses  This is not really a hotel but a  quot serviced apartment  quot  Some people stay for a short time but others live there for months or years  I staid here for one month  On the whole it was good but I am not sure if it is the best value that you can get It is clean and its rooms are of course more typical of an apartment than a hotel  They are equipped with full kitchens and laundry machines  The bathrooms are large and elegant  The location is excellent  It is in Wangfujing  one of the major shopping areas of Beijing and close to shopping and the subway  I also liked their cafe in the basement which gives pretty good food for reasonable prices The service while good  however  is not quite what it would be at a hotel with a smilar price  They clean your room twice a week instead of everyday if you sign a monthly lease  And it does not have some of the other minor perks that many hotels in China will give you  free bottled water  money changing etc  The apartment was generally in good condition but there were minor problems  My bathroom sink could never deliver hot water and did not drain properly  My washer dryer machine needed to be replaced because its drying function did not work properly  Even the new machine could only handle small loads and took hours to finish them If you are staying in Beijing for a while it is probably possible to get an equally nice apartment without twice weakly maid service for a much lower cost  If you are staying for a short time and don t need a larger apartment you might be better off staying at a similarly priced hotel like Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing But still  I can t really complain too much about my stay here  It was convenient and satisfying if not spectacular  
P => Serviced Apartment close to Beijing sites I was a little apprehensive to stay here after i saw some of the past reviews about the place being dirty etc  We traveled with our eight month old son and really needed to stay in a serviced apartment  for the kitchen and extra space  I have to say we had a wonderful time  I am so glad we stayed here  The reception staff were a bit cold and reserved  but the doorman was extra friendly and helpful  We stayed in an one bedroom apartment for five nights  which was really nice  I asked in advance from the reception staff for pots  pans etc since they don t seem to keep them standard in the apartment you have to ask  and used them for my son s food and sterlizing bottles  Our bedroom was very comfy  The bathroom had a shower and soaking tub  The apartment was very clean  I was really worried about this  since my son is crawling  but the carpets were fine  We didn t have breakfast at the property  since we found it pretty expensive  Instead we went to Oriental Plaza  about    minute walk  to the grocery store at the bottom of the building and bought groceries  We found that buying groceries at a top of the line expat  grocery store was cheaper than having breakfast at the hotel  There is a nice business centre on the bottom level  Our room came with a washing machine dryer which was really helpful during our stay  even though you can get laundry done through the hotel directly  The hotel is close to many attractions  I highly recommend this hotel for business travelers and families  Word of warning  the city is under reconstrution due to the olympics  This wasn t a problem for us during our stay  but there is a construction site on one side of the building  
P => Great value and location very pleased   Stayed here for   nights in ember in the one bedroom apartment  The apartment was very spacious  clean  maid service every day  and had good facilities  including internet  gym  pool and a restaurant   I had been unsure whether to try this place or the Tianlun Dynasty hotel which is a few minutes away  I am glad I chose the apartment as it was excellent value being     per night cheaper than the hotel for an apartment as opposed to just a room  and is in my opinion in a slightly better location All staff were courteous and helpful  They assisted us each day with directions and writing down in Chinese the names of places we wanted to go to  so we could give the info to taxi drivers  The location for me was excellent  The shops of Wanfujing are minutes away and so is the Donganmen night food market  The restaurant within the apartment was good but there are also plenty of other good options nearby  esp recommend the food hall in the Oriental Plaza mall   If I go to Beijing again I will definitely stay here and would not hesitate to recommend this place  
P => Great Location Friendly Staff We stayed there for a week with another family  Because we have so many children among us  I find the idea of a service apartment an excellent alternative to a hotel  especially since we paid no more  if not less than another hotel inthe area Location is excellent  it is   minutes away from a western style shopping mall where you can get all kinds of food  some even delivered to the hotel       McDonalds is also located in the same mall so our children are just happy to have some familiar food for breakfast for the first day  As a result  we never tried breakfast in the hotel The rooms are very big  even by North American standard  Our one bedroom apartment is more than      sq ft  My friend s   bedroom looks like a maze  with full size mud room  walk in closets and everything Air conditioning is at the right temp  We were in Beijing in the last week of e and it was very hot outside and most malls and taxis do not have good air conditioning  So it is always nice to walk into the hotel lobby and feel the cool air on you  Not cold  just refreshingly cool Staff are very friendly and extremely helpful  There is always some one who can speak good English on the front desk  Cleaning and housekeeping staff are also friendly and they do a good job too  but they don t usually speak English  I had to talk to Front Desk to get things done and delivered The kitchen does not contain anything  other than a coffee maker and some cups  But if you ask the Front Desk  they can bring you anything you need to make a meal  
P => nice apartment at excellent location We  a family of four with to children aged   and     stayed for a week at Lee Garden  Staff was friendly  especially the bell boy  They were practising there english and I attended an english lesson for the front deks staff  The lessons are a necessity because there english isn t too good  on the other hand  neither is my chinese   The apartments are spacious and well equipped although there are no kitchen utensils  The gym was allright and there was a large swimming pool  The indeed asked us  as another travller wrote  to use swimming caps  We bought the cheap ones     yuan  My girls liked the pool and it was something they looked forward to over the day when visting a temple or two Breakfast is expensive and nothing special so you better make your own or go elsewhere  There s enough in the neighbourhood  It s on walking distance     minutes  of the forbidden city and literaly around the corner of the wangfuijing shopping street and nightmarket An excellent place for families  
P => good location but dirty First the good news  the location is great  center of the city  close to most tourist things  Very safe with things to do at all hours  Also the bathroom is very nice   clean  modern with a separate shower and bath  Better than I had expected However  two negatives     it s not clean  It looks clean  however  my two young children discovered tons of soot and dust on the carpet near the windows  It was disgusting  After just a few minutes of playing on the carpet  their hands and knees were covered with black dust     the staff is stereotypically bad  When notified of the dirt  they just shrugged their shoulders and ignored my request to clean it One more thing  the pool is very nice there  but they require everyone  including the men and children  to wear swim caps  If you buy them there they are    Yuan  
P => Perfect place to stay After a crazy ride from the airport  where our driver could not find this place  we finally arrived to friendly night staff who got us settled in  In the morning we discovered how wonderfully located this place was  It is within walking distance of The Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square  interesting shopping and a night food stall market  The rooms were quite large with an adequately equiped kitchen  There is a great health club you can use  as well as yoga and other classes you can take  Look no further for accomodation unless you feel the need to spend lots of money for an overpriced fancy hotel  
P => loved the hotel  and the location is the best  very nice service apartment hotel  the rooms are big with kitchenette  very nice pool  the best location  
P => Exceeded our expectations Brought a long weekend away at a charity auction for this hotel  It really was a beautiful Hotel   in a French classic style  It seemed to be very quiet during our stay  which didn t bother us  Hotel is about   year old  Rooms   very clean and spacious with everything you could ask for in a   star hotel  Big bathroom with Loccitane amenites  Slippers and robes were a notch above average which pleased my wife very much  Pool   Gyym   Spa   Gyym is good with plenty of new equipment  the pool was indoor  but not heated  but it was the middle of summer so it was great   swimming caps were compulsory  which you could buy at the pool reception   Massage prices seemed on the pricier side for China  but you don t expect anything less from a Hotel in this range Food   Restaurants   Breakfast was normal daily buffett with selection of Asian and western fare  Room service  which I normally make allowances for was actually very good  my wife and I ordered a laksa and a club sandwich after our late night arrival and not sure if it was because we were tired   hungry but the food was great Portuguese restuarant   very well done technically with good produce  it s just that I don t particularly like Portuguese food I realise now   stick with Peking Duck at Da Dong   th floor above Gucci on next block     minutes walk  Location   Big shopping centre   minutes walk  Starbucks across the road  Plenty of dining options nearby  Probably        minute walk to Forbidden City and Tiananmen square       minute walk to SubwayService was good with the staff more than happy to assist wherever they could  One thing though the hotel corridors look down into the lobby  so those that are afraid of heights I would suggest the lower floors  Not a real big deal though Would definately stay there when next in Beijing  
P => Most luxurius hotel of the world I syated at the Legendale Hotel in Beijing for two nights with my wife  and I have no words to describe the hotel   Rooms are huge and abosutely full equiped Flat screen    LCD  Dvd player  incredible bath  huge bed   The pool is also incredible it seems an antique pool of Rome  the health club  has also two jacuzzies  steam bath sauna    Buffet breakfast is incredible  all kind of food a lot of variety   The hotel is located in the best area of Beijing I have stayed in   star hotels all around the world and I have no doubt that the The Legendale is the most luxurious of all   The service is unbeatable   You must go    
P => Great hotel for Americans Great food  decorated for Christmas with carolers too   very beautiful hotel  
P => excellent to get away from it all The Loong palace is a gorgeous hotel and resort   it has fantastic facilities   and is the only place in Beijing you can feel alone      sadly it is because you are   After a hectic eight nights spent in the city touring all the sites it was lovely to just unwind and relax out at the Loong palace  the staff are happy smiling people and the place is five stars without a doubt   The great wall is visable on a clear day and the tombs are not so far away so even if you wanted to base yourself out here it is not so far from everything   It would be wonderful if more people used the hotel and travelled into the sites each day to then come back to quiet luxury of an evening    it took about    mins from the forbidden city to reach the hotel   small pointer  you need a cap to use the swimming pool   
P => An excellent hotel The hotel is located in the Chang Ping district and is close to the Great Wall and Ming Tombs and institutions such as Peking University  If you want to go to downtown Beijing  it is a    minute journey in a reasonably priced hotel car or a cab  The hotel has excellent facilities including indoor tennis courts  a bowling alley  well equipped recreation centre  gymnasium  pool and a very good massage   spa  The restaurants are very good with an excellent range of cuisines and the Japanese restaurant is outstanding  The rooms are spacious and clean  For what you get  this is excellent value  Highly recommended  
P => Loong Palace  aka Lonely Palace  The hotel is phenominal  but the problem is that it is in the middle of nowhere  thus as my colleagues call it  quot the Lonely Palace  quot  Why  This location is outside of the  th ring highway  anything beyond the  th ring is considered the boon docks   But when I first moved to China  my company housed me at the Loong Palace for a month  and I enjoyed my stay  but being so far away  almost everywhere I wanted to go was a       RMB      USD  cab ride away  Although for the US people      USD seems like nothing for a cab right  the equivalent for cost of living is that the cab ride is like    USD  So if you think about it  cab rides start off at    RMB for the first     KM  and then   RMB for every KM you travel  So if you do the math  you will realize how far the place is  I think from Tienneman Square to the Great Wall  Badaling section which is the area that you should go to   this is the halfway point  So if you re thinking in US  if you re going from LA to Vegas  this place would be Barstow  But this hotel is truly a   star hotel  as in Ritz Carlton standards   The manager there is Dutch  speaks fluent english and fluent Chinese  And since I had a corporate rate  the month that I stayed there  the total bill for the month came out to     USD  Now that s cheaper than the price of rent in NY city for a studio in the city Like I said  it s not the most convenient of places  but the place is definitely a hidden gem  Also  with all the development going on by there is a new gigantic Japanese mall just north of the hotel which has a Korean Lotteria  burger joint   a Korean restaurant chain  a Sports Authority  and some other international brands  
P => World Class Hotel The Hotel is very new  Clean  very western in terms of the bathrooms and room furnishings  Traveled with a very large group        The breakfasts we had at the Hotel were a mix of western and Chinese dishes  
P => a world class hotel great stay others who had traveled to beijing warned us that a   star hotel in china might not be up to our usual standards  this is an exception  should be rated       stars  great room  outstanding common area facilities the staff was always ready to help  money exchange  extra towels  business center and written chinese directions for taxi drivers  just a few of the great services they try hard with english  but the difficulties encountered just added to the interest of traveling in china  my wife and i stayed for   days  and for someone who had traveled extensively  this hotel  and china  rated as one of our best travel experiences john k  modesto ca 
P => Good business hotel in Beijing I stayed at the Loong Palace while on a business trip for over       weeks  For business travelers  the club rooms are quite good  spacious clean and great respite from the day s work The hotel is out in the middle of nowhere  for leisure purposes  its probably better to stay closer to the city either in the Financial District or the Choyang district Food is good to excellent  the japanese restaurant providing excellent value Staff was quite courteous and accomodating  Unfortunately  many didn t have sufficient english skills to be of true help  
P => Very nice hotel far from the city center We stayed at this hotel for ten days on a combined business sightseeing trip  We were attending a conference held at this hotel  otherwise we probably would not have booked it since it is is very far from the city center However  we found the hotel to be an excellent choice  The property is beautiful and has all the amenities expected of a good five star hotel  pool  spa  shopping  gym  tennis  bowling      There are many excellent restaurants on site  which is good since there is not much else in this area  The restaurants were generally rather pricey by Beijing standards  but still much cheaper than we were used to so we didn t mind  The rooms were very spacious  immaculately clean and well decorated  The bathrooms were very large with lovely furnishings  Free bottled water was provided in the rooms since the tap water isn t safe to drink  In room internet access is available for a cost   however you pay only when logged on  and while we were online frequently the total cost for the stay was negligible We paid a very reasonable     yuan per night  including the buffet breakfast which was very extensive  and excellent quality  There are of course much cheaper hotels in Beijing  but this seems to be a good price for a five star hotel The location is the main downside  since it does take some time to get into the center  However we found it to be simple and inexpensive  a five minute taxi to LongZe station     yuan every time   followed by the line    train and the line   subway    yuan total   It took up to an hour but again  was quite simple  Note that it s not really possible to walk anywhere from this hotel  since the highway is very close  
P => Make sure to check out the spa Very nice and clean hotel  Most desk staff speak a little English  but double check important details  Breakfast buffet is very nice  The huge spa is something not to be missed  Prices are most reasonable  I prefered the  th floor spa to the services offered in the pool area  better ambience  though the pool area is cheaper  In restaurants  order your meat more cooked than you like it  Ours tended to keep coming our rarer than we d prefer It is in the ourskirts of town  so not necesarily convenient  but great value for the money  and taxis are cheap make sure you only get in metered taxis    Have fun  
P => Can t miss Wonderful Hotel  One of the best I ve stayed in anywhere in the world  We stayed in the new section just opened in ch      Wonderful breakfast buffet also  We were on a tour so the distance to the city wasn t an issue  Conveneient to the Great Wall and the Olympic stadium but maybe too far for business downtown  
P => Top Notch Hotel  I ve stayed here twice now   Both times just transiting through Beijing on my way back to the states   Flew in the night before and left the next morning or afternoon  The first time I stayed there was about   years ago   I booked it through Crowne Plaza s website  I arrived   days after it dropped the Crowne Plaza affiliation   Which scared me a bit  I was thinking before getting there  quot Uh oh  the place wasn t up to C P standards  quot  I couldn t have been more wrong  A GORGEOUS hotel  so big  such great rooms  big  clean  comfortable  many amenities   I could go on and on  My second trip there  I arrived late at night and was flying back to the States the next afternoon   Which allowed me to visit the Great Wall at BaDaLing in the morning and still catch my flight  I arranged a hotel car to take me there  wait for me for a few hours and drive me back to the hotel so I could freshen up before my flight   A GREAT experience  I had the hotel car for about   hours and ran me about US      Well worth it to finally see the wall    trips to China each year X    years and still hadn t seen the Great Wall until that trip  Car driver was friendly  although almost no English spoken  thank God I speak some Chinese  Superb hotel  GREAT value  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra US    and book a small suite  Well worth it Ate one meal in the Chinese restaurant   Great food  reasonable prices and fantastic service While it is relatively close to the Great Wall and the airport  it is a long way from the City Center  The PERFECT hotel for doing what I did  fly in quick for one night  see the wall and fly out  One of these days I will make it into the city  but will have a tough time staying away from Loong Palace  
P => The Best of Service Our Beijing vacation stay ended y          and it was the best vacation my wife and I ever experienced  Our room      was beautiful and bright  The staff was outstanding  always very helpful and answered all our questions  My wife and I hope to someday return  The best wishes and long life to the entire staff Hank Hammersmith and Lan Ying MiDiamond Bar  CAUSA 
P => Had a great stay   Just returned from another trip to Loong Palace and the improvements regarding service I have seen are getting better   especially for China The Restaurants still need improving regarding service although the menus had changed for the better since my last visit in ruary This time I went with my wife and we had a few days of leisure together which was a nice break from the usual buisness trip and I had a chance to properly explore all the leisure facilities which are really good and well maintained Although the hotel was really busy with an International Taekwondo event she was really taken care of  especially at their new Spa in their new South Wing called My Spa which is certainly one of the best we have seen in Beijing The understanding of English also seems to be improving as one member of staff told me they now have regular English lessons I hope they keep it up as I will be going back in Sptember  
P => Excellent Hotel A brilliant Hotel with excellent facilities  friendly staff and good resturants Rooms are large  well serviced  and well appointed room service is fast and efficient Business facilites were good  and it is well located in relation to the high tech districts The Great Wall and other major sightseeing areas are within easy reach I will be staying there again  
P => Excellent accomodations  Two friends and I spent   nights at the Loong Palace  It is a lovely hotel deserving of it s   star rating  The employees were very helpful  very accomodating  Most spoke enough English that we had no problems exchanging money  asking about areas we wanted to visit  ordering room service or ordering at the bars and restaurants  even getting a massage  This hotel is a bit out of downtown Beijing but taxi rides are very inexpensive and taxi cabs were numerous  
P => Excellent Rooms  The hotel is beautiful  the rooms are spacious  and the staff is excellent  Yes  as several reviews have pointed out  English skills are often lacking  but a little bit of patience goes a long way  Besides   you are in China after all  how fluent is your Chinese  The hotel has several restaurants  excellent breakfast in the Bravo on  nd floor   a spa  bowling alley  tennis court  and other amenities to fill your free time  assuming you have any   I will definitely stay at the Loong Palace again  Top notch  The ONLY negative for anyone travelling strictly for pleasure is the location     minute cab ride from downtown   
P => Nice Hotel but fair customer service I have been on vacation with my family to Beijing  and we stayed at the Loong Palace Hotel throughout our   day journey The hotel is in some remote outskirts of the city  but travelling has been reasonable  The rooms are nice  clean and big  The bathroom have also been in good condition  Variety of TV channels and breakfast have also been good However  what annoys me most has been the customer service  My father and I went to access the internet at its Business Center one evening  We checked for the price at Front Desk beforehand  and was told the first    mins would cost RMB      Fine  Even though a bit expensive  it s not over the top We went to the Biz Center then  checked a couple of emails for around     mins  When we are about to checkout and pay  a bill of RMB     has been sent in  It came as a real shock  Subseqeuntly  we found out that the billing was  quot First    mins would cost RMB      and then    per min afterwards quot  We feel cheated by the Hotel  and summoned the Duty Manager for reasoning  Sarcastically  he offered fruit plates as remedy  but insisted the full bill to be paid  He also guaranteed an investigation and refund us in full if the mistake has been made by his staff The following evening  the Manager returned with an evelope of RMB     He said it has been clarified that his staff made a mistake  but the billing of internet has also been posted in the Biz Ctr  and he claimed we should have checked again before using the service  The RMB    is a     refund to show the  quot goodwill quot  of hotel  He even claimed that this event had the endorsement of his GM and there d be no use if we keep complaining  We refused to take the refund and walked away  I think the handling is totally unacceptable  given that the mistake has been made by his staff  and the impolite manner of the Manager  It s not a matter of paying extra for the service  but the breakdown of trust and expectation from a  quot   star hotel quot   How can such a hotel in service for several years with front desk staff unaware of the pricing of its own service  I d say other than this unpleasant experience  the whole journey has been enjoyable  However  this incident spoilt our journey  
P => Great Hotel I stayed at this hotel with a tour group  The hotel was beautiful and clean  The food in the restaurants was good with a good selection  The staff was friendly and helpful  although not all of them spoke english  The hotel is located out from the city center  but a cab ride downtown was only    to      It was quiet and had a large indoor swimming pool  I would definitely stay there again  
P => Excellent Hotel I stayed there for a week  The amenities at this hotel are among the best by far of any other I have stayed in  The employees for the most part spoke broken english  but well enough to hold a decent conversation  There were quite a few  however  that spoke english very well  The food at the Palms restaurant on premises was very good  with many  many choices available to satisfy the hunger cravings of almost anyone  The choices range from western to asian cusine  with very well prepared on both  Not only would I recommend to anyone  I plan on going back and staying at this same hotel  
P => Very Poor Just spent a miserable time at this hotel  The building is actually very nice and the room big  The problem is service and lack of English speaking staff  Impossible to order room service food and when it arrived it was not at all what we ordered  The coffee shop was packed with noisy tourist groups and was a mess both mornings  Virtually no one at the reception desk could understand basic English  Could not tell me where the executive club loounge was   Pretty hotel but avoid at all costs because of service  
P => Tout simplement nul      
P => Okay stay for family We stayed for three nights in a two bedroom apartment which was very spacious and had heaps of space for the four of us  The location is good with the main road only five minutes up the road  heaps of buses going downtown for next to nothing and lots of atms around for cash  There is a      across the carpark   cheap beer and snacks   there is quite a smell in there and I don t know about eating some of the food in the heating servers  The front desk were helpful and always smiling  The only issue was cleanliness of the apartment   it didn t really feel hotel clean but it was okay   though we did have to keep the kitchen door closed the whole time  We didn t bother eating at MCS as the food was very average and even with the breakfast included in the price we decided that cornflakes and milk from      was better  There was a great restaurant up the road about   mins walk called De Tai Lou   nice food  reasonable price and walking distance after a few drinks   the menu is a laugh  Chips or french fries are called  quot Department of the Bombing quot    the kids had them every meal just to say it  Overall the apartment is okay  space for a family of four  sharing beds   the      is handy  good location and the De Tai Lou is lovely for a meal  
P => Central location execellent value  We stayed here for   nights and found it a welcome respite after a long day sightseeing around Beijing  Rooms were roomy  clean and comfortable   breakfasts in the attached restraunt were reasonable although simple  although they offered no cereal and when asked did not know what cereal was  We used taxis extensivly and found the cost minimal from this central accomadation  Its not a   star hotel but for a family    adults  it was very good value  
P => Great base while in Beijing My partner and I just spent   nights at the Luxury Serviced Residence in a   bedroomed apt  We found it was a great base at very reasonable rates  We paid     night   Apartment The apartment was huge   which was a nice change from some of the other micro rooms we stayed in while travelling around China   with a lounge area  separate kitchen and bathroom downstairs  and the bedroom  desk area  second bathroom   and even a separate clothes drying room  which we made good use of  upstairs  The space is so large that there are   air conditioners to keep it cool  The funishings were definitely on the cheap side and a little worn  but perfectly adequate and the bed was comfortable  Apt had free internet We found the front desk staff friendly  but not terribly knowledgable  The workout room is reasonable with a couple of running machines  universal equipment and some free weights Location The location is fine   the good news is that all the main tourist spots are only about a       taxi ride away  The bad news is that all the main tourist spots are a       taxi ride away   The only thing of interest within walking distance is the Silk market  The nearest subway entance is about a       min walk  right by the Silk market  The apartment complex is hard for taxi drivers to find   it is near the base of the road on the Western side  Just keep an eye out for signs for the      Nearby Amenities As others have mentioned there is a      less than   min walk  as well as a huge Western style supermarket in the SciTech plaza about a   minute walk away   with everything you could possible want  There is also a street of Western style restaurants on Xiushui St   directly behind the Friendship store  popular with the large expat population in the area  Includes an American diner and an excellent Tibetan restaurant we ate at one night Cons The only thing that annoyed us is that machines in the laundry room require tokens  at       a pop  which you have to buy at the front desk  We bought a half dozen when we first arrived and ended up having a couple left over at the end of the week  When we went to return these to the front desk we were told that they were nonrefundable   They gave us a weak excuse that the money had already been logged by accounting      even thought the money is just stored in a small tin along with the tokens  It would have been nice if they had told us that when we bought them   
P => Best Kept Secret for the Greatest Value in Beijing We looked through Tripadvisor and found this great hotel Luxury serviced residence  We were so happy we cancelled our reservations at riott   We stayed in a one bedroom unit  This comes with a living room  full kitchen  seperate bedroom in the upper level    bathrooms   cooking utensils  dishes  microwave  refrigerator etc etc   We felt perfectly at home   This is our   th night   The staff is always very friendly and helpful  They will guide you to anything   Change money at great rates  There is a    hr seven eleven across  This comes with coupons for breakfast at MCS coffee  Taxis are cheap and we can get to anywhere in    to    RMB   Dont forget to visit The Place   the new mall just   mins cab ride   We wish we had such a hotel in every city we travel   We booked through expedia and got      offf for every   nights you book   What a deal   We got the     sq ft apartment for about      US per night with breakfast   
P => A spacious home away from home with facilities I booked into the Luxury Serviced Residence on the basis of positive internet reviews and very reasonable cost  My wife and I were very happy with this quiet and spacious apartment which provided all the facilities needed to become our Beijing home for    days  Kitchen facilities were very good and the apartment was efficiently serviced daily  The bed was firm just like at home with an inner spring mattress on a slat base  the way we like it  Security was excellent  Desk staff had limited English but helped us wherever they could  and always with a smile  A display of tourist pamphlets would have been helpful but it seemed that in this city tourist are left to find their own way  Fortunately my extensive internet research prior to leaving Australia proved invaluable as a tourist  Neither the downstairs or upstairs ensuite had a bath but we showered comfortably  Breakfast in the downstairs cafe was cold and terrible so we used hotel vouchers wisely and didn t pay for breakfasts that were barely better than nothing  Buses     minutes walk  and subway     minutes  were regular  cheap and handy for city access although very crowded  If I return to Beijing I ll again stay at the Luxury Residence without hesitation  
P => Outstanding value  I cannot recommend this hotel serviced apartment highly enough    The front desk staff was always extremely helpful and communication was easier than you may be led to believe is likely in China  We relied heavily on the staff for translations of locations  we were in Beijing on business and thus had to travel to several locations during the course of our stay that weren t typical tourist destinations  and they were fantastic   The apartment itself vastly exceeded our expectations  We stayed in a   bedroom apartment  and our space was set up  quot loft style quot  with a   floor layout    bedrooms above and   on the ground floor  The apartment also had a large kitchen  huge main room  respectable Ikea styled furnishings  and   bathrooms  The apartment was clean  well maintained  and even included a DVD player and sound system   The location was outstanding  The Chaoyang district is large but contains quite a bit of commercial and nightlife restaurant activity  so you re in the  quot right quot  area of the city IMO  You re also relatively close to some of the main tourist attractions  Tienaman  Forbidden City  etc     Considering that we paid around      night for   people  I feel this was an extremely good value  I m a fairly well seasoned international traveler  and rarely have I been more pleasantly surprised than I was in this instance  This was a comfortable  hassle free stay and I d book it again in a heartbeat   One word of advice   taxi drivers do have some difficulty finding the building  Once we d arrived  it wasn t a problem because we had our bearings  but on your initial trip in from the airport  you should be aware that the entrance to the building is off the street   you need to go past a gate into a little courtyard roundabout  
P => Great Value  We stayed here from     to           Very well located and very well maintained  Going back to the apartment is like going home each day LOCATION   Walking distance to Subway line     Stations are  A  JianGuoMen Station  Line    amp  Line    B  YongAnLi  Line      Taxis have a hard time looking for the entrance because it is very nondescript  Tell them it is near the Beijing Friendship store  Look for SPR Cafe  amp        Remember to print the map of the hotel in MANDARIN    Embassy area in Chaoyang  Walking distance    mins  to the famous Silk ket where they sell at the fake stuff RECEPTION   Friendly  Anticipated that that we will need toiletries  serviced apartments usually do not provide     Not very proficient in navigating around the tourist areas  Was unable to answer question wrt to visiting the Bird s Nest  amp  Water Cube FOODNo breakfast provided  Hey  you are staying in a serviced apartment with stove  microwave and toaster  There is also a cafe at the same block  So you will not starve      APARTMENTThe pictures speaks for itself  While the apartment is very new  age is starting to show   it is Scandanavian designed and very well maintained  Well  we have a soft spot for lofts  and we simply loved it  There is a DVD player  So you can hop to the DVD shop next block  and feast on DVDs  there s not much to do in BJ at night   OTHER FACILITIESLaunderette  Gym WOULD WE STAY HERE AGAIN  Absolutely  We paid less than US     per night for the length of stay and I would say it is absolutely worth it   Very centralised  You can either than the subway  for   to   stops  to Wangfujing or even take a public bus f just outside the BJ Friendship store  for RMB   My bet is on the subway so that you can avoid the horrendous BJ traffic jams  
P => Great apartment hotel in Embassy area  We booked   nights at the Luxury Serviced Residence  An Ascott property  in t     I had read one other review on Tripadvisor which was positive but it was difficult to find other reviews We were pleasantly surprised to say the least  The hotel is located in the embassy area which we think is terrific  When we checked in  the desk person took us to our apartment  We were impressed with this personal service and sheer enthusiasm of the tour  She was obviously proud of her hotel s apartment and services  At check in  we were invited to a free party to celebrate the Moon Festival which is a very important celebration in Chinese life  For the party  all we had to do is show up in the lobby and the hotel took care of transferring us to the hutong cafe and hosting the party   We had a great time  The apartment is large by any standards  The first floor has a living room  dining room area  a kitchen  and a half bathroom  The second floor has a large bedroom  desk area  and bathroom with a shower  We met several people who have lived at the Luxury Serviced Residence for years  One couple we met at the party has lived there for three years For those who choose to cook  there is a full sized refrigerator  stove  microwave  hot water pot  toaster  and dishes to match  The only thing we added was some microwavable dishes  There is a      across the circle driveway for quick snacks and sundries There always seems to be someone who speaks English on duty  Each time we set out for the day we would stop by the desk and ask that our destination be written out in Chinese  Taxi drivers  in our experience  do not speak English and most do not read maps  There is a subway stop  Jian Guo men  about     mile away  It is an easy walk and the subway is extremely easy to use  The Bank of China is on the main cross street nearly around the corner  We would recommend this hotel for anyone who prefers an apartment  
P => very friendly LSR The first week of       we stayed at LSR  The people are very friendly and helpfull  The rooms were clean  We stayed there with   children     and    breakfast is at the corner of the building SPR Cofee  Across the building there is a little supermarket    H   days a week open  
P => Nice room and good value The hotel is about    minutes walk from the closest subway station     minutes walk to the Bird Nest  a quite and nice neighborhood  Also close to the airport and not far from the center of the city The pool is really nice with warm water  But beware of the strange rule that you have to wear a swimming cap to swim  
P => NICE  This really is a nice place to stay  Rates were quite reasonable  I upgraded to the Continental Floor and very much enjoyed the breakfast and happy hour  A very comfortable    day stay  The glass wall between the bathroon and the bedroom took some getting used to  The location was a bit off the tourist track  but I like it that way  Several good neighborhood restaurants within a   minute walk  Subway was the way to go more than a few miles  Quick  but rarely a seat available I would definitely stay there again unless I found another killer deal  
P => Superb hotel ideally located EXcellent hotel with very spacious and comfortable rooms Beds felt on the hard side but slept like a log Lovely bathrooms and towels etc also tea and coffee facilities Ideally located for the Birds Nest and Cube which are set in a lovely extensive park where the Chinese relax and play  Super to walk around in the evening and watch the  locals  Fantastic breakfast Superb pool  hats required   
P => excellent hotel   spa was FANTASTIC  was recommended to stay at this hotel by a friend  very lovely room  might be a bit far out from the city centre but it s worth it as it is quieter and less busy  what i wanted to say in particular is their spa  it was SO GOOD   very tranquil  very pretty rooms and the massage therapist was extremely skilled  excellent value for money so definitely give it a try  
P => Excellent   if you can get it at a good rate its well worth it Got a room for just US   and it was excellent  Little to fault about the hotel  Location from subway is about    minutes but the line goes directly to the centre of town  The hotel is not in the downtown area  Its to the north about a    mins walk from the Bird s Nest Olympic Stadium Breakfast and drinks are very pricey but there are very affordable eating options only a minute from the hotel  No bars nearby as far as I could see  
P => Nice hotel great breakfast buffets but not ideal location We stayed here  as our tour package had a last minute shuffle  We had wanted a hotel closer to the touristy spots  and the co Polo is close to the Olympic venues  The net effect is that our group had to commute almost every day to get the more touristy sites     it was closer to the Great Wall  However  the hotel itself was lovely  The rooms were large  very nicely done  and we had a separate sitting area  although my wife and I really did not need it  The breakfast buffets were great  with a mix of western and Chinese  
P => Excellent   star hotel although still no English  Everything you expect from a   star hotel is present here  including lovely spacious rooms  large beds  luxurious bathrooms  flat screen tv  internet     hr room service  large breakfast  tasty food etc etc  Only   negative things to comment on really     The location is a bit far from the places of interest  I was on a business trip  so it didn t make any difference     Nobody spoke any English whatsoever  Anyone travelling in China will know that nobody speaks English  but you would expect the reception staff at a   star hotel to be able to handle the basics  
P => Great   star Hotel I stayed at the co Polo Parkside Hotel for three days in y  The rooms were very spacious  clean  comfortable and large  It was truly a   star hotel  Each day  we received two small bottles of complimentary water The bathroom is huge  with a deep tub and separate shower stall  Some rooms have a very interesting glass bathroom wall  A shade comes down for privacy The beds were very clean and comfortable  I found the rooms to be sound proof and did not hear traffic from the outside or noise from the other guests The free buffet breakfast was fantastic  They had someone wearing a mask  H N  precaution  cooking fresh omelets and eggs for guests  There were numerous Chinese and Western dishes to choose from The restaurant was big and the service efficient Across the busy street  in front of the hotel  is a big supermarket  There is also a McDonalds near by  There are also banks close by  
P => Postive experience We have been positivly surprised from this hotel  The room is really big with a luxirous interior and bathroom  The bed is really comfortable and there is enough space for the luggage  The bathroom is stylish with tub and shower  The internet connection is fast and a desk for working in the room  The rooms are facing the street  it is a little noisy   but e g  with the aircondition on no problem  The spa and swimming pool area is very simple  when we went there the saunas have not even been on  But everything is clean  they provide towels etc Within a walking distance from around    min  you can reach the subway and olympia area  We would definitly recommend this hotel  
P => Pure indulgence This is a hotel worth a visit  The staff are very attentive and the rooms are some of the best in China   according to our sample  The food inthe restaurants is very good  The concierge are keen to order theatre tickets  cabs etc nothing is a troubleWe will stay here again if we go back to beijing 
P => Quality all the way I stayed at The co Polo Parkside for    days in ch        Contrary to other hotels in China  I found this hotel to be fully deserving of its   star rating Located just    minutes walk from the Bird s Nest stadium and Olympic Park  it s understated elegance and charm were a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of downtown Beijing  The standard room I stayed in was spacious  elegant  and completely quiet  BBC and CNN were available on the large flat screen TV in my room  along with free internet Each morning  a splendid Western breakfast buffet was available alongside a traditional Chinese breakfast   All in all  an excellent hotel which I hope to be visiting in the near future  
P => Good value Luxury The hotel is near the Olympic Park which is a bit remote form the centre but accessible by taxi or subway     minutes on foot from the hotel   The hotel is also located in a busy area with an excellent roast duck restaurant and a big supermarket on the opposite side  could be noisy if the room is facing the road   The room is very spacious and the fitness faciliates are excellent  Two small bottles of mineral water is provided everday free of charge  The look through bathroom is very nice  The service is also very good and the catering is nice  It is definitely a good deal when staying at this hotel at a promotional rate  The only complaint is about the mattress which is really hard  
P => Very nice I took my first trip to Beijing this past ember  a friend recommnded this hotel to me  After the long     hour  flight  I really needed a good night s sleep Upon arriving at the co Polo  I was pleasantly surprised  it looked like it did on the web   the pictures were spot on  The staff were very friendly  although most spoke very limited English   and the room was clean and warm  Everything worked just fine  and bottles of water were provided daily The only cons were that the bedsheets were pretty rough  I actually scratched up my elbows while turning over in my sleep   and the shower door wouldn t fasten properly  resulting in the bathroom floor getting soaked Otherwise  everything was great  and I d be more than willing to stay there again  
P => Below   star standard  I just stayed there for   nights  The reason I chose this hotel is just because it s a new hotel opened for just   months time  However  it s quite disappointed that the room is not so new as expected  Can you imagine that water will slip out from shower room for a new   star hotel  The staff are absolutely cool and not helpful  They will never greet any guest  The location of this hotel is just fine  It s about    minutes taxi ride from the city centre  but the problem is most taxi driver still don t know its location  Another bad experience I had is the housekeeping staff left my room door unlocked after the room cleaning  I will not recommend this hotel unless you ve got a very good rate and don t mind encounter any bad experience  I ll rate this hotel below   star standard  
P => Very Nice reasonable hotel We stayed at the riott West for an adoption homeland trip traveling with   other families  Rooms were large and nicely decorated and furnished  Had a great view of the CCTV tower from the window  I was hesitant due to location as I prefer to stay closer to the shopping and square but there was a Subway and Baskin Robbins in the front part of the property  a Pizza hut next door and a great noodle shop next door with picture menus  The staff was always helpful and kind and spoke decent English  The lobby itself was limited and small but not that big of a deal  The lobby did have Wifi access though  Breakfast buffet was also great  The location is only a ten minute cab ride to some major attractions so all in all I would stay here again  It was much nicer than previous hotels in Beijing we have stayed at  
P => Excellent Service Hi There I was at this hotel in       with Friends touring Bejing and must say that the hote was fabulous  The staff were friendly and informative  The location was a little out of the main city  but there were no issues getting around the city and downtown area  Also  the room and it amenities were excellent  
P => Not riott Standard As a frequent guest of riott facilities I would rank this as the worst riott property I have stayed at so far  The location is quite far and taxi is required  which can get tiring when you are fighting a       minute cab ride to get to San Li Tun district  which is were we spent most of our time  The other issue  well this property is in need of some upgrades and reno s  Our room had some weird sewage smell  we contacted front desk and we were upgraded but still the room felt a little tired  Staff and service were above average and no complaints there  Just issues around the condition of the hotel and the location was a little far for us  
P => Pamper yourself at the West  My husband and I were looking for a place to pamper ourselves for a couple of days after a   week long business trip to Beijing and Shanghai  We had stayed at another riott in Beijing and were looking to spend another   days at the tailend of our trip before flying out  The riott website showed no availability  but through Orbitz we got a great deal       night  on a lavish  HUGE suite in the Beijing riott West    more than worth every penny  Could not have asked for anything more comfortable and satisfying  Huge multi room suite    bathrooms  soft carpeting throughout  huge comfy king size bed with lots of soft pillows  on the   th floor near the Executive lounge with all its perks  free internet  full breakfast  happy hour with drinks and snacks  coffee and tea available    hrs day  free papers  magazines  great service   very good  polite  friendly service all around at front desk  main door  and lounge  Only downside was the overpriced and moderate quality of the hotel caffe restaurant  though the service was thorough and respectful  Many shops and places to eat with the locals within easy walking distance of the hotel  A bit dark around the entrance and parking areas at night  and a bit out of the way  but not as bad as I had heard or imagined  Taxis are easy and very cheap all over Beijing so no problem getting anywhere you want to go across the city for well under    total     we rode up to an hour in a taxi at one time and spent no more than    ever  Plus no tips are expected and the drivers are doing their best to learn some English in preparation for the Olympics  or at least have signs and recordings offering some English  Also  any hotel staff and doormen are happy to help explain where to go  and most hotels offer business cards with handy phrases and locations to visit written in both English and Chinese  to communicate with the drivers  etc  Great hotel and great quality for the price  We would stay there again anytime  
P => Spacious and attentive riott West We arrived late on the last flight from Narita which put us at the hotel around       p m  The bell staff had to be roused to help us with numerous suitcases  something we hadn t experienced with past late arrivals at different hotel chains in Beijing  But once we were at the reception desk  Simon  the desk clerk  took charge and all went according to plan  We booked a spacious suite on the Executive Floor  well worth the added expense for our five day stay The bedroom lighting console was a puzzle at first  especially when suffering jet lag  but eventually we managed the suite s rather confusing lighting system  Except for the inattentive late evening bell staff  from maids  to the front desk  to restaurants and the ex  lounge  the staff was excellent  The breakfast buffet was just average  especially Sunday morning  but we enjoyed the choice of both Chinese and western breakfast  The BIG downside of the hotel is the fitness center and pool area  From the hotel s website  I had learned the fitness center was a Ballys but the pool area is also public and shared with    s  seemed like     s  of Ballys members  No lockers were available and the locker room was really quite a mess The staff at the fitness desk was of no help  We did not use the pool  Swimming laps and working out is an important criteria for us when booking a hotel  This experience was a big disappointment  
P => pleasant stay We stayed at the riott for    days  Our first   nights  we were in room       Make sure you don t get that room   The view is completely obstructed by a glass roof  We asked  nicely  for a change and we got another room   days later  on the   th floor  The rooms are spacious and clean  The personnel was very helpful and always courteous  We were never overcharged  as I had read in some reviews  when we took a taxi directly from the hotel to the center of town vs taking a taxi down the street  Breakfast is very good  It is big buffet with a large variety of food The health club   Bally s  is great   Nice  view on the city  very large  very clean  good equipement  and it is quiet even during busy hours  The hotel is a bit far from the center of town  Without traffic  it takes about    minutes  Overall a very pleasant stay  
P => Nice clean friendly but a bit out of center The riott West Beijing is a very nice hotel with   m  to   m  rooms  The suite we stayed in was very comfortable at   m   with a good interior design and layout  Very large bathroom  Staff very friendly and at your service       English language is a bit of a problem if you have any questions other than the weather for the staff  Concierge Diana did not give best advice when requesting information on tour or shows  The hotel is the wrong side of the city if you want the tourist areas and traps  Around the riott West Hotel the people of Beijing are living and eating in cheap restaurant  I would recommend this hotel  Simon  amp  Colin Executive Lounge were very nice and professional  
P => Excellent Service Cannot fault the riott West A long term guest  over     nights in the last year  The service is excellent  This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in   the rooms are huge   The hotel is a bit out of the city centre but is easily accessible  
P => Fabulous hotel If it weren t so far away from the center of city  I would say this hotel was excellent Rooms are huge  Our room was very comfortable and cozy  Bathrooms are spacious and well lighted  also the towels were fluffy and quite large for hotel linen  Comfy bed with down pillows  and clean  clean  clean  The breakfast buffet was quite good  Lots of options both Chinese and Western  and very tasty  Free bottled water on a shelf above the salad bar  Wait staff was very attentive making sure our dirty plates didn t sit long and kept my husbands coffee cup full The whole front desk staff were helpful  knowledgeable and friendly  Two of the concierge doormen  Alan and Jason  always made sure our taxi drivers took us to the correct address  Diane found us a great tour guide  Grace  for the Great Wall  Ming Tombs and lunch  They have a Bally s Total Fitness within the hotel and we had free access to all workout facilities and the pool  
P => Absolutely wonderful     It is not very close to the centre of Beijing but this hotel is modern and luxury All the standard rooms have jacuzzi It is very clean  comfortable and new  What else can you ask for We were    in this trip and we all have the same good experience  An the taxis in Beijing are very cheap so   Highly recomended Daniel  Madrid  Spain

P => Hotel de   estrellas con un servicio pesimo  
P => Beautiful  This riott opened its doors this year and you can see it s new  I stayed in a spacious   bedroom    bathroom apartment    room is bigger than the other and has a big walk in closet and bathroom in the room  arate shower and bath tub  airco  heater can be operated in all the rooms separately  bathrooms  bedrooms and living room  The windows are big  the place is very luminous  there s a fully equipped kitchen  nice lighting    flatscreen tv s with home cinema system in the living room  dvd players  a six chair dining table  large comfortable sofa    It is the perfect venue to receive clients It s in the Chaoyang district  but more on the outskirts  But as you do everything with taxi or metro in Beijing  it will only take you   min longer  From the apartments to the riott hotel and Ritz next to the shopping center is only   min in taxi  Forbidden city is   mins away  Service was also impeccable Same day laundry  if picked up before   am  without having to pay an extra fee Swimming pool  wel equipped new gym  steambath  sauna     A perfect stay in Beijing and I will definitely stay there again  I can recommend it to everyone  Business  family trip  romantic weekend     Only downside  internet is not for free  You would expect to have free internet when you are staying in a     hotel  I don t understand why hotels still charge you for that     
P => This is the best apartment I have ever stayed in   This hotel is brand new  built in       and is absolutely beautiful  I stayed in a   bedroom    bath apartment  It has plenty of closet space  bathtub in master bedroom  washer and dryer  fully eqipped kitchen  oven  microwave  toaster oven  rice cooker    flat screen tv s  in   BR  and a DVD player  I believe there is free internet service in the room  But if you don t have a laptop the rental fees for a laptop are very expensive  It also has a gym  swimming pool and hot tub  sauna and steam room  Breakfast is included  and they serve coffee  tea  omelettes  asian foods  fruit  yogurt  pasteries  bread  etc  The Sandalwood museum is across the street  the owner of the museum owns the hotel too   The location is in the Choayang district  It is a little bit further away from the center of the city  It took about       minutes to get to the Forbidden city by taxi  with traffic of course   It s about a       taxi drive away from Yashow market  Not far from the Pearl market either  There is a high end mall that the hotel recommends that has an ATM  grocery store  and good restuarants on the top floor  About       min  taxi This apartment is extremely comfortable and roomy  you will love it  
P => great hotel hardware need improve service Stay   nights here with tourist group  the hotel itself is great in all facility setting  For ppl love swimming  the pool is excellent Olympic size and water is great  Breakfast has lots of variety to choose from  Latte machine is very handy  Now the annoy side   all the dim sum and bun are serving in COLD  Chef doing the Omlette has attitude issue and need improve greatly  Restaurant mgr eating in their mouth while serving the customer  The shower door in bathroom can t close tightly and water can t drain properly  
P => After our Cruise package City wall riott was part of a Princess cruise post package  The hotel is beautiful  the rooms quite large  The concierge service was very helpful with booking an extended stay package to the Terracotta warriors for us  They have a variety of excellent dining facilities that are very reasonable in price  The only downside is that the bathroom was about   out of   stars for cleanliness    floor abit dirty around corners and there was some blood on outside of the bathtub  But most important they have staff that speak English  and if they don t understand the request find someone who does  Also staff will wait to make sure you have understand your   answered  We had a flight delay and stayed by the airport and the  nd hotel really really made me appreciate riott  
P => Gorgeous facility outstanding breakfast Very beautiful shared facilities and rooms  Buffet breakfast was extraordinary  Only complaint is that Internet usage was expensive if you don t bring your own PC  
P => a convention hotel in a bad location This was my first trip to Beijing and I did some due diligence to make sure I am staying in a good place and in a good location  The riott City Wall was my fourth choice as my first choices  the Hilton  the Crown Plaza  and the Emperor were sold out Good things first  It is a nice hotel with nice rooms and a great Spa  It offers all the comforts for a business traveller  teh beds are awesome  the bathrooms too and it is brand new  But if you want to go out and explore this is not the hotel for you  The location is bad  City Wall says it all   On one side you can walk to the shady and hectic train stration area   I would not recommend going there  On the other side you will be blocked by a huge highway intersection area  It is far from all the major sights  I also found it quite expensive  A Club Sandwich was priced for arond    GBP  I can get that cheaper in a London hotel or in a NYC hotel  The riott City Wall is actually a convention hotel and is ideal for huge convention crowds  It felt to me that there were only a handful travellers in the hotel   The huge bar below was always empty  Next time  I will make sure I am staying in a better area where you just can go out and walk around 
P => Great place to stay  Husband and I landed in Beijing and the riott City Wall was our first hotel during our China stay  It was clean and modern  The room was spacious and had a nice televison with a decent amount of English speaking stations  The breakfast was one of the best that we had and included an omlet station and quite a few English and Chinese selections  The first night that we arrived  one of the chefs from the restaraunt brought out a new dish that he had prepared and offered it to our group to try  It was excellent even though I was surprised that our first night in China we were being offered  quot pizza  quot  He had done a fine job and even had fresh basil as one of the toppings  I was more than content with the wonderful bedding and pillows and wouldn t think twice about staying in this five star hotel again  
P => Others should learn from the BEST This was our last hotel on our trip to China and best  The service was slick the decor beautiful and the staff extremely friendly  The Spa area was to die for with everything you needed to pamper yourself  Once again riott does it  Others could learn a thing or two from those boys  riot Brothers    Matti Dickinson  Perth Australia 
P => Wonderful place to stay This hotel is definitely one of the best hotels in Beijing  We stayed there for   nights  The service is excellent  The buffet breakfast is so far the best I ever had  there is a very nice swimming pool  We stayed at the top floor and facing north  you can see the whole city  The location is convenient  Subway is a couple of blocks away  The only thing that is not so good is the Beijing railroad station nearby  There are always a huge crowd around the railroad station  We were told to be careful around the area Overall this is an excellent hotel  We lovel it  
P => FANTASTIC Hotel is located on southwest corner of Jianguomen South Avenue and Beijing Station East Rd  Two subway stations are close by and walking distance  You can take Line   to Jianguomen Station and take Exit C  walk south   block or you can take Line   to Beijing Railway Station and take Exit C  walk east       block  You need to walk about    minutes to restaurants  closes restaurant is west of Beijing Railway Station  about   blocks from hotel  Hotel is restaurants  whirlpool  sauna  room is very nice decorated to american standards  bed is excellent and soft  Internet is    RMB for   hours  so as long as you log off after use  time can be continued through duration of stay  We used only    hours for   days total  Ask the consierge for map of Beijing and study the metro subway as this is the most efficient way of getting around  Cost for subway is   yuan for single journey  one direction   
P => Best riott I have ever stayed in This was the best riott I had ever stayed in     Very large and very plush rooms   Hotel public areas very modern and chic   Superb swimming pool and surroundings   Right next to Beijing railway station    Helpful staff    Great bar and restaurantsA couple of niggles will reduce the score from a perfect    to maybe    My coffee machine had some stale milk from earlier and some other abberation I cant remember But brilliant nevertheless  
P => This is the best hotel i have ever stayed in in my life Everything about this hotel was fantastic  The staff   the hotel facilities  the food  the rooms  i could go on and on and on and they all get   stars from me  The breakfast was out of this world  I usually am not fond of breakfast in hotels because i never think it is worth it  but the breakfast here is unreal and well worth the money  I can t imagine ever been in hotel again that will top this place  
P => Beautiful Hotel Some Flaws I arranged for the hotel to pick me up at the airport  They used the VIP service and picked me up at the gate of the plane and took me through the VIP private exit where an old run down smelly car was waiting for me  The car was clearly a  rd party contractor and was a bit of a let down after the gate pick up and escorted exit  The hotel was sort of isolated and in a business district away from everything  My room was beautiful and the hotel was amazingly decorated  It sort of made me think what Donald Trump would have decorated a hotel like  I ordered room service for dinner because there was no where to go nearby and I was exhausted  After about    minutes I received a call from room service stating they were out of my food  I was pretty ticked off since I was hungry and why did it take so darn long to tell me that  I ordered something else and it was just OK  I am sort of a slow eater and like to pick at my food for awhile so I usually keep the tray for several hours  I decided to take advantage of the whirlpool tub and while I was in the tub room service came back to retrieve their tray  without me asking   I had put the DND on the door so I was a bit surprised when they knocked and rang the bell repeatedly for several minutes saying  quot room service  here for tray quot   I was horrified when after knocking and me not answering  I was in the tub    they decided to let themselves into my room  I had the bar done on my door so they couldn t get in  I yelled come back later at that point  and they did     minutes later  I found that really annoying  I am riott Gold so I had access to the executive lounge and ate breakfast there in the morning  I am an early riser so I think I was the first person there and apparently the cook doesn t show up later  So  if you want eggs you have to have them ordered from the kitchen  I wanted eggs  so I waited for them to come from the kitchen  Oh well  I am not trying to complain too much about this hotel  As I said it was really nice and the room was comfortable  I travel all over China and have come to expect these same issues at other hotels  staff letting themselves into your room when you don t answer  and very slow check outs  If you have business in the area I would recommend this hotel  Otherwise  don t go out of your way to stay here  It is not a tourist hotel either  
P => Best riott I ve stayed in I stay at about two dozen hotels every year  and this has to be one of the best hotels I ve seen  I also stayed at   different hotels while in China  including a Sheraton   This was easily the best one  Very new hotel  very clean  and very well managed  a rarity in China   The staff at the hotel were also great  and they all spoke English relatively well  which was a blessing after my experiences at other hotels in China  The location is a bit awkward  but it s close to the main railway station  and taxis are easy enough to find  If taking the subway  either go to Beijing Railway Station  then walk east to the hotel  or Jiangomen Station  then walk south to the hotel  Be warned  most taxi drivers don t know where this hotel is  too new   You will have to direct them to the Beijing Railway Station  get a print out from Google maps in Chinese   and the hotel is about    m east of there  Once at the hotel  ask the concierge desk for their directions card which will solve all your taxi problems  Also  showing the riott logo will get you closer to where you want to go than telling taxi drivers the hotel street name I stayed in the Executive Tower D    th floor  The room was very nice and large  Ample workspace  great bathroom  separate tub and shower  which was great  with a large glass window to the room that gives the bathroom an even lighter and larger feel   and of course  the great riott bed  best beds in the hotel industry for my money   Lots of English channels on the TV  CNN  BBC  CNBC  MTV  etc   The concierge executive lounge on the   th floor is amazing  best I ve seen at a riott  Full breakfast  with omelet station   and great appetizers every night  all free  of course   The hotel has a few great restaurants and each night one of their chefs mans the kitchen upstairs and has a sample of their food as part of the appetizers  The executive lounge staff were amazing  very polite and genuinely helpful  If you have the option of staying in the executive tower  definitely do it  The manager  who I think is from New Zealand  came by the lounge every morning and evening to check on things and did the  quot meet and greet quot  with the guests  Very nice touch  Thank you for the travel tips  Colin if you read this The hotel also has an indoor pool and spa  The pool is decent size  and clean  There are hot tubs and saunas in the men and women s locker rooms  yes  the hot tubs are separate  which was a bummer   The locker rooms are very clean and have everything you might possibly need The hotel is within walking distance of Silk Alley ket  which is a worthwhile experience even if you don t buy anything     minute walk  northeast  get directions from concierge desk  If going to the Great Wall  don t do the  quot coach tour quot  recommended by the concierge desk  It s a day full of being sold different stuff  jade  tea  herbs  etc   at ridiculous prices  Either take a private tour  or take a hiking tour  Might cost you a bit more  but a much more pleasant experience If I ever go back to Beijing  this will be my first hotel choice  
P => Terrific stay   Superb Hotel We have stayed at the riott City Wall  Beijing for one week in ch      and it was pure pleasure and delight  It was our  nd time in Beijing and the first time in this hotel  as this was just build in        We upgraded to the next higher category and had access to the executive floor and lounge and therefore  breakfast  dinner drinks and snacks available  The appetizers snacks were different every night and offered a fantastics variety of japanes chinese and European cuisine   delicious  Everyone in the hotel was very friendly and helpful  the room was lovely and quite huge and offerend all amenities you might need  The lobby bar and restaurant offered terrific snacks and drinks and the Italian restaurant was also good if you longed for a change  We would always come back to this place without any doubt  
P => Great First Hotel when arriving in China  After a long    hour flight from Washington Dulles airport  we arrived in Beijing  Our first hotel with our Vantage Tour group was at the Beijing City Wall riott  What a hotel  My room reminded me of the Mandarin Oriental in Miami  Florida  Excellent service  Wanting to use my computer  I did not have the right adapter  Five times  a gentlemen came and helped me with my problem  The last time  it worked and he had the right adapter  I was impressed with his determination to  quot get it right quot   The hotel breakfast   wow   something else  Western and Eastern food   this was the beginning of my gaining weight on this    day tour  We ate at the Chinese Restaurant  and yes  there were some language problems  but you could not discount the employees trying their best to  quot get it right quot   The only negative thing that happened was when I was writing my signature on a travelers check   they would not cash it  because on my signature I went  quot below the line quot  and marked over the digits and the  quot Bank of China quot  would not accept it  So  be careful when you sign in front of them  and do NOT sign beyond the line area and cross the digits on the travelers checks Hotel room was beautiful  I have read the other reviews on  quot bad smells quot   but I never heard or experienced any of that  And we were there for   nights with a tour group  Because of the marble floors  the hole is needed to drain any excess water  but never did I smell anything bad  I was impressed with the hotel room  that I took several pictures of it Walked   minutes to the subway  Concierge helped me on how to get there  Crossing the street   watch out  Follow the Chinese  It can be scary  but it is doable  Pedestrians here do not have the  quot right of way quot   Took the subway and made my way to the NEST and the CUBE  The place has two subway stations  and the place is huge  I went to the Olympic store  No one there spoke English  but through hand signs  and gestures  I got what I wanted  People on the tour were jealous that I actually got official Olympic t shirts and souvenirs  with the tags that say so  Also went to the Silk ket which was a short subway away  Loved it  Learned to love  quot haggling quot   From the subway  you can go underground and enter the SIlk ket through the basement floor  rather than try to cross the street  Three times I was helped by the local people to get me through the subway  No Chinese or English was spoken  Just gestures  I have never felt so welcome by random people in one of the most populous cities I have even seen  I love China  Around the corner  and if you get up early enough  you will see the locals do their morning exercise  Across the street  you see students go through their morning exercise also  before school starts  It was interesting to watch Hotel internet was pricey  but I used it anyways  For the first time American visitor to China  you will like this place  Beyond any normal American hotel  Just have an open mind  try and taste the local foods  The hotel atmosphere in the lobby seems cold and lonely  but you quickly get used to it  Only one time did I go down  and the bar was crowded  It must have been some local group or something Go to THIS riott in Beijing  You will love it  
P => Great hotel Took the airport shuttle bus to the main railroad station  then about a    minute walk to the hotel  It s kinda weird how far the shuttle bus drops you off from the railroad station  the cost of the hotel shuttle bus is   RMB  The hotel is pretty new  breakfast was included which was nice and ample  I stayed in tower D and the lounge on the   th floor had three computers with free internet access  The room was large  as was the bathroom    minute walk to the railroad station which also has a subway station  It took about    minutes on the subway to get to the Olympic park    transfers   and about    minutes to Tian amen square Forbidden city  I tried to take the train back to the airport  but the cab driver just dropped me off at the station from where the airport train departs  but could not find the actual train station  only the subway station  this is not the main railroad station   I ended up taking a cab to the airport which cost   RMB  Would definitely stay here again  very nice and new  modern comfortable hotel with good service  
P => A wonderful hotel  My partner and I stayed there for three nights in ember and enjoyed the hotel tremendously  Everything was perfect   customer service  room  breakfast  location  Wish we had been there for longer  We ll definitely stay there when we go again  
P => Fantastic modern hotel with all facilities Stayed for one night using Reward PointsUpgraded to an Executive room  Great room  with superb views over Beijing  Room very modern and all facilities you d expect from riott 
P => expensive internet    Bad location except for the train station   dirty carpet  look clean but when you take a closer look  the edges are yukkie   expensive internet access US        per day   terrible Chinese dumpling  taste like leftover   Beds great   bad view  male hospital across my room   breakfast at   am to   am  always full with tourists   long line on the egg counter for breakfast    better guest service 
P => Loved the riott  We stayed at the riott City Wall in Beijing for three nights in ember     This newly constructed hotel is gorgeous inside and out  Check in was smooth and we were given a room on a higher floor upon request  The rooms are spacious and quiet  given that it is alonside a busy street and within a five minute walk to the central train station  The breakfast buffet is excellent and there are many fresh choices  including Chinese  Japanese and Western breakfast choices  There are many juice and bakery choices too  The pool and spa were out of this world  The pool is an Olympic size heated pool that was clean and gorgeous  Now for the spa  I ve been to several five star resort spas and this definitely takes the cake  I had a massage that included a bath  The masseuse was extremely professional and obviously very experienced  The bath was in a private room that included rose petals  candles and aromatherapy oils  So relaxing and reasonably priced  They were running a     off promotion while we were there  but they are pretty decent without the discount Great hotel in a wonderful location  Highly recommended 
P => Beautiful  Great Hotel  new  clean  first class  Close to the bejing Bus station and many busses run by  Taxi s are cheap  Not a busy area   good for business traveler  Wonderfully exclusive business center  Don t expect the staff to know much English    but they are helpful CLEAN  Beautiful architecture and room design  If you are an Executive member   they cannot be any more doting I would give this an A Yes  consistently riott  
P => Fantastic Hotel Amazing  The best service that I have ever had anywhere  This new beautiful hotel has incredible service and amenities  Absolutly flawless  usualy when I travel I prefer to spend as little time as possible in my hotel and enjoy the local surrondings  thats why I travel  I was blown away by the service in this hotel  five star service without a doubt  Go see for yourself you will be amazed  Bartender Tim and manager Susn Liu in the lobby bar will make you feel at home  truly amazing service  Thank You riott City Wall Sobe  Terrence Connolly Miami Beach FL  
P => Great room   excellent value for money  Stayed for   nights at this hotel in ober     I had just come from the JW riott at Shanghai  Paying half the rate  but getting a bigger room that was beautiful  well equipped and luxurious  it was excellent value for money  Sure  it may not be in the best of locations  but taxis are cheap in Beijing  The Executive lounge was also huge and well appointed  Overall  a very pleasant stay  I will be back  
P => A Refuge Just returned from a three night stay in Beijing and while my impression of Beijing was not favourable  my stay at the riott Beijing City Wall was a very good experience The room was very nice and the staff was excellent  I had communications with all levels of staff and except for the maid  had no problems with English and it was always very polite  helpful and courteous  One early morning  I asked for a cab to take my wife and me to church  St  Joseph s Catholic Church   the bellhop hailed a cab and between him and the doorman  they made sure the cabbie knew where to take us  Another occasion of note  when we were leaving for the airport and our luggage was being loaded into the cab  the bellhop handed me a piece of paper with the taxi s plate number and a number to call in case we have problems  and told me to expect the price to be around    RMB  On our evening returns to the hotel  the staff was always pleasant and greeted us with a smile The location  while not very central was also far from the maddening crowd  just as far as the driveway  On the other side of the property is the remnants of the  quot city wall quot  and a park  and two subway stops are within walking distance Starbucks is a   minute walk away and there is a Blenz in the Henderson Shopping Plaza  opens later in the morning   if you need your coffee fix Beijing is not a pedestrian friendly city and subways can be crowded while taxis can get swallowed by the chaotic traffic  but both modes are very cheap The hotel is a five star property but there is stiff competition out there  especially with the Olympics over  So check the rates  
P => New Hotel with Great or Staff still learning This new hotel was beautifully decorated and in a convenient location  with easy access to central Beijing  The restaurants were good  but very few people were staying at the hotel meaning the restaurants and bars lacked atmosphere  The Executive lounge was spacious and the selection of food and drink very impressive considering the number of people using the lounge  All in all  a very nice experience  The only downside was the staff who are clearly still learning their jobs  Concierge service consisted of giving out maps and they were unable to provide any greater assistance in terms of advice or recommendations  And  checking out revealed miss billings from restaurants which were not easily removed by the front desk staff  
P => Bright future for new Beijing hotel Newest riott property to open in Beijing  and it is big  over       rooms   Although with separate towers and separate elevators it didn t seem that large  They are still working out some of the kinks and not everything is open yet  for example  shops still under development  one bar not open   Apparently they just did a soft opening a few days before the Beijing Olympics started  I stayed here the  rd week in tember Good sized room and everything is clean and new  Combination bathtub and separate shower side by side with marble surround  Executive Lounge on   th floor of one of the towers  there are two towers that have an executive club  is huge and stocked with drinks and goodies to eat and four PC workstations hooked up to internet with b amp w printers and HP scanners  This is clearly the largest executive lounge of any riott I have stayed in  I think it is about the size of my house in California Cushy riott beds and flat panel TV s with CNN  Bloomberg  HBO  MSNBC and all the China TV stations  Individually controlled digital thermostat made for good a c for hot summer months Hotel boasts   different restaurants  Excellent buffet breakfast in Bistro with eggs made any style  fruit  fresh juice  pastries galore  salads  salmon  meats  and Asian dishes  Lunch and dinner ala carte menus in the Bistro are somewhat limited as to choices   think they may eventually have buffet at lunch but did not during my stay   Chicken sandwich with avocado and peppers and cheese for lunch was very good  Java  Cafe has pastries for breakfast and lots of hot and cold sandwichs and fruit drinks  milkshakes and coffee drinks for lunch  Open and bright with cafe tables and chairs  Provincia is supposed to be an Italian Mediterranean restaurant but only had one pasta dish on the menu  Again  friendly wait staff but poor English skills  poor knowledge of dishes and disorganized service  The menu can best be described as a bunch of tapas type dishes with no real standouts and nothing I could really sink my teeth in to  Two Asian restaurants which I didn t have a chance to try are in the hotel   one Chinese and other Thai Japanese Indian food choices  Modern and trendy  open lobby bar and more intimate Ruby Bar  I peeked in but the Ruby Bar is not scheduled to open until late ober  Staff s English skills are not the best as compared to other   and   star hotels in Beijing but you can make do  Lady at the Concierge desk was not very knowledgable  could not locate the Temple of Heaven on map   the bellmen seemed to be more knowlegable Location   sort of halfway between Silk ket and Forbidden City Tiananmen Square      minutes walk in opposite directions from hotel to each of those sights  Very close to subway line   Jianguomen station  which is a block and a half from this hotel  Nearby park with parts of old city walls still standing is nice with open space  grass area  flowers  with lots of benches  Other various high rise shopping malls are within walking  subway or taxi distance  If going to any sights along Jianguomen Road  Forbidden City  Tiananmen Square  Silk ket  Wanfujian Shopping street  China World  etc   I would recommend the subway  less expensive  quicker  no connections transfers and when it rains  taxis are hard to find and want to charge you off the meter   Unless of course you have a lot to carry up and down the stairs of the subway stations Since hotel is so new taxis may have trouble finding it  My taxi only read the  quot riott quot  part of the Chinese hotel card and took me to the JW riott instead  Bellman at JW talked to the taxi driver and explained to him how to take me to the right riott Right now they have promotional rates so very good value  not sure what the regular rates will finally be  This could be a really fine   star property if the staff service  knowledge and communication skills improve and restaurant menus expand  
P => Un hotel muy chulo   
P => Comfortable and peaceful place to say We stayed here for   nights during our   day sight seeing tour  From the time of our arrival to the point of departure we were served and treated with utmost courtesy and care  The facilities were just what you want after a long and hard day taking in the sights of Beijing  The breakfast  included with accommodation  was very good  full of choice and variety  The hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle of the city traffic  The hotel charges  as with most Beijing hotels these days  was a bit too outlandish   Pity   Otherwise  this hotel is the one to stay  
P => Great Hotel Cannot understand some of the other poor reviews  overall this is a great hotel Did my research and chose this hotel from loads of others and glad I did  Got ripped off when leaving Beijing Airport from a useless taxi driver and charged        x the normal amount  Dont use a black taxi use the ones with the price stated on the rear door   the taxi is   tone in colour and bottom half is red  Should cost no more than     and journey time         minutes Make sure you have the address of this hotel in chinese script and not english as taxi drivers don t understand or call the hotel reception and get them to speak to the driver  Check in was very quick and easy with no hassle at      am  The whole hotel is set away from the main road so quite and peaceful  Rooms are first class  clean  tidy and large with very comfortable beds and pillows  Bathroom big enough and comes clean with useful extras like shampoo and toothbrush etc Also the mini bar is not too expensive when compared to other hotels of this standard also in room tea and coffee making facility  Internet in the room is via a cable and free  YES FREE  Very modern layout and colour scheme in the rooms and throughout the hotel  They have an internet room and business centre next to reception with very good rates if you need a fax e mail etc Good selection of food outlets and restaurants locally and also chance to buy small items coffee and milk etc  Also large retail outlet  Easy to get a bus taxi or mopped transport into city centre Staff are very very helpful and they have good English  The biggest surprise was receiving a knock at the bedroom door at       am and I received a birthday cake to celebrate on behalf of the hotel team and management  I cannot tell you how impressed I was and so happy  Made my birthday very special indeed  THANK YOU MERCURE     The hotel lies halfway between   metro stations and is an easy walk and safe at any time day or night  Takes about        minutes to walk and the once there journey time is    minutes downtown  Cost is only    return The price was excellent and for this standard you cannot complain  You cant get a hostel in Europe for this price The hotel restaurant is okay and have a mixed menu of meals  Tried the breakfast once and it was very disappointing cold coffee and food was so so and quite expensive Overall     out of    and the staff try very hard to make your stay a good one and if they dont have the answer theyll try thier best to get it  
P => Second to none      I did my homework on Tripadvisor and selected this hotel out of countless hotels in Beijing  I really hit the jackpot  The hotel is located away from the noise of Beijing streets and is a welcome place to call home after a day filled with seeing the sights  You can count on a peaceful night of rest in outstanding accommodations  The entire hotel is absolutely spotless  The gym is the envy of any gym in the USA  Great swimming pools for the kids  the most modern gym equipment and opened early in the morning until late in the evening  Also has a spa with very good rates for a massage after a tour of the Great Wall of China The staff are helpful and make you fill right at home  They go out of their way to  quot baby you quot  and pamper you to ensure that your stay is first class  I have been traveling for thirty years and you can pay so much more for a hotel of this quality and still not receive the level of service  The manager  Ms  y Goh  is sincerely interested in the comfort of the guests so do not be surprised if you are approached by a friendly lady asking you what can be done to make your stay more enjoyable  My response was  quot Everything is just perfect  quot The hotel is located about a five minute walk from the Line One on the subway  During rush hour you will get a train every ten seconds once one train leaves  During regular times every minute  You are exactly thirty minutes from The Forbidden City  The price of the subway fare is under    cents  More convenient than a taxi ride  The subway and trains are very clean  In fact  you will be hard pressed to even find a piece of trash on the streets in Beijing  This is the safest city I have ever been to in my life  So if you are a female traveler  you do not need to have any worries about being out late at night in the city  If you wish to take a cab remember that taxis are very inexpensive so you also have this option  I stayed at this hotel a total of eight nights  Believe me  there are so many wonderful sights and places to explore in Beijing  You really need a place to rest up after the long flight from Dallas and after each day in Beijing  The beds were comfortable with plush sheets  The rooms are large and the showers are fantastic  The value for the price is simply outstanding  
P => Nice hotel but too far away from attractions for first time tourists Stayed at this hotel based on other reviews and the Top Value rating  We were very satisfied with the hotel and its staff  but any savings on the cost of the hotel were eaten up by the time and expense of traveling to the major attractions  
P => New friends  Coming to China for the second time  I was excited about meeting more friendly people and the Mercure did not disapoint  The entire staff  from busboy and maid to front desk and general manager exceeded service and friendliness  I have traveled the world over and stayed at all the major hotels  and never have I seen such integrity  honesty  genuine smiles and just plain nice folks Michael  the General Manager treats each guest as important  stopping to say HI in the halls or at breakfast  Allen at the front desk was so helpful  He showed my   year old the fish in the lobby and let him feed them  Then Allen gave my son his very own Chinese name  From that point on  all the front desk staff called him by this name  which was so special for my son Its one thing to travel to a foreign country  see some neat sites and eat some good food   its another to make friends and feel right at home Will I come back to the Mercure  I m already planning my next trip  
P => Surprising Gem provides great value I am writing this review on our  rd day at the hotel   using the excellent  and free  internet connection Before we reserved the room I did my usual search for reviews and found nothing useful  Unfortunately  the photos on the Hotel s website are generic ones from European locations that do not do justice to the beautifully finished interior For us the location was the most important thing as we were visiting Family who live within walking distance  However  I believe that this location has advantages to any traveler  Located adjacent to  quot ring five quot  it is easily accessible from the airport without dealing with Beijing horrific traffic  If you are planning to travel around the city by car you will find the location very convenient  For people who want to visit the central area there is a subway station a few minutes walk away  which will take you to the Forbidden City area in about       minutes  The trains are clean and modern and arrive every minute during rush hour  One interesting surprise was the cost     Yuan  down from   last year  for unlimited single trip  In USD it translates to less than    cents   As expected  the trains can be packed and seats are scarce but to people familiar with subways this is one of the best One of the better things about the hotel is the price which is about a third of similar hotels in central Beijing  considering the free Internet and true four star quality this is a bargain package that cannot be beat The Hotel has two restaurants   Western and Chinese   that seem very nice and we are planning on using in the near future  Surprisingly  the locals consider the Chinese restaurant one of  if not the  best in the area  We will be having a party for family and friends there I expect to update this review later  but felt that I should post something now for the next person who looks for a review and cannot find one  
P => Excellent Stay Friendly and Hospitable Staff I had such a great stay at the Mercure Wanshang in Beijing  As an individual who has travelled to China before  it was by far the best hotel experience I ve ever had  The staff was extremely hospitable and were eager to help with whatever problem I encountered  The manager  Michael  was visible at all times and made me feel very at home  You could tell he treated his staff with respect as they all were very happy to help us  Our rooms were cleaned every day  and the gym is world class   I highly recommend staying at the Mercure when visiting Beijing

P => Nice hotel but too far away from attractions for first time tourists Stayed at this hotel based on other reviews and the Top Value rating  We were very satisfied with the hotel and its staff  but any savings on the cost of the hotel were eaten up by the time and expense of traveling to the major attractions  
P => New friends  Coming to China for the second time  I was excited about meeting more friendly people and the Mercure did not disapoint  The entire staff  from busboy and maid to front desk and general manager exceeded service and friendliness  I have traveled the world over and stayed at all the major hotels  and never have I seen such integrity  honesty  genuine smiles and just plain nice folks Michael  the General Manager treats each guest as important  stopping to say HI in the halls or at breakfast  Allen at the front desk was so helpful  He showed my   year old the fish in the lobby and let him feed them  Then Allen gave my son his very own Chinese name  From that point on  all the front desk staff called him by this name  which was so special for my son Its one thing to travel to a foreign country  see some neat sites and eat some good food   its another to make friends and feel right at home Will I come back to the Mercure  I m already planning my next trip  
P => Surprising Gem provides great value I am writing this review on our  rd day at the hotel   using the excellent  and free  internet connection Before we reserved the room I did my usual search for reviews and found nothing useful  Unfortunately  the photos on the Hotel s website are generic ones from European locations that do not do justice to the beautifully finished interior For us the location was the most important thing as we were visiting Family who live within walking distance  However  I believe that this location has advantages to any traveler  Located adjacent to  quot ring five quot  it is easily accessible from the airport without dealing with Beijing horrific traffic  If you are planning to travel around the city by car you will find the location very convenient  For people who want to visit the central area there is a subway station a few minutes walk away  which will take you to the Forbidden City area in about       minutes  The trains are clean and modern and arrive every minute during rush hour  One interesting surprise was the cost     Yuan  down from   last year  for unlimited single trip  In USD it translates to less than    cents   As expected  the trains can be packed and seats are scarce but to people familiar with subways this is one of the best One of the better things about the hotel is the price which is about a third of similar hotels in central Beijing  considering the free Internet and true four star quality this is a bargain package that cannot be beat The Hotel has two restaurants   Western and Chinese   that seem very nice and we are planning on using in the near future  Surprisingly  the locals consider the Chinese restaurant one of  if not the  best in the area  We will be having a party for family and friends there I expect to update this review later  but felt that I should post something now for the next person who looks for a review and cannot find one  
P => Excellent Stay Friendly and Hospitable Staff I had such a great stay at the Mercure Wanshang in Beijing  As an individual who has travelled to China before  it was by far the best hotel experience I ve ever had  The staff was extremely hospitable and were eager to help with whatever problem I encountered  The manager  Michael  was visible at all times and made me feel very at home  You could tell he treated his staff with respect as they all were very happy to help us  Our rooms were cleaned every day  and the gym is world class   I highly recommend staying at the Mercure when visiting Beijing   
P => Super Hotel   Schlechte Lage  
P => Kein POOL schlechte Lage  Gute Zimmerausstattung  
P => Excellent realistic Chinese Courtyard Accommodation We can t recommend this hotel enough  It really is an authentic Chinese Courtyard hotel in a good location in Beijing  We stayed in a deluxe suite room with en suite  which was a good size and very clean  The bathroom is a little small but the amenities were fine  The staff were very helpful in arranging taxi s and tours  Use of the computer and internet were free  Breakfast was served in the  quot courtyard quot  and although only a small selection of food  it was adequate but unfortunately the freshly brewed coffee was luke warm  If you want to feel part of the community  this hotel is fantastic  
P => Very warm and helpful staff Hi I had made a reservation to stay at Michael s House after reading the many glowing reviews  The reservation process was easy and during our stay  most of the staff were very warm and helpful What I liked most about the hotel was how the room and the lobby was so traditional and different from the usual hotels that one stays in  And because there were not so many people  because Michael s House doesn t have as many rooms as those other usual hotels   faces become familiar and you see strangers befriending and exchanging travel tips etc  Quite nice I thought Location   I personally liked the fact that just right outside the alley to Michael s House  there was a night market  So when you felt like supper  you could simply walk out to buy some roasted chestnut  fruits  popcorn  from the nearby cinema  or smelly toufu  And if you are adventureous enough  there are other food too  A small minus was the distance to the subway station  Given the extremely cold weather when I was there  the walk to the subway station was a tad far for my liking  After a long day  it was tiring  and cold  to walk that   min  I reckon it s about        m from Exit A  the nearest exit to hotel  of Jinshuitan station to the hotel   We took the subway for the first couple of days  after which  we found it too tiring and cold to walk  and ended up taking the taxi for most days  Facilities   The room we had was very clean and pleasant  And there is free internet access in the rooms  And if you didn t bring your own laptop or netbook  you could use the PC placed outside in the common area  I think this is quite thoughtful of the owners  There is also cable tv in the rooms  However  during out stay  the cable tv reception was quite poor  So on nights when we got back early  there wasn t much to do since we couldn t receive the cable tv properly  It kept freezing  But I guess that shouldn t be too much of an issue since one wouldn t be there to watch tv  Oh  and like most heated water tanks in winter  we had  on a couple of occasions  ran out of heated water while in the shower and had to wait  So space out when you take your baths All in all  while there were some areas of improvement  I think that it was quite an experience  For people who don t mind the fact that Michael s House is a little off the central  and who are looking for a courtyard house type accommodation  I would recommend staying here  
P => Cozy and friendly courtyard for socializing The most comfortable bed I have slept in for quite some time  Nice breakfast and cozy courtyard    of us also booked a private tour to the Mutinyou section of the great wall and car  guide and experience were all very positive Only suggestion is that they should add a light in the closet so you can see in your suitcase  
P => Excellent Michael s House combines authentic old Chinese qualities with the warmth of welcome and feeling of friendly support you might find at the house of a personal friend in your home country  The place stands in a small lane amongst the usual clutter and activity of Beijing s streets  ten minutes  walk from the nearest subway  underground railway  station  I agree with another comment I read that it s more like a B amp B in atmosphere but none the worse for that  If you want a   star international hotel  go somewhere else  and pay   times the price   I wish Michael and his family continued and deserved success  Great  
P => Felt more like a B The purpose of my trip was to visit universities like Bei Da  Beijing Normal and Renmin  so the location in the Haidian District was very convenient  The subway is a short    minute walk away  past street vendors selling roasted chestnuts  etc  It was nice feeling like I was living in a real neighborhood  not in a touristy part of the city  Lydia and the other staff were lovely    from trying to hail a cab for me in the middle of a fluke Halloween snow storm to writing all sorts of little notes for me in Chinese  they made the stay so much easier  Some of my Chinese colleagues scoffed when I told them where I was staying but they were all charmed when they came inside to pick me up and I noticed that many of them stopped by the front desk to pick up a business card on the way out  The breakfast  vegan vegetarian friendly   and lounge area is very comfortable and was great for impromptu meetings  My room had a kind of funky new age feel to it that I really liked  
P => Warm Inviting Quiet Place If you want a nice place to stay in a real Beijing neighborhood that s off the beaten path  this is it  It s not fancy  but it has everything you need for a good night s sleep  a place to relax  and a good breakfast  I ve stayed in many five star hotels in Beijing and did so for a few days on this trip  I vastly prefer Michaels House  
P => Michael s House in Beijing     best part of our holiday in China  My mum and I stayed at Michael s House in Beijing for our first   nights in China and we absolutely loved it We found the booking procedure relatively straightforward and pre arrival communication with the Front Office Manager  Sean  to be very good  his English is excellent  I asked a lot of picky questions about the room and bathroom and Sean gave me very clear and honest answers  I requested a specific room  N   in my booking and was happy that we were able to get it Sean had emailed me in advance with directions in Mandarin to give to the taxi driver when we arrived  with very clear info on how long it would take from the station etc etc We were given a very warm and friendly welcome when we arrived at Michael s House  We were a little concerned that our chosen room was so close to the public lounge area and were worried that it may be a bit noisy  however  despite there being a fair number of guests around  the room was in fact extremely quiet and peaceful and we were extremely happy with it throughout our stay The room was spotlessly clean  the sheets and other bed linen immaculate and while the bathroom was small it was perfectly adequate and clean with plenty of hot water in the shower and a full array of bathroom amenities For breakfast there was a great selection of both western and Chinese food  tho we recommend to you get in early before the scrambled eggs or dumplings get cold We had dinner one night while we stayed there  the menu is pretty limited but perfectly sufficient and while we wouldn t say the food was spectacular it certainly met our needs and wasn t expensive Michael was away when we d arrived so his lovely wife  Joanna  was a great help to us in planning our activities and very kindly arranged for one of the front office girls  Lydia to go out with us on our first day as an unofficial guide  We had so much fun with Lydia that we asked if she could come out again the next day  but she was working so Joanna arranged for Miranda  Lydia s co worker  to come instead  We had a great time with both of the girls and were deeply touched when neither of them would accept payment from us We felt so completely home at Michael s that we really didn t want to leave  The warmth  friendliness and hospitality of Michael  Joanna and his staff made our introduction to China very special and no other part of our holiday lived up to it  We will cherish our memories of this special little hotel for many years to come and I hope that we will get to go back there again one day Thank you  Michael  Joanna  Sean  Lydia  Miranda and the rest of team for a wonderful time Lindsay FlakelarCentral JavaIndonesia 
P => Exactly what I expected   a great hotel After reading numerous reviews on this site  we chose Michael s Hotel to stay in for   nights in late ober  We booked   nights in the Emperor s Suite and   nights in the Standard Double room  We wanted to live like kings  but only for   nights    And live like kings we did  When we arrived we went straight to our room and were delighted that it looked exactly like the pictures  A giant bed  small but stylish bathroom and our own computer with Internet access  We arrived rather late and asked if it would be possible to book a tour to the Great Wall at Simitai the next day  While we went out to grab some street food down the street  the desk clerk put it all together and we were able to catch mini bus the next morning to take us to to the wall  All the clerks at the hotel speak English  some better than others  but probably the best English you ll encounter for most of your trip The hotel is about     blocks from the Jishuitan subway station  which is about a   minute walk and you only have to cross one major road  The hotel is located down an alley  which can make it hard for cab drivers to find when dropping you off  however  there are a million cabs once you exit the alley and the hotel is very accommodating if you need anything  We asked the clerk to translate some dishes we could order at a nearby restaurant  since most of the nearby restaurants are quite small and they don t speak much English  and the staff made sure to tend to any need we had They serve a decent breakfast that s part of your room cost and there s coffee and tea whenever you like it  And there s one main computer for hotel guests to use if you need to email or check directions  The hotel owner also wisely invested in a separate phone line that links directly to North America  This came in quite handy when I urgently needed to call Visa about my card  And the hotel did not charge me for the call  so nice I hope this review is helpful in making a decision about where you will stay during your visit to Beijing  
P => Hotel rooms looked gorgeous  Hostel rooms were really gross  My intention was to book a private room  but I accidentally booked the  quot Private twin   Shared bathroom quot   I did not realize that this room was the tatami mat room  so keep that in mind with this review  I am reviewing the hostel part of this hotel  not the fancy hotel part  so bear that in mind  I ve stayed in many hostels before  and this one was on the gross side The tatami room reeked of mould  That s just a problem that comes from leaving a futon in a tiny room all day without air conditioning  they turn it off when they clean to save energy   The snacks were well past expired  not that you d come to a hostel for the snacks  but I thought I d mention it   The room was situated right next to the street on the main level  Elderly women would take care of their babies right in front of the windows  close the blinds   If you are a light sleeper  the sounds of screaming children can wake you up super early  even if you are using ear plugs   All of those things are things you can deal with for a hostel  but what really grossed me out was the shared bathroom  There is only one shower tucked away in the back behind the kitchen  You have to pack a knapsack full of your clean clothes  towels  and toiletries and bring it with you across the lobby to the other side of the building  The one shower is used by both men and women hostel guests and the staff alike  so you can end up waiting in a long line for a shower  The shower door has frosted glass for privacy  but it s not all that private  Anyone who walks along the hallway can see a fuzzy outline of you  As a woman travelling alone  I wan t comfortable dressing in front of it  but had little choice  The shower drain is usually backed up  so you are wading in someone else s dirt  BRING SHOWER SHOES    It was mouldy and the water pressure was reduced to the point that I was unable to get the underside of my hair wet  For the duration of my stay  I never quite felt clean  Plus  if you shower at night  you gotta walk across the lobby in your pajamas  The location was rather far from the train station  maybe a    minute walk  In the daytime  this is not a problem  but at night  this isn t safe  At least  as a female alone  I really didn t feel safe walking around this neighborhood  People would block my path and start demanding information from me like where I was from and why I was there  I know that some of it is curiosity  but I definitely felt unsafe  It also didn t help that some taxis refused to drive down the hutong to the front door  They would drop me off at the main street and tell me to walk it myself  Walking down a dark alley at night is just not smart anywhere  but I really had no choice  Also  many taxis don t really know the location of the hotel  If you give them the address  they may understand the general area and take you there  but unless you have a cell phone that they can call the hotel with  you may be dumped somewhere  Definitely ensure that you are at the hotel before you get out  Keeping that in mind  the staff were fabulous  Helped me with every little request from booking train tickets  to keeping my luggage at the desk  I really thought that they did a fantastic job helping everyone out regardless of what room they were staying in  They definitely make this hotel a great place to stay  The breakfast was also delicious if you can get there early enough  Very tasty and free  Overall  for the price        there are way better hostels out there  The hotel rooms may make this a great place to stay for a hotel  but for a hostel  you can do better  
P => Good rooms not so good location and a little over priced We stayed at Michael s House for   days earlier this month  The place itself is located in a narrow lane lined with street food vendors of every sort  which makes it difficult for a taxi to drive up to their enterance  It is also squeezed in by apartment buildings and the location does not really give a  hutong  feel unfortunately  The house itself is a big enclosed courtyard surrounded by rooms  while clean and reasonably well done  it does remain a little dark and is quite small  Location is reasonable  it is about    mins by cab to Waifujing  Forbidden City Rooms are what you would expect in a   star hotel  nothing fancy but good beds and clean linen and toilets  We felt that the price was a little high for the location and overall facilities  We found the staff very attentive and helpful  which was a plus  But for the price  feel you can do better in a city like Beijing  
P => Great place We spent about   days at Michael s House  and were very pleased  The room was comfortable and clean  and the atmosphere terriric  Lydia and Miranda were wonderful  helping us with recommendations  dinner reservations  directions  etc  Very glad we chose Michael s House over some generic hotel chain  It really made our Beijing stay special  Well located   easily accessible to downtown  but outside the fray of ultra touristy hotel areas  Wonderful place  hardworking  helpful staff  Thanks so much for a great stay  
P => It is our home in Beijing I have been living in this hotel for   times since last ust  My kids call it our home in Beijing  I definetly could not agree with the negative review about it  It is quiet  clean and extremly friendly  My children were   and   while we first lived in this hotel  It was their first time to Beijing  China  We were living in another   star conventional downtown hotel  you could not see anyone after you stepping of the elevator except the shutting door  Except the sightseeing all us could do was locked in our room  watching TV  playing game  Unless my friend in the States recomand us Michael s House  As we walked into the beautiful courtyard  the kids were attracted by the chinese lattern  fish pond and the big comfy coutch  They begged me to switch our hotel right way  My children felt relax  safe  interesting here  and of course their generouse breakfast  All the staff were very friendly  especially Michael and his wife Joanna  they would chat with the kids and explain some chinese culture to them  My children had great memoties here  This ember was our second time to stay in this hotel  On afternoon as we stepped in the courtyard  there were roasting chesnuts  fruits and tea on the table  all the guests were welcomed to enjoy the autumn celelbration  All of sudden I realized that this was the real life of Siheyuan  That is the reason why we choosed to live in Michael s House  It is a great hotel  Although it does not have the fancy lobby  but it is cozy enough to be our home away from home  
P => Michael s House is a great choice for comfort and convenience We stayed   nights at Michael s house   twice   days because of a short trip in between  in two different rooms  and did not regret having chosen this based on previous reviewers  It is conveniently located  not near any main attraction  but   min walk to the circle line that gets you to all of them   near wonderful lakes in walking distance  Michael s house is small  has very personal ambience  serves great breakfast  mix of western and Asian   It is unique  a restored nearly     year old courtyard   The only weakness is maybe that the rooms are small   you aren t in a Hilton or riot   and it is quite expensive and largely used by Western tourists  But if you want personal attention  incl  help in booking a tour  and Western clean bathrooms close to all BJ attractions  it is great  
P => Michael s House is the only place I d ever stay in Beijing My husband and I loved Michael s house  Michael himself is a wonderful host and helped us figure out how to best spend our   days in Beijing  The staff are gracious and friendly  any help we needed was available immediately  They arranged a wonderful trip for us to the Great Wall for an extremely low price  only   other person in a newish van  and we had our own driver and tour guide for   people   Michael s House itself is a refurbished authentic multi generational Beijing home  and staying there made us feel like we were living in Beijing  The ensuite rooms are quite large  with a comfortable sofa and flat screen TV  with HBO  in the living room area  and a large extremely comfortable bed in the bedroom area  The bathroom shower was comfortably large as well  The whole place is beautifully decorated and was spotlessly clean  It looks just like the photos on the website  but everything is larger in real life than it looks in the photos  which is great The neighborhood location is excellent  very close to the subway  which we took everywhere  and lots of access to taxis nearby as well  The nearby main street hosts a sort of flea market each evening  where local people shop to purchase low priced items  My husband and I strolled through each evening and felt like part of the neighborhood There are lots of good quality moderately priced restaurants within walking distance  and with a bit of a longer walk  there are some fabulous  though more expensive  restaurants on the banks of the human made  quot seas quot   The breakfast at Michael s House is excellent also I would never stay in a typical western type   star hotel in Beijing  The only place I d ever stay would be Michael s House  
P => Lots of character great service but bad location My husband and I stayed at this hotel for   nights in tember of       One of the reasons we choose this hotel was because its website said it was in a traditional hutong area  This is not true  It was located among tall buildings  not at all a hutong area  At night  the street where it is located was very dark  The taxis wouldn t drop us off at the entrance because the street is too narrow  so we d have to walk for a block or so  It didn t seem too safe  specially for a solo traveller  In the morning the street would be really dirty because at night many food stands would be along the street The hotel s location is also bad since it s far from the city center with lots of traffic  You waste about   hours each day just in transportation The hotel itself is a traditional hutong structure  nothing special  The room was really nice since we stayed at the Emperor s suite  Although difficult to get off the bed in the middle of the night if you re the person against the wall  We saw the other rooms and seemed small  The door to the room and bathroom were made of aluminum  not really blocking the noise from the courtyard On the good side  the service was excellent  Michael from the fron desk was really helpful and friendly  The breakfast was tipycal chinese and generous  Good   service  emperor s suiteBad   location 
P => Loved This Place My wife and I and our university student son stayed at Michael s House for three nights  We did have a little trouble finding the place  as the sign in English is not very obvious  dim light  and partially overgrown by plants   A taxi got us close  at the head of the alley  but from there we were on our own  Fortunately  we ran into some very friendly guys who asked around and found it for us   In fact  we were very impressed by how easy it was to get friendly help  as compared with previous trips to China  Once we found it  we were very pleased  After we checked in  we were given plenty of information on Beijing and the places we wanted to see  Yes  as another reviewer pointed out  the breakfast is not exciting  but we didn t stay here for the breakfast anyway  It was enough food for us before we hit the road each day  We loved the room  a combination of traditional and modern  There was plenty of space for the three of us  and even though it looked right out on the courtyard  the thick windows kept out all sound  A public computer was available when we needed the internet  The staff were great  friendly and helpful  Sean arranged for a taxi to come at      a m  on our last day to take us to the airport Without question  Michael s House was a great find  We d stay there again in an instant  If you want a place with character  cleanliness  and friendly service  and at a good price  this is where you want to stay  
P => Clean friendly tasteful decor and interesting neighbourhood My wife and I have travelled extensively all over the world  and have lots of very good things to say about this place  The service was friendly  and the staff was willing to look up information maps on the Internet to make our stay more welcoming The rooms are clean  tastefully decorated  very quiet and with thick drapes  meaning that a good night s sleep is pretty well guaranteed  While it s true that there are some cheaper hotels in Beijing  this one offers excellent value  There s kind of a garden comfortable chill out area to sit and either watch the big flat screen TV  use the free Internet or just read  Once you get oriented  it s about a    minute walk from the closest subway metro station  and the neighbourhood is lively  with lots of street stick food and restaurants around  all at very cheap prices  Once you re on the subway  it s roughly    minutes to Tiannamen Square and or the Forbidden City   The biggest improvement to make would be the breakfast  It was okay  and buffet style  but the hot plates to keep the food warm were either turned on too low  or they didn t work  making the breakfasts cold  It might also be nice if they would offer drinks  like beer  for sale in the evenings  Most of the neighbouring places charge   RMB for a half litre  pint  of beer  so something like this at Michael s House might be a good idea  For those who get up after      am  when breakfast finishes  it might be nice to still be able to have a free coffee My wife and I stayed for five nights  and as we live in Tianjin      hours away   are planning to regularly return to Michael s House  We re also recommending it to our friends and colleagues  
P => If you re looking for value for money and lots of personality Michael s House is for you  I recommend Michael s House for the superb quality of service they extend    from Sean handling the last minute changes in booking we had to do  to Edward meeting us upon our arrival and giving us impromptu history lessons over breakfast  to Miranda getting us the dumpling dipping sauce we couldn t describe  to Lydia who took us on a night out in a pretty part of town  The hotel has a lot of personality  is very cozy  serves great dumplings  and the staff exerted every effort to make sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable  Michael s House is a few minutes  walk to the nearest train station  and is situated pretty near to a bus stop  The rates are good and on the whole made our Beijing stay all the more fun One thing  though  When booking certain tours  ie to the Great Wall or the Forbidden CIty   it would be good to double check with the hotel s travel agent partners that you re going to the right place  
P => Wonderful Stay and Services beyond hotels I often stay in china hotels and many do not offer the service and attention like here  I decided to choose this place for the next   nights here in Beijing  Very easy   minute walk to subway station  Jishuitan Station  and near to all tourist attractions  Make sure you don t go out too late because subway is out by     not like New York which is on    hours  I ended up taking taxi and thanks again for the driver and hotel staff at Michael s which have no problem taking me to back at  AM  Room prices are very reasonable and service I get is better than what I would expect from a   star hotel  Emperor s Suite is classy  I didn t bring a computer with me but there was one available in the room at No Charge  The staff is very friendly and helpful  I don t speak any Mandarin and the staff there wrote all necessary destinations and guides in both English and Chinese which is easy for most drivers in China  Overall it s a very cozy hotel  clean and reasonable price in the area  I was lucky to personally met with Michael and Joanne and thank them for even providing me transportation assistance to Airport Shuttle on the last day I leave   be because I stay at the Emperor s Suite  Great job Michael and I look forward to stay here again when I am in Beijing  
P => Comfortable and welcoming My husband and I stayed at Michael s House for three days in the third week of y  We enjoyed it alot  We had been touring with family for two weeks  and were looking to poke around by ourselves on a somewhat more relaxing pace  This small hotel is almost like a B  amp  B  with a friendly and welcoming atmosphere  The hotel looks exactly as it does on the website  We stayed in the deluxe Queen Suite  which had the most comfortable bed we had encountered in our first two weeks in China  The sitting area of the suite had a comfortable couch and a flat screen tv  The whole place was immaculately clean  and the bathroom had the amenities of a larger hotel   hairdryer  shampoo  etc  There are rooms there of all price ranges  including a dorm room with bunk beds The location was in the North West of Beijing within walking distance of the Jishuitan  SP   subway station  as well as within walking of the upper lake area  The location of the hotel is totally different from that of downtown Beijing  and it will give you more of a feel of the less touristy part of the city  although if touristy is what you want  it is easily accessible   We did that earlier in our trip Michael Wang  the owner  is on the premises  and is an enjoyable person  a good host  and speaks English  as he has lived in the US for several years  He is happy to give you suggestions and directions  and he and his staff will happily write out directions in Chinese to hand to a cab driver  Also  when we made our reservations  they emailed us directions written in Chinese to give to our cab driver  as their place is a little difficult to find down a small alley  THat was a big help  Our last two nights in Beijing  we moved downtown to a fancy hotel to see the other side of Beijing  near the shopping  the ritzy shops  etc  We loved that too  We were glad we had seen both  and without a doubt  Michael s House was the most personal  
P => Very comfortable and friendly My   teenage kids and I had a great stay in this hotel last week  We found the location quite convenient   it is about    minutes walk from Jishuitan subway station on line    the cirlce line   so if you don t mind the walk you can get anywhere in the city easily  And there are lots of taxis nearby  The courtyard setting is very cosy and comfortable   like having your own living room right outside your room  Very good value  The other guests were friendly and we were able to trade experiences regarding what to see and do  A special mention is deserved by the staff  who were extremely friendly and helpful  Anywhere we wanted to go or see  they were willing to look up details for us and write out directions in Chinese for the taxi driver  I would stay here again in a flash  and the kids enjoyed it too  
P => Best way to expreience coutyard life in Beiing My name is Joe Zhao  I work and live in New York I stayed in Michael s House for   nights with my wife We were amazed by the personal attention from Mr  Michael Wang  the owner We feel really like staying home We really like the room with junior suite functionThe bed is the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on  
P => Was this really a hotel  It felt like a second home  Quite simply  if you are looking for somewhere in Beijing  you must consider Michaels House  Of the hundreds of hotels I have stayed at  Michaels House is one of the best The staff are very kind and friendly  the rooms are delightful  and the courtyard lounge and dining area is beautiful  The only thing I would mention is to ensure you have a phone with you upon arrival   taxi drivers are reluctant to go down the laneway where it s located  so for the first time you arrive  it s easier to call the staff     hours reception  and have them explain the location  Once you ve arrived  you ll never have a problem finding it again  
P => Charming hotel with service minded staff  This is a very nice little hotel with very helpful and service minded staff  It is clean and the people there work hard to keep it that way  The staff spoke English better than in to five star hotels  one in Xian and one in Beijing  we visited on our trip to China I don t know if Tripadvisor have changed the location  it used to be totally wrong  but the actual location is   min walk north west of Jishuitan subwaystation  From there it will cost you   RMB to go to any other subwaystation  It s easy  safe and fast The neighbourhood seem to be a typical chinese neighbourhood  
P => Well decorated and cozy hotel If you want to have a feel of real Hutong and authentic Beijing experience  this is the right place to stay  Small family run hotel where you receive very friendly and thoughtful services  The location is convenient for sight seeing  This is indeed a boutique hotel with unique decoration  
P => A Gem of a hotel My wife  little boy and I stayed at Michael s house back in uary and we liked it so much we came again in il  As soon as you walk in place you feel at ease  which after a day s sightseeing in Beijing was just what we needed  The rooms are great  staff really helpful and the atmosphere around the place perfect  The biggest compliment I can give this hotel is that it was part of the holiday experience and one of the reasons our visits to Beijing were so enjoyable and therefore very different from the instantly forgettable stays we often get with larger chain hotels  Good work Michael  it is how a hotel should be  Tony  Helen and Harry 
P => The most welcoming hotel ever A group of    of us stayed at Michael s House for almost two weeks and  from the start  the place felt more like home than a hotel  The staff are amongst the most attentive I have ever encountered  without ever being fussy or intrusive  The rooms are tastefully and individually decorated  the place is spotless  the atmosphere great  Any requests or enquiries we had  and they ranged so wildly I m surprised the staff kept up with us  were dealt with efficiently and in such a helpful manner    This is a very special place  a world away from bland hotel chains  If I ever get the chance to go back to Beijing I will head straight to Michael s House  
P => great place Michael s House is a boutique hotel hidden inside the  Hutong  of Beijing  its glass roofed lobby is very special  like the sunroom of your own house  The room deco is in traditional but supplies modern facilities  clean and comfortable  The staff is very helpful and friendly  I will highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to feel real Beijing  
P => Michael s House Staff Superb    The staff was the most attentive I ve ever had at a hotel  The service was excellent  They helped us book several tours in Beijing  and also on our trip to Xian  I would highly recommend this Boutique Hotel to anyone who wants a true taste of Chinese culture  The hotel sits in the middle of a Hutong  and we were able to see how the citizens of Beijing go about their daily routines  Sean  Snow  and the entire staff were great     
P => charming  
P => 					   
P => exellent souvenir  
P => Excellent Location Located near Beijing famous Wangfujing district  it is literally just across the road from the Wanfujingt Shopping Area  Location wise is fantastic  Close to shopping areas and public transport  Rooms are good  with free internet provided  
P => Good Value Execllent location This Hotel is very well located  It is not a four star hotel by any means  but the rooms are an excellent value given the location  We were traveling around China and looking for budget places to stay and this fitted well  There are shopping malls right across the street  If you like to walk you can walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen in about    minutes  The Dong Hua Men specialty night food market is lest that   minutes down the road There is also the Dengshikou subway station which is a five minute walk away  There is also free internet in the room  and every time we went to the front desk for help there was always some there who spoke English  a big plus  
P => Great location great value Although not a four star hotel  it represents excellent value for money   its called motel     as that s the price for a basic room for   people  Recommend you go for the slightly higher price rooms as the basic ones are small and no windows We paid    RMB about      for a decent size room standard similar to premier inn  Modern in style  bathroom very nice with wetroom style large power shower  vanity unit etc  All beautifully clean  air conditioning  kettle  white bedlinen etc The hotel is part of the Merrylin chain and they do a range of motels called motel      but the central beijing one is a bit more expensive website called motel    com  but we booked through China Trip Advisor The absolute best thing was the location   right on the corner of Wangfujing opposite Sun Dong Plaza and   minutes walk just across Wangfujing from the Night ket  and   mins walk to Forbidden city  So loads of things to do  and no taxis  
P => Good Value well located This hotel is very well located  almost directly on the corner of Wangfujing and a very diverse night food market  Within walking distance of the Forbidden city as well and metro station But beware  the hotel is no longer as clean as the reviews lead one to believe  I am confused on how this is considered to be a new er  hotel  The corridors are dirty and carpets with holes and many stains on most floors The trick to enjoying this hotel is to realize that they have   classes of rooms  D C B A   I would completely write off D and C as they are very dirty and tiny  it would seem that they receive a large amount of visitors and are not well kept  The B room is very clean  much larger and only    USD more  I spend the first night in a C and changed over to a B for the next   nights of my stay  didn t even see the need to look at the A class Breakfast is also included in most rates  If you are not on a corporate plan  they sell a  quot club card quot  for    that will give you a discount of    per night  which would only be worth it if you stay for more than   nights Overall  it is very good value and clean if you select a Class B or A room  
P => Nice Hotel Third time staying at this hotel  Location is superb and the rooms are clean and functional  Only set back is the size of the room  Some rooms do not have a wardrobe   a pity   On the whole  value for money  
P => Fantastic   Great value  Fantastic new hotel  Excellent location next to brand new shopping mall and shopping street in Wangfujing  Rooms are not big but functional  very clean  have comfortable beds and modern bathroom  Though it is next to the main street  the windows are really soundproof  We could just cross the road and get all the food and shopping we want  Also short walk to train metro station  They even have a DIY washer and dryer for   yen per wash dry  with washing detergent provided  Definitely excellent value for money    they have rooms to cater for budget travellers if you don t mind having no windows  Though the only problem was because it is right in the city square so cabs are not allowed to stop in front of the hotel from  am to  pm but it is not a major issue because they can stop across the road behind the shopping mall and you can also catch a cab some   m walk from the hotel  Highly recommended  
P => Excellent experience We stayed New World Hotel for   nights and liked it a lot  Their complimentary breakfast was they perfect way to start my day and features a variety of breakfast foods including  a bowl of noodle  fried rice  porridge  omelet  sausage  bacon  danish  toasts  cereals  yogurt and fresh fruits and much more  Also they served a variety of drinks such as coffee  tea  milk and fruit juice  The room was very clean and we were lucky to have the corner room which came with a large window and a beautiful view of the city  There is a small grocery store inside of the hotel where locates the same floor as the swimming pool  The prices are not as bad as I thought  All in all  we liked this hotel and will stay here again  
P => Excellent Hotel good location highly recommended The hotel is a little out of the way in the Chaoyang District  near the Chaoyang theater  right across the street   Easy access to the subway and    minute ride subway to Silk ket  maybe    minute to Tiananmen Square  The hotel is very nice  modern rooms with LCD TV s  The breakfast buffet was excellent as well  especially suited for foreigners  I personally like the street food outside for   Yuan  it s the real taste of Beijing  There is a small grocery market near by if you need any snacks  One special note about the hotel is that there is a convenience store on the  th floor  one with the pool  and the price is not that far from the local market  Tsing Tao Beer for    yuan per bottle    
P => Modern Well Located Hotel Having refurbished its lobby  dining facilities and executive floors the hotel now offers a reasonably priced five star hotel in a great location in the CBD  providing you stay on the executive floors  Hopefully they will upgrade the other floors soon so it can compete with the extensive under performing hotels in Beijing 
P => Good value I stayed at the New World for two nights in a standard room  Although this hotel has had less than flattering reviews from its time before the Olympics but since it was renovated it has certainly picked up  The lobby is very bright and modern and is a welcoming sight on arrival  The check in process was simple and handled well by the friendly staff  The room was unremarkable but still very clean and comfortable with all the various facilities provided  The internet was free and fast  When I needed an iron and board they were promptly and politely delivered   Since I did not have the meal option I did not use the cafe in the morning but one could see they certainly had all the facilities to provide a substantial buffet  Considering that I checked out at   AM  peak period  they could have had one more cashier on the job but nonetheless it was still fairly quick  All in all a comfortable stay and still within walking distance of China Trade Center and numerous other restaurants and hotels  
P => Never again At first impression  the hotel looks great  The lobby is newly refurbished   obviously for the Olympics  Upon entering their premises there were no bell boys and several people waiting to check in and out at around   pm  Their service was slow and at one point in time there were no staff at reception  I then took my luggage to my room and found that the rooms were not refurbished   only the lobby  The room suffers from poor lighting and bad ventilation  There was no hot water in either the basin or bath   just lukewarm  which really is unacceptable  The blow dryer was so weak that I might as well let my hair air dry  I also tried room service because there was nothing around the hotel  I ordered a club sandwich  which was tasteless and had no avocado even though it was listed in the menu  Overall  a very disappointing experience  I checked out after the first day despite original plans to stay for   nights  
P => Completely Refurbished I booked this room in e for two nights as I had gotten some corporate tickets to one day night event at the Olympics  At that time  bookings were tough and rates were high  I paid rmb        per night  Needless to say  as we got closer to the games  rates in general dropped like a stone Some history on this hotel  It s one of the original   star hotels in Beijing and probably about    years old  In China  that s like dog years  It has been completely refurbished inside and outside including the rooms and common areas  They ve actually done a good job and it s relatively tasteful  We got upgraded  no kidding  to a corner room and had a great view of the new CCTV building  known to locals as  quot big shorts  quot  If you ever see a picture of the building  you ll understand  The room was very nice  quiet and had all mod cons  Breakfast for the executive rooms was served on floor   or   in a very nice and quiet room  The hotel may have had very low occupancy due to their pricing policy and difficulties foreigners had in getting visas The hotel is located near the the financial district and a good alternative to some of the higher priced options in this area such as the Four Seasons  It is also located right by a station for the number    underground line  Linking up to many of the sights can be done with greater ease than in the past  In the past   years  Beijing has added two additional subway lines  both of which go North and South  plus the airport line which is quite convenient given bad Beijing traffic At their normal pricing  I d recommend this hotel  I still prefer the Crowne Plaza in Dongcheng district but this one is better value  especially if you re traveling with family or on a budget  
P => Very disappointing As a part of a tour group  we stayed in this desperately in need of a facelift hotel  The lobby is very grand  but it is the only part of the hotel that has received any attention in recent years  When we looked at our first room  there were cigarette burns and watermarks all over the thin carpet  It was obvious the carpet hadn t been vacuumed recently  Though we had requested a non smoking room  we couldn t be accommodated  Our second room wasn t much of an improvement  the one positive was a recent vacuuming  It is not well located as there is no nightlife nearby  making a cab ride a necessity  The breakfast buffet was poor with limited offerings  and the food was never hot  Tablecloths and chair covers often had stains  When a hotel uses the fact that it is the tallest in the city as its greatest claim to fame  that is not a good sign  Our entire group had the same concerns about this reputed five star hotel  Avoid at all costs  
P => Good hotel with good location Good hotel with a good location for shopping and dinning  The service is acceptable  English speaking staff  very friendly and courteous  Although the hotel is a little bit expensive for the room rate compared to the service and quality resp  cleanliness  but the rooms are acceptable and comfortable  Even the smoking rooms  The bed is clean and comfortable  The rooms look like they have never been reconditioned  that is the only disadvantage  The bar resp  cafe downstairs in the Lobby is quite nice and a good meeting place  The hotel staff and the waitresses waiters are also very nice and friendly  The check in is ok  so far  All in all a acceptable place to stay  with a acceptable service  Recommendable  The only real disadvantage at the time of my stay was the internet connection  Dial up connection with a   k modem  That was lousy  Don t know  whether they still have it or not  
P => There is much better in Beijing I actually stayed a few months at this hotel which is by the way the tallest building in town  For sure it s the one liked the least in Beijing  The rooms are not anything near   stars with their worn out carpet and tired furniture  The gym was acceptable but not what one would expect from a   star hotel  Service was very good  as in every hotel in China With so many nice hotels I can t see why one would choose this one  
P => Not   Star But not terrible I stayed for a week at the Jing Guang New World Hotel  in   different rooms  one on the  th floor  the other on      The rooms were in about the same condition  which was not great  It appears that nothing has been replaced since the opening of the hotel  So  everything is worn  dirty  stained  etc  One trivial item is that each night we would have   or   business cards of not so reputable massage parlors stuck under our door  You would think a  quot   star quot  hotel would be able to deal with that  The lobby and lobby bar are both very nice  The Japanese restaurant in the basement is pretty good  too  The gym is large  but the equipment is outdated  
P => What to see Spent five nights in Beijing at the Jing Guang New World Hotel  Excellent  Of course you have to see Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City  What ever you want to buy from the  quot hawkers quot  cut the price down to one third or less  Hats  postcards  some were selling for   and   for one dollar The books on the area I am not really sure  but bargain  bargain  Take in an Opera  its not like anything you can imagine  but worth going to see  Take the Hutong tour and you may also get to visit with one of the families that live there  The family we visited has been there for years and it was wonderful hearing about who lived there  The Great Wall was unbelievable  prepare for a walk  a tough walk  And again  quot the hawkers quot  and stands selling there  Bargain  Bargain  A visit to the Summer Palace and the Panda place was worth the trip  Some out of the way places  Pearl Shopping Building and also a place our guide called The Knockoff Store  Both great deals  but Bargain  Bargain  One thing I noticed it was hard to get a Cold Beer  But finally found TGI Friday  that advertised  quot cold beer quot  and it was  A great trip  jonbarb    juno com 
P => rooms were average The rooms were at least   star  We stayed  nights and rooms were clean  with no problem of soiled carpet or worn bedspreads  The bathroom was stocked with amenities  ex  shampoo  toothbrush and toothpaste  etc  The only draw back with this hotel is  it deals with large groups of tourists  The buffet breakfast was included in the price and it was ok  fruits  yogurts  cererals  danish pastries  bacon  sausages  pancakes  eggs  And of course the staff is always helpful  Overall this hotel was ok  
P => Rooms far from   star I stayed in this hotel for   nights en route to southern China  It is rated as   star and it is fair to say that the reception area lobby  lifts etc are very nice indeed and give the impression of   star quality  However the rooms are far from   star   in fact I have stayed in   star hotels in China that have had better rooms  The carpets were worn and dirty and the beds were soft and worn  Worst of all were the bedspreads which were filthy and threadbare  Fortunately these can be dispensed with and the bedding underneath  sheets and duvet  were clean  Had I paid full price for this room I would have been very unhappy indeed

P => Sicherlich kein   Sterne Hotel  
P => Bastante bueno  
P => OK But Old Service Average Overall  Not too expensive by Beijing standards  ent clean rooms but showing its age everywhere  Can probably find better places to stay that are more central Location Access  About   minutes and RMB   by taxi west of Xizhimen station  Note that you can t realistically walk to the hotel from the subway  There isn t much immediately around the hotel although as others said  Carrefour is right across the main street  Taxi directly from the airport would likely cost about RMB      and take about    minutes Lobby  Huge marbled lobby although the reception is not immediately obvious  The public areas really need to be renovated  Many places  such as the elevator area  have chipped paint or chrome  The deco  especially the light colored wood panels  is like a rewind to the early    s Rooms  ent size and comfortable colors  Lighting is too dim overall even with all the lights on  Beds are firm and comfortable  Old style TV with mostly Chinese channels for selection  Two small bottles of free water provided although the ones at the mini bar were a whopping RMB    A C never got cool and felt more like a fan  Very small built in alarm clock  Overall  could use renovation as well  Requested non smoking but could only get smoking room  Smell was faint though so ok Food  Tried the cafe at the ground level and the food was expensive and very average  Breakfast is served at the function room on the  th floor with huge round tables covered by old pink orange tablecloth so you sit with people you don t know  The entire breakfast room setting seemed very out of date although the food is halfway decent  However  if you have had buffets in Hong Kong or Thailand hotels  this one pales by comparison  Breakfast simply didn t feel comfortable due to the setting Service  Ok but not particularly friendly  They seemed to frown a bit when they couldn t understand you or vice versa Value for money  The rate was around USD    for a single with breakfast  Double occupancy would have given me the same room except breakfast would have cost another USD    The rate is reasonable by Beijing standards although you can stay more central at a similar price  
P => From Califronia We booked the Nikko through RCI time share and felt we received excellent value  We were concerned beacuse the hotel wasn t in the center of town but loved the location  We were only a       minute taxi ride from the Old Quarter costing     US   The Nikko must have done some redecorating since reviews were written in       We found the hotel to be very pretty and our room which was spacious was very tastefully appointed  Counldn t have asked for a better breakfast  Asian and Western food were in abundance with good quality  Evening meals in the   restaurants were delicious with a wide variety to choose from  The bell staff  concierges and front desk staff all spoke very good English and took care of all our needs  The peanuts they serve in the bar and the Asian restaurant before dinner were the most delicious I have ever eaten  We took an overnight trip to Halong Bay which should not be missed  Overall our experiences in Hanoi and the Nikko were one of the best trips we ve ever taken  We highly recommend both  We found the Vietnam people to be the most polite and friendly people we have ever met  
P => Nice enough Stayed at the New Century with my wife who was on business  When the job ended  we stayed in Beijing for an extra week but moved to a much cheaper  three star hotel  Beijing Shatan  that we liked better  particularly its location   Our New Century room was spacious by Beijing standards  though a bit shabby in spots  smudges on the wall  frayed spots on the carpet  etc    Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean  The staff was friendly and helpful  and many spoke fairly good English  The breakfast buffet was quite amazingly comprehensive  Western  Japanese and Chinese choices   I used the gym a couple of times    it was well equipped and almost completely empty Don t even touch the New Century s outrageously overpriced minibar goods  which are expensive even by Western standards  including    Tibetan bottled water   Make a trip across the expressway  using the pedestrian walkway  and visit the Carrefour    a French owned department grocery store for snacks and supplies  It s one of the most useful shopping spots in Beijing  A double sized bottle of beer at the Carrefour will set you back less than    cents If you re travelling on a five star budget  you might check out other alternatives  If you re at all careful of your money  you can do better  But there s no particular reason to avoid the New Century  
P => Nice enough hotel We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour for   nights  The lobby looks beautiful  but then you quickly come to learn that there aren t any places to sit and wait for people  which is a little inconvenient  The hotel rooms themselves were nice  but it seems as if the cleaning crew missed a few spots of mildew here and there in the bathroom The swimming pool is just kind of gross   with hot and cold spots  It probably wouldn t have seemed so terrible if it weren t freezing outside  The changing rooms and locker rooms aren t very easy to navigate  and there are a bunch of rules that you wouldn t get  like having to wear communal slippers to the pool  if you didn t speak Chinese Overall it was a nice place to stay  but if I were to come back to Beijing on my own  I d probably look into other options 
P => Lovely start to our vacation We were placed in this lovely hotel by Princess Cruises prior to our cruise  The hotel is in a very good location  superb common areas and lovely bedrooms  We took an excellent tour from the hotel  bus with super guide  pedicars  Chinese home and studio  the Olympic stadium  great Chinese banquet and night tour  all for     I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bejing 
P => O K  for one night Lovely public areas and very helpful staff  Polite waitresses in the lounge area too  but this wouldn t get a five star rating elsewhere  The room was clean but looked tired  Wallpaper ws beginning to peel off and the carpet had a few stains  The tiles in the bathroom needed either replacing or a good scrub  I stayed for one night with my wife prior to flying out of Beijing airport and it was O K  for that  but I wouldn t want to stay for any length of time  
P => Tourist class hotel dingy rooms We stayed here for   nights in ember while attending a conference  A very beautiful lobby was as a quite misleading opening to the rooms  The hallways are bland and unappealing  Although clean  the room is extremely small for two people  the rug was old  mattress hard and uncomfortable  bathroom had granite counter but floor and bathtub need cleaning and along with a stained shower curtain  Fortunately  we were busy all day so we only had to spend evening hours here  It calls itself a five star hotel but what I found out about China is that once one earns this rating it is never re evaluated  This may have been a   star    years ago but it is barely a     star today On the positive side  the catering for the conference was excellent  In addition  the staff is very responsive to the customer  e g   we had a problem with our TV and someone came to the room in less than   minute  Any other similar requests were handled in the same manner  It was as if someone was positioned on each floor to respond immediately  So  Kudos to them for excellent customer service Perhaps it is ungrateful to complain because our room and board were being paid for by Peking University as speakers at the Beijing Forum and we appreciated this very much  
P => Better than I expected Stayed our first   nights in China here and found the hotel to be far better than I expected  The room was very clean  nice bathroom  tea and coffee making facilities  a little tight with the coffee sachets   bottles of drinking water supplied daily  View on the  th floor was a little obscured but able to see a lot of high rise buildings  Breakfasts were very good  buffet  and the buffet dining room we used was excellent with a good range of dishes  Swimming pool available  bank facilities  shops  postage stamps available Staff were very helpful We were very happy with this hotel and have no hesitation in recommending it to others  
P => Very stylish  some flaws Stayed four nights at the Hotel Nikko New Century  My room was very clean and stylish  with a comfortable bed  and the bathroom was very nice  The shower was a circular area outside the tub with a sliding door  Water pressure was great  Refrigerator and coffee supplies were nice  but the electricity goes off when you leave the room  key activated   so had difficulty keeping things cold On the down side  the room was very small  with paper thin walls  think hearing your neighbor brush his teeth    and no drawers for clothing  The lobby is very nice  with shops and restaurants  and a bank for currency exchange  There is a store with supplies and groceries within walking distance  and US type food as well  KFC  Pizza Hut  It was very nice  but the room to room noise is quite annoying  
P => Excellent Executive Floor Room I was at this hotel for business  The room was very comfortable and functional for working  Because this room was on the Executive Floor  internet access was free  Other amenities included a fax machine  flat panel TV  a safe  light switches for all lights in the room in several places in the room  like right above the nightstand   separate shower and bathtub  and free water  There was a large window between the bedroom and bathroom that had blinds  if needed The room rate included a full breakfast in the lobby restaurant or a continental breakfast in the Executive floor business center  Services in the business center  except food  were quite expensive   you had to pay a lot  I ve forgotten how much now  to print something from one of their computers  Beside a continental breakfast in the morning  there were snacks and free wine beer in the afternoon The lobby was immaculate and very attractive  There are several restaurants in the hotel  I ate twice at the traditional Chinese restaurant   called the Golden Palace Restaurant  on the third floor  The prices in this restaurant were very reasonable  and the food and service were excellent  
P => beige palace I stayed at this hotel for four nights in il for a conference  The Nikko claims to be a five star but is pushing it to be a three star unlike the Shangri La nearby which is a genuine   star  The Nikko has begun renovation on the upper floors but I had a suite on the  th floor  The room are shabby and generally pretty grubby with very worrying stains on the carpet and the shower floor  The rooms are permeated with the smell of cigarette smoke and even though you can partly open the windows it cannot be shifted  The rooms while providing instant coffee provide only jasmine tea in the home of tea drinking and they found the whole idea of providing free milk for a cup of coffee in your room very novel indeed  The rooms are large but depressingly beige with no low level lamps or   star room dressing features like throw cushions or paintings to soften the almost dormitory like decor  Everything is worn and sad looking  The hotel is in the business district and not close to any of the tourist sights  The views from the hotel are of rather dirty and run down office blocks  The restuarants leave much to be desired with very ordinary food  including the Chinese menu  and the attitude to service is sloppy  unsmiling and unwelcoming  I did not encounter anyone in the hotel who spoke english beyond the words  bill  and  pay   certainly not  thank you  The business centre is ruinously expensive and charged    yuan per page if you printed anything out  In addition  while there were plenty of staff in the business centre they were much more interested in having long loud gossipy chats with each other in Chinese rather than being helpful  The noise level also made it very difficult to concentrate in the centre  All up I would say that there are much better located and more stylish hotels for the same price with a better developed service culture for western business or tourim visitors  Unless your like beige and guessing what may have caused the mystery stains in every room   give it a miss and run  do not walk  to the Shangri La down the road  
P => Better than expected Our first night s stay was provided by a cruise line and rather than change hotels we simply extended our stay to four days  Initially we were assigned a smoking room on the   th floor  The hotel has limited non smoking rooms and changing rooms created a few difficulties  My only language is English but found this presented no problems  Both the smoking room and the non smoking room were identical  They are about the size of an average US motel room  Amenities include all the usual plus a safe  scale  hair dryer  and a mini bar with a kettle  The closet was minimal size  The hotel was recently updated with one exception  the carpets  Both rooms and all carpeted areas throughout the hotel  including the elevators  need recarpeting or a good steaming at the very least  If you can overlook them the rest of the hotel decor is quite nice although it would be nice to have a few chairs in the large lobby  The location is not particularly good for the tourist as the hotel is some distance from the city center    
P => Good business hotel Arriving at the Nikko Beijing around midnight  I could have used some help getting my bags to the front desk  but no working bellhops were in sight  The young man at the kerb just stared at me   perhaps they are not used to seeing a woman show up at a business hotel dressed in motorcycle leathers  But  my leathers are the warmest things I own  and I get quite chilled on the long distance flights  The young lady at the desk was polite and efficient  and got me checked in and summoned a youngster who got my bags to my room and helped me knock a little of the rust off my Chinese  Apparantly I speak with a slight Cantonese accent   not surprising  as most Hawai i Chinese are        Cantonese  I really like the breakfast buffet  which came with the room  Good  basic food  just like grandma used to make  Two kinds of jook  congee  every day  condiments  lots and lots of fruit  two to four kinds of bao  stuffed steamed breads   noodles  lots of juices  yoghurt  tea  coffee  and American food   I don t know how the American food was  personally  but my fellow conference attendees enjoyed it  I did a lot of my business by just showing up early and nibbling through the entire breakfast service as different contacts came and went  The supper buffet also was nice  though at     kwai  RMB   a bit pricy  IMO  The hot pot restaurant down the street only charges     kwai for a meal for three people  But it had a good selection of yummies  sliced small enough that one could sample a bite of everything  plus a nice sushi bar  Wine  beer  and sake were included  The room was tidy  though the carpet sould have been replaced some ten years ago  It took two days for the laundry service to figure out I wanted laundry service  and by then I had washed everything in the bathtub  It s all good  I saved a few kwai  I found the staff friendly and helpful  Most spoke decent English and were very good about not laughing at my atrocious Mandarin  and even put up with my incessant questions on vocabulary and pronunciation  Checkout was friendly and efficient  The doorman hailed me the only cab around at      am and gave me a little yellow slip with the cabbie s license number  It has instructions in Chinese and English to give it the hotel if you have problems with the cabbie   I ll be mailing it to the hotel with a reccomendation to ban that cabbie from the place  He ripped me off    kwai for the toll booth   toll charges are included in the fare   and refused to give me a receipt  You don t have time to fight when you have a plane to catch  You should pay     to     RMB       absolute tops   between the Nikko and the airport   If I had business again in that area  I would not hesitate to book with the Nikko New Century Beijing  
P => Very Nice Hotel Stayed for four nights at end of e and must disagree with previous lukewarm reviews  I found the public areas of the hotel to be in excellent condition  my business class room was comfortable and in superb condition  The bed was fabulous  Staff was helpful when asked  but thankfully did not hover around you as in so many other places in China  I rented the doorman s bicycle and rode throughout Beijing for a morning    what a trip  
P => Not terribly impressed This hotel of the Nikko Hotel chain provides all amenities that you would expect of this group and class  However  the overall impression is a bit lower than other Nikko hotels in Asia  The rooms would greatly benefit from a renovation   or at least from a proper cleaning  cutains and floor   Internet connection  wireless  worked without problem and the staff was generally friendly and helpfu   although English skills are generally low  But after all it is China   Would recommend the hotel to anyone who is on business and needs to be at the nearby exhibition centre  Otherwise there are certainly nicer locations and hotels  particularly if on vacation  
P => Above average for a    meeting hotel not a palace  I stayed at the hotel for a conference  The equipment are good  large swimming pool  well stocked occidental bar and oriental tea parlour  Have to agree with all the previous comments that this is not a palace   The toilet seat is in the bathroom  soundproofing is less than perfect  Rooms are not large  but I enjoyed a lot the view from the   th floor  As for the location  it s far from the big tourist places but taxi is cheap  There are plenty of restaurants around  starting at Y   four yuan  for a bowl of noodles soup  The Carrefour across the street stocks a good selection of teas on the lower floor  and has a special outlet in the mall gallery for the more fancy ones  The most expensive are of course in the hotel  Expect beer around Y    and tea from Y   to Y     yes  it is very good tea  By all means  avoid the Great Wall tour with the hotel agency  Hualong International Travel Service  if you don t want to do the  quot jade factory quot  and the  quot chinese clinic quot  tourist traps  Any other travel agency will be happy to pick up at the hotel Minh 
P => Great value for the money The New Century is a   star modern hotel in Beijing s west end near the Panda Zoo and the Purple Bamboo Park  Would like to have been closer to the centre but transportation is reasonable  Taxi to Tiennamen Square    yuan  to the silk market    yuan   Staff at the New Century are competent friendly and extremely helpful  Always willing to help you out or give you the directions you need  An excellent concierge staff as well  The on premises pool and health club are excellent too  Standard rooms are good sized and comfortable  If you have breakfast included  it is both Western and Asian  buffet style   There is a need to get the Omelette station some more choices  cheese and ham would be nice   but I quibble  Supper at the hotel can be quite reasonable with a Western and Asian Buffet starting at     Yuan plus     service includes all the beer and softdrinks you want as well   The weekend buffet was     yuan and featured Japanese fare Hint for the budget conscious  There is a Carrefoure store just across from the hotel   Ideal to buy those snacks you might miss find too pricey  in the hotel room  or  get some supplies for a picnic lunch  It s good if you forgot some necessities and want to replace them  No bargaining allowed We were at several other     star hotels in China during our stay but this was one of the best

P => They are letting the place rot they are budget hotels and there are budget hotels  but this is the worst hotel ever  very depressing  no upkeep  shower appliances coming off the hook  stained carpets  personal unfriendly demoralized  i think they want to get rid of the budget crowd altogether  i left after one night  do you yourself a favor and go to a better hotel nearby  
P => unbelievably tranquil and luxurious I just got back from Beijing yesterday and can t rave enough  I m    years old and stayed in a room with my older aunt and two young cousins  both under     and all four of us fell in love with the plethora of chinese and western breakfast assortments  from fresh and safe fruit to buttery homestyle croissants and traditional american bacon eggs and hash browns  and tranquil and luxurious enviornment  The staff was above and beyond helpful and attentive  The bartenders in the hotel bar are not only beautiful but very funny and comforting  My favorites being Kitty  Lily  Zheng  and Melody  The hotel is right across from Louis Vuitton  Chanel  Cartier  Burberry  etc  and when it s snowing  its unbelievably magestic  We stayed for   days and   nights and found every moment in the hotel  dining room  and pool to be absolutely FABULOUS   The hotel offers enough western tradition while never masking the Chinese culture  If I had the option to go back I would do so weekly   Everything was very clean  and organized making relaxation while getting a massage or laying by the infinity like pool beautiful  If you have the opportunity to visit Beijing absolutely make it a point to stay at this hotel  the new part I would recomment as I ve never seen the older rooms  at least for one night  It is absolutely worth every penny    
P => Superb location   comfortable accomodations   great breakfast I m a fan of otel and found this location to fully meet my expectations  Clean  comfortable  quite room with an excellent breakfast buffet  Concierge helpful with navigating to destinations in the city  Only negative was the consistently grumpy breakfast buffet employees who served up food and coffee with a grimace  
P => almost   points but what a shame the service is so bad and the lobby just disguting    I m staying often in this hotel for business and if a few years ago  this property was extremly bad with disguting rooms  the refurnishment of the rooms has been really well done and in regard to the value  otel Peace is now a good deal in Beijing and a quite good choice   OK  if we focus on the service  it s still very average with a staff not good at all in english and not very smily  You have always the impression to disturb them when you need something  The staff at the reception could try to think why they have decided to work in the hospitality industry cause it s hard to see    Same at the restaurant for the buffet breakfast  don t even expect any smile or any  quot good morning quot  and don t forget the hot drinks are in self service cause if you ask them  it could make them unhappy   About the concierge  if you need any  quot tip quot  about the city or a restaurant  i highly recommend you to refer to your  quot Lonely Planet quot Anyway  you understand you will do not choose this hotel for the quality of service but more probably for the location just in the middle of the city at    minutes walk from the Forbidden City and easy access for shopping and sightseeing  for a very good value cause the rooms have been renovated and spend a bit more to stay at the Executive level cause if the bathrooms are a bit dated in the standard and deluxe rooms  the ones of the Executive rooms are brand new with a large shower very comfy  for a good design of the rooms  modern and zen  different from what you expect to find in a otel  for the very acceptable size of the rooms making a stay with a third person absolutely possible and for the buffet breakfast offering a good and yummy selection of sweet and salted dishes  cr pes are really good and friend veggies so delicious     However  if the rooms are nicely decorated  the lobby is still not renovated and looks like from an other century often with an ugly flower arrangement and with dirty and very old sofas in the lounge  I hope the management is thinking about re designing the lobby cause this is the first impression the guests have when checking   But due to the excellent rooms and this incredible value for money  this property is close to   points but a lot of things have to be improved and for now  let s just say this hotel is recommandable but nothing amazing    
P => Great location Stayed here for a couple of nights before attending a conference just out of Beijing  The otel is well located  close to the big ticket sights  The hotel met the standards that you would expect of its chain  The buffet dinner was relatively expensive by Beijing standards  and there were probably more affordable  quot Chinese cuisine quot  options within walking distance  
P => Comfortable base in Beijing We stayed at the otel Peace for three nights  this being the first leg of our seven city tour of China After passing through strict swine flu checks at Beijing Airport we arrived late morning at the hotel The hotel has a large  impressive lobby with a wide staircase at its centre  At the time of our visit  a huge mooncake was displayed on a table in the centre of the lobby Having stayed at several otels in the UK  this was in a completely different league  The room was large  with two double beds and floor to ceiling windows offering views along the busy road running outside of the hotel and over the rooftops of Beijing The bathroom was a little tired but was perfectly adequate There is a separate room for Internet use  but two free computers were available on a  first come first served  basis in the lobby area towards the lifts  however these were almost always in use Breakfast was included in the price and was varied  catering for all nationalities  The lobby bar was expensive but was quite comfortable and relaxing after a hard day s sightseeing We ate in The Square restaurant  also on the ground floor  on the last night  where we had a tasty Nasi Goreng and Club Sandwich As mentioned by most reviewers  the situation of the otel is perfect  Ten minutes walk to Wanfujing Street and the evening food street  serving such exotics as Sheep s Testicles and Sheep s Penis The hotel organised a taxi one evening to take us to the Houhai Bar and restaurant area and wrote on a pad the Chinese name for the otel which we had to present to the taxi driver for our return trip as they would never have understood us otherwise I would recommend the otel to anyone visiting Beijing  In addition to the obvious sights such as Tiananmen Square  Forbidden City  Summer Palace  Hutongs and the Great Wall  do make the effort to visit the Temple of Heaven in the south of the city  If you get there early you will be entertained by hundreds of locals singing  ballroom dancing  playing musical instruments and practising tai chi   an definite highlight of a Beijing trip  
P => Unbelievable service and value  We had a fantastic stay at the otel Peace  Great location  very close to Wangfujing shopping and the snack street  Walking distance to Forbidden City and Tiananmen  The room was very clean and comfy  with nice furnishings  And finally  the concierges were beyond fantastic  Friendly  courteous  went above and beyond in making sure that our taxi drivers knew exactly where we were going  and we went to some unusual places   They also can quickly and easily arrange a car to the Wall or other popular spots for a fairly standard price  Really a great place  would recommend to anyone  One note  paid internet in the room  but free wifi in lobby and also two computers in lobby for general quick use  
P => LOCATION AND   LOCATION We booked this hotel after reading the somewhat positive comments on this site  and locating it on a map    Well  we did found the location to be near perfect    The hotel is facing the Peninsula  wich has a Bank of China international ATM in its basement floor   Lee s Garden Hotel etc   I did felt a   western   athmosphere in this aera  wich is not bad   it kinda allows you to digest more easily the somethimes intense sightseeing during the day   There s an entire trendy shopping aera minutes away  with a fantastic shopping center at about    min walking from the hotel  with numerous and great restaurants ranging from Pizza Hut to South Silk Road  wich I highly recommend    The Forbidden City is at about       minutes walk   for the north gate  if not mistaking   but would suggest to take a cab  about   RMB   and keep your energy for inside the city  since theres already a lot of walking and standing still inside the city    The temple of Heaven is a couple of minutes away by cab from the hotel  etc   Theres a very nice tea shop just next to hotel  can t miss the waterfall tea pot outside    We did avoid it at first since we where afraid to get scammed there  but actually  after comparing it to Xi An tea shops  the prices are very reasonable   When we first checked in  they located us in the west wing  First thing we noticed is the ridiculeous walking distance from the lobby to the room  and the awfull looking carpet waiting for you in the  th floor hall    It looks like all the toilets from the floor rooms have leaked and spoiled the carpet   all the way   But the rooms where renovated  and had quite a lot of storage facilities   The bathroom was nice  with a separated glass shower unit  After our trip from Xi An  they relocated us in the east wing  in a corner room  and the room  although a bit aged  was huge  with a nice corner wall window  etc   The breakfast brunch is ridiculeously overpriced  the internet is free if don t mind standing up and having some people waiting from you in your back  and reading your e mails with you  only   screens    If you want tu use it the business office  it costs about  RMB minute for internet   But the worst was probably the service    I wasnt expecting an unforgettable consumer service in China  no offence   but since this hotel is proudly french owned  they should seriously thinking about teaching the staff to be more friendlier    But I guess that tall french dude who seems to be the manager there is more busy talking about China s car prices with the bell boys than talking care of business   All in all  its really the location that makes it a great deal for us  since the rest is kinda forgettable    
P => Location can t be beat great value here The location is perfect for Beijing  just   minutes walk to Wanfujing shopping street  Not too far to the subway  I think about a    minute walk  The food in the buffet restaurant was really excellent  and a great value for money  I went to other Beijing buffets  most were much more expensive and not have as good or generous as here  The room was fine  about     to   stars  everything worked great  especially the air conditioning  There is an older and newer tower  the newer seems a bit nicer and more recently refurbished  Compared to other Beijing hotels  this is an outstanding value for money  
P => Value for Money   Great Location and Service  I stayed in otel with my partner for   days in Beijing  We managed to get a good deal online for only USD   per night  Location was good  just a stone throw from WangfuJing  although it is about  mins walk to the nearest MRT station  it was ok  Room was rather small but good  Good housekeeping service and free WiFi in the room and internet at the lobby  Clean sheets and hot water Only grasp is the bed is hard  Don t be surprised to wake up to shoulder ache for the first   mins in the morning  Also  breakfast is USD    per pax which is ridiculously expensive  But there is a nearby shopping centre which has Mac   hrs and eatery that opens at  am   and at another corner  a breadshop that opens at  am so no worries there Stay here if you are fine with a run in a mill hotel  with good location  
P => Great location usual otel style rooms I got put up here on a business trip to Beijing  I didnt have any choice of the hotel  After my business trip I spent   weeks travelling round China and when I returned to Beijing I chose the Emperor hotel  which is worth checking out  a little pricier  but fantastic I thought the hotel was fine as a business hotel  I spent a very happy week here  The location is great and when I had a little time to myself I was able to quite happily see many parts of the city on foot  The breakfast at the hotel is of a good standard and has a wonderful array of choice from Western and Eastern selections The rooms are typical otel style  if you have stayed at a otel or similar standard chain hotel before you will know what to expect The taxi hailing staff outside are fabulous  they ran around outside hailing taxis for me at all times of the day and night  in the rain  everything  Big thank you to them  A good pick I think if it suits your budget   enjoy Beijing  
P => Perfect location for touring the Forbidden City We stayed on the Club level and the room and the service were very nice  We had a king room with a comfortable couch that was big enough for our adult son to sleep on  They did not charge for the third person  We enjoyed a view of the Forbidden City from our room  The Club level includes an elaborate breakfast buffet and happy hour with free drinks and hor d oeuvres  The only negative was that the bed was a Chinese bed and very hard  
P => Fantastic hotel central location nice pool Amazing foyer   Room spacious and very clean  Swimming pool on second floor very pleasant with large changing rooms and small gym  Breakfast buffet excellent choice of european and asian cuisine  Dodgy coffee machine though Great location for walking to Forbidden City and Tianamen Square  Wear comfortable shoes and buy some water from the shops along the way  Takes about    mins to get there  Lots of restaurants to choose from too  Main shopping area Wanfujing is not far from the hotel  Very pretty at night lit up  Supermarket across the road  and down a side street  from the hotel sells drinks and snacks cheaply  
P => Great location Overall our   day stay was great  The staff is friendly but service is not upto the mark  My coffee sachet in the room was not replaced after the first one  House keeping should have seen to it  I used the coffee from the kid s room The location of the hotel is the best  Close to shopping and restaurants  I would go back and stay there again  
P => ent central hotel   good option for small families and others We spent   nights at the otel in mid y  a large  bland  good quality  reasonably priced Western chain hotel located in central Beijing  We opted for an executive room  somewhat more expensive but assures you of a better quality room    all was fine with it    Views   We were on a top floor and did not have a view over the Forbidden City   apparently there are very few rooms with good views in that direction   Cost   We checked out the main discount websites and were able to get a much better deal directly from the otel   about     off the regular sale rates  but for a non changeable non reimbursable reservation  We had to become members of the otel Ibis Sofitel  quot frequent users quot  group   free and easy to do over the web   to access the lowest prices though   Families with teens   A huge advantage of the otel is that kids  at least    probably    stay free in rooms up to age     unlike the    year cut off of most hotels  That lowered our costs a good deal  and makes the otel an especially good option for small families   Location   in central Beijing  near a subway stop  near huge shopping malls and a shopping street  a long walk or short taxi ride from the Forbidden City  etc  We went to the acrobat show one night and had trouble finding a taxi afterwards   ended up taking the metro back  a stop was right beside the theater  and got home faster and at    the cost in the end  FYI   subways  metros  are easy to use  with announcements in English as well as in Chinese  There are plenty of ATMs in the area  across the street and in the nearby Peninsula Hotel   Too  there is a good nearby food shop   turn right as you leave the hotel  then take the first left   it is maybe    meters down that road   good for getting snacks and reasonably priced bottled water  etc   Our room was in excellent shape  Yes  the hotel is not brand new but our room was kept in very good condition  strong water pressure for showers  safe included  a sitting area with two small sofas and a coffee table  a flat screened TV  etc    Pool   small but fine  about impossible for people to do laps and have kids in the pool at the same time   The front desk and concierge desk staff were fine   well informed and pleasant  We went to a less travelled part of the Great Wall and were able to get a good English speaking driver for the day for     yuan in a comfortable car   You can negotiate a regular taxi down to about     yuan  but forget about English  comfort  and a fair number of Beijing taxi drivers are formula   wannabees     Internet   there are two recent apple computers in the front lobby for guests to use for free   quick access to websites  I think  not sure  that wifi is also available for those with their own laptops   Breakfast   The otel breakfast buffet is both excellent and overpriced  around    USD per person   so we ate there once  It is too bad that they don t offer a lower priced continental breakfast for people not travelling on an expense account    We never found a good substitute breakfast restaurant in the area   places to eat at the nearby mall and shopping street open up too late  etc  Twice we bought pastries at a nearby store and milk  Nescafe and yogurt at another  and ate in our room  Would we return  Yes  but without a lot of enthusiasm as  again  the hotel is bland but fine  It is a good option for small families on a budget and for business travelers  We would have preferred going to a more typical Chinese hotel in a Hutong but  in the end  are glad we did not   taxis are loathe to enter into those areas  roads are very narrow   most do not know of the smaller Hutong hotels and  for a first trip to China  being in a large western chain with an English speaking staff and easy to access made it worth it    
P => Excellent Hotel in Beijing Excellent location  close to wan fujing shopping street with famous and oldest Roastduck restaurant  The staff were bar staff were friendly  Very impressed with this hotel  
P => Good city hotel When we arrived we were able to check in straight away  even though it was only  am  It meant that we had a twin room rather than a king  but it was so good to be able to get some sleep  and it set us up for the rest of the day  The room was very pleasant  and certainly not shabby  as some people have mentioned The location is good  minutes from the main shopping area  and walking distance to the Forbidden City  about       minutes I should think  We always got distracted by the shops  which is why I m not sure how long it took The pool was nice  although the footbath on the way into the pool looked dirty  and you couldn t avoid it  The pool was small  but as we were still on English time sort of  we were having a swim as it opened at  am  and had the pool to ourselves The breakfast was good with a lot of options  and everything was very fresh Internet in reception was very useful  the only hotel on our holiday that provided this service  Changed money in the lobby a couple of times  and they were very helpful  letting me have a mixture of large and small notes  Mini bar  like most hotels  stupid prices      yuan for a bottle of water  surely they would make more money if they charged less  as more people would use it Overall  good hotel  in an excellent location  
P => A very good location if slightly worn looking appearance inside this hotel I stayed in this hotel for   nights  I had chosen the Peace Hotel as it seemed very central and I was going to be doing some hardcore sightseeing whilst in Beijing Arriving late after a flight from Kazakhstan  I jumped in a taxi at Beijing airport and after some initial confusion discovered that the locals recognise this hotel as  Peace Hotel  and don t understand the otel part of the name A huge lobby awaits  that includes   huge I Mac s for free surfing  check in was fairly quick  The layout of the hotel was quite strange and my room was in a wing that meant I had to go up one floor then walk around the top of the lobby before getting a lift to the floor I was staying on  The room itself was standard otel fare  although the large flat screen TV was a nice touch The location is very good  and has a choice of   metro stops within a few minutes walking distance  It s also located less than a minute walk from Wangfujing St which is the main Shopping St in Beijing It s quite possible to walk to Tianenman Square Forbidden City  as I did on several occasions  and this will take between       minutes  depending on how hot it is   Overall this hotel was a great location  although the interior could do with a little bit of TLC  On my floor the hallway carpet was showing signs of an air con water leak but the manager told me it is due to be replaced soon  
P => Location is important in Beijing   otel Peace has got it   Number one is that the hotel is just off Wangfujing St  and its shopping  eating and crowds  and close       min walk  to Tiannamen and Forbidden City  Beijing is a BIG sprawling city and so location is very important   The hotel itself has two sides   The lobby looks modern and there is free Internet via courtesy iMacs in the lobby  However  the rooms are old and quite shabby  The mattresses were hard and not in a good way  Its an older hotel that they have tried to spruce up with so so renovations to the rooms   I think the location makes up for this hotel and I would ignore the rooms but I ve noted this to be fair  For Beijing this is a well priced  expedia for us  hotel with a great location  
P => Holiday Get Away Whilst living in central China  I took my family to visit Beijing and selected the otel Peace hotel for our weekend stay As with all the otels  in China where I have stayed  the staff were excellent and the hotel gave great value for money  
P => Great for location but the room was average  When we arrived at this hotel we thought it looked really nice  certainly the lobby and restaurant areas are  However  our room looked  very tired   We also found the bed very hard  it was like sleeping on the floor  In fact I even checked under the sheet to see whether there was in fact some board there as it felt like it  However  the shower in the bathroom was great with an extra large head as well as another than you can use freehand The wing that we stayed in had a funny smell   kind of musty but I m not sure that it was that or something else The location was excellent  only five minutes walk from the main shopping street in Beijing  The staff were friendly and helpful  Breakfast was included in our rate and we did enjoy the selection  We didn t eat any other meals in the hotel though There are two computers in the lobby that provide free internet but these were often in use and the internet in room is expensive  
P => Great location with the style and comfort of a European hotel  All for a good value  I couldn t beat the value for the location  I could see the Forbidden City from my window and could easily walk to Wafujing shopping district  The rooms and lobby were nice and it was a comfortable place to be as an American on his first trip to China  The staff was very nice  but there were some service oddities that I m not sure were their fault  The line to exchange money was often    minutes  it was nearly impossible to hail a cab in the evening  and they nagged me about not having enough  quot deposit quot  even though I had given them my credit card to be charged for meals  incidentals  etc  Three criticisms  While the breakfast buffet was great  with Chinese  European and American options  it was a pricey lone option at the hotel  The Internet was free only in the highest level of rooms and in the lobby  It was     day in the two lower grade rooms  Oh  and the massage services were  um  less than professional All in all  I d stay here again easily  
P => Extremely overpriced poor value with amateur rude staff in good location The otel s accommodations were the least impressive and most expensive of my  city  week China trip  Beijing was the last city I was visiting so I thought I would splurge on hotels and end on a high note but it fell flat  I booked an executive King room and was shocked to see that the room was extremely substandard  unimpressive  small and looked to have been decorated    years ago  The staff was lazy and generally unhelpful  The porter doorman who stands outside refused to help us get a cab on a few occasions so he could smoke and talk to his buddies  Whenever you asked an employee something that involved them doing something they pretended they didn t speak english but then you would hear them speak fluent english   minutes later  They told the cab  after supposedly double checking  to drop us off at the wrong area of the airport which is a HUGE problem at the Beijing airport since the terminals are so far away from each other it might as well be another airport  The thing that made me the most offended though was the restaurant buffet  The price was absolutely ridiculous  It was so outrageous I went to look to see what they were serving  maybe I was missing out on something  Lobster and Caviar covered in gold leaf  After telling them I might be interested in eating there and wanted to see what they offer  the staff followed about a foot behind me and treated me like a criminal about to stuff food in my pocket and run out the back door  Lastly  let me mention that the hotel knew that I was just married and on my honeymoon and they did absolutely nothing to make my stay there special  Not even a congratulations  The hotel is extremely overpriced for the quality of rooms and service  I travel all over asia and this hotel cost   to   times as much as others in major cities like HK  Shanghai  etc  that were far superior in every way  
P => Nice situated I spent there   nights  the hotel is quite good and I suppose the price is reasonable  Wireless in restaurant for free The breakfast you can get for extra ca    RMB   The hotel is in very center of city  close to the Forbiden City  The shoppes are more expensive there  
P => Nice hotel in good locations We were very happy with this hotel   not only because it had a great location but also because the rate we got as Accor Advantage members during their   day sales was crazy   AUD       night  The hotel was a   min walking to the main shopping strip of Beijing and a  min taxi ride to the Forbidden CIty and Tia namen Square  When we arrived  we requested a non smoking room and because there were none left we were upgraded to a suite  It was nice enough but was situated in an old part of the hotel quite a way away from reception  It was very large but a bit old and tired compared to the other part of the hotel  The buffet breakfast was fantastic   lovely food and the huge lobby had a great bar area that you could sit and watch all the comings and goings of the hotel  They also have free internet on   terminals near reception   a good deal  Staff were always helpful and attentive  
P => Great Location This hotel has everything that you could want  The staff are helpful  the rooms are comfortable  the breakfast buffet is enormous and the room service is efficient You can book your tours at the travel desk  I would recommend that you hire a hotel car to visit the Great Wall  The cost is     RMB for the whole day and you can tag on a few detours that are on route If you don t have breakfast included in your room package then it can be very expensive      per person   in the shopping Mall across the road in the lower ground floor you can find a nice chinese restaurant which serves a full breakfast for around     they also serve great Dim Sum Free internet in the lobby and if you are in a Club room you have internet in your room and also in the club lounge  It is worth paying he extra for a club room as you get your drinks free of charge in the evening and light snacks  The hotel bar is extremely expensive and two drinks and two small snacks came to       you don t want to spend too many evenings relaxing in the bar  If you are looking for a supermarket then there is one just across the road heading towards the Hilton hotels  The shops in the hotel are very expensive and charge   x the cost of anything you can buy outside  For clothes shoping go to Ya Show    floors of fake designer goods  i phones to Gucci hand bags  Bargain hard  things sell for     of the original asking price  walk away if they don t come down to your price  My daughters spent a small fortune on clothes all of it reasonabley good quality   make sure you have room in your suitaces  
P => Great location and price We stayed at this hotel last week for   nights  The hotel service was very good  Upon checking in we were given a smaller room  that didn t match the description of what we had talked about with the reservation department  We immediately went down stairs explained that we were in the wrong room  they changed our room and moved the bags immediately  The standard rooms are very small and I would not recommend them for a couple  Our room was on the   th floor overlooking street  we enjoyed breakfast everyday on the   th floor  It opened at     am  The conceirge and front desk were helpful in providing directions  getting cabs  making dinner reservations  etc     Everything you would expect in a big city  
P => Great Location otel Peace is an ideal place for a traveler who want to catch up with beijing after finishing his business  Located at the center of a very active shopping areas of Beijing  Also located nearby is the Food street which is bustling with local food in the evening  You get things like dog meat  fried scorpions  silk worm  snakes etc   Priced at a reasonable approx      rmb per night inclusive of breakfast  otel peace is nothing fancy and down to business with its features and service  
P => Great value location and service This hotel is within walking distance of the Forbidden City and a great shopping district  Pay the extra and stay on the club level floor  it has a wonderful buffet breakfast  probably the best I have had in China  Only complaint is super hard beds  I really like a hard bed but this was like sleeping on the floor with a only a sheet underneath  Most hotels have too soft beds  this is the first one with too hard  
P => Good location Great location within walking distance from the forbidden city  a reasonable walk  and within close distance to the night food market  great for eating scorpions  reasonable rooms  old wing could do with some work   staff were attentive enough although their concierge weren t too suggestive  When i asked for a good Chinese restaurant outside of the hotel  he suggested the place next door  Not so good  Breakfast was excellent and almost worth the stay  Fresh ingredients  Overall a good hotel  
P => Perfect well located hotel Stayed at the otel Peace for three nights from il        Clean  well appointed  and convenient for central Beijing  For business purposes it was perfect as a well known hotel as well as its walking distance from everything  Even Tianenmen Square and the Forbidden City are easily walkable from here is you are in good shape Fantastic breakfast buffet  The flight crews of Air France stay here so great croissants and baguette can be had  I highly recommend this hotel for any type of travel  
P => Excellent Value Service and Location The staff was multilingual which was extremely helpful especially while navigating through a foreign country  While the hotel didn t have the same grandeur as the other larger hotels  it was still very pleasant  The room was a little cozy and the bed a on the firm side  As far as value  location  and service  this hotel can t be beat  
P => Western friendly for business and tourism We stayed for   nights at the otel  Compared to US business hotels  the otel is similar in style to a nicer Hilton  Westin  riott  or similar  quot brand name quot  hotel   otel is NOT a recognized brand in the US   Most of the staff was competent enough in English to make us languange impaired Americans feel at ease  Location was within walking distance to a shopping mall and to some other restaurants and shops  I believe it was just outside Beijing s  nd circle  so it was reasonably close to The Forbidden City and nearby attractions  The hotel lobby was impressive and comfortable for an afternoon libation  And the breakfast buffet was marvelous  I would see this as a great hotel for the business traveller  and a comfortable and familiar hotel for the tourist  
P => Appreciated the spacious room with its full length window  wall  I took advantage of a very good rate  about US    per night  to stay at this four star hotel that I would otherwise not have splurged on at  quot normal quot  rates of        The room I got was a double with a good view  Bathroom was well equipped  with hot water at all times  Everything worked  and there was no damage evident anywhere in the room  It must ve been recently renovated  Most of all  I loved the full length windows that opened out onto the street  and the ample sitting space near the window with a lounge chair for resting  The in room bar was well stocked  albeit fairly expensive  by contrast  the room service  the burger platter I ordered was delicious and hot  was more reasonably priced  a very high quality  and had a pretty extensive Western European menu  The hotel staff spoke English quite well  took care to answer my questions and offer help  and this holds true for the restaurant manager as well  a Frenchman who also spoke English  The location was meticulously clean  Perhaps one downside was the lack of much of a bar scene on the premises  the lounge was for little more than that  lounging  before or after a day in the field  I also think the breakfast buffet could have offered more extensive variety of hot dishes  
P => Excellent in every way  We stayed in this hotel for   nights  and had two rooms  Each room was spotless and very comfortable The staff were without exception  very friendly and helpful We always ate breakfast at the buffet  and it gave us a great start for our days of sightseeing or shopping  
P => All the makings of a great stay The otel is a French chain of Hotels  so you know reputation and quality are somewhat important  You walk into the large open lobby and find a friendly  and very helpful  staff that all spoke English  There was free Wifi and Apple Computers for guests use in the Lobby as well  The Hotel rooms were very spacious  clean and comfortable  Water was replenished everyday along with nice towels and bathroom supplies  Though it is inevitable you ll have to take cabs a lot  I found the location to be very good  considering how spread out and large Beijing is  It is approx  a    minute walk to Tian men Sq  and   minute walk to one of the busiest shopping roads in the city  I believe it s called Wangfujing Road  There is a great Food market that opens at night on that road  if you are up for eating Dog  Snake  Squid  and whatever other mystery meat the vendors offer  I did not get an opportunity to try the buffet because it was rather expensive  but it did look amazing Overall  I really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling who is not on a very strict budget or who can find a good deal  
P => Very central Stayed at the otel Peace several times  It is a good   star hotel in the centre of Beijing opposite the Peninsula and close to Wangfujing shopping street  From the airport it will take you about   min  The rooms are clean and spacious but the decor is a bit old fashioned  If you book one of the Premiere rooms you get access to the lounge  Breakfast is great and offers a big selection of Asian and European dishes  In the lobby there are two computers and guests have free access to the internet  
P => give the executive floor a go Somehow   I m still not sure how  we ended up on the executive floor of the hotel for   nights during the olympics  We really enjoyed the perks of this  Private check in  You have an enormous room   although strangly a very tiny bathroom with a leaky shower screen  You have your own floor to take a bespoke breakfast with fantastic views across the city and in the same place every night between       they hold  quot happy hour quot  which is free unlimited drinks and food   very civilised  The room service is a fair price  although the food can be a bit tepid  but the buffet restaurant in my opinion is hugely overpriced  In the location you are you are right in the thick of the city so there are plenty of places to eat and right on top of the shopping centres  Nice hotel  
P => Found Peace at the otel Peace Beijing I know this review is long overdue but I couldn t resist telling everyone how grand my experience had been in this hotel My   colleagues and I recently had a business trip in Beijing last              When we arrived at the hotel  I noticed some fixing going on in the entrance just in front of the revolving door  We got two rooms for a    day stay in the   th floor  The receptionist told us that occupants of our room was yet to check out so if we could wait for    mins  Well  ok  No worries  We put all our luggages in the other room and decided to have a walk in Wangfujing which is nearby  After an hour stroll  the room was ready and with one of my colleague  we transferred our stuffs to the next room What I liked about this hotel is the accessibilty to almost everything  It is stratgically located at the centermost part of Beijing  It is a few steps to shopping malls  fast food chains  and banks  a few minutes walk to Forbidden City and the Tiananmen Square  few minutes drive to the world famous Silk Street ket  hehehe   where we hang out nightly  few minutes to The Nest Olympic Stadium and electronic market  You should check the electronic market  guys  I bought a Sony digital camera for half the price here in the Philippines  As the Chinese salesladies say   quot It s cheap ah  quot  It is also an hour or two drive to the Great Wall in Badaling  Nice view in the lounge through the glass wall where you can see the street outside  The hotel s lobby is majestic  Very well lit huge  feels comfortable and has a free WIFI access  The staff speaks very good English  thank God   very attentive and helpful  Thanks to the supervision of Ms  Sophie LePage  The forex is a little higher here in the concierge and they do not take a fee unlike when we exchanged money at the airport The room was clean  spacious  cozy and comfortable  The bathroom was also nice and my favorite place  the bathtub complete with hot and cold water  They tap and shower got a very good supply of water  There were nights that the water was dirty but they inform us in advance that they were fixing some pipes and tanks  They always left a note saying what time the repair would take place and what time the water would be available  Our room was in the   th floor so I had a pretty much good view of the city especially at night  The food  It was superb  I looked forward for the breakfast every morning at The Square  There were so many choices be it western or eastern breakfast  The breakfast was to die for  The European supervisor made us feel comfortable and always offering us coffee when he could ask his staff to do that instead  I didn t catch his name but I will include him in my photos The staffs were great  I would like to commend the housekeeper in the   th floor  My roommate left his wallet in his bed with all his money  US dollars and yuans   He was quite worried and had no chance to go back  When we arrived in the evening  the wallet was beside the bathroom sink  Talk about honesty  Kudos to the housekeeping staff The not so bad side  The picture quality of our TV was bad  There were only a few English channels to choose from  The bar was not inspected before we checked in  There were empty cans inside the fridge and some soda stains  And we found out only on our last day  We were lucky it was not charged on us  The indoor pool closes at midnight  the only time we had the chance to swim  I hope they open it whole day round Overall  yeah  I loved it  I m looking forward for my next visit here sometime next year  
P => Nice Hotel in a good location The hotel is really central so location is brilliant to access the malls  forbidden city etc  Whilst there we went to the Badling section of the great wall  we hired a private taxi to do this as they wait for you  This cost us about     for the day  on the way we also got the chance to stop by the olympic stadium as the paralympics were on  The zoo is about    mins away from the hotel and costs about    to get in  was good to go and see the pandas  Didnt think much of the food both in the hotel and outside really but thats mainly because the food is so different to our idea of chinese food but if you are adventurous with what you eat then you wont be short of somewhere to go    If we ever went again I would stay at this hotel  rooms were fine  clean and had everything we needed  
P => Good mid range hotel   food terrible Spent four nights at this hotel  Good location for shopping and within half an hour walking distance to the Forbidden City  There were a lot of staff but they were not overly helpful  Tried the coffee shop twice for quick meals but the food was disappointing both Chinese and Western   bland and tasteless   cheaper and better quality to be found outside  Only two English language TV channels  The rooms were clean and comfortable  Overall  a typical otel  
P => Great hotel Spent three nights at otel Peace Beijing  y           Hotel lobby very nice and clean  front desk very helpful  Currency exchange available  also have business center  Concierge  very helpful with restaurants  tours to Great Wall and other sights  You must try Peking duck  out of this world  Rooms very clean and spacious  although carpeting and bathroom fixtures need updating  The biggest advantage for this hotel  location  location  location  Two blocks to Beijing s    shopping street  Wangfujing     minute walk to the Forbidden City  Pearl ket and Yashow ket  short cab ride away     RMB   Bring extra luggage  you will need it for all your shopping  Enjoy    
P => Good choice in central Beijing The otel Peace Beijing is a nice  mid range hotel that is reasonably priced and in a good location  The main restaurant offers an excellent buffet style meals offering both Western and Chinese dishes  and a lot of cook to order items  The rooms a bit dated but are  for the most part  reasonably spacious  some rooms in the newer wing are smaller   One problem in the springtime is the hotel s air conditioning is not yet on and the rooms can be stuffy since the windows don t open  except in the newer wing  The lobby is attractive and offers free wireless internet access  internet access in the rooms is available for a daily fee  Serivce was friendly and helpful  
P => otel Peace Beijing Wangfujing district Recently stayed at the otel in Beijing  found it to be very good  Very clean  staff spoke excellent English  and French  and were very helpful  The location is almost perfect   right next to the Wanfujing Station for easy access  plus a    minute walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City  It s also just across the road from a couple of shopping centers as well as many restaurants   we had Peking Duck   times  There s also a MacDonalds  Pizza Hut  KFC  Starbucks and a Haagen Daas if you need Western Food There is free wireless access in the lobby  plus   Apple Macs were set up for free internet access as well We stayed in a King size room which had a flat screen TV  although with only   English channels  Room was large  comfortable  very clean  Shower pressure was good  I mention this because I ve lost count of the showers that dribble in hotel rooms   We had a room at the back of the hotel and it was very quiet We didn t eat in the hotel because there were plenty of places just over the road Highly recommended  though expensive  
P => The Ideal Place to Stay in Beijing I have to agree with all the positive comments in the previous reviews  this hotel is ideally located  is to a good standard and is reasonably priced  we were in one of the premier rooms The concierge desk were helpful in arranging our day trip to the Great Wall  the Summer Palace and a quick look at the Olympic Stadium  They arranged for a driver to take us and stay at each location until we had finished and all for     Yuan  just under      which we paid upon return to the hotel  They also gave us some good advice about using taxi s ie how to say  quot turn the meter on quot  and suggested we make a note of the registration number so a complaint could be made if we felt that we had been overcharged  They also have cards with the hotel name in chinese which are useful to show taxi drivers when trying to return at the end of a long day The breakfast was great with so much choice  including delicious cooked to order pancakes  although we felt that the buffett dinner was perhaps not quite up to the same standard and a little on the pricey side when compared to outside  but still only     for three of us   If you want good chinese food  confirmed by the number of locals eating there  then the Xiu Lan is excellent with the average dish costing less than    and the portions are generous  beer only    a    ml bottle  The service was excellent and a couple of the waiters spoke a little english  out of the hotel  turn left and it is approx    m on the left If you are planning to go to Beijing I would recommend this hotel as an ideal base  As we were leaving they were just erecting some covering above the main entrance  we did receive a note on our last day saying that the windows are all about to be cleaned  so don t let this put you off  
P => Great base for seeing Bejing Stayed at this hotel for   nights whilst on honeymoon in t     Our room was clean and comfy and our en suite had a great walkin shower  which was welcomed after a hot summers day exploring the city Lots of choice for breakfast  waffles  fruit  bacon  egg fried rice   Hotel staff very helpful and they arranged taxi s for us to make day trips easier  Good location for exploring the city itself   only a    minute walk from Wanfujing Street  modern shopping street   We even walked back from Tiananmen Square one day   but if you re going to do that make sure you re wearing comfy shoes The hotel has a nice bar to unwind in of an evening   they d often have a pianist playing   and much to my husband s delight they had their own internet cafe as well We d recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a good base from which to see Bejing  
P => Nice Stay Perfectly good hotel  Handy for Forbidden City and Tiananmen SQ  We were in a premier room and it was excellent with plasma screen HUGE bed and nice robes etc  No problems  The breakfasts were good and the breakfast room was the restaurant at night  It was lacking in atmosphere at night so we went to  quot Le Cabernet quot  which was the French restaurant attached to the hotel and just outside to the right  Nice young French manager there and great food at a better price than the hotel restaurant  One tip if you want to go to the Great wall and the summer palace don t book a coach trip Have a word with the concierges who were really good  We had a taxi for     Yuan  about      for the day and he took us to the wall which was     hours drive away the Mutianyu part which is less touristy than Badaling  waited while we did it all then drove us to the summer palace and again waited till we were fifnished and we paid at the hotel when we arrived back  He even took us to the Bird s nest Olympic stadium  Great experience all round  
P => Great Hotel and Location I just checked out of the otel Peace Beijing and was extremely pleased with my stay  I had booked the Executive Floor room which was well worth the additional US    in the price as it included free internet service  evening cocktails appetizers and full hot breakfast in the   th floor Club Room with expansive views of the Forbidden City looking west overy Beijing The hotel is also extremely well situated in the heart of Beijing        minutes walking distance to Tianamen Square and the entrance of the Forbidden City  It s also in very close proximity to the Wangfujing pedestrian shopping street  The subway is only a   minute walk away  Cab from the Beijing Capital Airport was only     RMB  Ask the information desk at the airport to write the name of the hotel in Chinese for you to give to the cab driver  It s located just outside the arrivals area The guest rooms were amazingly well appointed and recently renovated  at least on the executive floor       It would have been easy to mistake this room for one at a W hotel in any other major city  Contemporary and upscale furnishings including a king bed  sofa and coffee table  As with most Asian hotels  the service was great with complimentary bathroom amenities galore  tea coffee service  robes  slippers and turn down service  The staff even folded my clothes left on the bed when they came in for the turndown service  Cost of the rooms was very affordable for central Beijiing at only about      RMB per night The buffet restaurant does a great job at providing a nice selection of western and asian fare for about US    for dinner  They had a number of vegetarian options Only a couple of minor downsides    the bed must have been one of the hardest I ve ever slept on  The fitness center was not terribly large and had a limited amount of equipment for use  Smoking is permitted in the lobby area which can get a little overwhelming  Tour desk and front desk staff spoke adequate english Look out for the very large groups of Air France crews that frequent this hotel  They move in large numbers  
P => A Good Hotel Chose this Hotel following reviews on this Website  was staying for a few days on a stopover from London to Sydney I went for the Executive Suite  yet again following advice from this website  The room was great  two LCD TVs  King Size bed  Air Con the works  couldn t fault it in anyway I used the Exec Lounge for the inc Breakfast and Evening Buffet and this was good  The only fault I would say  as with any buffet  is that if you go at the wrong time the food could be a little on the cold side I used the concierge service downstairs to sort out a couple of days trips  they were exceptionally helpful  I think it was around     for a very nice car and driver for the day  If you can I would recommend getting Mr Kong  his english was excellent and he took me to a very nice authentic chinese for lunch I used the    hr Restaurant as I was leaving  it was nice but not really my thing  I would recommend staying here as it was all very good  It probably lacked a little atmosphere and was very formal but if that s your thing  well fair enough  
P => new renovation After staying at this hotel last year I decided to book this hotel again but on the executive leve  I was not disappointed  I checked in on the   th floor and was given a room on the   th floor with great views  Breakfast on the executive level was very nice with plenty of food and custom ordered breakfast  Plenty of coffee  juices  fruit  pastries and chinese fare as well were available  The room was very nice with all new bathroom with rain shower and nicely appointed  Everything looks ready for the Olympics and the staff was great  I highly recommend this hotel for its location and helpful staff  
P => Great value and Location We booked our stay through the Accor centralized hotline  very convenient  We found our stay a pleasant one  and excellent value for money  Location is top notch  a stone s throw from Wangfujing and with many taxis in the area  Certainly a better choice for tourists than the overpriced Penninsula across the road We were upgraded  and the room  newly renovated West Wing  was excellent  very large with a separate living room TV area  small bathroom  and adjoining big bedroom space  No lack of space  except perhaps in the cramped bathroom  no tub  only shower   The room was clean and comfortable  and probably worth more than the price paid  Breakfast was a good spread of Continental  American and some  awful  Asian dishes  The Crepe waffle station was a highlight Service was moderately displeasing  but not immensely so  Although we booked a twin double room  clearly stated on our reservation  reception insisted that only b fast for one was included  the other being chargeable  which we disputed  and eventually won   Apart from that and a few other service hiccups  some staff were great  especially the taxi bell boy and luggage service Overall a recommended choice for value conscious travelers  
P => Good hotel good location good value We loved   the central location in Wangfujing  short walk from Forbidden City  night market  great shopping etc     wonderful buffet breakfast with a French flair eg crepes and delicious croissants among many other stuff   comfortable rooms  friendly staff  cheap for what you get and in comparison with similar neighboring hotels 
P => Great hotel for a great price My stay at the otel Peace was great  The room was very comfortable and had a great view of Beijing  The staff were first class  Their English was great and they always willing to help  The Hotel was very clean and well maintained  The buffet breakfast was very nice and always looked fresh  The bar was also very nice with great views outside  Overall a very good hotel and when i return to Beijing in     i will stay there again  
P => Very centralized hotel Apparently  the rock bottom pre paid rates guaranteed at accorhotels asia com is not a pre pay situation  We had to pay upon check in  bring a copy of your printed reservation with rates  Love the fact that kids eat free and b fast selection was very extensive  most of the AF crew stay here   Bed is very firm  you can bounce coins off it   Least troublesome hotel among all the Accor brands for my entire trip  Good location and close to everything  OBTW  if you re flying into Beijing airport late  go for the hotel arranged shuttle van  No need to give unfamiliar directions to taxi drivers  
P => Fantastic Hotel with Excellent Service As I lone woman traveller I read many reviews of hotels in China before choosing this one  I was so pleasantly surprised by the hotel  and would highly recommend it  I was there for   nights  my room looked out onto the front of the hotel  I was able to open the window  and even though there was building work going on next door  the hotel advised me of this in a note left in the room  The room was clean  quite spacious  the bathroom was amazing with a huge shower and the room was always cleaned and replenished daily  English was spoken by a lot of the staff  I used the business centre twice daily and never had any problems  Breakfast was excellent  and because the hotel is used by Air France crew breakfast included French crepes  I was able to sit in the bar in the evening writing my diary and was made to feel welcome and the bar staff were extremely attentive  One evening I ate in the French restaurant attached to the hotel  and the food and service were second to none  The location of the hotel was my main reason for choosing it  walking to the Forbidden City takes about half an hour down Wangfujuing Street  the Night ket is just along from the hotel for an experience you have to see  taxis were readily available for further travel  I met with a friend in China and the hotel rang my friend for me and gained directions for the taxi driver  I would hearily recommend this hotel to others  the carpet in the corridor to my hotel was stained  but otherwise it was extremely clean  friendly  and welcoming  
P => Good value for money otel PeaceSpend   nights and otel Peace and can recommend it  Rooms are might appear a bit tired  but they are spacious  with sofa and table  toiletry articles sufficient and re supplied daily    complimetary water bottles  a c worked well  and we could even open the window  Nice little sitting area created through couch  armchair and coffee table where we could sit in the evening  TV unfortunately offered only small selection of English channels  BBC and a Chinese channel featuring some English programs   no German channel  Bathroom appeared to be very clean and was quite spacious  separate room for shower and loo and bidet   quite practical actually    Shower head was at a high enough position for European heights  but could unfortunately not be removed  No noise from outside in the morning   The location is terrific  close  walking distance  to Metro  many huge shopping centers as well as Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square  There are also some restaurants further up and down from the hotel  try Qunjude Roast Duck restaurant on   Shuaifuyuan Hutong        in small hutong next to Shopping Centre Oriental Plaza and ca    min  walk from hotel   Finding a restaurant further away can turn out to be problematic  since taxi drivers do not speak English and unless you have the address of where you want to go written out in Chinese  I would not recommend attempting to communicate with the taxi driver  at least once a day one taxi driver drove us around and around the hotel  refusing to listen to what we were telling him and although he had the address   also  beware  drivers tended to approach a location that was basically in a straight line from the hotel by circling around town    luckily  taxis are still cheap   Hotel also has French restaurant next door that serves food till a little before    pm   pizzas were delicious and large enough for   people to share  With a taxi it is about    min  with taxi to Silk ket  if there is no traffic jam     and costs somewhere between         Euro  depending on traffic  Pearl ket is about     Euros  When leaving these markets  avoid leaving when shops close as finding a taxi is very hard  And only use taxis with meters and beware of drivers that want to charge    or    Euro for the drive What we enjoyed at the hotel was that the swimming pool  even if only indoor  not deep and not very beautifully decorated  stayed open until    pm  which made it possible to go sightseeing  shopping and out to dinner and enjoy the evening swim  Also nice that hotel provided Jacuzzi and sauna and gym  free of charge   What we disliked was that some women were swimming in their clothes and no one really cared when we reported that  In any case  the existence of the late pool must be ideal for familiesBreakfast was good  except coffee  Sadly  Chinese dishes did not state whether they were suitable for vegetarians and staff did not speak English    Nice touch   weekends it remained open longer  The restaurant where breakfast is served was big and sunny  Also  there was a smoking section  so that should make smokers happy Staff was very polite  and while only few people could really speak English  all efforts were made to come to understand us Recommend this hotel to both young and older people  business travelers  families etc  Would definitely stay again  
P => Loved the otel Peace We stayed   nights and thought our accommodation was top class Because Beijing prices are low compared with our home town  London  UK  we felt able to splash out on the top of the range accommodation  The top few floors are called  quot executive quot  and they have their own breakfast floor  with great views    th floor  you can see the roofs of the Forbidden City   From   to   every evening they have a Happy Hour in which you get free food and wine  mostly European food  So while we had a great time there  I must emphasise that we were in the best accommodation the hotel had to offer  There was even free internet connection  I didn t even get that in the otel in high tech Singapore   We had a suite  of two large rooms plus large bathroom   Everything worked fine    th floor and great views  not much to see  given the pollution  but that s something else      The bed was extremely large   and extremely hard  I can imagine that bothering some people  We really enjoyed having such a firm mattress so we didn t mind We had one evening meal at the hotel restaurant on the ground floor  The food is mostly Western and quite poor quality  There s a decent souvenir shop available too I chose the hotel for its location  It s in walking distance of the Forbidden City  It s further to Tianeman Sq but certainly doable  We took a cab to the Temple of Heaven  as that s a bit further off  Taxis come by the hotel the whole time and are very cheap The hotel is right by Wangfujing which is a busy pedestrianised shopping street  Very popular on Saturday night  Also close by is a food market street  I walked through the market which was thronged with Chinese early on Saturday evening  Some hideous looking  quot foods quot  for sale   from a Western perspective  that is  They didn t mind me taking photos Unfortunately  there are prostitutes hanging out near the hotel  Also  Westerners are constantly being approached by young people claiming to be students  always asking  quot how are you  Where you from  quot  and telling you they want to practise their English  Only one pair admitted that they really were trying to coax me into going into an art gallery  It gets to be very annoying I had decided against booking guided tours from abroad and I m sure that saved a lot of money  We booked tours from the hotel  We went with another couple with a guide and driver to the Ming Tombs  where we remembered to ask them to take us to the Spirit Way which has the most amazing statues  and Great Wall  For a whole day s travelling it was  for us  extremely cheap  Also  we went on the Hutong Tour which takes you round living quarters of old Beijing  Excellent A quick tip about the Forbidden City  Go to the main entrance  and when approached by an English speaking guide  ask to see their badge  Then book them for your personal tour  It s cheap and we had excellent service with the first person to appoach us  No need to book a formal guided tour with loads of people And go to the Temple of Heaven park on Saturday morning and see the people doing tai chi and groups singing revolutionary songs together  
P => My wonderful stay at the otal Peace Beijing This is a very tourist friendly hotel in an excellent location  walking distance to the Forbidden City   The staff is very competent  a hotel guest could not ask for better service than that provided by this hotel s staff   the deluxe room I stayed in was perfect  The tourist information in the lobby is also very helpful  I will definitely stay at this spectacular hotel again  
P => Not Recommended Stayed there for four days  Lots of problems for us  Check in was easy and they gave us the room we requested  inter connecting rooms and rooms with windows  after reading the reviews here    However  upon arriving at the rooms  we found the rooms dirty and outdated  Having stayed here   years before when they were undergoing renovation  we wondered why the rooms are still so old  We were given one big corner room  might be the suite  and one standard room  Beds are hard  Air con on the suite room seem to be not working at all which is a problem for hot summer days  Breakfast was a real chaos  we booked via the official site and they stated that children under    do not pay for breakfast  However  when we got to the breakfast restaurant  they told us that the children had to pay  The people who work there could not speak english and kept on insisting that  quot children don t pay half price quot  which we don t even say at all  At last we had to go back to our rooms and fetch the booking statement that we printed  The waitress then ask us to go to the receptionist  We had a row first at the receptionist  because after he saw our statement  he told us that breakfast are free if we had ordered the breakfast first from the internet  It was SO ridiculous  seeing that we had stayed at various otels and didn t encounter this problem  Finally when we finally had our tempers real on  he gave up and we only had to pay for the adults  By the time we got there we found that the breakfast wasn t so special at all Overall our stay wasn t pleasing at all    not with the hot weather with useless aircons  and our outdated room  What makes it worse is that on the day we left  we realized that there are some rooms which is already updated with modern plasma TV and stuffs  
P => Excellent cheap and central We thought this was a really lovely hotel  Very central  cheap  clean and comfortable  We stayed here from   e    for   nights   We contacted the hotel in advance to ask for early entry to our room  which was not a problem  The staff were polite  spoke good English and helpfull  The lobby is very nice and rooms very clean   The one thing I would comment on  is the lift is at the other side of the building  however  the bell service bring your cases so you don t need to carry them  Oh and when you first sit on the bed  it feels like a solid rock  however  we found it surprisingly comfy  The breakfasts were a bit of a hit or a miss  There was a really good selection  but I found most mornings it was cold  There were freshly made omlettes  and pancakes  however  the pancakes had usually been sitting for a while   There was a swimming pool  however  we didn t even see it  let alone use it  so I can t comment on that  I would definately stay here again  it was a   min walk to the central shopping street    min walk to the nearest tube  amp     min walk to Forbidden City   
P => A rather bland hotel We stayed at the otel Peace Hotel for  nights in     The hotel lobby is probably the best feature of the entire hotel  We requested for a non smoking floor on our on line reservations but was given a smoking room  When we asked to have a non smoking room  we weret told that we will have to wait for at least another  hrs  As we have young children with us age   amp   yrs old and having came in an overnight flight we decided to take the room  The room is spartan with a small window overlooking the delivery trucks coming to the hotel  The white linen on the sofabed had brown stains on them which one can only guess what it is  However  ouse keeping did come to change the sheets promptly  The hotel is about   minutes walk to Wangfujing  Food at the restaurant is so so  Will we stay in this hotel again   Most unlikely et from Australia 
P => Good value and location Our first hotel in China  We had a nice suite at a reasonable price  Located centrally near the Snack street  Forbidden City and just off Wangfujing  A short taxi ride to most sites that are too far away for walking Helpfull staff and a great buffet  although a little pricey  Since we were not sure about what where to eat the first few day we ate a hugh breakfast here and took an apple and banana with us for lunch Our last day  they stored our luggage all day at no cost ontil we returned to pick it up All in all a nice place  
P => Great location For a four star hotel this is good value and in a great location opposite the far more expensive Peninsular  It is a walk  but quite a long walk  to the Forbidden City  take a cab The rooms are quite comfortable  I was fortunate to be upgrade to a suite until I found that there were no windows in the suite  Seriously there were no windows but a very big suite  It was like being in a cave The buffet breakfast is one of the best and when you book make sure it is included in your room rate  There are not many other alternatives near by The bathrooms are a good size athough I don t understand why hotels put in rain shower heads when they limit the flow of water  
P => otel in excellent location We stayed here for   nights         il        The staff were great  arranging for an excellent english speaking driver to take us to The Great Wall and other sites around Beijing including acrobatic and kungfu shows   which were actually very good  The hotel itself was busy  with a tourist rather than a business base  It is in an excellent location  within easy walking distance of the major shopping street  the Forbidden City  Tiananmen Square and the night food market  Taxis are easy and cheap to get for other destinations The room we stayed in was a  quot deluxe quot  at CNY       plus     for a rollaway bed   there were   of us   It was a corner room with plenty of space and a view out towards the Forbidden City  The decor was a little tired  We were told renovations were underway and we might be disturbed during the day but we never noticed anything  The bathroom was spacious but a bit dingy and rundown  It didn t matter though  we had a very happy stay and would return   unless the Peninsula Palace over the road was giving away rooms  The Regent is also close by  The breakfast buffet was very good  although expensive by Chinese restaurant criteria  but this is standard for China  I particularly liked the crepes with chocolate  The swimming pool is indoor and an adequate size with a good spa next to it  
P => Very ent Hotel I had a weekend stay at the otel Peace Hotel  The location is quite good  It is about   minutes from a major pedestrian shopping district and about       minutes walk from the South Gate of the Forbidden City  The staff are nice  The lady who checked me in spoke solid English and I noticed that the person checking in beside me also had a staff member who spoke solid English  There are staff who have trouble speaking English  however  they speak more English than I speak Mandarin   but there is always someone near who works there who can assist you if you run into any trouble The rooms are a little older and not very fancy  but they are adequate and clean  My room would not be considered a room for a romantic getaway  but as a tourist  it fit the bill completely  The washroom is also clean and the amenities provided with the washroom are decent  toothbrush  ear buds are included too   There are   bottles of water      ml each  provided as you are not recommended to use tap water in China  The hotel breakfast is excellent  A buffet of Chinese and Western food is provided  You can get fresh fruit  pancakes  french toast  toast  eggs  bacon  etc  Checkout was very simple and fast  The front desk is staffed with enough people so that the guests do not have to stay waiting that long  They also help with providing maps and directions for the local sights in Beijing A tour desk can be found in the lobby in case you would like to sign up for a city tour or an extended tour outside the city  
P => Good value for money Hotels are quite expensive in Beijing and given the good rate I got through internet booking for this hotel  the room and other amneties have been above my expectations  I had been given a standard double room in the recently renovated section and the room was comfortable  However  a problem with the shower room door proved to be a dangerous and they required me to move to another room  I was reluctant as I had only   more nights and they persisted and gave me a small suite at no extra cost  Overall  service was good and prices of drinks at the lobby lounge reasonable as compared to other hotels and restaurants  I had previously stayed at the Beijing Hotel at double the price and find the otel a much better deal  
P => Rubbish I stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of a business trip before flying back to the UK  The reception and public areas were very stylish and contemporary  However  the room I was allocated was a non renovated room and was shabby and tatty  and clearly in need of the pending renovation  I had booked a Superior Room but fail to see how the room I had booked could be so described  I wouldn t stop at this hotel again  and would not recommend it unless you have a guarantee of receiving a renovated room  
P => Get a suite deal I booked a last minute stay for two night at the Peace hotel  I went directly to the novotel website and found that I could book a king executive suite for about      per night  The room on the top floor so the view was great  and the room was huge  Actually it was like two rooms  one was a large bedroom with a king bed and great furnishings  the other was a sitting area complete with couch  chairs  large tv  and a dining area that sat   people  I had two full bathrooms and the executive concierge lobby was down the hall  I had free snacks and drinks after       and they also set up a breakfast in the morning  Everything was perfect  I would highly reccomend this hotel  but spend a few extra bucks and get an executive suite  
P => Beijing s best We stayed there in ober this year and found it to be very clean  and having a large room and great facilities it was an ideal hotel for our pleasant stay in Beijing The breakfast buffet was the best we have ever encountered in all of our travels  and the bar which faced the street  and had  quot happy hour quot  was a great place to unwind after a day of shopping or touring It is also walking distance to the Forbidden City and the main shopping area as well We have recommended it to other friends who are visiting Beijing  
P => Loved the otel Peace Great hotel in terms of both room and service  I booked the deluxe room with king bed and it came with breakfast  Cost was approximately US      Great breakfast  great room  big and clean  and great service from the staff  When I first checked in  the safe in the room was out of battery  I called and immediately someone was sent up to replace the batteries  At another time  the tv remote was not working and immediately after calling  a service personnel came up to check on it for me  Great buffet breakfast every morning  Furthermore the hotel was at a fabulous location  right next to shopping and eating area     mins walk to forbidden city and tiananmen square  
P => Excellent location and very good room Just back from a trip to China  Stayed at this hotel for three nights  much better than expected after reading some comments on this site  We were given a very large corner room with triple aspect windows and sofas  very well appointed and comfortable Buffet breakfast very good Some excellent restaurants within easy walking distance Staff were OK but could have been a little more friendly 
P => Great Location Having previously stayed in Beijing before I wanted a hotel that was central and the novotel was definately this  It s only about a   minute walk to the main shopping street and very close to all the main attractions  I stayed here twice on my holiday at the start in y and at the end of my trip in ust and both times I had a great stay  Check it was quick and easy with the front desk staff talking good english  The room was large compared to other hotels and even though I had booked a standard room there was a fruit basket in my room  The hotel also provide small bottles of water in your room free of charge  The bathrooms in the standard rooms are not all that impressive and are a bit out of date but they are clean On my second stay I arrived early in the morning   am  and had expected to not be able to check in until later  when I asked at the front desk my room was not ready however they decided to upgrade to a suite even though I had booked a standard room  This room was awesome  it had a bedroom and connecting lounge room and the bathroom was really nice  The resturant I had breakfast two of the mornings I stayed and I can t fault the food  it was good  I m a chef in a hotel and often examine what people serve for breakfast the novotel had a great range of foods  A chef was cooking fresh pancakes  waffles and crepes for you  Another was cooking eggs  There is a section of freshly cut fruits  traditional chinese breakfast  cereals  juices  whole fruits  It is expensive     CNY I think  but it is worth it if you do eat alot for breakfast and the food is of a high quality The front desk was a great deal of help and so was the bell boys and concierge  They assisted me in instructing the taxi drivers were to go  plus they have small cards with a whole list of tourist places in both english and chinese  good to give the taxi drivers This is a hotel I would stay at again 
P => Nice downtown location Nice hotel in a great location  Pleasant lobby bar with good prices and good music  Terrific breakfast buffet If the       minute walk to the major attractions is too far for you  a cab is less than       USD  Lots to do within the    minute walk range Staff was very helpful in arranging tours and trip to the Great Wall Would definitely recommend this property  
P => Well situated but overated We moved from the riott West to the otel because of the convenient location  The entrance to the hotel is spacious and beautiful  The people at the desk were very helpful but we could not see a room when we came to check it out  We decided to give it a try and stayed   nights  We were put in a room in the  quot newer quot  part of the hotel  The room was a good size and the beds comfortable but that s about all the positive things I can say about the room It was very  very dirty  dark stains on the blue carpet  stains on the grey  old curtains  stains on the lamp shade  poor lighting  and broken cheap furniture The walls also needed a serious coat of paint as they too were very dirty The electric tea kettle was melted at the rim from the heat and I ended up with piece of pastic in my cup of tea  The bathroom was also in very poor condition  The towels were very old and the sink was chipped and had old black dirt marks I talked to the manager and explained how surprised I was to see a room in such poor condition in a   star hotel  I ask her to come and see the room  She did  and she seemed very surprised when she saw all I was pointed out in the room  Within   hours  she called us to tells us that she was putting us in a Deluxe room on the   th floor  The room was a bit cleaner and there was newer  more sturdy furniture the sink in the bathroom was also chipped  but overall  we were not impressed  The best part of this hotel is the location and the food  The breakfast and dinner buffet were excellent with a large variety and good quality of food  
P => Excellent value great location great food This was the second time I stayed there and both times were great  I rate it a standard   star  but at very resonable prices  The rooms are modern  clean  and large  The location is excellent  you can walk to the Forbidden City  Best of all is the amazing buffet breakfast lunch with both western and eastern food  When we first ate there on this trip  we pigged out for two solid hours   Mind you  we had just spent the previous three weeks in northern China and Russia  We had a small problem where we were too close to some construction in the hotel  so we had to ask them to move us  which they did  
P => Good hotel great location  I stayed in this hotel for   nights during       and really enjoyed it  My room was clean  spacious  two beds  and on the   th floor away from the road noise outside  In fact the whole hotel was nice and quiet  Bathroom was fairly basic but the room had everything you could want  Good small pool in the hotel  with sauna etc which was again always quiet Staff had a reasonable amount of English and the concierge were helful in finding restaurants etc  The main restaurant in the hotel had a buffet most days which I didn t fancy but the one occasion I did eat there the food was good  Someone else mentioned air crew  and they were plentiful  I think they keep the hotel going  but not a problem You could walk to the main shopping street and some good restaurants  and in    minutes you could walk to the Forbidden City  Taxis are plentiful in that area  but be warned you need your destination in Chinese  the hotel has some handy cards with the main tourist locations in Chinese for you  Just down the road is the Chinese night food market   one for those who want to try something different  It s an experience  Only once did I experience hte pimps outside but a simple  quot no quot  got rid of them  They are everywhere in China so nothing particular to the hotel I got a taxi from the airport which cost around   RMB which wasn t bad but I was lucky with the traffic  In fact I got taxis around most of the city as they are cheap   never consider driving as traffic is mad  
P => Not sure it warrants   stars While the common areas of this hotel are very nice  the rooms don t seem to live up to that promise  Rooms are quite basic  beds are very uncomfortable and bathrooms are very ordinary   don t even think abou taking a bath However breakfast was very good  as was dinner the one night we ate in  The location was very good with good restaurants and shops nearby  I was there with a group of girlfriends and the location felt very safe  The hotel seemed to be used by Air France for their staff overnights  and some mornings afternoons evenings  we d go to the lobby for drinks and every available  empty  table would be marked as being reserved for Air France A large group of us arrived at the hotel at check in time   pm  with our luggage  and only one of the   rooms was available and the reception staff were pretty unsympathetic Found reception staff and staff at the bar coffee lounge to be rude on more than one occassion Overall   we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again if the price was right  
P => A very good comfortable   star hotel This was our first hotel on an extended tour of Beijing  We enjoyed our stay there and were very happy with the hotel  We were not expecting it to compete with the five star hotels but it offered good decent accommadations  a great breakfast and a wonderful time Unlike the previous writer we had no problems out and about on the streets  Wangfujiang is close by and we happily ate at a local dumpling restaurant with no problems  As two women  we never felt threatened or harrassed  We looked like tourists but had no issues  There are great night food stands on Wangfujiang near the hotel   we did not eat at the stalls but it was fun to watch all the  action  Breakfast at the hotel was very good  Initially it didn t seem like much but we soon realized that all the hot dishes were around the chef stations along the back wall  the containers are recessed so you don t really see them   Croissants  as befitting a hotel with a French background were excellent Our room was good  decent  clean  of a   star quality  Ethernet Internet Access for a fee in the rooms with a daily maximum I believe of   RMB or     RMB We enjoyed our stay there and would return there again  There are very reasonable rates when you check prices on the Internet for this hotel

P => Excellent in all means Excellent otel in great location  Stayed for   nights in   Was in premier floor in the new wing and it meant great room with excellent amneties  free bf and internet  as well as free   laundry items per day and use of lounge and meeting rooms  Locaton is right in the city center with a metro stop just outside the main entrance  Also lots of western restaurants and shops  Very highly recommended  
P => Excellent   Star Hotel I ve stayed in a few   star hotels in Beijing and have found otel Xinqiao to be among the best  However  THIS STATEMENT ONLY APPLIES TO ROOMS IN THE NEW WING  if I remember correctly  the new wing is known as the A wing  while the old wing is the B wing   The rooms in the new wing are slightly larger  have more modern fixtures  are cleaner  and have more natural light  If rooms in the new wing are not available  go elsewhere because the old wing rooms are lousy  I think the differences in the rooms of each wing account for the sometimes contradictory reviews found on this thread If your hotel rate doesn t include breakfast  a great alternative is the hotel s little coffee shop by the main entrance  The coffee there is magnificent and they sell pastries as well Parking is RMB   per hour or RMB   per day  This applies whether you re parked in their underground garage or on the street in front  A great way to travel around this area is by rickshaw  On a previous visit I rode from Qianmen back to the hotel on a rickshaw for RMB   and it was one of the most pleasant experiences I had during that trip One negative about this hotel is that they don t always keep their word when it comes to meeting guests  requests for non smoking rooms  I ve stayed here three times  and twice they gave me smoking rooms even though I had explicitly requested non smoking ones  They eventually switched me to non smoking rooms but that was only after the first night  
P => Excellent hotel in a good location A typical otel with very clean rooms of a high standard  The food though was exceptionally good with a vast choice  buffet style  for both dinner and breakfast  No one could fault a single dish  Price also included wine and beer with the meal  Just across the road from a main shopping area with western style  and price  department stores  and a short taxi riide to the discount markets  jade market I think but not      sure   our guide said they all sell a mix of everything these days  the name doesn t mean too much     metro stop from Tiananmen Square  metro station right outside the hotel  
P => Excellent location but only very average otel Stayed   nights  Fantastic location  Easy to take the Airport Subway Express     yuan  to the connection for Subway line       yuan   then   stops to the corner directly in front of the hotel  So for    yuans  about    USD  you can get from the airport to the hotel  Fast  easy  amp  inexpensive  Both Subway lines     amp     stop directly in front of the hotel  so the fantastic Beijing Subway System makes it very easy  amp  inexpensive to move about the entire area  If you arrive by train it s only   long blocks to walk to the hotel  bt turning left when you exit the train station  The New World Shopping Center is   block away  which includes the usual US offerings of McDonald s  Starbucks  Pizza Hut  KFC  amp  Haagen Daz  if that is of interest to you  In addition  there are numerous great local restaurants throughout the area   amp  a fantastic local food market between the hotel  amp  New World  Anything  amp  everything that the locals want in terms of foods   amp  lots of offerings for tourists as well  There is also a small grocery store inside the market for your needs  Unfortunately  we found the hotel itself to be just average  It s an old building that shows its age  even though Accor Hotels has tried to keep it updated  If you are in the older section you can literally touch the low ceilings in the hallways   amp  we have had bigger bathrooms on cruise ships  The lobby has been totally remodeled with lots of marble  amp  blonde woods  which is typical of Accor Hotels   amp  the rooms have been updated as much as possible in an old building   amp  the AC puts out        Our reservations were not correct upon arrival  even though it was totally prepaid  amp  non refundable  so it was a hassle to get that straightened out  since the front desk personnel spoke very  very limited English or no other languages  Polite  amp  courteous  just unable to communicate effectively to solve the problems quickly  amp  efficiently  Finally found a front office supervisor  Hugo  who was able to make the corrections  High prices within the hotel reflect the chain hotel approach  but with so many offerings in the immediate hotel area there is no reason to use the hotel services anyway  There is a bakery adjoining the hotel building which other guests brag about  but we found the bakery  quot directly across the street quot  to be far superior   amp  it has a coffee bar which the one adjoining the hotel does not  The hotel has   computers for free guest internet usage in the Lobby  but there were usually several people waiting to use them  The hotel location cannot be beat  but we will choose riott Courtyard across the street on the next visit   
P => Look for a different option  I am not especially picky  but found this hotel to be disappointing on many levels   most pictures and the hotel s front exterior conceal what is essentially an old and run down building   the location is not bad per se  perfectly safe  but is rather girtty and boring and not within true walking distance of any noteworthy sights   the  quot cafe quot  is depressing and the food is not very good  the towels  hangers  refrigerators  desk  etc  all appear to be from the     s  giving the room a roadside Motel feel  Add a musty smell and the experience just gets depressing   Many rooms overlook a seriously run down tennis court  surrounded on one side  honestly  by a   s era hospital and Emergency Room  Overall  with so many affordable hotel choices now available in Beijing  the recommendation is clear  look elswhere  
P => Great value across the street from the subway station I enjoyed my stay at the otel Xin Qiao  The hotel is very centrally located about a       minute walk to Tiannamen Square and just   stops away on the subway to the Wangfujiang shopping street  The hotel is located right across from the Chongwenmen subway station which makes access around the city very easy  You can reach almost all the major city sights easily by subway  From the airport  we took the express train and then the subway which was fairly easy  Just note that you will need to buy another ticket when you go from the airport train onto the regular subway like    RMB from airport  subway   RMB   On the way back  we ended up taking a taxi for about    RMB right from the hotel  Just down the road from the hotel are two large shopping centres  New World Shopping Mall and the Glory Mall  I ended up eating at the food court at the Glory Mall which had fantastic meals for next to nothing       RMB  Actually  all the major shopping malls in the city  which you will see tons  have fantastic food courts where they cook up everything to order and they have models or pictures of what they are offering  You just need to point at what you want  There is a good blind massage place inside the New World Shopping Centre on the  th floor  If you like strong foot or body massages  you ll like this place  We stayed on the executive level of the hotel which gave you an upgraded room  free buffet breakfast  free internet access in the lobby and free happy hour which included free drinks and snacks in the executive level lounge  For breakfast  you can either have it on the executive level or go downstairs to the main level  The selection is a bit better downstairs but we chose to eat in the excutive level most days as it was much more peaceful and relaxing  The main buffet can get quite chaotic and crowded early in the morning when all the tour groups are getting ready to head out  We had booked a non smoking room and would recommend that if you do want a non smoking room to specify that when you book  It didn t seem like there were that many non smoking floors in the hotel  The room itself was comfortable enough  It had a flat screen tv and the typical hard bed  The concierge does try to push tours on you quite a bit and from the brochures I saw in the lobby  they were quite a bit pricier than what we found on the net  We ended up booking a Great Wall tour to Simatai with  quot Tour Beijing  quot  The rates with them were almost half what the hotel was offering  If you want to go to a quieter part of the wall  though it is quite a steep and physical hike  go to Simatai Overall  I had a fantastic stay at this hotel and wouldn t hesitate at all to go back  
P => Nice hotel for a fair price  We booked   standard rooms by internet  a double room           nights  and at arrival the hotel offered us to pay a surplus to be upgrated to senior rooms including breakfast at the   th floor  like a business center   happy hour every day from   to    which was fun because of all different kinds of people attending   free internet in the rooms     computers available at the   th floor for free use  Free metro tickets  Laundry   pieces per day per room included and quick check out  This upgrade was worth its money        per person per week  The bell boys downstairs were very nice and helpfull and at reception they attented very nice  polite and friendly  With the bell boys we arranged our tour to the Chinese wall by a private cab and at the travel agency desk we bought tickets for the Kung fu show  which is really recomendable  We had dinner in the japanese restaurant from the hotel which was very nice  Once we had lunch in the chinese restaurante from the hotel which was also nice and further we had some lunches in the pianobar of the hotel  Service there took quite some time but the food was good Roomservice was quick and tasteful Just outside the hotel is the metro and temple of heaven  tiananmen square  forbidden city are all to reach by walk  I do recommend this hotel  
P => Lacks respect for diverse clientelle  I had many issues checking into the hotel although arrangements had been made with the manager before with   e mails  The front desk staff were not helpful and I had to threaten to call their corporate office in order for them to do their jobs  While waiting in line for several minutes for them to correct another issue a desk staffer made a choice to give superior service to other guest and ignore me Some of the staff would make a negattive reference to my appearance in Chinese  although they did not know that I spoke the language  I dressed in business casual attire  I have traveled around the world and have never met such disrespect from a company   Housekeeping great and food on premeire floor was pretty decent  
P => Good hotel The hotel is good  our room was on the small side  but manageable  The room was clean  I have two complaints   first  the lobby was always crowded while the staff were excellent it sometimes took a while to get to the counter  be it the front desk  tour desk  etc   The restaurants all close too early  so late at night your dining options are limited I would stay here again  
P => Good hotel   good service Stayed for three nights in         found the rooms very clean and comfortable  shower was excellent  The breakfast was very good  This hotel is also in an excellent position for visiting Beijing would recommend without reservation  
P => Comfortable stay with everything you need  Four night stay at otel Xin Qiao Beijing Hotel has been renovated for    Olympics  so disregard older posts before that time Reception staff was friendly  check in and out was quick and easy Room was quite large with everything you need  extremely big bed  bar fridge  kettle  TV  etc As is quite normal in China  the bed is quite hard Bathroom very clean but towels a bit old and frayed at the edges Room service was excellent   good value and good food Our room faced the street outside but was still very quiet English level of staff could be better  speak slow and as few words as possible and you ll be fine Hotel is just outside Subway station and has excellent location Internet in room is about RMB   per day  cable   Two computers available in lobby free of charge though Will stay there again  
P => Wonderful place to stay The hotel was fantastic  Very clean rooms  air conditioning that works perfectly  a large LCD TV that had a good selection of English language programming  and of course conveniently located near many of the city s cultural sites  Many of the staff spoke moderate English to understand what I was trying to say  It s right by Chongwenmen subway station  I wish the hotel offered complementary internet service in your room  but you have to pay for that  Instead  there were a couple of Macs in the hotel lobby for guest use  
P => Loved the Coffee Shop Beijing is of course a fantastic place to visit  novotel only increases the pleasure of the trip The excellent hospitality services and good housekeeping did the trick for otel Great hotel  great location  great food and a wonderful experience  
P => Ideal base for seeing Beijing s sights After a    night stay at the etel xin qiao both my wife and I have no complaint s at all  Reading previous reviews we requested a room that was outward facing  not inwards towards either the breakfast room or lounge bar   We were facing the rear which was quiet while a couple we met who were facing the front  the main road  stated it could be rather loud The staff were excellent and proffesional whenever we needed anything plus the western breakfast selection was the best we have had after previous stays in either mainland China  Taiwan or Hong Kong Although not related to the hotel please be aware of the  quot students quot  who will approach you  especially on the walk from the hotel to Tiananmen square  who appear very sincere wishing to practice their English on you  if you look western   I have never been fleeced before after years of travel but ended up being charged over      RMB        for tea when suggested to go into a tea room by    quot students quot  after chatting away and walking for a while  The whole situation was very awkward with both my wife and I refusing to pay but ended up negotiating a way out by paying half the price  which is still obviously over the top   This left a sour taste of the trip and we were approached by another   groups of  quot students quot  afterwards who we politely asked to go away The location is ideal with Chongwenman subway station right by the front door which is on   lines and only   RMB for any journey around the city when using the Yikatong card  This was easily purchased from the subway station Overall a great hotel in an interesting city  
P => Great hotel During our time in Beijing  we stayed at both the otel Xin Qiao and otel Peace  In my experience  I think the otel Xin Qiao was a better stay  The rooms were cleaner and seemed newer  The best part was that it is literally right outside the subway so you can practically go anywhere  I also liked it because we had a room facing the lounge  I know others might not like it because of the loud music  but it was nice to be able to get some air inside the room  
P => Acceptable Hotel The Good    Next to a subway  Very convenient especially in the cold and unpredictable weather  Free internet    PC at the lobby for use by the guest  There is a   hr Yong He restaurant about    m away  Cheap and good  Took most of our breakfast there  Also a ajisen ramen  KFC nearby   Some massage palours across the street  Very useful  There is a blindman massage down the street   A supermarket near YongHe for some shopping   Room is clean and niceWhat could be improved  Housekeeping could be improved  Did not really tidy the room well  
P => Do not leave your cash in the room s safe deposit box            The hotel was fine but please don t think for one minute that it is safe to deposit money in the  safe deposit box  Stayed at this hotel while on Hayes  amp  Jarvis   Day China Experience  On arrival we placed      in a zipped bag into the safe deposit box  When we left for Xian a couple of days later we took the bag out of the safe deposit box and placed it in our hand baggage On arrival at Xian we found that the      was missing from it s bag  yes we should have checked it before we left   This could only have been taken from the safe deposit box while at the otel as the hand baggage had been in our possession since we left the hotel We reported the theft to our guide asking that the company report the theft to the police and the hotel and he assured us that his manager would sort this out for us We were then informed that the hotel would do nothing for us as we had left and couldn t prove that the money had been in their safe deposit box  which we couldn t have done if we had discovered the theft while still there  and that they wouldn t provide a theft report for our insurers  We were also informed that the tour company wouldn t report the theft to the police or provide us with a theft report  apparently they don t like bad publicity  
P => Great Location and exceeded expectations I have to say  I wasn t really expecting that much and thought it would just be a place to crash  However  I was extremely surprised by the service and standards I saw in this hotel  I found the staff friendly  amp  holpful and I thought the room was plenty big enough and very clean  The shower we had was excellent  I love a good shower  and the one in our room didn t disappoint  The location is excellent for getting pretty much anywhere  with the metro stop just outside We didn t eat in the hotel at all  Why would we when breakfast at The Windmill Bakery  Look for the bear over the street  was so delicious  amp  so cheap  My Fiance loved the Treasure Islands Also  just up the road at the Oriental Shopping Plaza is Megabite  An excellent food court serving a vast array of food at super cheap prices  We d both eat a large dinner plus a dink and it d cost less than     As a tip  we found that no matter which seats you paid for at the theatre  they just put you at the front  So always just buy the cheapest  
P => Nice place Stayed at the room       at a premium level  The room was clean and had a very nice view  The breakfast and the happy hour meals were available on the   th floor for all premuim guest at no charge  The food was actually much better than I anticipated  The hotel kind of surprised me in a good way since it had the same   star rating as a hotel I stayed in Kunming for   days before i got to Beijing and that place was a NIGHTMARE  
P => A ent Holiday Maker s hotel Stayed for  N  experienced both the Premier level           and Standard room           at Wing A  Both rooms faced the main road and are pretty comfortable  Premier lounge at Level    served evening bites from   to   pm  The choice are pretty standard  no variety  One can quench your thirst  has choice of cocktail  beer  juices plus brewed coffee and tea  Breakfast choice is a mix of continental and oriental  quite a good spread for maybe the first   days  there after get a little bored when same food is served for the next few days  Breakfast is complementary if guest book at Premier level or need to pay about RMB     per pack    RMB value for money        Fast food ie McD  Starbuck are available across the main road       metres   Huge shopping complex also located across the road  Otherwise the staffs speaks functionable English  not much of difficulties to understand each other  The concierge staffs are very friendly and resourceful  Helpful when you want to get city and subway map and to get other informations  Can t enjoy the other facilities  the swimming pool and sauna was closed for maintenance work The hotel is very conveniently located in front of subway Line    very convenient to move around for only RMB   per trip  The subways are well planned with signage in both Mandarin and English  One can easily reach the hotel thru taxi  subway or airport shuttle  We choose shuttle service   Bus      for only RMB    per person  shuttle stopped about     metres from the hotel  very convenient  Try not to book any day tour offered at the hotel  the choice is limited and highly priced  My wife and I booked the day tour thru e tourbeijing com  The tour was in small coach tour  English speaking guide which is really value for money  The cost of tour also includes entrance fees plus a typical lunch  
P => Pleasant Enough   But Review for Room The hotel room was very neat and compact  I was clean and looked after well by the staff on a daily basis  Quiet at night  But never get a room on the floor that faces the dining room unless you want to be awakened by the sound of Bkst and dinner music and plates  I use earplugs so I never heard a thing unless they fell out  The windows on the rooms open onto the dining room  It would be building B   Not sure about value for money  The     service charge now being imposed by the govt and their rate might make this overpriced  The food is pretty good since it is western and Asian  The udon noodle were fantastic one day and disappointing the next  Go figure To save money buy your water elsewhere  The water in the hotel is    yuan for a liter  FYI there is a    shop behind the hotel  Come out of the hotel turn left  turn left again at the corner of the building at the bakery    walk in the alley beside the eye hospital and keep heading left you will see the green shop sign  The carry snacks  drinks etc  Its safe we went to    girls at      pm The nearness of the subway would help those who use it  I chose taxis The hotel rooms are very hot  The cooling system needs adjusting  The shower stall overflowed each day onto the floor  For   days I called maintenance only to have them tell me it was fixed and me get up in the morning and flood the tiny bathroom  I had to use my extra towels to mop up a corner to apply makeup  They said that the problem was fixed and the  nd time I believed them and by the third morning it was time to check out so I never got a chance to request another room  It was gross  
P => Not the usual otel Standard I booked to stay at the otel Xin Qiao Beijing for two nights in the Suite Duplex  ending my two months study visit to China  I booked this hotel specifically for the location  after all the comments from fellow Trip advisers  I cannot make any comment about this  because we never walked any where from the hotel  As it was our final nights in China  we were out Drinking in Sanlitun and woke up with bad hangover the next day  What I can comment on though  is that the subway stop is literally right in front of the hotel entrance  so that was convenient  In our hangover state  we ordered room service  and the food turned out pretty good  A bit hard trying to communicate with the lady on the phone though  Oh  and u should try out the burger    awesomeHousekeeping was very disappointing  As our beer bottles and wine glasses were not cleared out the next day  the glasses weren t even washed  Checking in and out was done on the Premier floor  and was nice and quick  Staying in the premier floor means we get the free breakfast and happy hour   happy hour was great  selections of nibblies and lots of drinks and alcohol  Breakfast was standard Room wise  was ok but has quite a weird layout  It was basically a two stories suite  which the living room was downstairs  and up the spiral stairs was the bed room  There were two entrance to the room  upstairs and downstairs  and also two bathroom  Also upstairs bathroom has a Bidet  Overall  judging this hotel in comparison with the otel Atlantis Shanghai  i would say that this hotel would need to work a little bit harder in getting the usual   star standard for otels  
P => ent   star hotel ent hotel we stayed on the executive floor   breakfast buffett was ok  nothing fantastic  great coffee  Happy hour on the executive floor has open bar but horrible snacks  staff on the executive floor are helpful but very limited english  Lobby is very smoky  chinese smoke everywhere   i would stay here again   this is my  th visit i guess its not that bad   hahahahaha 
P => Great Value and location This is a great value for money hotel  the rooms are small but have just been renovated and have small but excellent bathrooms  lots of amentieis are in the bathroom to use  The location is very good  just at the front of the hotel is the metro  the Forbidden City and Shooping area are about a    minute walk  but there are great small streets to walk along when you are going to these places  The check in out is a bit slow  but set your expectations begore you get there  The buffet breakfast is also very good  
P => Absolutely Loved It This hotel was amazing  The room looked like they had just recently renovated it  It was spacious enough to have a couch and table on one side of the room and two beds on the other side  Flat screen TV and a beautiful bathroom with hot shower and very good water pressure  The staff was wonderful  I was having trouble booking a flight on line to travel within China and the front desk called the airline and had someone come and meet me at my room with the airline ticket  The hotel staff also set up a car to take me to the Great Wall  Ming Tomb  and Summer Palace for     Yuan   the car picked me up at      and we got back around       Free internet in the lobby  I can t say anything bad about this hotel   I didn t want to leave  
P => Good location but not such a great hotel We stayed at the otel during the Olympics  as part of a package  We had a choice between a Chinese hotel and the otel  and chose the latter  mainly because of it s convenient location right next door to a subway station and a few km  from Tianamen Square and the Forbidden City  Because of the Olympics  the hotel was fully booked and staff had to deal with many matters  all new to them We had asked for a superior room  non smoking and according to front desk  that is what we got Our room was on the second floor of the  quot A quot tower  overlooking the main entrance and road  which was nice  We were not too pleased with the room  it looked very tired and had seen better days  No door covering the closet  so it made it look rather  quot airport hotellish quot    and the furniture needed updating  stains on the carpet  The bathroom was very small  with a shower in the bath tub with a showercurtain which needed replacing  full with mould   The room had a stale smell and was definitely a smoker s room  But as we had a full schedule with the Games and sightseeing  and would be in the room only for sleeping  we decided to stay   As many reviews have stated  the beds are very hard indeed  as that is the way the Chinese people like their matrasses  but we found them to be really comfortable  You get used to it and it s very good for your back  The a c was working very well We later learned that the rooms in the  quot B quot tower had been renovated  Walk in powershower  flat screen TV on the wall  ironing board and dressingmirror covering the closet  So  Ask for a renovated room in the  quot B  tower  so much more value for money  The first night  house keeping came only to close the curtains       the wastebaskets were not emptied and no clean towels  although we had placed them in the bathtub  We learned  that the rooms in the  quot B quot tower had towelchange twice a day and that the wastebaskets were emptied  After our complaint with the frontdesk  we learned that the same should be done in our wing and indeed  towelchange in the evening happened once  later no more  So  every night  after we came in  sometimes well after midnight  we had to call housekeeping for clean towels The shampoo and bodylotion was not replenished  although that should be the case  so we had house keeping bring it over every night We aked for a wake up call a few times  We got it only once  but it was again  forgotten quot on the day of our dearture  so we almost missed our flight A breakfast buffet in the coffeshop  Only guests of the  quot A quot tower were allowed in  the guests of the  quot B quot tower had to have breakfast in the stuffy Chinese restaurant on the fourth floor Breakfast was ok  Plenty of fruit and a choice of eggs  But as most guests had their breakfasts early in the morning  it happened more than once that at       there was no more cheese  no more croissants or sweet rolls  It took a few days before this problem was solved The French restaurant  quot La Cuisine quot was taken over by the French officials  and we were not allowed in  Lunch in the coffeeshop took forever  One day we ordered a hamburger  we were the only guests  and it took almost    minutes before it came on the table The Chinese staff hardly spoke any English  but espacially the front desk was staffed with a few European ladies  When we complained about the non existent towelchange and the always forgotten wake up calls  in a friendly way   one of the staff started crying    Later on  one of the Chinese staff told us  that they had learned so much in the course of the Olympics  A really positive sign Two computers for the guests to use in the lobby  Normally enough  but during the Olympics  you really had to wait your turn  sometimes for more than    minutes Overall  Apart from the location  we didn t like very much about this hotel  True  it s not expensive  but be sure to ask for a renovated room  The price is the same and you get more value for money A better option is the otel Peace  about   minutes away  A little bit more expensive  but a better deal 
P => Good value if you spend little time in the hotel We spent three nights at the hotel  It was a good value for the money  The room was large and clean  The breakfast buffet was really good  There are computers in the lobby that are available for guests to use  The business center was great and the staff helpful  All of the hotel staff were very polite and helpful The location was good  The only negative was the bed  We spent the first three nights of our honeymoon at this hotel  When we sat down on the bed it actually felt like were were sitting on a boxspring and not a mattress  My husband actually pulled the sheets off the bed in order to check and see if there was a matress there   After flying to China from the US for    hours the stiff bed was nice on our sore backs  but by the last night we were there we could hardly wait to leave  We spent all day and night out of the room touring and exploring Beijing and the hotel location was great  If we weren t exhausted from touring all day long  I can t imagine we would have been able to sleep on this bed  We chose the hotel for the location and not luxury and that is exactly what we got  It is like staying at a really nice riott Courtyard  
P => Not for Business Travellers   Have Fun with iTouriiest hold Party in Corridors The  st disappoint otel I stay ever Noisy corridor  non sound proof window  dimmy room  low ceiling   well you will recieve calls in     am from Front Desk helping you to fix your room TV     at that time you already in the bed     the Front Desk mis called your room Chaning your room     no way  The Front Desk staff will tell you no other rooms avaliable in a second     very fast service because they do want to check for you Enjoy     if you want to join the Tourist Party in corridors with House Keepers and Bell Boys    well     have fun with them in Mid NightSorry     this is not the type of otel I expecting  
P => Great Location and above average budget accomm Great location with access to Tiananmen Sq  Temple of Heaven  near to Tourist centre for bus to the Wall  nice bakeries nearby and restaurants  Good sized  clean room  gym and inhouse restaurant  Underground station right outside which takes you to most of the tourist attractions Airport bus will drop you off around the corner with a   mins walk to the hotel  
P => Stylish hotel great value for money Location  Good  Ample shopping and restaurants in surrounding area  If you are prepared to walk  you reach Tiannemen Square and The Forbidden City in about    mins  You will need a taxi to The Temple of Heaven though  Room  Excellent  Large  clean  lots of storage and comfortable beds  Spotless on suite  fab power shower and better than average selection of complimentary toiletries  All fittings were of a high standard  e g huge flat screen TV  The air con was invaluable and did a good job cooling us down after the rediculously hot days Hotel  Excellent  Contemporary clean lines and modern furnishings throughout  large reception and lounge areas  internet  leafy plants etc  The fitness centre  sauna  beauty salon and shop were well equipped and we always had good service Food drink  Good  A huge buffet style breakfast offering everything you will need to set you up for the day    good restaurants    coffee shop and a gallery bar  The stylish gallery area was a top place to relax as it had a live jazz pianist and doubled as an art gallery  It s also overlooked by several floors so has a light and airy atmosphere  We loved it and spent many evenings sipping the many cocktails available Overall  Excellent hotel offering great value for money  Staff spoke good English  were friendly and helpful  Stylish base for exploring the area  
P => Quite a decent choice Travelling alone and stayed   nights  Booked on their website on their cheapest no frills rate and paid    sterling pounds for the   nights  king sized bed before taxes   which was a further    pounds   Breakfast is extra at around   pounds  but there s a bakery right next door that sells buns at an average of   p  so no contest Location  excellent for me  as I caught the bus from the airport  charges      pounds or RMB     which stopped about   mins walk from the hotel  the bus drives pass the hotel  Within a    min walking radius  you have the chongwenmen metro station  which takes you straight to the start of the tian an men square  There s also a shopping mall nearby called new world with starbucks  a noodle restaurant  etc  you can also walk to the beijing train station in aout    minutes  or take the metro which is one stop away from the train station  Metro ticket is RMB   roughly   p  for a single journey  they don t have a daytravel weektravel system You could also walk for about    minutes to the wangfujin pedestrian and shopping area  the walk isn t very exciting with some tired shops and residential compounds Room  on the  th floor  Comfortably large for the furniture in it  Clean sheets and clean bathroom  small gripe on them giving me a smoking room  but the stink dissipated with an open window  there s a TV  minibar  though I couldn t get the TV to work   Hotel supplies the usual towels  slippers  shower stuff  And also toothbrushes  detergent   Internet is available and charges are RMB  per minute  But I suggest you pop down to the lobby with your own laptop where there s free wi fi Value for money  great  since I went with their economy rate Reception Concierge  Reception refused to allow a late check out  The hairdryer was missing when I checked in and never replaced  so I had to convince them not to charge me for  quot taking quot  it  Bags can be held and you are given a tag for identifying it  Concierge is not knowledgable about the sights etc  but are helpful enough if you go with a specific question  eg  where is XXX road on this map Restaurant  I had a glass of wine and a bowl of noodles there when I got back late one night  The wine was exorbitant at   pounds for what you get  but this seems typical of China  The noodles weren t tasty  but it was hot which was what I needed  Price was around      pounds    compared to half the price in an outside joint   So overall  I would guess that this could be considered reasonable for hotel prices  
P => very nice hotel We stayed on the   th  non smoking  floor  Our room was clean and nicely furnished and trimmed  It included several amenities  a complimentary breakfast buffet  bathrobes  amp  slippers  flatscreen tv  beds turned down at night  and a helpful and friendly concierge There were a few annoying quirks  The touchpad controls for the lights are very modern  but a pain in the rear when you re looking for the bathroom light switch in the dark  The room was so warm we had to open the window the first night even though we had the heat turned off  it was below freezing outside   And the shower cycled frequently between too hot and too cool  But keeping things in perspective  it was a great room in a very nice hotel and a good value The location of the hotel is also a plus  In a taxi  it s a    RMB toll  about a        to first rate shopping  the forbidden city  etc  If the weather is nice you could walk  but it s a few blocks  If you walk out the front door and turn left there s a nice little bakery there  
P => ent with good quality price ratio but noisy The hotel is in a good location  the rooms  at least the low priced one i got  are really small although you can survive for a week if you just sleep in there The window in my room was loose and the first two nights it was not properly warm  I tried to put the room temperature regulation on  but the fan was really noisy  so i opted for an extra blanket  My room was facing the rear street and it was rather noisy early in the mornings On the average  i would suggest this place  at least for the cheap rooms  to the budget conscious traveler  
P => good value hotel When I booked this hotel i read reviews saying that it wasn t very good  so I was a little apprenhensive  This was an excellent value for money hotel  I can t belive how little it was for   nights  The location was fantastic  with Tiannemen Square and The Forbidden City nearly on your door step  The Temple of Heaven is a short taxi journey away that only cost     Breakfast is charged at an additional cost  but there is a good bakery on the corner of the hotel  In Beijing getting food is not a problem  unless you are a vegetarian like myself where it is a nightmare  The hotel had good facilites and even has a travel desk where you can book tours to Xian and the Great Wall of China  Sometimes you want to stay in hotels that are a bit more cultural and local  but with the price and location of this one it is a hidden bargain  
P => ent base for exploring Beijing Stayed for a week at this hotel and there were no problems at all  Had a regular room in building B   decent size  beds were comfy  nice soft towels and the shower worked very well  that s all I expected for the price and was happy with it  The only disappointment was that we were in an inside room with the windows looking out on the restaurant so no natural light in the room  but got used to that Didn t really use any of the hotel s services as only wanted somewhere comfy to sleep at night  Used the tour desk to book a trip to Xi an for the day and that was fine though Checked in and out at  am due to flights so took less than   mins each time  but did notice queues during the day The main plus point of the hotel is that it is located in front of the Chongwenmen subway station which meant you could get to Tiananmen Square for just   yuan  
P => Not great Good location  only   minutes walk from subway station  for this hotel which is part of French chain  Also near some major shopping centres  My room  economy  had seen better days  slightly depressing decor  During my stay  the service offered by the front desk was a tedious combination of French lack of organization and Chinese bureaucracy  Checking out took    minutes  There were several long  extremely slow queues  Many angry customers complaining  I have been travelling weekly for business in Asia for five years  and never experienced such a service fiasco in any other hotel  As a result I was late to the airport and missed my flight  Most staff unsmiling and cold  Hotel has a good souvenir and snack shop  No swimming pool  
P => satisfactory stay This hotel was selected by the hospital where my husband was giving a lecture  Overall  good location and pleasant staff  The room and bathroom were clean  we were in the A building   The bed was very hard   like sleeping on the sidewalk  The  th floor breakfast buffet had many choices  We didn t have any problems while we were there  
P => Better think twice before staying here Location is pretty bad with it being along a busy road  It would take you a while to be accommodated at the reception as I think they are undermanned  Small bathrooms  Only consolation is that the housekeeping staff members are courteous  
P => A pretty good hotel We booked a tour through Indochina tours and this is where they booked us This hotel is a    minute walk to Tianamen Square  It is also close to a mall and a few bakeries  We love Chinese bakeries  There is a real nice one across the street This hotel is quite clean  There was staff constantly cleaning all around the hotel  However  they could use a few more staff for the front desk  It took us over an hour to check in  It was ridiculous  If you wanted something  like an iron or a wake up call  it was a three day request  You had to call everyday and they would promise  but nothing would happen The room is quite large  There is CNN on the TV The breakfast buffet at this hotel was okay  nothing great  However  there was lots of choice I would recommend this hotel  However  barely any one that works here speaks english  
P => Great value The hotel is well located     minutes walking to Tianamen The staff is not so great  they focuses exclusively on the services they have  so if you need someone to check if there are tickets in a theatre they don t work with  you will not find help  Neither give you informations on how to discover Beijing on your own The food in the coffee shop is terrible  and most services close at   h Nevertheless  you will find confort in the rooms  they are clean and beautiful  It s a good place to relax after you go crasy  positively of course  with the city  Be carefull with the tours  they all include taking you to shops they like    I hate that Anyway  It s a very good choice  Good price compared to other hotels with the same level in Beijing I would tay here again  
P => Great location for the price The hotel was in a great location  walking distance to shopping  the Forbidden City  Temple of Heaven for the hardy souls  My only complaint was my bathroom was a little tired but I spent more time seeing Beijing than hanging out in the bathroom  Give yourself plenty of time to get to an international flight  I thought if I left three hours before my flight it would be fine  In a great taxi with a driver who only spoke Chinese  we managed to hit every traffic jam possible  and we communicated in sign language that he was headed to the  th ring to avoid all of it   then I met the unexpected customs line and snuck in the wrong entrance with a Lebanese soccer team  found an understaffed airline counter at United  and then the health inspection  that didn t really exist   immigration  and security  Talk about high blood pressure  and then the flight ended up being delayed because of some dead batteries     apparently they had failed quite dramatically on the flight to China  I m glad I wasn t on that flight  But the hotel was fine  the hearty yet somewhat expensive breakfast seemed worth it to tie me over for most of the day  and the staff was very responsive  
P => Would recommend We just stayed at this hotel for   nights after booking it online  After reading some bad reviews I was a bit unsure of what to expect  I had booked a King Economy room  We ended up with a room at the back of the hotel that was fine  You could hear the odd car outside and it did smell like a dirty ashtray  but the room was clean  air conditioned and perfect for what we wanted  I would recommend that people ask for rooms at the back and some of the ones around the cafe would be rather noisy  Checking in and out can be a major hassle  it took the people in front of us    minutes  as everything is hand written and doubled up  This hotel is in a great location  only a    minute walk to two major shopping areas  is right next door to a really good bakery and has a railway station out the front  Staff were mostly very friendly and helpful  We tried to book a cab through one of the concierge to go to the great wall and ming tombs and he said normal cabs could not be trusted and his  quot friend quot  could do it for    RMB  we went back the next day and another concierge booked us a black taxi for    RMB which we were happy with  so just be careful  The same concierge also booked us to see the acrobatic show  which was excellent  and he said to see the stage we would need to sit in the more expensive middle section  however when we got there  the view from every section was fine  We ate at the hotel for breakfast one morning that cost us    RMB  the next day we went to the bakery and got   different things for   RMB  
P => Disappointed in Beijing    Just checked into the otel Xin Qiao  Beijing   I booked online a few weeks ago through the expedia  asia website I have been traveling for about a week now and trying to keep costs down so I have been booking cheap  unheard of hotels with good results  So now that I have come to the end of my holiday  I wanted to book a nicer hotel to spoil myself  I booked a room which was    Yuan  I ended up with a room that smelled like a filthy dirty ashtray with windows that were half boarded up   and theres a note on the desk apologizing for the construction that will start at      M F and      on weekends Also  this hotel charges a     service fee for EVERY service  even the restaurants   So if you book here  please factor that into your calculations   After all my research of hotels  I know I could ve booked a better one than this  The only thing I do like about it  is that it is right next to a metro station  But I am sure many hotels have that feature as well I hope this helps   Good luck  amp  safe travels  
P => Very pleased I read the reviews on this hotel before I travelled and to be honest I wasn t sure what to expect  I have to say I was pleasently surprised  My room was clean and spacious  I found all the hotel staff helpful  with passable English  The hotel s doormen were great in securing me a taxi and informing the driver where I wanted to go  I ate in the  coffee shop  restaurant once  and whilst it was overpriced the food was ok  The prices of the beer and cola in my room s minibar were surprisingly affordable compared to bars and restaurants  The location was fantastic  with a subway station just outside  Over the road was a very large shopping mall with food court  supermarket  very handy  and American fast food outlets  McDonalds  Pizzahut etc   Walking distance to Tian men Square and the main shopping district  It was perfect for my stay and an excellant base to explore Beijing  
P => Keep looking  The otel Xin Qiao is in an excellent location right outside a metro station in Beijing  Transport to and from the property is easy  We stayed for   nights and had many disappointments during our stay  We stayed in an economy room  and maybe we got what we paid for  but the bed was really old and uncomfortable  the fittings and fixtures in the room were needing replacement  the bathroom looked dirty as it was so old  air conditioning didn t work  I requested a room change after the first night as we were right opposite the lifts and it was noisy  Room change was granted  although the alternative wasn t much better  The staff in the restaurant have no English at all  so it was very difficult to communicate our needs even though we have lived in China for a few months and have basic communication skills  Wi Fi internet initially didn t work  and after being passed from one staff member to another  the manager finally helped us  My main gripe was the piano being so out of tune in the lobby it was unbearable  but I am a muso      Well below the standard you would expect from a otel in Asia  
P => Great Location Great Price  My family and I  myself  my wife and our two children ages   and    had a wonderful stay at the hotel based primarily on the great location and favbulous price Since it was our first time to Beijing we didn t apprciate how proximity to the sights plays a significant part of enjoying and mazimizing your holiday  Firstly we were a ten minute walk to Tianamen Square and the Forbidden City  Great bakery just next to the hotel  A couple blocks away was a large  modern shopping centre and supermarket  Also wonderful restaurants all around Secondly there is a wonderfully efficient subway right outside the doors of the hotel which we used extensively  Clean  efficient  and cheap  Traffic in Beijing is horendous at the best of times so this was the best way to get around          US for all of us per ride  The hotel itself was average but for the advertised web special of     US night it was wonderful  Basic but clean rooms  just request a room which doesn t overlook the lounge courtyard as it was noisy  No problem when we requested a change All in all average hotel  great location especially if you can get a great rate Adrian and Family from Vancouver 
P => Loved this hotel  We stayed in this hotel for   nights end of ober      and found it to be an excellent choice  especially for the money we paid too  I chose this hotel due to it s central proximity in Beijing  especially to Tiananmen Square  the Forbidden City and Temple of Heaven  all of which were      mins by taxi   This hotel also had an advantage in that it is only a few steps from the Chongwenmen subway station  There are several restaurants in the hotel  including Chinese  French and Japanese  which were expensive compared to prices on the street  but were average compared to Western prices  I was very satisified with the meals that I did eat here For breakfast I just grabbed a croissant from the bakery next door which cost next to nothing Our room was fine  however  no outside facing window  only inside facing  with a restaurant below  so you could hear some noise from this in the morning  fine for me as I wear earplugs anyway  The service in the hotel was very good  and unlike reviews I had read previously  I found the staff s English to be fine  and they provided maps for us and pointed places out if need be  If you needed a taxi you simply stood outside the front of the hotel  and one was beckoned for you by a porter from a hotel taxi line waiting nearby  You simply told the doorman which destination you needed and he would write it in Chinese for the driver  If I was to return to Beijing I would definitely stay here again  
P => Good value for the money The hotel was clean  had CNN  and very well located for the money  The subway is literally in front of the entrance  and we found that a quick and convenient way to get around town  the traffic in Beijing can be a nightmare    It was about a    minute walk to Tianamen square  It has a bright and cheerful lobby  though the room lacked any view whatsoever  and the bathroom could have used one more light  however  we are not picky and the room was clean and well appointed  and for the money  it was an excellent value  Just beware the gift shop   prices there were up to     s of times greater than outside  There is a good  chain  restuarant  Ajisen Ramen  a couple of blocks away which has english in their menus and pictures of each dish   we ate there a few times  Also  we didn t notice until the last day but there is a bakery adjacent to the hotel   I m sure the prices there too would be multiple times less than the hotel restaurant prices  we never ate at the hotel   
P => Mixed bag I have a mixed feelings about my stay in this hotel  We stayed in the hotel for   nights beginning of our China trip  and   nights on return at the end of our trip in            The location is good  right next to metro station     mins walk to Tiamemnen square     mins walk to Temple of Haven  and    mins walk to a good shopping area  Some rooms are pretty shabby  and some rooms bizarrely face the restaurant area of the hotel  so not very bright  Ask for a room which face the back of the hotel  not the side  Side rooms were noisy  next to a busy main road   The second room we stayed was not so clean  and a lot of things did not function properly  Like the TV set and the tap  The service was at best average  even in Chinese standards  Cleaning staff did hoovering of the corridor at           Breakfast was just ok  The front desk staff did not speak very good English  and they were not very willing to help either  But I guess overall  it is a good value for money  and I could recomment it to people who are not so fussed about the comfort and service but looking for a basic room in a good location  
P => Great Value in great Location This is a great hotel for the cost  The hotel is modern and fits the general otel style  The lobby is large and new looking  There are a variety of restaurants to choose from  although the Jazz bar is a bit lacking in atmosphere and Jazz  The rooms were a descent size and well appointed  The bathroom was large clean and the usual   star hotel standard  The bed was a little hard but nothing that couldn t be put up with The price was excellent at only   GBP night The location is was made me choose this hotel  Outside you have a small mini mart opposite   and a post office just along from the hotel on both sides of the road  tiannemen Square is only   mins walk away  whilst The Temple of Heaven is not much further and is justa straight walk along the road next to the hotel  Should you be too lazy to walk  a taxi will take you in about  mins and cost under  GBP A good hotel in an excellent siteseeing location  and well worth the money  and also gives you the reliability of a major hotel chain  
P => Great value for money I stayed in the hotel for almost   weeks with a friend sharing a twin room  I paid     a night  the room was     for both of us the hotel was clean  in a great location  and cheap  Beware of the hotel s shop  it is very expensive    
P => Close to many attractions We stayed at this hotel as part of a great priced tour through China Travel Agency  The lobby of the hotel promises great things  however this hotel has two standards  We were in the older area for rooms and restaurants  the rooms had threadbare carpet and were quite old  the beds were amongst the hardest I have ever slept on  but this seems to be standard for many Asian hotels  The rooms were clean and quiet  although some of our fellow travellers were given smoking rooms that they said were uninhabitable and one family with very young children were given rooms on seperate floors so the parents had to split up so each could sleep with one child for security and safety  Our tour was very well priced and so the value for money was great for the hotel  There is very good shopping nearby and you can get anywhere in Beijing by taxi for a reasonable price  The subway is just outside the hotel and is easy to use  Tianneman Square and the forbidden Palace are within walking distance  
P => For the price it is good  The hotel was fine for the price   we booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor Com  The room was very clean  hard hard mattress but we got used to it  The location is very good  shopping center and grocery store   blocks away  Tiananmen Square a    long blocks  walk from the hotel  subway connection in front of hotel   Tiananmen Square   subway stop away from hotel    restaurants in hotel but we only tried       was Chinese  where we had trouble with wait staff understanding English  and the second was the coffee shop  which we found very good  especially for breakfast  We found a good tour company to show us the sites with excellent English speaking guides  Beijing China Travel Service  contact Zhu Songdai  director of business travel dept  and request Jason  the tour guide  to show you the sights   they will also arrange airport arrivals and departures  
P => Good Hotel Good hotel  Clean and airy  We had a large modern bedroom with glass floor to ceiling windows  Excellent restaurants and bar area  Only problems were that the room was boiling hot  and the beds were very uncomfortable  I could feel every spring in my side  Breakfasts were average but the staff in the breakfast area were rude and unhelpful  
P => Pretty good The otel Xin Qiao is a good hotel  well equipped with a roomy bar and several decent restaurants  The room was fine but overlooked the bar and was consequently quite noisy until about   pm  The business centre is convenient but internet access is very expensive     yuan per minute  Staff were helpful and able to provide tours at short notice and packed lunch  Location is quite good  next to a subway station  
P => Nice location Excellent hotel for the price  We found this hotel online for     total with tax about      CYN   We were so happy to move to this hotel after being in Jade youth hostel for a couple of days  The rooms are pleasant and very clean  Bathroom is showing age but again   clean  We always had hot water with good water pressure  Rooms with windows over the lobby get a bit noisy in the morning  You can feel the springs in the matresses but we still slept very well  Room service was good with reasonable prices  Massage on the basement level also very nice  If you go left out of the hotel to the main road and turn right you can find several good restaurants within    min  walk or just hop on the metro directly in front of the hotel  Also there is a small grocery within   minutes walk if you go out of the hotel and turn left and left again  store is on the right side of the road  Reception was very busy and we always had to wait in line or call several times before getting someone to answer  Make sure to leave some extra time for check out  
P => Best location average hotel I live in China and have been to the otel Xin Qiao in   different moments  The hotel situation is probably one of the best in town  with a Metro Station at the door  ChongWenMen   walking distance to Tiannamen and the Forbidden City  and near a street full of restaurants  duck  japanese  fast food  etc   Besides  it is a couple of metro station away of Xidan  where the shuttle bus to the airport will leave pick you up  Train Station is also very near For the hotel itself  it is correct  average level  Clean  nice beds and linen  standard toilets  but not bad   Common areas are nice  and some of its restaurants  the Japanese  for example  are excellent  although a bit expensive for the price standard in China Prices are slightly higher than some other Chinese hotels near Tiannamen  but the difference can be assumed due to the great location  
P => A Reasonable Hotel We stayed at this hotel over the period          in an executive room  Positives   great restaurants and good gymnasium  Negatives  Staff were not always overly helpful and coould even be described as disinterested at times  The price is reasonable and we would recommend upgrading from the basic room as the Executive Floor is less crowded and offers a few other good things such as internet access and drinks in the bar at night  Overall  we got what we paid so no significant complaints Regarding the many tours which are available   be very careful which operator you choose  We unfortunately went on a very dodgy tour to the Great Wall  Try to use a recommended company if possible  
P => Good Value and Location This hotel is centrally located  The subway station is in front of the hotel  A taxis ride to Wangfujing Daijie and Tiantan Park costs about   RMB  There is a Peking duck restaurant called Bianyifang is    mins walk from the hotel  I had a King size bed with additional bed for my child at no additional cost  The service is very prompt too  The room we had was spacious and clean  I would recommend this hotel  
P => Would stay again I booked this hotel as part of a package through a UK travel agent  Was overall very pleased with the hotel   the room was of a high standard  on being on one of the top floors  had a great view of the main street below  In a good location  right next to a tube stop  Another bonus was english speaking TV channels  I ve found this a bit of a rareity in other parts of China   and UK plug sockets   On the downside I found the stuff to be quite unhelpful   English is definetly not their strong point and they made little effort to try and understand you and were of little help for anything important  Food in restaurant very good  especially the night time buffet  if a little on the expensive side   All in all  I would stay here again if in Beijing  but would bring along a translator    
P => Great location but average service Picked this hotel for the location and because we trusted otel s reputation  Although the location part was great  the service standard was not what we had expected from a otel  The Good  Subway station right outside hotel  which gets you on subway line    The only down side is major shopping areas  such as Xidan  Silk ket  Wanfujing   and major attractions  such as Forbidden city  Tienanmen Square  are on line    so changing lines are often needed  We stayed at a standard room in the back part of the hotel  it wasn t as nice as the new part  but was still clean  roomy  and comfortable  except for the really hard bed     bottles of water was provided free each day  The Average  Breakfast prices at the hotel were expensive for China  so try to get a deal where it s included in your room package  If not  there is a really clean and good quality bread shop across the road  so we ate there at breakfast time  The Bad  Service was below average  At check in  staff were slow  our paperwork changed hands whilst others behind us pushed in  One of the girls at the ticket desk was extremely rude  and unhelpful  Would often rather talk on her phone than answer questions  therefore was difficult to get help on domestic air tickets  so we booked our flights with China Travel next to the hotel   Most people at the Concierge desk were also uninterested and unhelpful  which meant getting directions to major attractions was difficult  so plan you trip well  know where you want to go  and just use them to confirm your destination  or to write the address down in Chinese for the taxi drivers  Overall  We would stay there again  but would not expect great service  
P => Great Hotel I was a tad dubious of this hotel after reading some of the reviews on this site but we found it a perfectly adequate hotel in a reasonable location  It was delightfully clean and the staff were very helpful and kind although English wasn t their strong point  We were allowed to check in at     am which was excellent and our room was large  clean and quiet  The coffee shop offered    hr service and the breakfast was outstanding with a range of dishes for every palate  Within an easy walk of Tianemen Square and the main shopping district  Plenty of taxis available and luggage storage facilites  The gift shop was incredibly expensive so avoid that Travellers Tip   Check out the Hutong Tours at the north end of Beihai Park 
P => otel Xin Qiao in Beijing   Great Value  We stayed at the otel Xin Qiao e              We had a room on the  quot Executive Floor quot  or  quot BIZ Floor quot  as they call it  I would definitely recommend getting a room on this floor as the room rate includes a wonderful breakfast each day  The hotel was very nice and very convenient to the subway  right outside the hotel entrance   The room was nicely appointed although the bed was hard as a rock  This was the case in all asian hotels where we stayed  so be prepared for a hard bed This hotel was a great value and I would highly recommend it FLTXKS aol comKansas City  USA 
P => loved the otel Xin Qiao My husband and I  travelling with another couple who also stayed here in another room  found this hotel to be wonderful  A great location  very helpful staff  and comfortable  clean rooms  We found the local market around the corner very useful for stocking up on reasonable  cheap wine and beer  
P => Reasonably priced hotel with good facilities but be aware of extra costs I stayed here for two nights at the end of a long journey flying around China and couldn t find a reasonably priced room at any of the hotels on Jianguomen Street so decided to book this hotel at the last minute  It turned out to be a pleasant surprise and better than what I expected  The price is quite affordable but not including breakfast       to     less than what other   star hotels on the main street would charge during the same time period   with several conventions meetings were taking place While the hotel shows its age  it is apparently popular among European tourists indicated by heavy presence of guests from UK  Germany and France in the lobby whenever I was in and out  The decor of the hotel rooms have lived up to the   star standard  all come with a European flair and are decorated with contemporary furnishing  My room is considered spacious for its class  standard  and equipped with modern amenities like mini bar  coffee tea station  sitting area  a clean bathroom and of course a nice big king size bed  Like other people pointed out in the forum  the hidden cost is a problem  The hotel website did not indicate tax information at the end of my booking  many hotels in Beijing do include tax in the listed price  so I was a bit surprised when I received the final bill   In addition  breakfast would cost extra    something RMB if I requested it  Fortunately there is a shopping area  Beijing New World Center  within   minute walking distance south and you can find a nice market and lots of cheap places for meals so I just decided to have breakfast there  The high speed internet connectivity is also very expensive   RMB per minute and     RMB max  for the day but included in the price if you book a much higher priced  quot executive business quot  room  Overall  this is a decent place and I wouldn t mind recommending it to people who are interested in staying there  
P => Don t expect too much  We stayed in the otel in        We found the rooms well sized with very clean facilities  amp  of a good standard  although the airconditioning wasn t very efficient The staff could benefit from better training as the ground floor cafe always appeared disorganised with long waits  especially at breakfast  The bar staff often found difficulty in preparing even the most basic drinks and certain staff throughout the hotel could be brusque and lacking in communication skills However  bearing in mind China is a relative novice in the hospitality trade  we found the overall stay enjoyable  
P => Nice Luxury Hotel in Beijing We    Adults and   Children  stayed at this hotel in e       We found it to be a very nice hotel with great rooms and a good restaurant The rooms are high end and very comfortable The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to the Forbiden City  The hotel has a good tour groups to the Great Wall and the staff are very helpful in helping you get around town and making travel plans  Additionally there is a ATM machine right next door and a CITS office     meters away There is a good buffet at the hotel which is not cheap by Chinese standards  but it is good food and music and is very convenient We would stay there again  
P => So sad    I ve just returned from a   nights in ust      We stayed on a B wing  standard room  for     RMB per night See photo reviews  I think doesn t need any comments   
P => One of the best hotel I ever stayed

P => Excellent Place to Stay This is an excellent place to stay if you need a clean and comfortable bed  nice and fully equipped kitchen and laundry machine  It is very spacious  Beware though  most taxi drivers cannot find the place as the hotel is located inside the street   The breakfast is really nothing just enough to fill your stomach  There were some unfriendly voices on the phone by some receptionists on my first day but I got excellent service on the rest of my stay  Everything were provided including water but there was no dishwasher soap to my surprise  The internet is extra     or     yuan a day and I would rather have free internet than free minimal breakfast  The restaurant food was also not good for my taste  But overall  this apartment hotel is excellent based on the room alone  
P => Highly Recommended My husband  daughter and I stayed in the Oakwood Residence for a month and a half while looking for a more permanent residence in Beijing  The rooms flats are large and comfortable  the location is terrific  and the services  breakfast  spa  gym  are all very good  Perhaps if you are staying for one week as a tourist you might want a fancier restaurant or elegant furnishings  But if you re staying for longer than a week  this is the place  It s very comfortable The highlight however has been the staff  The customer service has been exceptional  All staff are very friendly and helpful  And if you are not a Chinese speaker having the assistance of a capable team can make all the difference I would recommend the Oakwood to anyone planning a long term stay in Beijing  and I would absolutely stay here again  
P => Clean Comfortable and Value For Money We booked   x one bedroom apartments at Oakwood Residence  Apartments consisted of fully equipped kitchen  brand new appliances  utensils never used  spotless  arate living and bedroom  large bathroom and separate laundry with additional toilet This place is great value for money  the bed and pillows has to be  one of  the most comfortable I have ever slept in  Staff are very professional and friendly  Having stayed in apartment hotels before I have often found that breakfast can be a disappointment  no such thing at Oakwood  breakfast and the surroundings are on a par with any   Star hotel  Location is acceptable  being on the  rd ring road  gives easy access to most places in town  You can walk to Sanlitun shopping and bar street       min  Location is hit and miss in Beijing  you are going to end up stuck in traffic wherever you stay I highly recommend Oakwood Residence  why stay in a   m  standard hotel room when you can enjoy the comfort of a    m      apartment Great place to stay and fantastic value for money  Be aware currently  there is a construction site next door  This is standard for China  wherever you go these days construction sites are difficult to avoid  but it caused us no bother at all  
P => Thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Oakwood Residence Beijing There are two Oakwood properties  as of today  in Bejing  and we decided to go with the Oakwood Residence Beijing based on a friend s recommendation  We were very pleased with the property  We stayed at the   bedroom Executive apartment  which was almost     square meters  large and roomy  with   ensuite bathrooms  This was perfect as my husband and I were traveling with my parents and we needed space  The bathrooms have shampoo  conditioner  body lotion  toothbrush  shaver  hair dryer  etc  But there is no vanity set so you should bring buy your own cotten swabs  There is a large living room with a flatscreen TV and DVD player  and the kitchen was fully loaded with all the appliances  utensils  pots   pans  what have you  There is also a laundry room with a washer dryer  in one   which was very convenient since we did have laundry after a couple of days  There is also an iron   board  And very important  free WIFI in your apartment The property is located on the Eastern  rd ring of the city  which means it s quite centrally located  next to the modern shopping malls and restaurants   bars  It is also about    minutes away from the airport  taxi ride should cost about    RMB or   euros   However  it is not within walking distance to any landmarks  shops or restaurants  As Beijing is insanely big and sprawling  though you can walk to the subway  about   minutes by foot   we chose to take the taxi all the time  and it was not a problem whatsoever to get one from the hotel  Most trips cost about    RMB  about      euros   A trip to the absolute center of Beijing  i e  Tiannman Square will cost you about       RMB  Though most taxi drivers seemed clueless where the building was  so if you can t speak Chinese  make sure you get directions written down by the concierge We absolutely loved the swimming pool and gym at the basement level of the building  and we took full advantage of the spa  Chinese massage  facilities connected to the building  The spa is called  quot Taipan quot   and if you tell them you re guests at the Oakwood  you will receive a     discount Breakfast buffet is so so  but you can order eggs and grilled salmon a la carte for free  The staff got a bit overwhelmed when a lot of people showed up for breakfast at once  but overall it was fine  We would definitely return to this property  
P => Comfortable Stay  I was working in Beijing for two months and stayed in these apartments from the end  to the end of y  I had a one bedroom apartment and it was spotless  It had a full kitchen  washer dryer  nice sitting area with a large flat screen tv  and king size bed and another flat screen tv in the bedroom  Plenty of closet space  Maid service cleaned twice a week  The price was very reasonable  compared to a hotel  The apartment complex is in close proximity to some major attractions  It also offered a continental breakfast  There is also an assortment of restaurants and shops within the complex  
P => Great surroundings with first class service I live in Beijing  but when my father visited  my husband and I decided to have a holiday too and we all booked into a   bedroom apartment at the Oakwood  I ve stayed in other serviced apartments in Beijing  like Lee Gardens and East Gate Plaza  but the service  furnishings and d cor at the Oakwood was far better than any other serviced apartment that I have stayed in  Usually  as the only Chinese speaker in my group  I have to cope with all the dealings with front desk  etc    but the standard of English at the Oakwood is very good and I could relax for a change  The apartment was wonderful   spacious  spotlessly clean and the kitchen was far far better equipped than my own at home  Usually in serviced apartments it s a drag to get them to provide everything needed  but the Oakwood even had nice wine glasses  Despite having our own apartment only    minutes away  we didn t need to go home to get anything   the Oakwood had it all  
P => Excellent stay I stayed at the hotel   nights with a twin deluxe  The employees were helpful and always pleasant  The location is very close to the subway and a WU mart  south of the subway station   like a mini walmart  for shopping  It s about a       minute walk to the birds nest  I walked there and took the subway back  Official Cabs are cheap  so it s a good choice if you have a lot of bags to the airport instead of the subway  only use official cabs to and from the airport  its easy to tell which ones are official and which ones are not  If someone at the airport asks if you need a taxi say no  Then go to the official taxi stand at the airport  It cost me about       Yuan for   people from the hotel to the airport  The subway is easy and excellent to use and the best way to get around  without alot of luggage   The bakery near the Wu mart is also excellent  I was pretty concerned with getting food poisoning and had no issues with the bakery and WUmart for food  The rooms were very clean with a big stand up shower  Every night the staff brought oranges to your hotel room  It was a great stay and I would go again  
P => Excellent Great location close to subway and within walking distance of the Olympic stadium although it is a longish walk  Very clean  modern with little snacks supplied to each room in the evening  Each room came with a pet goldfish  Stayed there a few times and would definately use it again  Its a real bargain  Restaurant next door is pretty good too  
P => Highly Recomended   Good Value and good rooms Traveled to Beijing in        Stayed in Orange hotels for   nights  the room is clean but relatively small  But it is not an issue   st night i felt that the pillow has some smell  have requested to change it  after that is fine   mins walking distance to MRT station  There is one Nine head eagle       restaurants beside this hotel  it served delicious food  with hotel card can get     discount  I recommend it to those who stay at orange to try it  
P => Wow  Excellent Price and What a Bargain We intially had stayed at the Orange Hotel in Hangzhou and was impressed with the price  cleanliness and service at this hotel  The hotel in Hangzhou was new so it is very clean We tried the same Orange hotel in Beijing near the Water Cube  The price cannot be beat      US for regular room or     for a larger Deluxe room  This is a bargain considering the other hotels we were at before  The service people are excellent  We wanted noodles and they walked us to the restaurant nearby  They do not speak English very well so you are on your own with any lengthy or customize requests  I used Google translate and show them the chinese display for customize requests  They will get you taxi  write places in Chinese for the taxi for you to go to The room is large  Larger then the Comfort Inn in the US  Clean  but not ultra clean  Similar to Comfort Inn  The bed is hard by my standard so be aware of hard matress  They do not provide breakfast  but drop off pastries and milk cartons at night for breakfast  There is wired and wireless Internet in each room  There is not a supermarket nearby  but they sell waters  juice  etc at the front desk  We walk half to     of a mile to Wu t  similar to Walmart  for juice  fresh milk  yogurt  chips  water  cookies  crackers  etc  Wu mart has a second floor that sells electronics and pretty much anything you need for a house hold  Our kids like Pizza so a Pizza Hut is a    minutes walk or    RMB with a Taxi  To go to Pearl market on taxi  the cost    RMB  To go to Silk market  the price is    RMB  There is some traffic during lunch and also between     pm pending the direction that you are going to with the taxi  
P => Paralympics   Orange Hotel We stayed in the hotel during Paralympics and it was excellent for that since it is very close to the stadiums  cca    km  It is also very close to the metro and bus station  cca     meters   but taxi is very cheap and if you have address in Chinese it is very good option  From the hotel to downtown you will need approximately   min which will cost around    RMB The hotel is new and very clean  but the receptionists did not speak English so we had problems communicating with them Hotel does not offer breakfast  but every night we were getting some bakery products  milk  and tea  free of charge  If you want to drink some good coffee you can find it in hotel Tibet     m  We paid    Euro for   people in deluxe room and I believe it is excellent value If I was going to Beijing again I would stay in this hotel since the ratio of price and service are very good  
P => Great hotel in great position Stayed here for   nights  Hotel  large business type but very good  Rooms spacious   clean and comfortable  Hotel has a geat indoor pool and fitness centre  Breakfast very good The really good thing is the easy and fun walk in the evening  Walk towards the Bell tower  right on the main road infront of the hotel and then left at the traffic lights  On a gentle stroll down this road will pass all sorts of eating places and life  At the end of that street on the right are   excellent restaurants  a Vietnamese and a Chinese  Go round the corner and you come to an allyway on your right which takes you into the Hutong area by the lake which is brillaint for night life  bars and restaurants  Strongly recommend hotel and area 
P => Oriental Bay Hotel Beijing China We travelled with one other couple from Shanghai to Beijing on y   th and stayed at the Oriental Bay International Hotel for five days  We were impressed with our rooms and the magnificent lobby  Staff were courteous and polite  There is a canal in front of the hotel and the metro or subway is a short walk along the canal under a busy intersection and back up onto the main street  The rear of the hotel leads out into a street with small stores where you can purchase basic packaged food staples  A few small restaurants are also on this street  There is a local Internet Cafe close to the hotel and can be located by walking to the street at the rear of the hotel  turn left until the end of the street and then turn left again  the internet cafe is the last building on this street  We enjoyed the Western buffet breakfast at the hotel in the morning complete with egg omelette  pancakes  bacon  toast and an assortment of Chinese food  
P => An imitation of an international hotel It looks good as you approach it  even though the area is quite drab  The lobby  too  has cosmopolitan aspirations  Unfortunately  the architect s vision does not trickle down to staff level  There are plenty of them  but they don t all seem to know why they are there  The concept of service seems a bit alien to them  Basic items   napkin  spoon  salt   are often missing from the breakfast tables  Waiters go around topping up people s coffee cups but you have to find your own coffee to start with  The luxurious  French style restaurant on the top floor should be avoided unless you want to play a practical joke on someone  The food looks like haute cuisine but tastes like nothing on earth  They also serve a red liquid called house wine which has the aroma of grease on hot metal The rooms are OK and there is a special small bore pipe in the bathroom for drinking water  The laundry service is good  
P => Excellent   Star I was traveling with a group of     This hotel was awesome  Very clean  staff extremely personable and very willing to assist  Most spoke English  Restaurant at hotel is open    hours and the food is good at   in the morning  The breakfast buffet is A   A variety of foods both Asian and Western  The rooms are very large  comfortable and roomy  
P => Modern friendly would stay again  I just came back from about a week s stay at the hotel  Breakfast was included daily  and included choices from all over the world  American style bacon  eggs  pastries  not fresh daily   Also they had Asian types of food such as soups  rice  vegetables  It sits right on the city moat at the  nd ring road  Close to Temple of Heaven and Ya Show for shopping  Behind the hotel is a small       amp  Korean restaurant accross the street from there  Rooms at the hotel were very roomy  spacious  modern  GLass shower  deep tub  marble  Large closet  safe  Free bottled water  but no refrigerator   or ours wasn t working anyway    chairs  a desk  lots of storage space for all your things  Friendly staff  concierge  ront desk could use more help  Not a lot of staff speak english  but they were always willing to get you someone that could assist  Business center had internet for small fee  I would recommend for Olympics  Taxi cabs were readily available and cheap  Also close enough for Olympics   Bird s Nest  amp  Water Cube less than       mins away  
P => Great hotel close to Olympic Stadiums This hotel was wonderful  The rooms were very clean and comfortable  They give free internet access  which is a plus  The rooms had very nice decor  warm and inviting  I would definitely stay here again  
P => smart hotel shame about the smelly toilets An excellent   star Hotel clean  good staff  english understood and the food excellent Only complaint was that at certain times of the day the bathroom smelt of sewage this is common in the new buildings in china and you have to run the taps and flush toilet to get rid of it  The staff in the end moved us to another room which was no problem The air conditioning would only blow hot air which meant the windows were left open at night  another problem in china Pool and gym very good but no private changing facilityssmall problems but all solved 
P => A great place to stay Oriental Bay is a lovely hotel the rooms are very spacious and front desk staff very helpful  There is a wonderful buffet breakfast both Chinese and Western tastes are catered for   quot Le ceil  quot restaurant on the   th floor was worth a visit and as you can guess had amazing views and can provide buffet and a la carte selections Leisure facilities were very good the pool was a little on chilly side and the sauna was self service needed tobe switched on perhaps this was an energy saving drive   My daughter and I would recommend the in house massage service for those feeling the effects of jet lag There is a small kiosk selling postcards stamps confectionery alongside a tailors and tourist shop Plenty of lifts to all floorsThis was the first experience of Beijing hotels at the start of our tour with Oriental travel Deserving of   star status 
P => Fantastic start to our holiday We arrived very early in the morning after two flights from London and seeing the Orientalbay Hotel was a very welcome sight We required two rooms for our family of five  The rooms were nicely set out and in our room we had a double bed plus a single bed but the room still wasn t crowded The staff were all very helpful and couldn t do enough for you The resturants in the hotel were all lovely and the food was of a very high standard The children enjoyed the swimming pool in the hotel  though I found it a little cold  We had a evening coat made at the hotel tailors which was excellent value for money and made to a very high standard We had a fantastic view over the city  Our tour operator was Oriental Travel and they had planned an excellent holiday  
P => the people OrientalBay International HotelBeijing  China  AsiaDate   ruari      for two weeks I have to say it looks good on the outside and nice and clean on the inside  The level off service is good no problem  Dont drink the water from the tab is spiced whit chlorine  They give you   bottels off table water every day for free and some noodels of cource  The people in the breakfastroom are very nice after one or two times the know you and give you a nice place to sit  There is for everybody to like chinese or western even for the moslims  halal  food is there  The AC  Airco  is better to turned off to keep it cool in youre roomget one on the southside      or soon it the coolessed place there They have a sauna health center and swimmingpool  restaurants are ther too and a converence center internet acces Youre close to the city centre and Lama temple  you have to go there  Soon ill will go back and probaly stay there agian the trouble off the AC system is on every hotel there so this does not mather anyway  
P => 			  
P => Great find  I stayed at the Oriental Culture Hotel in Beijing for a week in y     I had expected an average     star hotel in a crappy location  BUT what I found was a great   star business hotel in great part of town and close to transport and downtown Service was good  considering that China is not yet Thailand when it comes to service  and I was upgraded to a Deluxe Room facing the street  The room exceeded expectation  Modern furnishings  huge King size bed with luxury linen  Plasma TV  fast internet  free   CNN  HBO and even a turn down service  The bathroom had a walk in shower with waterfall shower head plus normal power adjustable head  Fresh towels and toiletries daily  Bathrobes and even a turn down service where they gave me a choc and the next day s weather The staff were helpful and most spoke decent Engish  They were helpful re cabs but abit clueless re tours  The lobby is big and well lit Only gripe was that my fridge didn t work  That said  I didn t complain so I didn t give them a chance to fix it This hotel is a great find and I ll definately stay there again   
P => The best hotel I have ever seen  I was positively surprised when I opened the door of our room  modern furniture  huge flat screen TV  very spacious  air conditioning  complimentary Internet connection  wired  lovely stone floored shower  super modern bath room and generally very very clean  The breakfast is good  very Chinese though  staff do not speak English fluently but are very nice and will do everything they can The location is also great very close to Lama Temple  For the rest of sightseeing places I cannot say much since we were transferred with our guide Don t forget your cap or they don t let you in the swimming pool  
P => Good Comfortable Hotel In Beijing We stayed at this hotel last week  We were with a tour group  We had a problem with our room but this was quickly sorted out by our tour guide  The room was very clean and comfortable If you change money in the hotel  you need your passport even for cash  If you use an ATM make sure it is at a Bank of China as some of our tour had problems at other banks If you go out of the hotel and turn right and walk about     yards you will find a big supermarket selling everything you could want  It is worth a visit just to see what is on sale on the meat and fish counters There are plenty of restaurants around  although several in our party at at the hotel and found the buffet excellent and very reasonably priced  The breakfast buffet was very good with plenty of variety TravellingPensioners 
P => Enjoyed our stay My husband  son and I stayed in Beijing Oriental Culture hotel for   nights in y       and enjoyed our experience  We booked a suite and requested an extra bed in the living room for my son  all with very reasonable price  The suite was spacious and well furnished and decorated  The location was ideal for us  as the hotel is in a fairly quiet area of the city  but still centrally located and only   minutes walk away from a subway station  There are many restaurants within walking distance of the hotel  and there is a supermarket only a few minutes away  very convenient  The internet service was good  we also booked a domestic flight through the business service of the hotel to our satisfaction  We will definitely book this hotel again  
P => Loved the Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel We visited Beijing  China from ember          to uary          We really had a great time in Beijing especially so that we picked the right hotel  Before booking our hotel with the travel agent  we made sure that the hotel we are about to stay is clean and comfortable  We tried looking up the hotels in the internet and found out that there were a lot of horror stories of the lower ranked hotels  We found the reviews in this site very helpful  So we decided to book our  day  night stay at the Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel We were very impressed when we got to the hotel during our first night  After a very cold first day tour of Beijing  we found the hotel to be nice  clean and comfortable  The front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating  Our rooms were ready and immaculately cleaned  The breakfast buffet was also good  It had a choice of eastern and western food  The staff at the Oriental Cafe were pleasant and very courteous  We really had a great time during breakfast as the cafe manager made us feel at home and well taken cared of The location is also good  It had small food shops and stores nearby  There s a supermarket and a Mc Donald s outlet just two minutes away  A subway station is also nearby  We were able to take the subway to various parts of Beijing  The hotel is really accessible We were very happy about the service and the rates  We thought that we could not have this kind of accommodation since we were not booked in a   star hotel  The Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel is indeed a hidden treasure  We did not want any terrible hotel stories to be part of our Beijing tour  We found none We hope that the service of the hotel would even get better  Prehaps they should have a non smoking floor  
P => Reasonable Booked as part of a China Tour www tourchina co ukHotel seemed fine and comfortable although beds were very hard It seems all the     star hotels on our trip were very similar in all that the hotel and rooms offered but were pretty much business type hotels you could find in any city in the world Most hotels and this included will only provide   small bottles of drinking water and will charge you for extra   my advice is to go out of hotel and turn right and there are   big supermarkets to buy water a lot cheaper One tip is that in all the hotels we stayed in the alcohol was very expensive in the bars         mls beer       yuen           outside in restaurants or supermarket      yuen and    yuen respectively  Well in this hotel we found a cheaper way   the restaurant on the ground floor next to the lifts sells    mls local beer for    yuen   the staff seem more than happy for you not to eat and just have a drink   but you can t take out the beer into the general hotel area Otherwise hotel is in a good area with good local restaurants   advice is to choose bigger establishments which are full of local people   they won t speak english so be prepared to point to what you want on other people s tables   don t feel embarrasses as they will be watching you too  
P => A hidden gem    grab it  My friend and I found this place pretty much by accident when looking for a replacement for the City Hotel Beijing  about which  the less said the better  And what a happy accident it was  This is basically a five star hotel at a three to four star price  The rooms are gorgeously furnished  with couches  desks  televisions in both the lounge room and bedroom  and pristeen bathrooms  Our rooms were done in different styles  one more modern  one more classic in feel   but both were absolutely top class  and were superior even to the more expensive rooms we had in the five star Beijing Asia Hotel    hour room service is available at reasonable prices  and the quality of food is fairly good  try the chocolate cake    The morning breakfast buffet offers a wide range of Chinese and Europoean American options  with staff on hand to cook eggs and omelettes to your liking The gym and pool facilities exceed those of many five star hotels in Beijing  although the dumbells at the gym only go up to    kg  which may not be enough for some   The service is courteous and helpful  and comparable to any similar hotel in Beijing  though of course not as polite as you would find in  say  Japan  The location is good as there is a well known restaurant street nearby  although as with just about anywhere in Beijing  where the city blocks are enormous   you will need a taxi or the subway to go pretty much anywhere  However  transport prices are so cheap that this isn t a problem My only quibbles were that one of our rooms took far too long  around     hours  to prepare after we checked in  and the rooms do not include ironing boards and irons  which you have to borrow from reception instead  Overall though  the Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel was a fantastic experience and I will be heading straight back there when I next visit Beijing  I should add    what unfortunately does not go without saying in mainland China    that we experienced absolutely no shenanigans from the hotel staff or management  This place seems to represent the better side of Chinese culture  
P => Had a great stay at the Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel Had a fantastic time at this hotel  Had only good service at check in  could have been better   I think foreigners actually get better service than patrons of asian appearence The room was very comfortable  room was made up each day and covers turned down each evening with a chocolate placed on the pillow in an envelope with the next days forcast temperature What makes this hotel good  it the location  Close to the Lama Temple and Confucius Temple and new subway station is only a few blocks away Local to a wonderful street full of fantastic restaurants made it easy to find food at any time of night  The lights were so so pretty and great for photo ops  
P => Loved it Hi  i stayed at the Oriental Culture Hotel when i went on a school trip with my school band in      representing the uk in the international music festival  China was an amazing place  The hotel was the best place i have ever and probably ever will stay in  Staff are friendly and polite  you are given a swipe card too get into ur room be careful not to lose but if u do u canacquire another one at reception  In the lobby you have a seating area which is surrounded by a fountain a piano and some palm trees  The food is chinese food and nice if u like that sort of thing  I only ate the rice luckily there was a Mcdonalds nxt door to the hotel  The swimming pool is big and has a lifeguard on duty  The hotel also boasts a gym  a huge bowling alley  snooker rooms  football tables etc  The facilities at this hotel are absolutely fantastic  When i first got up to my room i couldnt believe it s size  The view out of the window went on to the high street  we had a widesreen television which gives you movies ni english or with english subtitles  Our room consisted of two double beds for two people with an ensuite bathroom which had a shower  bath  wash basin and toilet  There is plenty of storage space but beaware of not being able to drink the drinking water  The staff were pleasent and the cleanliness of the hotel was amazing  i left some money for our cleaner as she did an amazing job  Next door to the hotle is a cd shop sellnig the latest english albums for   p  Convert your money to yen and beaware that everything is very cheap  Mcdonalds give u huge portions for less than british price  i had a two litre coke for   p  Visit the great wall of china  tien a men square etc  The oriental culture hotel was amzing and a brilliant stay 
P => Great value and excellent service Despite all the renovation going on   dusty entrance way  gym and pool out of action  really enjoyed my   day stay here  Free internet  spacious and very comfortable rooms  Service with a smile everywhere you go  although sometimes a bit difficult to make yourself understood away from the front desk  Food is OK  but i tended to walk across the road to the cheap and tasty local restaurants where you can eat for less than     
P => Fine Stay at the Oriental Garden I stayed at the Oriental Garden over a weekend for business  but found it also to be convenient for a day of sight seeing  What the hotel lacks in character is more than made up for with sizable and clean rooms     and what I lack in good Chinese language skills was made up for with a friendly  English speaking front desk staff The hotel offers    hour room service with a selection of both Asian and Western dishes  Though I did not order from room service  I did eat one breakfast at the hotel and found the buffet to be quite good  Selections included everything from steamed buns to omelets and french toast The hotel was conveniently located no more than a    minute taxi ride from Tian anmen Square and the Forbidden City  Taxis were readily available and the doorman will help call one for you I cannot fault the hotel for anything and my stay was a pleasant one  Though it lacks character and is not within easy walking distance to the historical sights  the hotel represents a good value and I would not hesitate to stay there again on my next trip to Beijing  
P => Value for Money My wife and I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour of China and found it to be quite comfortable with pleasant staff and good surroundings The hotel boasts a garden complex next door  hence its name  which is free to hotel guests on presentation of your room key  The locals have to pay to get in which many do as it appears to be a central point for early morning exercises such as Tai Chi  Badminton and a variety of other games enjoyed by the Chinese The rooms have either twin double beds or one king size bed  television  airconditioning  safe  tea and coffee facilities  lounge and combined bath shower  For those that can afford it they even have suites available which are quite large Breakfast is a combination of western and local foods  plenty of it and it is quite sufficient for most people  The hotel has a small but comprehensive shopping arcade that has for sale a myriad of local items at relatively cheap prices as well as a tailor that promises to make a suit within    hours at a moderate price It has a unique  quot Old World quot  ambience about it with everything in dark wood that is characteristic of the Chinese  The staff were friendly enough and could speak fairly good English which made for easy conversation when checking in and out All in all not a bad hotel  
P => Has some potential but much better places close by On the surface  the Oriental Garden s rooms seem to be adequate  if a little worn  However  after arriving my business associate and I left the hotel as soon as we could make other arrangements due to a range of problems  First  the beds are almost literally as hard as rocks  Second  as of ust      some areas of the hotel are under renovation  A note left in the room indicated that work would be done between  am and  pm  However  on some nights work related noise continued past   pm  Also  the air conditioning was not adequate  It took several hours at the maximum setting for the air conditioning to make the room comfortable for sleeping in Beijing s ust heat  Finally  as others report  the staff s English is less than perfect  though this did not present a major problem If you are willing to spend a little more  you should definitely look into staying at the excellent Kuntai Royal Hotel located two subway stops south  
P => Has great potential but hasn t reached it yet The rooms and bathrooms are modern  well equipped  and elegant  It s true  the staff speaks limited English  but wasn t really a problem for me  Also  the breakfast buffet was crappy and too expensive  The doorman was very polite  as were all the employees  The gym was small  Location is very good  lots to do nearby I had one major problem  they refused to turn the air conditioning on  The weather outside was mild  but my room was too warm  and the only advice they had was to open the window  The hotel is on a major street and the room was very loud with the window open  Make sure you ask for a room on the back side of the building  This place could be a really nice hotel if they take some classes on how to handle non chinese guests  
P => friendly but a bit short sighted we stayed at this hotel for   nights and found similar problems to the first review  lack of English speaking staff may have been more of a problem for others  but we got by with our mandarin phrase book  we stayed in the exectutive floor which has the bonus of free internet access  broadband   byo laptop  and free snacks in the exec lounge and coffee  our room wasn t ready on our arrival  and we were offered free coffee the staff are quite young  but we found that everywhere  the front desk and concierge were excellent  but the cleaning staff are not very good  our bathtub had some ugly brown stains on the bottom  and when asked  the cleaning girl said she doesn t clean that  the japanese restaurant has a great lunch offer of teppanyaki for   Yuan  which was great for a lunch meal if you re looking for an english orientated hotel  this is not the one  but it was basically clean and good  and i would stay there again for this price range  in china  it can get much worse don t ask for an early morning wake up call though  ours came about    minutes late   we had already woken ourselves up    
P => Has Potential But Disappointing I stayed here on business for   nights  and while the hotel itself has attractive decor and much potential for being business friendly  I was quite disappointed  The biggest problem is an utter lack of effort to cater to Western tourists  The staff language skills are terrible  the food  while overpriced as expected for being in a hotel  caters almost exclusively to the Chinese community  and the only TV stations in English were CNN and HBO   Disclaimer  My only available comparison is the excellent Holiday Inn Shenyang  located in a MUCH less touristy region  whose staff spoke excellent English and made the effort to offer almost a dozen English speaking TV stations and a wide variety of international dining options   The cleaning staff was rude and pushy  bothering me even with the  quot Do Not Disturb quot  sign on my door at      am  saying if they did not clean the room immediately  they would not clean it all day  I was forced to print out a business agreement in the Business Center  which appears well equipped for business needs  but the    page agreement at RMB    per page cost me an outrageous US     for one copy  To its credit  they do have a dedicated non smoking floor with fairly large rooms and very clean  modern bathrooms  but should I ever come to Beijing again  I will certainly seek out a different place to stay  
P => Very nice hotel Very nice hotel in very good location  Its a   minute walk from the dongzhimen subway station  on the blue line  and a    RMB cab ride to sanlitun lu  bar street   The rooms are very clean and spacious  The staff is very helpful  Be aware though that most staff doesn t speak much english  beyond the basics   
P => Nice Hotel  Skip the Spa The hotel was very pleasing and very well kept  The accommodations were very comfortable and the space was big enough to stretch after a long day  and my family and I really enjoyed staying here  The breakfast was standard continental and well stocked  and the staff was friendly  especially the manager  This hotel doesn t have your standard Guest Services person to help you plan your trip around Beijing  but the staff can give you some tips The Palm Springs Spa on the other hand was a miserable experience  They charge big bucks for poor service  I made an appointment after my mom and my sister got a massage  When I arrived to get the same massage  they made me switch rooms three times  which was very ackward and uncomfortable  The attendant brought me tea when I ordered water  and the massage therapist kept sneezing on me during the massage  Surprisingly  I got a cold soon after that  Not pleasing at all  On top of that  the massage was lame and not worth it  When I asked my mom and my sister about their experience  I realized that they had screwed me  They gave the cheapest  lamest massage and charged me the price of the Thai Aromatherapy massage  Their service and the way they treat clients is poor and unprofessional  
P => Excellent for Long Stay This place is really targeted for long term stay  e g  over   weeks   The rooms are huge and well decorated  Everything you could possibly need is provided The hotel  it s a serviced apartment really  is located inside one of the most upscale apartment compound in Beijing  The club house has a good size gym that s not crowded and a huge spring water pool  excellent for families  The garden inside the compound is enormous and fantastic to walk around Yes  the location may not be convenient on face value  but if you ask the front desk to write down the compound name in Chinese  almost all taxi drivers know how to get there  The location is actually very good because it has easy access  without getting stuck in traffic  to Sanlitun  CBD and the  th ring road  for quick access to the airport and Lido area As it is a serviced apartment  don t expect the same type of service that you would get from a   or   star hotel concierge  however the front desk will try very hard to help you The fact that many of the guests in this hotel serviced apartment are long residents is evidence of the good service  location and room quality If you want a   star breakfast  this is probably not for you  The selection is limited  and there is no    hour room service  The restaurants in the club house do room service for lunch and dinner For full disclosure  we are long term residents at the riott  
P => Great rooms but out of the way  My husband daughter and I stayed in the riott Palm Springs for   nights in ember  We booked a   bedroom apartment and it was spacious  beautifully decorated and clean  We weren t guaranteed a non smoking room and sure enough  we didn t get one  The smell was quite bad for the first day or two but then wore off  These apartments are really designed for travelling business people  The kitchens are gleaming because they are never used  There are no cooking utensils to be found and when I asked at reception for a saucepan to cook some pasta was told they are not available  That being said  there was little else wrong with the room  Food in the hotel consists of a decent breakfast buffet with a mix of Asian and Western food  After breakfast there is no food to be had in the hotel  Only a coffee machine which operates all day and gives quite nice coffee  Across the road is Chaoyang Park which is enormous and a lovely place to wander  We found an amusement park and though it was Winter and the park looked deserted we found there were some ride operaters and ended up riding a small roller coaster  which was fun  A few kilometres up our road is a pretty good shopping area  Buses cost   yuan to get there and to ride the subway costs   yuan  Taxis are plentiful and cheap  The staff at our hotel were polite and helpful  Had I done more research  I may not have stayed at this hotel mainly because of the lack of easily obtaining food but we were very  very comfortable and the accommodation cost was certainly not budget breaking   around      AUD per night for a   bed    bath apartment  
P => Great For Family I stayed here because I want to have my    years old mother close to myself and wife in our Beijing trip  Originally I booked a two bedrooms  two baths unit  Right before we departed for Beijing  I found out a Beijing relative is willing to spend sometime with us and stayed overnight  so I changed the booking to three bedrooms unit for a short time We arrived and was told three bedrooms were actually two big bedrooms with own bathrooms  and a third study room that can accomodate a rolling bed  and a non attached bathroom  My relative left after two days  so we moved down to a two bedrooms unit  The three bedrooms unit is not only larger in total area  the inside is plusher  and more luxurious We made use of the nice kitchen to heat leftover  and was happy to find washer dryer Palm Spring Executive Apartments is the most exclusive apartments in Beijing  riott is housed in tower    Included breakfast is great  Service is impeccable Location is a little far  not within walking distance to any subway  but there is bus station in the front I ended up taking taxi everywhere I went  but taxi fare is cheap in Beijing  Within walking distance is an restaurant called wangfu Peninsular Resturant  in the Chaoyang Park  and the place used to be the royal residence  We ate there and the food was great  At the attached Palm Spring shopping center  there is a cash atm from Citibank  and I got money there easily The separate club house has great excercise facility  and it is comprehensive   even with a ping pong room  Because all the entrances are guarded  one can feel really safe there  I would definitely return to here next time I visit Beijing  
P => Love this place This long term executive hotel is a perfect place for a long term stay  Breakfast is included and a wonderful place to meet other expats that are staying in the building  The staff is very friendly and helpful  The internet works fairly well most of the time and the gym is so convenient  The location is easy to access restaurants via walking or cab  Also  a good place for a vacation stay as you can meet so many long termers that can offer suggestions to you   The GM goes out of his way to make you feel part of a family  
P => Superb Beijing hang out  On the basis of what we read here  we booked two nights at the riott Palm Springs apts for our last days in Beijing and found the accommodations to be so perfect we wanted to extend our stay for another few days  The descriptions of the room layouts  appliances and materials are as others have positively chronicled   well appointed  except for kitchenware   comfortable and classy  The floor to ceiling windows allow excellent views of the city and the addition of sheers to the curtaining allows the entire apt to be bathed in light without leaving the occupants on display  Zoned heating and cooling is a definite plus  Breakfast was a delight  with the hot items totally changing from one day to the next and fresh pastries and fruit  cereals and yogurt a constant  The coffee espresso cappuccino machines make truly excellent beverages and work      so you can pad down after dinner and get a freshly brewed espresso to go with your nightcap  There s a Manager s reception each evening at     pm  but we never managed to make one In our one bedroom apt there was a good desk and desk chair facing the window in the bedroom with a leather lounge chair and ottoman adjoining  Lots of electrical outlets behind a panel on one end of the desk  good lighting  feature filled telephone and a supplied Ethernet cable  along with the great view  made it a very nice workspace  There s also a cordless phone in the living room and phones in the baths The housekeeping we experienced was very good and certainly adequate  In making the bed  our housekeeper fluffed and arranged the pillows we d actually used for sleeping and didn t return to the bed the plethora of sleeping and decorative pillows we d removed and placed in a corner  Some might consider this a fault  but we appreciated not having to demolish the bed covers each night to make the bed ready for sleeping  As is now the norm most everywhere  towels are replaced only if you specify  All linens are plush and plentiful  as you d expect from riott  We paid      room tax night and feel we got a bargain We were impressed with security  beginning from the gate when our taxi entered the compound and on into the elevator where one had to insert a room key to ascend to all but the first floor  As noted by others  there is a grocery just a three minute walk away  It s three floors of excellent shopping   quick foods take out  regular grocery items  alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages  paper products  cleaning products  OTC drugstore items and a great selection of general department store items  We bought excellent stainless steel chopsticks for    cents pair and a terrific Argentine Mendoza cabernet for    yuan  about       as well as all the components for a noodle  vegetable and tofu dinner  chocolate pastry dessert  fruit and yogurt for about     Directly across the street from the front door is a neat little restaurant from which we got take out one night  Without our asking  they split all the dishes we ordered into two equal sized containers so we each had our own servings   a nice feature when you don t have plates at  home  The staff at MPS is very accommodating and very professional  One reviewer found their English wanting  but those we encountered were English savvy and eager to help  They offered suggestions  obtained cabs quickly and accurately advised us on the approximate fare to our destinations  Our departure was from Beijing Airport s Terminal    the most common international terminal  and the fare was    yuan  about         with a travel time of about    minutes  average traffic  not bumper to bumper   Whether for business or for pleasure  we highly recommend riott Palm Springs apts and intend to make this our permanent home for all future visits to Beijing  
P => Yes yes yes I don t know why this isn t better advertised  We got a two bedroom for about      US  It s a cheap cab ride into the tourist parts of the city and very fast  I stayed with a friend who snores very loudly  and given the crazy jet lag we were going to have  we wanted two bedrooms  This place is huge  what was nice was the living room where we could recover from jet lag while another slept  It was just a very comfortable way to being our trip to Asia  Very clean  large kitchen  although we didn t cook  Next to shopping and grocery store to buy water  drinks  etc  For families  this place is perfect  Just a nice way to acclimate to a far away journey  Bedrooms were large  well lit  Living room was enormous with large flat screen  Full size kitchen  Sometimes in hotels large is inversely related with quality  i e   large rooms are usually junky and small rooms are nice and refined  but in this hotel  you have large spaces very well decorated with granite bathrooms  etc  If I had a bunch of kids  I would definitely stay here  too  Just a nice neighborhood where you are  too  Very safe and lots of expats staying nearby  Very happy we found this place  You don t earn riott points though  that s not so great  Two bedrooms  two bathrooms  
P => This Hotel is Fantastic My Family just returned from Beijing we stayed at this Hotel and were delighted about everything this Hotel had to offer  This Hotel is clean and the staff here are very helpfull  This was our first time visiting Beijing and we could not have been more pleased  The Apartments are spacious and clean  they actually have hard wood floors in them and they have everything you will need for your stay including a washing machine  The Hotel has a buffet breakfast everyday that offers many different types of food  You can have anything from fruit and yogurt to authentic chinese fair  if you ask the staff they will even fry you an egg or make you an omlet This hotel has a beautiful swimming pool and spa as a guest of the Hotel you can get a membership free of charge while you are staying at the hotel  The spa is first class  The pool is on the other side of the property this hotel has several buildings in a gated area it has a covered running track that circles the buildings as well as a playground for younger children  The area that this hotel is in is called the Chaoyang district which in fact is the wealthiest district in Beijing  The city is undergoing major contstruction so you will see roads that look nice but others are not so nice  However at no time did we ever fell threatend or unsafe in any of the areas that we visited  Remeber Beijing is HUGE so if you plan on walking bring good shoes  The Hotel is located well you will find that most things you want to see are within walking distance if you like walking if not just grab a cab most things are just a few min away  The front desk has maps for you and they have several different business cards with addresses written in Madarin for the taxi driver  Dont be afraid to ask for help the people in China will not offer to help but if asked they are more than happy to give directions My family would stay at this Hotel again  We enjoyed every moment here ie 
P => Poor service not suitable for short stays or first time visitors I just completed an over   month stay at the riott Exec Apartments  The one bedroom I occupied was spacious  but the gold plated furnishings and decor with the dark wood floor and green carpeting are not entirely my taste  Cleanliness in the rooms was so so and amenities appear precious at this hotel  cleenex are not refilled    The inventory check in list did not match my check out list  which is why I was charged for  missing  items I had not even signed for in the first place  mostly kitchen items like can opener  cutting board  etc  or that broke during my stay  glass container   The cost is excessive and the charge for the two laundry bags in which I carried my dirty clothes to my permanent residence was absurd  CNY    each   and to add insult to injury  the receptionist assured me that was standard at any hotel    not that she had ever stayed at one in this category Service overall during my stay was poor  Staff appears poorly trained and unknowledgeable about Beijing or the surroundings  Guests categorically have to greet staff first before being greeted back  The  at your service  button on the phone in the room is best not used  Calls are either unanswered or answered in chinese  Very helpful for foreigners The hotel only serves daily breakfast  Identical every day  little to no choice and the same green scrambled eggs   yuck   in a quite unpleasant lobby banquet area space  and features no other restaurants  The attendants there try  but have no means available to please guests or make you feel good  Taxi drivers usually drop off at the front of the    building apartment complex  as the two riotto towers are in the back of the    building complex  resulting in a   minute walk through the grounds Location at the south end of Chaoyang Park  not what one expects of a park  as there are no trees and losts of amusements only  is not ideal for business in the North Chaoyang area  but only about a   minute cab ride from the Workers Stadium and Sunlitun area I did not use the pool or fitness area  as they are located in another building  walk outside across the complex   During most of my stay  outside temperatures were well below freezing  which did not encourage a visit there  as returning from a workout or swim came with the real risk of acquiring a serious cold  
P => Star accomodations for   Star price The property is really nice and the rooms descriptions are accurate  The grounds are beautiful and breakfast served in the hotel was good  They served different items each day  They served different breads  cereals and juices and coffee of course  You can ask for eggs cooked to your liking  The hotel is a little far from the local sites but cabs are cheap and plentiful  The hotel staff is very helpful and they would hail a cab for you while you waited in the lobby  They would tell the driver where you needed to go  The rooms are roomy and clean  The driver we had arranged for our trip to the Great Wall no showed  They arranged for another driver for us    that day in less than    minutes  He was really nice and police  It is true that some drivers were not familiar with the location of this hotel  We loved the place and we would definitely stay here again  There is a grocery store half a block away very convenient  The kitchen only had glasses and cups no plates or silver and there was a washer no dryer  I didn f really cook or need the plates and I used the washer once and hung items to dry  also do remember to bring your swimming caps they are required at the pool  
P => Overall a good value for the money We recently stayed at the riott Palm Springs executive apartments             Overall  we were satisified and would stay there again  The apartments are huge  we had a   bdrm   bathroom with dining room  full kitchen  and living room  The facilities are great  a heated indoor pool  gym  small playground  and   on site restaraunts  Breakfast was included in our rate and was pretty good  a mix of western and chinese  The only reason we didn t give it   stars is because even though there was a fully equipped kitchen  there was nothing in it  no silverware  cookware  dishes  etc  And there was a washing machine but the hotel didn t provide washing soap  or sell it for that matter   We did ask to have some forks sent up one night for our take out dinner and it came    minutes after we called As for location  most big attractions were about       minute taxi ride away  We never had a problem with taxis being able to find it  Good restaraunts within a      minute ride  We arranged most of our site seeing prior to arrival so I can t really comment on the front desks knowledge  Their english was just OK  
P => Great Place to Stay Stayed in a   bedroom apartment with my   friends for   nights  The apartment is huge  although one room is actually an office but I requested a bed be put in  The location is fine  just bring a map of the hotel when you are going out  Taxis are very cheap Recommend you go to the Silk Street ket  its indoors  and you can find anything there  But be prepared to haggle alot  if they      you say      We took the trip to the great wall with the hotel  we had a guide called susan who was very informative however  the trip is expensive and the lunch wasnt exactly great     spiced jelly fish    the is a mcdonalds just down the road if you find yourself a bit hungry  The breakfast was fine  buffet and there is free coffee all day in the lobby  Free wireless internet is available in the lobby but you must pay for internet in your room  
P => location is so so  service is poor we just got back from BJ  we stayed at the hotel for about one week  even the place has great facilities  like swimming pool  gyem   the location is just so so  service is poor  the front desk does not know much about the town   not recommend this hotel for first timer in Beijing 
P => great place to stay Fantastic apartment  Huge rooms and facilties  Good location  Breakfast ok  staff very helpful  Web site could explain the location better in the compound as some taxi drivers don t know where it is  
P => Fantastic stay here We spent   nights here in a   bed apartment    bathrooms also  as a party of    The whole experience greatly exceeded my expectations  Staff were friendly  helpful  and spoke excellent English  The apartment was beautiful   clean  fresh  lots of thoughtful touches  Rooms were extremely spacious  and the kitchen was well equipped in terms of appliances  including washing machine  dishwasher  iron and ironing board  There was no cutlery crockery pans  but a well stocked supermarket within the complex sells all of this  There s also a pharmacy and spa  and a lovely leisure complex with a large swimming pool  as well as a gym within the apartment building  It is a little out of the centre   minimum       mins in a cab outside rush hour  more than twice that at peak time  but cab fares were no more than          There are several restaurants within    mins walk  at the west gate of Chaoyang Park  On arrival  it did take us a few minutes to figure out which building in the complex was the riott  but the security guards were helpful in pointing us in the right direction  Would definitely recommend this place  The biggest downside was that every other hotel we stayed in afterwards was a disappointment in comparison  
P => Perfect for business traveller This is a   star property at a   star price  For   of us in Beijing for    days on business  this hotel was perfect  Particularly the free internet access  free breakfast  on site gym and walking distance to a variety of restaurants  Then there was the accommodation  We usually stay at the   star china world hotel  which would have cost us more than double what we paid here for the   bed   bath suite  and none of the room  The front desk staff was over the top helpful and gracious  Although it seems to be out of the way of the action  and for a tourist wanting to be near the center of town activities this is true  it was just a    cab ride to anywhere we needed to go  Will stay there again and recommend this bargain of a property  
P => Top notch facility We were   families that rented a   bedroom apartment for   nights  This was the most spacious and luxurious facility ever  Everything from the hardwood floors to the marble bathrooms was top notch  This was one instance where the rooms lived up to the photos on the hotel website  The beds and linens were the high quality now expected of the best hotels  Amenities and towels were high quality  bathrobes were provided  The master bedroom had a private bath with separate shower and tub  The second bedroom had a private bath with a shower over tub  There was a third bath on the hallway with a shower stall  The master bedroom had a standard in room safe Although the staff s English was a little spotty  service was good  As mentioned in another review  the   bedroom units are really set up as   bedrooms plus a den office  with a sofa but no bed  as the units are designed for long term residents  My confirmation from booking at the riott website  however  said there would be a king bed and   queens  so when we called the riott in advance of arrival  they promised we would have a second queen in the den at no charge  On arrival  there was a roll away bed there  but when we pointed out the discrepancy a crew arrived and cheerfully replaced it with a queen bed  The kitchen is not stocked with pots pans or utensils  There were only   coffee cups saucers    glasses and some spoons  No coffee maker  only a water boiler with some instant coffee  common in China   There is a large Chinese grocery store about a block away where we bought paper cups  plates and other supplies  A large separate laundry room had an American brand front loading washer and a dryer  This was one of the few places where there was lots of bottled water on arrival which were diligently replaced daily  The riott operates two apartment towers in a complex with several towers  The complex is a secure facility with limited access  In the interior are extensively landscaped grounds with a waterfall and children s play structure  riott guests have access to an athletic club in the complex which has a workout room and the biggest and most luxurious private indoor pool I ve ever seen  The enormous pool room has one wall of glass looking out to the gardens and has marble floors  columns  The locker rooms are first class  with showers that are separate booths with privacy curtains  It s a little awkward to get club access  as you have to get a free card pass from the riott front desk and then cross the garden area and access the pool from the club entrance at the other side of the complex  The club requires you to wear a hair cap in the pool so you either have to bring one or purchase one at the club  about       CNY   Free breakfast buffet is included for occupants  Although we were   adults and   kids  there was no extra charge  The buffet is limited  scrambled eggs with a rotation of bacon  ham or sausage  some kind of potatoes  toast and a few pastries  a few Chinese items  rice porridge or noodles   Coffee is good as it is from self service automatic espresso machines that grind fresh beans for each cup  Although the buffet offerings were limited  for some reason this was the favorite breakfast during our   week trip for our kids  I think it may be because the dining room is small and intimate  with sofas and coffee tables as well as dining tables   more like a bed and breakfast place  The location is not ideal for tourists  It s out between the third and fourth ring roads across the street from Chaoyang Park  This is an area under construction  and it s not like you walk out on the street and there are lots of restaurants or shopping nearby  Returning from the Forbidden City during evening rush hour by taxi took us about    minutes  of which    minutes was wait time  There is no subway stop nearby   you have to take a taxi to the nearest stop  From the airport  taxi drivers seem unfamiliar with the riott   you have better luck not mentioning the riott name and just say you want to go to the Palm Springs apartments  The best approach is to have the hotel s phone number handy and have the driver call to get directions  they all have cell phones   On the other hand  the riott is better located for getting to sites outside the central core area  such as the Great Wall or Summer Palace   We began our   weeks in China in Beijing at the riott and at the end of the trip when we asked our kids what their    experience was  they unanimously said   not the Great Wall  not the great Buddha of Leshan  not the sunrise at Mount Emei   but the Beijing riott  and particularly the swimming pool  So if you re traveling with kids  the riott apartments are an unbeatable choice compared to a couple of hotel rooms  especially given the current very reasonable pricing  At the end of a hot  tiring day  it was great to return to paradise  
P => Luxury apartments Just returned along with my family from Beijing  We stayed at a   bedroom ambassador suite which was excellent  Initially   the driver from the airport took us round and round in circles as he could not locate the property  It is not easily located for that matter and is in between a cluster of buildings around a large garden with several points of entry and exits  all with security control  So it would make a big difference if you knew which gate was the best to approach  Anyway  the lobby is very small and check in took a bit of time as they need to take passport copies of all guests etc  Our suite was located in a different building and we were led to it through a corridor  Lightings and decorations were of a high standard and elevator access is room key card controlled for security  Our suite was on the   th floor and had a foyer with a laundry room next to it which had an ironing room and a washer dryer as well  making life very easy when traveling with kids  A large dining area with living room adjacent to an open plan kitchen was beautifully laid out with quality furnishings  Although the booking was of a   bedroom suite  the fine print clarifies that the third bedroom is actually a study room  It indeed was a study room with a large sofa and ample space to place an extra bed although the housekeeping confessed it had no more extra beds  The other   rooms were a master bedroom with a king bed and a large bathroom with spearate showere and large windows  The other room was a queen bedroom  An extra bathroom was outside the room to cater for the bedroom and study room but there was a guest toilet as well  Free high speed internet  local calls and breakfast was also provided  Breakfast was in the lobby and nothing special  We preferred to make it ourselves in the suite kitchen  Overall service was good and as usual in China  langauage might not be very easily understood  My word of advice is always to take instructions and addresses written in Chinese along with you  Also if you are with a family  it is better to hire a minivan with a driver which does not work out too much  Overall we had a great stay and I will readily recommend it to family groups  My only gripe is there isnt any convenience store or supermarket in the complex  The nearest one is Watsons located    mins walking from one of the gates  but it closes at  pm  We had arrived at      pm but the bellboy was nice enough to arrange a cab to take us to a store    mins away by cab and made him wait and bring us back  
P => Returned to reception to ensure rate was in CNY and not USD  it was that nice    friends and I spent   nights in a   bdrm suite in late uary and this hotel far exceeded our expectations  The   bdrm was a perfect size for   people and contained   bathrooms  a kitchen and washer dryer The staff at this hotel truly went above and beyond  planning booking all of our activities in Beijing  dinner reservations  our Great Wall day trip and all Taxi rides  This was extremely helpful as there is very little English spoken in some parts of the city and quite frankly we were a bit intimidated  The Peking Duck at the restaurant recommended by the hotel  the one with the rainbow sign out front  that s all I can remember  was so good we went back   nights later Upon check in  a hostess sat with us  served us cappuccino and gave us information about the hotel and the city itself for       minutes  She even delivered a    case of bottled water to our room free of charge  The hot breakfast  included  was also enjoyable The only knock on this hotel is the location  the area is quite dirty  in great contrast to the hotel itself  and there didn t seem to be many restaurants shops in the immediate area  Taxis  however  are abundant and very inexpensive  Also  there is a grocery store in the compound which is handy Beware that the hotel is only part of a large complex of buildings  gated with tight security  and is very confusing to find even for taxi drivers  Make sure you are at the right spot before leaving the taxi Overall  the service at this hotel was outstanding  Also  I am quite certain I will never stay in such an impressive suite again in my life  The rate  when split among   people  was more then reasonable   approx      CDN per night each   For what you are getting  this is well worth it  trust me  I would highly recommend this hotel  
P => non   oro quello che luccica  
P => Agr able s jour au riot Palm Springs  
P => Superb view Good service and Chic design Park Hyatt Beijing is located on the top floors of the Yintai Centre  We got a great view of the Beijing landscape and its neighbouring sky scrapers  CCTV Tower etc   from the sky lobby and the rooms Service that I experienced was really good  To start with  the staff wore friendly smiles  And what s more  one of the members of the staff even took us around and introduced us to the hotel upon our first arrival My family and I    of us  stayed at   Park Twin rooms  The interor design was sleek and modern  with a slight oriental touch  I especially like the ACCA KAPPA bathroom amenities All in all  the Park Hyatt Beijing was a good deal  considering the comfortable and unforgettable stay that it provided my family and I with  
P => real nice hotel the rooms at the park hyatt were really nice  the staff was friendly and did their best to speak english  the bar situation was a little weird  in terms of them reserving bar stools for people for hours that never showed  but the view and   man band is definitely worth the weirdness  the spa was amazing  complete with great views of the city  we went two separate times  reflexology is a must after climbing the wall  the gym was also great  the only downside is the elevator situation  you have to ride two elevators to get down to the lobby  it s fine once you get the hang of it  but you definitely have to leave yourself an extra   minutes or so to get out of the hotel  if that was the worst part  it wasn t so bad  it wouldn t keep me from staying there again  
P => very high calibre city hotel   enjoy  As other reviewers have mentioned  for some reason cab drivers can t find the place  Despite being armed with a map and a Beijing resident Mandarin speaking friend  the first two cabs I tried declined even to try to find it  and the third had to be navigated in on my cellphone by the hotel reception  All quite entertaining  really  Apart from that the location wasn t an issue as I was at conference in the hotel so never had to leave Everything else was excellent  My room was booked at an absurdly cheap conference rate which made this the best value hotel I ve stayed in for years You re in the top half of a skyscraper  with three lift banks to choose from depending on where you want to go  I guess that could be a bit of a puzzle  but just allow a couple of minutes extra and you ll be fine   and the views compensate for the minor confusions  The staff are very professional  easily comparable with the best Hong Kong    hotel staff  And the hotel s very tastefully decorated   quot understated modern with generic Asian accents quot  as an interior designer might describe it The room was big  with an open plan layout  so the bathroom is part of the room   which I like but you might not if you re sharing with a not quite best friend   It has a high tech Japanese toilet  which you ll find in every    hotel globally within a few years  they re so good  Nice big  tho  square   bath  with bath salts  Plenty of work space  moderately expensive internet  coffee machine and kettle  CD DVD player  tho  an ipod player would have been nice   Uber comfortable bed and bedding as you find in all the top end chains  Electronic controls for everything  including the blinds and a very effective blackout shade for you daytime sleepers Breakfast was on the   th floor and was a nice mix of buffet and a la carte  all included in one price  I really like this   it irks me to have to fetch my own breakfast if I m paying for it  but buffets do allow you to customise  so this was a good compromise  I swam a couple of km in the pool  a   m lap pool so you can do a proper workout set   and what s better is that the staff KNOW how long the pool is  The overwhelming majority of front desk staff have no idea how long their pools are  so unless I go scope it out when I check in  I can t plan my morning set the night before  Well done Hyatt on the staff training  Beautiful gym and changing room  too  though in this quality of hotel I d have expected to find a few more toiletries  razors and cream  deo  etc   a pretty minor moan I admit  I didn t explore the mall  but I d imagine your shopaholic friends could burn a few thousand dollars on branded toys very easily  if that s their thing So all in all  this is one of the best and most sophisticated big chain hotels you could envisage staying in  reminiscent  not surprisingly  of the Hyatt at Roppongi Hills in Tokyo  Enjoy  
P => Nice hotel in wrong location Take the subway and you are right below the hotel  Very convenient  Though you have to walk through a tunnel if you come in on the number    line  Take a taxi  Forget it  You better know how to explain how to get to the hotel or have the number for the driver to call  Even then  he probably won t find the entrance  Worst design for an entrance to a hotel I ve ever seen  Plus  there are no regular taxi s waiting  They have a private taxi that does not use the meter  I used it once and coming back with a regular city taxi found out it was only   Yuan more  However  that was on a short ride  So hard to say  I don t like not knowing if I got ripped off or not  The area itself is close to everything and not in a remote location  So that s good  It would help if the building had a Hyatt sign on it That being said  the hotel itself is top notch  Everyone speaks perfect English and is very friendly  I asked if I could get an upgrade to a corner room and did  Much larger room than the regular one with great views all around  The room is amazing  Shower and tub that look over the city  Japanese style toilet that sprays water in more places than I needed and then has a dryer to boot  Heated seat is very nice though  even opens up automatically Nice hardwood floors that were not slippery  Controls for everything  Had to ask to find out you have to hold the blind switch to get them to raise after closing  Nice espresso coffee maker  Very nice bed Never made it to the pool or gym so I can t comment on it  Only stayed one night As other s have said  the elevators are a pain  If you come into the hotel from the ground level and go to your room  you must go up before you go down  Then to go to the bar restaurant it s two elevators again  Little silly just to show off the   rd floor check in Would I stay here again  Probably not  The hassles with the taxi s when not using the subway is just not worth it  Now if you JUST use the subway  you are in a GREAT location  However  those damn subway s are ALWAYS crowded and it gets old after awhile being locked in a sardine can  
P => Great views from beautiful room  Stayed twice in two weeks     nights each stay  Upon our  nd check in the hotel addressed us immediately by our sir name   very   star  Front desk staff was the perfect combo of friendly and professional   often hard to achieve in Beijing  Lobby  as well restaurant bars  are located on the hotel s highest floors   stunning views of city  Actually the hotel s best feature is the view  We had a corner room for both stays   very large with windows everywhere  Amazingly comfortable bedding  The toilet is a trip   many buttons w  crazy features  Too funny  Only negative in room design was the highly stylized shower  It required towels be set under the glass door to stop water from escaping  Also the lights were a little confusing to turn on and off from the bedside panel The spa and workout facilities are beautiful and like everyplace else in this hotel offers amazing city views  Great steam and sauna  The indoor pool was an oasis Room service and restaurants bars are pretty pricy  but expected at   star hotels in Beijing lately  Hotel sits atop a high end shopping mall with some restaurants  Two major subway lines are footsteps from the hotel and the Silk ket is an easy walk  Ideal   star hotel in great location  
P => Stylish contemporary Everything you d expect from an expensive  top end hotel  The  quot Park King quot  room is easily the best I ve had the pleasure of staying in  perfect for relaxing after a hard day in the office  Spacious  contemporary  well furnished and with great views  The deep limestone bath is superb  There are a lot of electronic controls in the room for lighting  blinds  and even the toilet is one of those Japanese inventions that has a control panel of its own The views from the China Grill  amp  Bar on the   th  amp    th floors respectively are awesome  Breakfast is in the China Grill  There are a lot of staff on hand  all eager to please and serve  The only gripe I had was with the reception being on the   rd floor  It is a little inconvenient having to go all the way to the   rd and then down again to one of the lower floors to get to your room  When you want to leave the hotel  you have to repeat the process again   up to the   rd and then down to the bottom   One note of frustration  and not really the fault with the hotel  is that taxi drivers don t seem to know where it is  We almost always had trouble finding a taxi driver who knew where it was even after showing them a card with the hotel s name  address in Mandarin  amp  a map of the location  This was surprising considering it s the tallest building in the area  Other than that  highly recommended and in my view  better than the JW riott I stayed in on a previous visit  
P => Beautiful hotel but I wouldn t stay there again While the hotel is beautiful  there are too many isssues to warrant staying there  The lobby is on the   rd floor which has gorgeous views  but you have to take   elevators to get to your room from the enterance of the hotel inconvenient at the very least  Because the hotel enterance in in the middle of complex rather than on the street  taxis are hard to get and returning to the hotel by taxi is a problem because taxi drivers don t know the hotel and have a lot of trouble finding the hotel and the entrance  It was the only hotel in China in which we stayed that there weren t taxis waiting  The hotel is somewhat out of the way although taxi rides are inexpensive  It is the most ultra modern hotel I have stayed in  
P => Delightful   top marks highly recommended I was lucky enough to enjoy the Park Hyatt as a little getaway from the city rush last weekend   it was absolutely delightful  I stayed in a standard King room which had an amazing view  was very spacious and had a lovely deep sandstone bath The decor was lovely  the food delicious and the service   brilliant All requests were cater for in an instant   even the bellboy buying some headache tablets from the pharmacy Will be back for an escape   cannot fault Oh  I didnt use the gym or pool  but bothy looked excellent  a long pool and brand new technogym equipped gym Outstanding outstanding 
P => Very Chic The Room  It comes with a spa style decor bath area with in ceiling rain shower  There are   sliding door in the room  one of which closes the main door sealing out sounds from the corridor  the second divides the bathroom from the bedding area  The room also has two lighting mood settings  In general  the room s design has strong Asian influences  The Service  The hick up of the hotel is something that I ve also had at the Shanghai Grand Hyatt in that  being a Chinese myself  some of the staff automatically speaks to me in Putonghua even after I reply in English  A somewhat frustrating experience when they only speak English when I tell them I don t understand what they are saying in Putonghua myself  I was also slightly offended at the China Grill when I tried to make a reservation with the receptionist there where I had a camera in my hand and in  off  mode and was told I can t take pictures of the menu    The Food  The Lobby Lounge seems to be the most reasonable in price and quality  No real need to go up to the China Grill although it s a couple of floors higher than the Lobby Lounge which is already on the   nd floor  
P => An experience matching the Great Wall Due to a broken foot I was  quot trapped quot  in the Park Hyatt Beijing for   days  To start with  the concierge was extremly helpful in arranging for transport to the hotel  This included organising a wheelchair which was waiting for me right in front of the train with which I arrived   one hour late  The staff waited  The manager welcomed me personally and generously offered an up grade from a corner room to a suite right away  I spent the   days alone in suite      and wasn t bored for a moment    Internet  at an extra cost of     yuan per day  allowing me to skype with the world  international TV  luxurious baths  great views  in room dining   it was all a pleasure  The staff were very friendly and helpful  Front desk  concierge and butlers are all fluent in English  This is not to underestimate when dealing with medical issues As good as it can get under the given circumstances  
P => Perfect Park Hyatt My three night stay here was practically faultless  extremely comfortable and with friendly and professional staff in every department  Benny  the Head Concierge was particularly helpful and personable  prior to arrival and during my stay  The limousine airport pick up was particularly impressive and while more costly than a taxi it comes with great extras  Guests are met right at the air bridge and quickly escorted through all the various  checks  and baggage collection  then whisked through a special exit straight to the waiting BMW     minutes later greeted by name by the door staff and escorted to the reception on the   rd floor where formalities are quick and efficient The bedroom had stunning views  although the windows were rather dirty    comfortably laid out and a pleasure to use  Lovely square bath and rain shower  quality toiletries  hi tech separate WC which does everything imaginable  excellent lighting  supremely comfortable bed  great linen and impeccable housekeeping  Nespresso coffee machine  some fresh milk in the fridge would have been a nice touch   silent air conditioning and great soundproofing Good gym and pool facilities  The China Grill and Bar was a real highlight of the stay  Stylish surroundings  great nightscape views  friendly and knowledgeable staff  memorable classic martinis and excellent food  I was impressed with both dinners sampled   so much better than my experience at the Grand Hyatt Made in China I found the hotel very well located for exploring Beijing with Guomao Station  Lines   and     just   minutes from the hotel  For shopping  the World Trade Centre complex  opposite  offers all the usual stores and within the hotels own building are some particularly top end designer shops  
P => Stunning but minor quibbles We stayed here for   days in early The hotel and staff are everything you would expect from the Park Hyatt group  excellent service  spectacular space  comfort  convenience  etcStay if here if   you need assistance with advice in Beijing and or China  The size of Beijing is daunting  and I Iive in London    The staff will bend over bankwards to assist with anything from going to the shop for you to advising best times and places to visit  want something familiar and not too boutique original    location  it s relatively central  but so long as your within ring road   it s fine  want awesome views of Beijing  particularly CBD  superb facilities  health club  spa    the pool is in the tower  so you can swim and look over BeijingMinor quibbles  staff were consistently unable to get cabs between    pm in the evening  which caused us to be late for appointments  This is despite the sterling efforts of staff posted outside the main road  trying to wave taxis into the complex  China grill is shockingly expensive  Quality of western food not great  Chinese is food is great  but not value for money  as the hotel is relatively new and in the middle of a business park  and away from the main road   cab drivers don t know where it is  Having said  finding a beijing cab driver who knows where anything is  is a result  shower faucets are too low  so they spray water at you rather then on top of you  we found the decor a bit sterile  Given the rich history of chinese art asthetics  etc the hotel hasn t really leveraged this  If you want a  quot hotel with chinese character quot  then this is not the place  Try Opposite House  China world Hotel  etc 
P => Best room  This is a new level in hotels   rooms  Everything is first class and the staff is exceptional in every area of the hote  This is a MUST stay if you can do it     even for one night  Rooms are so well planned and designed it is total comfort  A real experience   
P => Simply velous Date of Stay  ruary            Room Type  Park Deluxe Room Upgrade  Amount Paid Per Night    nights Free from Hyatt Gold Passport s Faster Free Nights Promo  paid additional RMB    for an upgrade    RMB           for Awake Package on the  rd night Reservation Method  Hyatt Gold Passport WebsiteLoyalty Card  Platinum Hyatt Gold PassportAirport Hotel Transfer  Booked a car transfer from the airport  normally hotels in China  most of the ones that I ve stayed in send an Audi A L but the Park Hyatt sent a BMW series    The hotel representative met us at the air bridge and escorted us through immigration and baggage carousel before leading us to the waiting car at the car park next to the terminal Location  There is a subway stop near the hotel although I never tried it  I tried taking the Beijing Subway once  and didn t like it  so I usually just take a cab  The hotel is located in the Chaoyang District of Beijing  there is a high end mall on the  rd floor but basically I found it too far from everywhere a tourist would want to visit  Plus the fact that most cab drivers don t know where the hotel is and the taxi card doesn t helps either but telling them  Jianwai Soho  does the trick sometimes    Check in  We were greeted at the ground floor lobby by the staff who escorted us to the   rd floor lobby for the check in  When we got to the reception the already had everything printed out  so it was all a matter of scanning my passport and swiping my credit card and we were off to the room Room  Our room was located on the   th floor  rooms were located from the   th floor down to I think    or something  never paid much attention to it   The room follows the open floor concept  which seems to be the in thing for most hotels these days  I never hated it  the first time I saw it was at the Hyatt on the Bund  which fine  But somehow I feel that this one is just way too open  I actually don t have problems with the vanity beside the bed  that s fine but I really don t like the feeling that I have to walk through the bathroom when entering and leaving the room  Don t get me wrong  the room is nice  just enough space not cramped like most hotels would be  but the problem with the open layout is getting some privacy when you want some  Basically if you want to take a shower  you close off the entire section with the use of sliding panels  Problem is when someone in the room needs to go out or if the person you re with needs to come in  they would have to wait for you to finish before they could go in or go out not unless you are the exhibitionist type but beyond that everything was nice  I was never a fan of light colored wood before but it felt right  I don t think the room would feel the way it would if they used dark wood furniture instead  They had a huge work desk  which was good when you want to dump your stuff and go out again  There was also a small walk in closet so all you big winter jackets won t be all over the place  The floors were heated so you won t notice that it s almost    C outside  They also have an amazing lighting system and mechanical curtain system so you don t have to get up and open the blinds by yourself Bathroom  The toilet is in a small room cubicle by the entrance  Everything was automatic  The cover closes automatically and opens when you step into the cubicle  Has a built in bidet also and you can even control the water pressure and nozzle position through a control panel mounted on the side  There is also a heated blower to dry your      after washing  The shower is very big with a very big rainforest shower head  the spa like square tub is also very nice and cozy and would fit two persons and ideal way to cap a long day in the city and all the toiletries are by Acca Kappa Bed  Bed was very comfortable   just the right height  the only comment I have is I wish they didn t use those big square pillows because it s quite hard to sleep on them  Breakfast  Had to pay for breakfast for two days because I was on using a free promotional stay  Selection is pretty standard but unlike most Asian breakfast spread that I ve come across  the breakfast at the Park Hyatt is a mix of buffet and ala carte  Basically the fruits  bread and cereals are on buffet but the hot food  like omelets  sausages are on an ala carte style menu  you can also order more than one and the price would still be the same  I suppose its all about keeping the food fresh and tasty  Check out  Check out was fast   everything was in the system by the time I came down from the room    Other Stuff  Sometimes I don t like getting showered by attention when in the hotel  The occasional good morning is fine but when you have people on every corner of the lobby greeting you good morning  it s too much  But then again it s not their fault  it s always better to be polite than be snobby  Great staff  they were able to fix my airline ticket for Xi an that suddenly had extra ticket numbers  they had it changed and sent it back to the room with a note about the changes  They were also kind enough to buy ibuprofens for me when I slipped  snow  at the Summer Palace and hurt by back  It took a while for them to find the right one since I suppose they were all thinking if I wanted the Chinese or Western medicine  Oh and unlike most hotels that give you coffee pots or worst instant coffee  the Park Hyatt gives you your own espresso machine in your room  which they refill each day with new    thingy for the coffee  Overall Evaluation  The Park Hyatt lived up to my expectations  simply marvelous  
P => Sleek Park Hyatt Stayed at the hotel in ember for   nights  Room was very modern and sleek with a view of the city  Had a Xmas eve dinner at the bar  Not very impressed  dessert was good though   Had dinner at their China grill on the   th floor  The restaurant had both western and Chinese selections  I tried the latter and it was very good  but it was pricey  I also used their massage service and it was excellent The location was very convenient    to   minutes walk to the subway that connects you to either line   or     line   takes you to the Forbidden city  Wanfujing dajie   The hotel is situated in a shopping center  still under construction   But from what I saw  they were of the same non exciting brands such as Rolex  Chanel  etc Overall  it was a good experience  
P => Great             This is a great hotel in Beijing      the price is affordable  the location is great  the staff is awesome  and speaks English haha  they translate everything for you in Chinese  the rooms are very nice  there is organized tours that you can do  highly suggested in Beijing   We had a great experience there  this hotel made our stay in Beijing very relaxing  
P => Great Hotel for a great price  I just stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing last week and loved this hotel  It had been recommended to me by a friend who stayed there last year and I also read the reviews here  so I am happy to say it was even nicer than I imagined or some of the photos indicated  The staff was great and very nice and helpful and my room was cozy  clean and had all the comforts I needed after a day of sightseeing  I would definitely stay here again  I didn t eat at the restaurants  breakfast or used any of the other services  I did however drink both of the half bottles of wine in the mini bar which were decently priced at     RMB   considering that I might have paid that for one glass and that it would have been much more in the US for the same half bottle I liked the convenience    I am going to upload some photos of my room as well  
P => Wonderful hotel except for the absence of a good gym as i said  if you can live without a great gym and a pool  both of which are helpful to combat jet lag   and you want need to stay in Dongchen  the hotel is great  also   minute from the subway  important in BJ  
P => Very service oriented hotel offering great value We spent a very comfortable five nights here in tember  The staff at both Front desk and Concierge desk were extremely helpful  Not only did they book flights  trains  trips but they also looked up addresses  made telephone calls for us  checked businesses and shops which we trying to find  and allowed us to use the shower at the gym free of charge even though we had checked out the day before  we took the overnight train back from Datong to Beijing and needed somewhere to freshen up   The hotel is next to the Dengshikou subway stop  Line     within    mins  walk to shopping centres  about    mins walk to the Forbidden City We have stayed at other hotels in Beijing and this place is streaks ahead of the competition  given its price range  A really excellent value hotel with outstanding staff  
P => Great hotel and value right in the heart of Beijing Our family stayed in two rooms in early ember  It snowed the last day  Terrific  new hotel  in a excellent modern location  We recommend the duck at Da Dong  right across the street  Nothing to complain about  The drinks at the bar are a little pricey but happy hour is every night  so be sure to have two for one and have fun  
P => Stay here  Brilliant amazing hotel  great rooms  excellent food  fab location  TOP TOP staff  Onl y   minor complaints  Teh     service charge on EVERYTHING makes sundries very expensive  ie   rmb for a beer including service is about twice as much as anywhere else for a Tsingtao Also their bill was very confusing as to the layout due to the aforementioned       But please dont let that stop you  Its a great hotel and well worth it for the above reasons  
P => Excellent hotel Very satisfied with this hotel  centrally located and sure will stay again traveller from USA  
P => A Fantastic Start to the Trip of a Lifetime This hotel is so nice that they were literally filming a soap opera in the lobby     With that out of the way  I think all the fanciness and beauty of this hotel would mean nothing if not for the amazing staff  They bent over backwards to help us at every turn  The doorman was amazing about translating names of places and directions for us  Make sure to pick up a card with the name and address of the hotel  map to the hotel  and seveal popular tourist sites in Enlish and Chinese  This handy card got us many places with ease and really helped the cab drivers to locate the hotel on the return trip because it s a bit hidden  The hotel itself is very classy and clean  The rooms were exceptionally stylish  The beds were typically hard Chinese beds but the room was still comfortable  The breakfast buffet is worth the upgrade because it s fairly tasty and is a fun culture shock on your first day  I have no idea why they think people eat baked beans in the morning   Of the   hotels we stayed at in China  this one took the cake without a doubt because of the attentiveness of the staff  It means a lot when you are far from home and a little scared to have kind people who make everything so easy   
P => Simply superb  Well where do I start  We booked this hotel based on other Tripadvisor reports and it is just superb  from the moment we walked through the door to the day we left I dont think I have ever been made to feel more welcome in any hotel in the world  As others have noted before the hotel is not that known with taxi drivers and the fact it is behind the Regent hotel does make it difficult to spot  Even with my wife being Chinese it still took a slow drive down the road to spot it hiding behind the Regent  I would suggest printing a google map or get one from the hotel before staying to make sure  Location  once you are there    Its in a great location with a tube station next door  about a casual    minute walk to the main shopping area and about    minutes walk to Tianamen square  Hotel appearance  Very smart  clean  stylish     need I say more  Check in was easy and quick  good English speaking staff who explained everything about the hotel  Our room wasnt ready due to us being early but we were directed to the club floor for free tea  We had booked a club floor suite as this included breakfast for    happy hour between      and      pm in the club floor and a larger room for the   of us  The room was just magnificent  a separate lounge from the bedroom  bathroom with walk in shower  toilet and bath plus there was a separate toilet just on the entrance to the lounge area  Very good selection of toiletries as well  We upgraded to this room for about     yuan inc tax which considering what we got it was a bargain  There was free wired internet as well which was quite a good speed as well Breakfast was excellent with a large range of western and asian options  About   chefs cooking eggs and noodles as well  even the coffee wasnt bad which was a first on this trip  Club floor  Basically free drinks and nibbles for a couple of hours each day  A nice section of food both hot and cold with various drinks available including alcoholic  Free wireless internet in the club floor as well which was useful Concierge  Never seen as many staff on a Concierge desk  im sure there were   one day  but I have also never had the service like they gave  Helpful  polite  cheerful and more  We organised a tour with them and also booked the train from Beijing to Xian  Our train tickets arrived within an hour  they also clearly explained the commision rates that were charged which was refreshing to say the least  Downsides to the hotel  Im loathed to put anything as I cant praise the hotel high enough but the bar prices are bordering on insane  One night we had   teas and a fresh orange which came to     yuan  I hope its the last time my   year old son has a more expensive drink than me  Unless you really need to I would therefore not have casual drinks in the hotel  The same beer they charge nearly    yuan for is availble for    yuan in a shop near by  Im sure the pricing is probably standard to other similar Beijing hotels of this class but as a family it is still exceptionally expensive  Many hotels have similar issues regarding pricing in my opinion so I dont want these comments to put anyone off a hotel which I safely say is the best I have ever stayed at  My advice is enjoy the hotel  the staff and the location  just eat and drink while you are out  
P => My favorite Beijing Hotel I have stayed here for more than   times for the past   over year  I have tried Sheraton  Hyatt  Radisson and Hilton but I always end up coming back here  What keep bringing me back  The rooms here are new and very clean    It is a small hotel  after   days  every staff here will remember you  You will start to get more personal smiles and greetings like they are greeting a friend instead of a guest What makes me considering other hotels  location  Yes it is very central  But my office is far away in the south and getting back from office during   to  pm is a nightmare with the traffic  Suggestions  this hotel has a limited view  BUT always ask for a room facing the north  Part of the hotel in the east side of the hotel is unblocked and you can get a GREAT view of courtyard houses just below  You also get to see all the way to Bird nest stadium on a clear day  which is very very rare in BJ   Every morning  you will also find a flock of birds flying above those courtyard houses which I always find it amusing   Taxi drivers generally do not know this hotel  The tip is to tell them the street  quot Jinbao Jie quot  or  quot Li Jing quot   Regent Hotel  which is more famous brother of Park Plaza Wangfujing   I have started to see some beggars just outside the main street junction outside the hotel  I have seen them jump out of a taxi and than beg money from me and telling me they have no money for food  Ignore them like they do not exist    There is a nice meat bun shop   mins walk along Dong Dan North street  The sign outside said the master cooks were from the famous  quot kou bu li quot  buns  Its taste similar  If you do not want to walk all the way to wangfujing for the real thing  this is not a bad choice   There are some facotry outlets    mins walk north of Dong Dan road  Including Adidas  But I never find the price good enough to buy   MacDonalds  go north along Dong Dan  and KFC  go south along Dong Dan  are   mins walk away  MacDonalds even has home delivery here but I have never tried calling them from hotel room  
P => Good Value Great Location Pros  Beautiful hotel  It s what you would expect from any nice western hotel  Comfortable rooms with comfy beds  Rooms even come with plush sitting chair plus ottoman  TV has all your cable channels including HBO and other movie channels  Buffet breakfast  included in our package  was great  Good selection of Asian foods like Chinese vegetables  baked chicken  and sushi  even for breakfast   They also had a great selection of hearty western foods  which did change daily  like pancakes French toast waffles  potato wedges scallop potatoes hash browns  and scrambled poached hard boiled eggs  I opted for the made to order egg station  Dengshikou subway station is located at the entrance of the Regent Hotel  which is right in front of Park Plaza  Also  they have a variety of international plugs  So  no need to buy extra converters   See attached picture  Cons  Hotel has a habit of giving up your room  even if you pay for it in advance  if you check in later in the evening  We were upgraded to a larger room w  two twin beds the first night  There are temperature controls in the room  but they don t seem to work  We increased our thermostat to   C  yet the room was still freezing  My husband and I ended up squeezing into one twin bed to stay warm  It s nice that they  upgraded  us  but it still doesn t make up for living out of your suitcase the first night b c you know you ll have to pack the next day nor does it make up for finding the time the next day to pack your bags  move to another room  and unpack again  The next day when we were changing rooms  another guest was complaining that their room was not ready or available  I didn t get the details of her complaint  but did see a pattern with the hotel reservations Tips      Print out your own map using Google or some other program to show the cabbies  The map offered on the hotel s website as well as the business card maps provided at the hotel for cabs both use   point font for the Chinese characters  Most of the cab drivers have trouble seeing this  hold the card far from their face to focus  and get all grumpy  which doesn t help you  especially if you don t speak Mandarin  See for yourself  Here s the link to the hotel s website map  http   www parkplazadestinationguide com locationMap process OID E F C     hotelCode CHNBWAN      Following another reviewer s advice  the hotel s Chinese name is  Li Ting   If the cabbies say  Li Jing   it s for the Regent  which will also get you to the same block  Once there  just keep repeating  Li Ting  Li Ting  and they ll eventually see the signs for Park Plaza      Ask for a room facing the courtyard  The courtyard is actually the main entrance  quiet  gorgeous  and overlooks the Regent s lobby  The street side has a cool view of a local hutong  but all the construction that goes on here seems to dispose their materials in a truck located right outside the hotel starting at  AM  It s very loud  Thank goodness we had to get up at   for our plans that day  Then  we were moved to our real room      If your flight arrives late in the evening  consider calling in advance to confirm you will be checking in later that night  Even though we paid for the room weeks ago  it didn t guarantee our room was available Even though I m only giving it   out of   stars  I would stay here again  
P => Nice hotel and good deal I stayed here on for a couple of nights while traveling on business  Its in a good location  The staff was very friendly and helpful  The rooms were clean and comfy  Best of all it was a good deal  
P => Great Hotel Great Hotel  I wouldn t hesitate to recommend it My room was large  well cleaned  No complaints at all I d say it was very central  but then Beijing is such a massive city that I d have to question  quot what is central  quot The Park Plaza is near a lot of other western hotels  and  quot only quot  three blocks away    min walk  from the Wangfujing shopping mall  a street closed to road traffic  which has the usual souvenier shops  along with chinese food markets  McDonalds  amp  KFC  and a very modern western style airconditioned shopping mall running alongside the street mall  Having these things  shopping  amp  cheap food  nearby is always an important consideration for me when selecting a hotel There were closer hotels  however most would have been outside my price range The hotel is within walking distance to some of the more central attractions such as the Forbidden City  however I didn t personally walk to any attractions as I had a guide  amp  transport  However it s also importrant to note that you can t pick a hotel central to everything in Beikjing  as many of the attractions are so far apart The cost of the in house food was a little expensive  eg AUD   for breakfast  and AUD    at night   however that s to be expected in a  star hotel when you want the conveniences of home Naturally each person s  quot Value quot  rating relates to what they paid  I was very happy with my rate  I believe I got a  quot   nights for the price of   quot  style promotion Overall  a great hotel  I don t hesitate to recommend it  
P => Superb Hotel   Exceeded Expectations    My wife and I stayed   nites at this hotel in Beijing starting on   nd       This hotel is superb  Rooms  food  and service all exceeded expectations  The staff  especially the concierge staff  was amazingly helpful  We have stayed in hotels in    countries and on   continents and would recommend this hotel to anyone  It is located very close to all the major sites  Short walk to the Night ket  maybe    minutes  Short cab ride to other destinations  Starbucks is a   minute walk out the lobby door  Room service is fast  good  and inexpensive  Cable TV  all amenities you need  We highly recommend this hotel    
P => Great Hotel near subway lines Stayed for   nights  The place was clean and staff very accommodating  The breakfast buffet was good  Would recommend for families and business travel If your Canon camera breaks down the repair shop is in the next building  They fixed our camera overnight  
P => Great Hotel  value for   We stayed in the hotel ch of this year  The hotel matched our expectations in every way  We did our research before booking the hotel on the advice of other people who had stayed in this hotel before us  Great hotel  great location  The only problem i think was that many taxi drivers weren t too familiar with the location of the hotel  
P => Wonderful hotel This hotel is a great bargain  a four star hotel with two star prices  We stayed at the Park Plaza for four nights with our two grandchildren  The rooms were about      including breakfast for all of us  At first  the reception had a problem with our reservations   they had lost it and we didn t get the connecting rooms that we had requested  However  once we settled in  we were more than happy with our rooms  The breakfast buffet was fantastic  with western  chinese  and japanese breakfast foods  The concierge was also more than helpful  The hotel is within walking distance of shopping and the famous food street  Somehow  taxis seem to have a hard time finding the hotel   
P => Wonderfully convenient  Excellent   star quality at   star rates  Stayed at Park Plaza for   days in      Location was great  It s right smack in the centre of Beijing where the main shopping artery  Wangfujing  is  If you re adventurous  you can actually walk to the Forbidden Palace  But take note that it is a fair bit of walk  Much easier to take the underground to Tian An Men East stop Park Plaza is just behind Regent Hotel and Jing Bao Plaza  office tower   Cabbies tend to know the hotel as  quot Li Ting quot   Alternatively  tell them  quot Li JIng  aka Regent Hotel quot   The Underground  Deng Shi Kou  is just around the corner of Park Plaza and Regent  Barely    min walk  There s a Starbucks right across the main door  at Jing Bao Plaza The room itself was nicely done up in subdued furnishings  Comes with portable hairdryer  iron and ironing board in the room  This isn t something you see in most hotels  A very nice touch which I appreciated    complimentary bottles of water is provided daily  Tap water is drinkable as well if boiled first Concierge was excellent  Utilised their knowledge quite a number of times during my stay  They were always helpful and smiling One of the best experience I ve had in a hotel  The personal touch is priceless  
P => Beijing in tember      We stayed at Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing No    Jinbao Street  Dongcheng District  Beijing         China from    to    tember       The hotel is on a slip road and an office block is south of the hotel  while on the south west is the Regent Hotel  The general map is attached as Map A  From the attached Map B  the road running in the east   west direction is Jiabao Street  At the road intersection and the curved structure is the Regent Hotel  At the bottom right hand corner  is an office block  The rectangular structure that is north west of the office block and north east of the Regent Hotel is the Park Plaza Hotel  The circular structure is the Bloo restaurant of Park Plaza  where the guest will take their breakfast on the  nd floor  The vehicular entrance to the Park Plaza is from the bottom right hand corner and beside the office block  Going straight immediately after the Park Plaza hotel and at the junction  is a small Chinese restaurant  It is seen in the picture as a cluster of trees  The area north east of the Chinese restaurant is a small community  with government offices  like the traffic office and also a branch of the Red Cross that also runs a hotel  You will find a courtyard hotel in this community and it costs      yuan per night  Laundry  convenience shop and small restaurants are found in this community  The Map C  amp  D may help you to know the vicinity of Park Plaza that is westwards towards the Forbidden City  Of immediate interest is Wangfujing street  where they close up one section of the road so that you can walk in safety  This street runs in the north south direction and the food street runs in the east west direction and starts from the junction  Along the way  you will find a few hotels  motels and hostels  The initial impressionThe concierge guys were helpful  the moment you step out of your taxi  they took my luggage  tag it and left it behind their counter  It may be a nice and pretty normal gesture  The check   in staff were friendly and offered me an upgrade to a suite with a     yuan extra payment  but I am happy with my  club  room The roomIt was reasonably spacious  The bathroom was large and comes with a bath tub  Two full sets of liquid soap  conditioner and shampoo were available and others amenities like two cakes of soap  comb  toothbrushes  razor  cotton buds  etc  Just note that the shower curtain must be drawn nicely and all the way or water may be spilled out  Two mini bottles of mineral water are available per day and they are placed in the toilet The King size bed was nice and soft  There seems to be countless electrical plug outlets in the room  They can be found on the two bedside tables  the working desk and the utility cupboard  Of special mention is that the electrical plugs comes with all variation  meaning  whichever country you come from  you don t need an adapter  I have travelled quite a bit and this is the first time  that I find electrical plugs for all countries  I am from Singapore and there are three Singapore style electrical plugs in the room  inclusive of one at the bedside table On one of the bedside table  there is a touch light that emits a faint blink  Quite thoughtful of them and you will probably find them in some hotel as a safety feature  In the room  is also a large umbrella for guest to use  It will cost    yuan  if you want a new one as a souvenir  There is also a paper carrier bag in the cupboard  Quite handy for all the shopping that the guest do and will bring home  A safe is provided in the room and also a tray of tidbits for consumption together with coffee tea and sugar  On the writing table  there is a vertical row of shelves and also an outlet for plugging in your LAN cable  The telephone is guest friendly as they have the hotel s facilities on separate buttons from the numerical ones  The breakfastAs a club room guest  I could have my breakfast on the   th floor lounge or at the  Bloo  restaurant on the  nd floor  Menu was fair and varied and the service staff were efficient  They do change some of the breakfast menu everyday The high teaA privilege for the club room and suite guest  i e  free  They start at      PM and ends at     PM  Liquor  can soft drinks and hot beverage were served   in addition to some food in a lounge atmosphere Nice place to relax and they have low sitting sets and a large LCD TV within the lounge  The cookies on the table were made in house and it is one of the best that I have tasted  Light snacks were also available and to me  it is more than sufficient  Other facilitiesThe gym is located on the  rd floor and comes with weight lifting equipment and a treadmill  Basically simple  You may also arrange for a massage also  They have a business centre in the hotel  in addition to two PCs  on the   th floor lounge for any work or Internet surfing  One of the PC has an English operating system  while the other is with a Mandarin operating system  There is a printer connected to the PCs  and of course  you may plug in any USB devices that you may have brought along  The conciergePretty efficient guys  If you need a taxi  they have someone out on the main street to usher a taxi in  They will inform the taxi driver of your destination and will confirm  if the taxi driver did know how to reach the destination  As a safety measure  they register the taxi vehicle number on the hotel concierge log book  in addition to gving you a small slip of paper with the taxi vehicle number on it  The concierge will also remind you to get a receipt from the taxi driver at the end of the journey  You may also ask them for information that you want on beijing  like  what to buy and where the places to visit  During my trip  they directed me to the interactive Mona Lisa exhibition  Local toursThe hotel can arrange them  I went to the acrobatic show and the kung fu show  The price you paid is exactly the same if you buy them at the venue  so  the tourist don t lose out  I was told that they do tours to the Great Wall  but I don t have the price for comparison Hotel LimousineYou may use them for your travel from the airport or vice versa  Additionally  as an emergency  just call them and they can arrange to pick you up anywhere in Beijing  The cost is fair  considering that they use the Audi A   which is a     litre car  Very comfortable The hotel immediate vicinityOn the half left from the hotel entrance  is a row of shops  There are two restaurants among them and they have a reasonably extensive menu  A furniture shop  sits in the middle  A local chinese restuarant  as mentioned earlier could also be a good choice to know what the local would eat at  Across the road  from this row of shop  is Jiabao Place  where  you can shop for mid range clothes and most of all  Da   Dong  a Beijing duck outlet is situated on the  th floor  The restuarant has a nice atmosphere  They will bring the beijing duck up to your table and carve the duck  right in front of you  in addition to demonstrating to you  the suggested procedure to eat Beijing duck with the codiments  The menu  is gold painted and heavy  Inside it you may want to order dished like fish  where they will offer live fishes that can be cooked in two ways  i e  the fillet in one way and the rest in any way  Walking eastwards along Jiabao street  you will see a row of local restaurant that sell Muslim food  like  quot naan quot  and hot pot  They are cheap and most of all delicious  Do explore the side roads of Jiabao  where small departmental stores and supermarkets are located  together with hardware shops and convenience stores Nearest subwayDengshikou Station is the nearest subway and I have attached a subway map  Subway are useful principally because  you may find waiting for a taxi a little bit longer at your destination  The cost is just   yuan  irrespective of the distance travel  even  when you change to different route  Do note that Beijing subway is expanding and by the time you visit Beijing  there will be more new stations  In fact  I have passed a few almost completed stations  like the one at the National Library   ConclusionA good and cheap hotel  with good service  I will stay there again as the staff were responsible people and that it is convenient  too  
P => Great hotel would definitely stay again  Stayed here three nights in tember       Great value  nice location  excellent service  We booked   rooms as we were traveling with a party of five   including two children under     Both rooms on   th floor with nice views  very quiet  We paid about      night each  For the location  it was a great value considering how expensive Beijing can be  Walking distance to one gate of Forbidden City  There s a Starbucks and several restaurant choices right outside the front door  more restaurants easily within walking distance  even w kids   Room service was nice  although Western selections are limited  Concierge  front desk  and doormen ALWAYS had a smile and helping hand  Good English spoken  Only complaint is the small  hard mattresses   but that s typical in Asia  The stated  quot twin bed quot  is barely big enough for two adults and very hard  
P => This is How a Hotel Should be Run  We just can t say enough about the great staff at Park Plaza Wangfujing   this is truly how a hotel should be run  Always a smile  always there to help  from holding the door for you to taking your bags without you asking  to waiting patiently but observantly at the restaurants to be there the moment they sense you are wanting for something  It was truly a pleasure to stay here   especially after our next hotel experience we really missed Park Plaza LOCATION   Right across the street from Jinbao Plaza and high end shops  lots of restaurants of all price ranges across the street or just down from it  including Da Dong Duck Restaurant  Two blocks from Wangfujing Street and only a few blocks from the Food Street and Night ket  Subway station right next door  Taxis super cheap   usually about   or   dollars where ever you want to go  but nice to be able to walk  Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City only a   minute taxi away  Great location for tourists   not the best for business  but not bad either because the taxis are so cheap and easy to get STAFF   See above  Outstanding  from the restaurants to the bellmen to the housekeepers to the restaurant employees  We always felt so welcome and appreciated RESTAURANTS   Overpriced  as one might expect  Menu in the bar is poor  Room service is available but similarly overpriced  Buffet Breakfast is    Y   about         Good  but not that good  There is a Starbucks across the street  Oodles is the onsite noodle bar   not great  but cheap eats  Didn t eat at the restaurant for dinner   there are so many other options nearby  Nice lobby bar  cozy  live music at times  expensive drinks but free wi fi makes it a nice hangout to catch up on work  NEARBY   There is a Hot Pot restaurant across the street which is fine if you ve never tried hot pot before   they help you learn how to do it  which would have been nice if we didn t already know  Also a Cantonese place where you can have their special soup  Da Dong Duck Restaurant across Jinbao  and Quanjude Duck Restaurant only about a    minute walk away  Night ket maybe a    minute walk  Starbucks across the street  also a Japanese Place that we didn t try  Walk down the street toward Wangfujing and there are plenty of fancy shops and some semi local restaurants ROOMS   We did not upgrade to a suite  just had a regular superior room  It was spotless  very nicely appointed  modern  Turn down service available  The shower had massive water pressure which was nice  Could have splurged for a flat screen TV I think  but that was ok  View was only across the street to another hotel  Bed was terrible  rock hard and felt springy like a really cheap mattress feels  If the bed was at all comfortable  we would have given the hotel   stars  but we really had trouble sleeping well  and my back hurt every morning  Met some people staying at the Hilton nearby  whose beds were apparently very luxurious  BUSINESS   Free wi fi in the lobby  Free Ethernet LAN broadband in the room  both awesome  Large desk big enough for   computers  Business Center on the second floor   only used it to print once  but that went well  Not in the business district  but taxis are cheap and only takes about    minutes  As long as the quality of the bed isn t important to you  Park Plaza can t be beat at this price range for value for the money  location  and service by the staff  
P => Clean excellent location great staff   no complaints at all We were travelling with our kids     and      so we wanted a nice  clean and easy place to stay that did not cost an arm and a leg  The Park Plaza Wangfujing seemed to fit the bill The hotel location is excellent   in the centre of the luxury district  surrounded by many other hotels that cost at least   times as much  The staff were extremely accomodating and all spoke excellent English  Our rooms were a good size and were very clean with all of the ammenities that one could want on a trip  The hotel gave us connecting rooms without us even having to ask  The hotel does not have a swimming pool  but we were doing so many things outside of the hotel  there is so much to see in and around Beijing   that we were happy to not have the distraction  We didn t fly half way around the world to stay at the hotel and swim That being said  we wer e pretty pooped the first day we arrived  amp  ordered room service  It was really good and not expensive at all When we had adjusted to the time difference  we found that the major tourist attractions are about a    minute walk or a    minute walk and   minute subway ride away  Tien an men square and Forbidden City   These sites are really close in Beijing terms   there are some hotels right next to them  like Raffles for instance  but their prices again are about   times that of the Park Plaza  The walk was really nice  amp  we visited some huatangs that we might never have seen if we d been right there  We booked air tickets from Beijing to Hong Kong for the following week and the concierge staff did this for us very quickly and easily   no fuss and a much better price than we d have gotten if we d booked them at home Taxis are tough to get in Beijing at times  but our hotel was always able to find a clean and friendly driver for us if we needed it We had snacks one day out in the  quot Beer Garden quot   yes  it is called that  and enjoyed   for one drinks and free hors d ouevres  along with fresh soy bean snacks  Really nice  And inexpensive again The Plaza Hotel Wangfujing is a nice mix of traditional Chinese service and style  mixed with some good North American  amp  European touches  They ve done it right  amp  I wouldn t hesitate to stay here again  
P => Simply excellent Have stayed in many hotels across Beijing over the years and this has been an excellent experience to date  I think the service has been outstanding  
P => Awesome Hotel This hotel had an excellent location  the rooms were amazing  so big and luxurious   and the value for money was the best I have encountered  
P => Park Plaza Beijing Excellent Had  quot deluxe quot  room on floor     Lovely room  no problems  good location  UK plugs in room at desk and next to bed  Staff always helpful  cheerful  pleasant and courteous  Free internet by RJ   cable   more secure than wireless  No shaver socket in bathroom  which is odd  so take an adapter for that A little tricky to find  which may trouble your taxi driver  as the hotel is slightly tucked away behind another hotel  The Regent  so try asking for that  or Dengshikou subway station   Park Plaza is right next to the north exit  It is also right by the Ferrari and Lamborghini dealerships  so one of those ways will locate it Use the subway   easy and great value No ATM in the hotel  but there are many in the Jinbao Tower just across the entrance courtyard Some local restaurants   Da Dong  floor   of the shopping mall containing the Gucci store  across the road from the hotel   very high class looking  but with some reasonable priced dishes  including roast duck  Very nice  Highly recommended   Sunshine Kitchen  just along the small road that leads to the front of the hotel   very nice food at a modest price  Has several large TVs and they changed the channel on the nearest one to us on request so we could watch the F  Grand Prix   Casa  also just along the small road that leads to the front of the hotel   more very nice food at a reasonable price  
P => nice hotel Park Plaza s is a very nice hotel   its easy to see why it has excellent reviews  Upon seeing the room  my brother immediately asked   quot Are all our hotels in China going to be this nice  quot  The folks at the front desk and the concierge were helpful  It was very convenient to be able to exchange currency at the front desk One incident of note   we realized that someone had been smoking in our room at some point and told the front desk this  and they accompanied us up to to the room to see for themselves  After realizing that indeed someone had been smoking  they helped us to change rooms  Unfortunately  the second room  although very nice  faced the back side of the hotel  facing a construction site  and on two mornings  we heard folks working loudly at the site as early as      in the morning  I will say that the hotel staff eagerly encouraged the upgrade to a nicer room on different occasions  breakfast included  but we declined  it kind of would have defeated the purpose of finding an excellent deal for the room on the internet  The hotel is a several block walk from the Forbidden City  Old Beijing  and Tiananmen Square  Locally  there is a Starbucks across from the hotel  and yogurt and water at the Q convenience store right around the corner if you prefer not to eat breakfast in house or would like a big bottle of water to take with you while exploring Beijing  Also  around the back side of the hotel is an alley  with some local small stores where you can buy fruit or nuts A couple of points of practical advice about Beijing     The Great Wall was one of the highlights of a trip  However  we signed up for the first tour recommended by the concierge with the Ming Tombs  and the two stops at other places where we could spend money  If I did it again  I would sign up for a different tour  We were gone all day  but only two and a half hours at the Great Wall  and would have loved more time there  especially given how many folks were there on a weekend  which means you spend a lot of extra times in line    everything besides the actual Great Wall on this day tour was just filler for us  Also  my brother was irritated with the tour because they skipped the stone animals near the entrance of the Ming Tombs    we were told we had to sign up for a different tour to see those     Temple of Heaven was unexpected highlight of the trip  I highly recommend it  along with the Summer Palace for a relaxing time  We loved the singing  folks playing music  and the people dancing at the Temple of Heaven  I don t know if this is routine at the Temple of Heaven   we were there on a Sunday afternoon  Also  if you visit the Olympic village area  do so right before dusk  Its great to see everyone flying kites in the evening  and fun to see the buildings light up as it gets dark 
P => Excellent   Previous Reviews Spot On I have just returned from Beijing  I chose the Park Plaza based on the previous Trip Advisor reviews and I wanted to stay in a solid western style hotel rather than anything too designer hip  I stayed five nights in total and loved the hotel and the staff  The price I got via booking from their website was unreal value considering what you would pay for the same type of hotel in Hong Kong  NY  London etc  Everything was faultless   lovely room  fantastic bathroom  spotlessly clean  superb air conditioning  friendly and helpful staff  Location was great esp  for sightseeing The doormen and concierge were extremely helpful and can be trusted      esp  when it comes to getting taxis and making sure you get to where you need to go  Starbucks is opposite if you don t want to pay extra for breakfast in the hotel and I can also recommend the Japanese restaurant next door   very good indeed Not much more to say  except that the hotel definitely deserves it s top    rating in Beijing   
P => Welcome and service without equal All the favourable reviews about this hotel and its excellent staff are fully justified  You feel at home from the moment the taxi stops and feel genuine regret when the time comes to check out  If the upgrade which includes use of the club facilities is available then do take adavantage of this  the food and drink that accompany this deal make it a good value extra  Vicky who serves you in the club lounge has excellent customer skills and loves to practice her English  The rooms are in excellent condition and impeccably clean  the breakfast buffet offers a wide choice and the one meal we had in the restaurant was excellent  The Metro station around the corner makes getting around the City an easy proposition although the trains do get very crowded at times  all part of the China experience though    essential that you have the hotel directions written in Chinese characters  accompanied by a good map  since taxi drivers struggle to find it  hidden away behind the much larger Regent Hotel and the Bank of China  Jinbao Tower  and they universally seem to speak no English  
P => Great location Awesome hotel We stayed at this hotel for   nights  The location is great because there is basically a subway station IN the hotel  and it is an easy    minute walk from all the bustle of Wangfujing  down a street that s nice for walking with plenty of people around  felt very safe All of the staff  esp  the concierge desk bell desk  were incredibly pleasant and helpful  and fluent in English  And this service compared well with   star hotels in the US and other destinations  and totally outclassed the other   star hotel we stayed at in Beijing With all this the rate was very reasonable  we reserved the room at       night  on site they offered us an upgrade which we did not regret taking for a minute  it included a daily breakfast buffet  very good  and cocktails and snacks in their  quot executive lounge quot  for an additional     day for the two of us  If you are not a big eater  you could make this your dinner  although  since it is so close to so many other great places to eat  you should get yourself out to those  Oh  and free internet  Checking the hotels website  I think that they offer package deals even better than this  
P => We loved this hotel  Very nice hotel conveniently located on Jinbao Ave  Its a short taxi ride  RMB    to the Forbidden City and Tianamen Square or a longer walk which  if you take the back roads  is quite interesting  some Hutongs to be seen   The area around the hotel is very smart with shops like  Gucci and Burberry  for the girls and naturally Maserati and Lamborgini for those boys who have everything  The rooms in the hotel are well  equipped with free broadband  excellent plug selections for those of us who forget their adapters   The staff are delightful and very helpful but be aware that in the whole of China  English is not easily understood so some confusion can arise  We took the club package that they offered us which meant that a sumptuous breakfast buffet was included as well as free drinks and snacks in the evening in the club lounge  Here one has computers  printers etc  for use all day long One thing I particularly liked about the hotel was the fact that one can open a window  we hate sleeping with air conditioning The restaurants around the hotel looked great  we had Peking duck across the road in the Jinbao centre which was excellent but quite expensive  RMB   per head    and there is a Starbucks right outside the door  although the hotel coffee was great and their selection of teas sensational   
P => Staff was really helpful On our last night  my father became very sick  We didn t know what was wrong with him  We were very scared  especially since we were in a foreign country and couldn t speak the language  We called the front desk  A woman named  came up and called for an ambulance  She was very reassuring  so that made me feel better  Two staff members came with us to the hospital  and we re very grateful to them  because the hospital was not patient friendly  The ambulance dropped my father off at a small room where he was checked for swine flu  After the blood test showed that he didn t have the flu  he was expected to somehow make his own way to the main hospital entrance in the dark   it was   am   when he was very weak  Fortunately  the male hotel staff member got a wheelchair for my father and pushed him where he needed to go  The other hotel staff member  a woman named Kira  helped us with the hospital procedures  she also interpreted for us  They only left after my father was settled in a hospital bed and we encouraged them to go back to the hotel  The hotel staff really helped us  the ordeal would have been worse without them The room and bathroom were clean  We were in an executive room  and there was an ironing board and an iron in the room  There was also an umbrella and about six drinking glasses plus mugs  usually there are only two in the room and two in the bathroom  We drink  water  often  so having a lot of glasses was a plus  The beds were comfortable We could have breakfast at the lounge or at the coffee shop  but since we were told that the breakfast at the coffee shop was better  that s where we ate  The breakfast buffet was good  Some of the hot dishes were changed  so there was something new to eat every morning  There was happy hour at the lounge in the evenings that served small snack dishes  cookies  fruit  and drinks  There is a subway stop next to the hotel  which we found very helpful  because we found it easier and cheaper to use the subway than to take taxis  When we needed a taxi  we just told the doormen  who flagged a taxi  the hotel entrance was tucked away from the main roads  for us and told the taxi where to go  When we asked  the doormen and the concierge also wrote down in Chinese the names and addresses of the places we needed to go  which was good because the taxi drivers couldn t speak English Wangfujing street  which has shopping malls and restaurants  is a ten minute walk away  but there are also some restaurants around the hotel  For those who want duck  there is a branch of Da Dong  which serves good roast duck  in the fifth floor of a mall that is across the street from the hotel You can exchange money at the front desk  unlike the money exchange in the airport  the one at the hotel didn t charge commission  and the hotel gave us a better rate  Aside from the ones who helped us at the hotel  the other staff members were also helpful  The doormen were quick to help us out of the cabs when we d arrive and ask us where we wanted to go whenever we left the hotel  Check in and check out were quick  Housekeeping responded promptly when we asked them for things like extra hangers and ice It s hard to find fault with the hotel  and they really helped us with our medical emergency  I highly recommend this hotel  
P => Great hotel Park Plaza is a very good choice if you want a nice place to stay at reasonable price  It is is a walking distance from Wangfujing area  but the subway is also just a few steps from the entrance  Rooms are nicely decorated  staff is well educated and helpful  Starbucks is around the corner  Based on the experience of spending here two nights  when we came back to Beijing after a   week tour  chose this hotel again for our last night in China  
P => Five Star Room and Service at Half the Price Great location    minute walk to the subway  Quiet   It is setback from and shielded by the Regent Hotel from street noise on the   nearby main roads  Rooms and hallways are very nice   seem to be almost new  Service is super  The lobby is not big and there is no swimming pool  Laundry is expensive  like most hotels  
P => Top Class I ll echo most reviews of this hotel  excellent location and great value for money  The rooms are spacious and spotless  The food is excellent  But it s the staff that place it alittle out of the ordinary  I stayed for eight nights while exploring Beijing and every time I had to deal with a member of staff it was obvious that he or she enjoyed their work  Every request was dealt with efficiently and with good humour  The housekeeper on my floor spoke excellent English and took pride in her work  The concierge  porters and receptionists were full of information and willing to take the time to ensure that guests were looked after I ll be back  
P => Absolutely Excellent Like everyone else seems to say  there is absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel  Staff were very efficient  friendly and helpful at all times  Hotel is sparkling clean all over  rooms very comfortable and location brilliant  Would definitely recommend to anybody  There s a Starbucks right opposite too  which was useful  
P => Great location super helpful and friendly staff good value My friend and I were on a shopping splurge city highlights holiday and wanted a nice hotel in a good location but couldn t afford the very     This was just great   great rooms in super location within walking distance of Forbidden City and city centre shops at a really great rate The staff spoke English very well and were SO helpful and friendly  Breakfast is included and was really great too  Something for everyone  There were cheapish restaurants in walking distance too for night time  Very safe area bang smack in central Beijing  We loved it and would highly recommend it  
P => Very Nice Hotel  The hotel is very nice  one of the things that i liked is that the rooms are same as on the pictures on their web  Very good hotel  
P => Treated like family My stay in Beijing was broken up into two segments since I went elsewhere in between so decided to try two hotels while I was there  Stayed at Park Plaza first  The hotel is conveniently located near major sightseeing spots walking wise  or if you prefer taking the subway  it s right next to subway station  Dengshikou   Line     The hotel has good facilities  gym  bar  restaurants  free in room internet  and the room was spacious  But one would expect those in most hotels  I think what distinguishes Park Plaza apart is the service  Everyone at the hotel was pleasant to deal with  In particular  the concierge is extraordinarily helpful with recommendations  directions  tour arrangements and really made me feel like I m at home which is important for a solo traveler  My  nd hotel was one much higher ranked than this  Even by paying almost     more a night  the service level was nowhere near Park Plaza    I had to carry my own luggages and hail a taxi to go to the airport  
P => Greatest hotel service I ve ever experienced This is not a big hotel but it s BIG in service in every way   from the warm  friendly and courteous reception to the helpful concierge when asked for directions to the thoughtful housekeeping staff  Really impeccable  Even the travel agency rep  based at the concierge area was most attentive and helpful in every way  
P => Superior experience Everything about my stay was excellent  starting with the staff  all of whom were caring  helpful  and efficient  to the decor  The location was great  Starbucks and ATM machine across the driveway        Chinese equivalent  and subway a block away  great shopping and restaurants within a       minute walk  The hotel amenities were all I could ask  and more  and the bed was sooo comfortable  in spite of being quite firm  I doubt I could have found a better hotel for my   day stay  though I probably could have paid a lot more    than I did  
P => Excellent Location Great Service Great Hotel My friend recommended this hotel to us when we plan for our first trip to Beijing  After reading through all the positive reviews  we decided to stay in this hotel for   days  This hotel is right around the corner of subway station and within walking distance to major attractions  Wangfujing  Tianamen Square  etc   Hotel staffs provided great service during our stay  Room is clean and spacious  Breakfast buffet is good with great selections  We highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again  
P => Love our stay  We  four of us including two kids aged    amp     had such a wonderful stay    nights  at the hotel  It was tucked right behind the big street Jingbao St  It was an oasis after a full day of tour and in the sun in Beijing Location   within    min walk to Wangfujing main street location  At first  I wasn t sure how close the hotel was which was our main concern  In the end  the location worked out perfectly  We will walk to Wangfujing to eat  all types of meals available   souvenirs  hotel is also near a small inconvenient store to get water and popsicles ice cream  We had walked and taken cabs to Tianamen Square from the hotel  It depends on how of a walker you re   in the heat  Like other reviewers  you do need to have the address in English and in Chinese  print from the hotel website  if you take the cab as not all cab drivers seem to know where it is by the name alone  The hotel is also right behind the subway  At the last few days  we finally had a good sense of the city and started taking subway    RMB anywhere you go   We also took it to Summer Palace per suggestion of another person staying at the hotel  Rooms   we upgraded to a suite with club level privileges  It gave us access to the Club Room for Happy Hour and breakfast  good spread of breakfast  appetizers and drinks including alcoholic beverages   The breakfast was not as extensive as the one in the restaurant but we enjoyed it a lot  Our hotel room came with breakfast for   everyday  Our family took turns going to the restaurant for breakfast while the other   went to the club level  The club level also has two desk top computers  The service was very attentive  Great coffee at the club level  The suite is very comfortable for four of us  Very clean  Good view of Hutong  The sofa in the living is a sleeper  Service   the staff showed us three rooms when we arrived  We then decided to choose the suite  Since we re staying for   nights  there was a promotion that gave us great deals  Staff don t all speak English very well  but most of them speak good enough  Great value  attentive service  Value   great value for the room type  location and service  We never ate at the hotel except for the complimentary breakfast as there were many more options outside the hotel with great pricing  Will definitely go back to the hotel when we return to Beijing  
P => Very good four star hotel This hotel is in a great location as the previous reviewer has already stated    minute walk from the shopping street  Wangfujing  I found the food to be of a good standard and the service excellent  All the staff acknowledge you as you enter  I did not get the chance to use the subway and only used taxis  which I found to be both reliable and cheap  If I was coming on holiday I would choose this hotel again  
P => Pleasant haven convenient to sights Business hotel was very modern  clean  and comfortable  The English speaking staff were helpful  The breakfast buffet was varied  filling  and delicious  A subway stop is just a few seconds walk from the hotel and can take you to most of the sights  The subway has signs in English and is easy to navigate  Use the subway instead of taxis because the traffic is bad  The hotel is also a    minute walk from the shopping street  Wangfujing  A Starbucks is right out the hotel door across the plaza  The dinner menu was somewhat limited but there are many restaurants within walking distance  
P => Excellent value  We came from Toronto  Canada  We have been travelling quite a lot in these few years  This hotel was recommended by my brother  After we saw the good ratings in this site  we decided to stay in this hotel for   days while we are staying in Beijing  This hotel is very clean  the staff are friendly and helpful  the service is excellent  buffet breakfast are the best with so many varieties and delicious food provided  subway is around the corner and you can travel to many attractions by using the subway  One more thing to mention was their arranged tour service is very good  Our tour was to the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall and we visited the Ming tomb on our way there  The driver we had drove very carefully and the english speaking guide was good  My family enjoyed the tour very much  
P => Great hotel but geared toward business people Rooms were nice  but oriented toward business travelers  While the hotel is located in the  Rodeo Drive  of Beijing  there is little to do in this area at night  Staff was excellent  particularly at the Bloo Dining Restaurant  which was a great place for westerners to eat  we ate there every night for   nights in addition to the breakfast buffet   The club level is nice and serves almost as nice a breakfast and such as the downstairs restaurant  Good business center  but VERY limited gym  
P => Excellent value for money  impressive hospitality Impressive   Impressive   Impressive       On a business trip to China  our stay at Park Plaza Wangfujing Beijing was booked by our travel agent  The moment one gets down from the cab at the gate of the hotel  one is greeted by smiles from the courteous staff of Park Plaza  And after spending   nights at this hotel  one gets to know that this is in the DNA of Park plaza staff  Right from the staff at the reception to the bell boy to the laundry boy to the housekeeping boy  they would greet you cheerfully  Also  after roaming around in Beijing for   days  we realised this was one of the most centrally located hotels from all the popular tourist places  And with excellent concierge service  we had absolutely no problem in getting wherever we want to  And one also got impressed by english speaking staff  most of them   And coming to the money paid for room    I would only say this is the best value for money one can get in any part of the globe       All in all  I would look forward to another hotel in any part of the world which would offer all these and comes close to Park Plaza Beijing  Cheers to the hotel   
P => Great stay centrally located hotel We stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing  deluxe room  for   nights in        We chose the hotel based on the high ranking on tripadvisor  location  and price  On the hotel website  we found a discounted rate for   night minimum stays  We were not disappointed with the quality or value  The location was great   on the Dengshikou subway stop  one stop north of Dongdan   It s a short subway ride to Tiananmen square Forbidden City  Lama Temple  Temple of Heaven  and Pearl ket  The room was perfect   spacious  clean  and modern  Beds were firm and comfortable  The bath was large and pretty  Air conditioning worked well and room was quiet  The hotel provided   complimentary bottles of water each day  Service  front desk  bell hops  cleaning  was friendly and timely  Bell hops hailed cabs and gave instructions to drivers in Chinese  The concierge was super friendly and eager to please  She also spoke English very well  She booked tickets for us to the Shoalin Monks at the Red Theater  Acrobatics at Chaoyang theater  the Opera at Huguang Guildhall  and a Hutong tour by pedicab  Ask for a brochure for  sunny vacations  which outlines the activities the concierge can book for you  We recommend the Hutong tour by pedicab which was very interesting and includes the Bell Tower  We suggest skipping the Opera at Huguang Guildhall  a more exciting evening may be had at the Opera at Chang an Grand Theater   The concierge also booked us a car and driver for the day to take us to the Great Wall  We choose to go to Mutainyu  takes about two hours in rush hour to get there from the hotel   Few tourists on a weekday  wonderful views  Inquire about this in advance to allow for booking  The concierge and the bell hops can recommend restaurants  We enjoyed their recommendations for South Beauty  Sichuan  in Oriental Plaza  and a local place directly across from the Peninsula Hotel  street number may be       We did not purchase the daily breakfast in the hotel  opting instead for the Pheonix Bakery on the opposite side of Dong Si Nan Dajie from the hotel  We did eat at the hotel restaurant   Oodles   one night  It was good  The hotel is a short walk from Wangfujing pedestrian street  the restaurants in the Peninsula Hotel  and the Oriental Plaza  Take business cards with the hotel name on it when using taxi cabs  The hotel can not be seen from Jinbao Street  so  if a taxi is unsure of the hotel s location  ask to be taken to the Peninsula or the Legendale hotels which are nearby  When we first arrived in Beijing  we took the airport train which connected to the subway  It cost nearly the same as our taxi ride from the hotel back to the airport upon our departure  Overall  a great place to stay  We would stay here again  
P => Harrassed by hotel staff I agree with all the positive reviews about this hotel  I just returned from a   night stay and I only had three negative issues  My hotel room was on the Jinbao St  side and each morning at      am I was awoken by noise from the street below  Apparently construction trucks use the street to transfer materials from one truck to another truck and it is quite disruptive  Also  I was called at least once or twice a day by the staff to see how I was feeling  They seemed obsessed with the idea  for no obvious reason  that I may have the swine flu  One day I went out and accidently left my  quot Do Not Disturb quot  light on all day  Three staff members came and knocked on my door  the light was still on after I returned  and started grilling me about my health  The reason I felt particularly harrassed and singled out was because I was traveling with two colleagues who were never called once  I also went to Shanghai and Nanjing and none of the staff ever questioned me at those hotels  Lastly  the fitness center was not air conditioned and it was extremely hot outside so it was hard to work out  I would have complained but there was not one at the desk in the fitness center while I was there  
P => Good hotel good location nice staff Good room and bathroom  Great breakfast and the staff was very nice  It s a typical western style hotel  
P => Wonderful well located spotless quiet friendly hotel We have just completed a three night stay at the Park Plaza  We have nothing but good things to say about the hotel  It is very well located  within walking distance of many sights and it is about two minutes away from the subway  The subway is easy to use and only costs  RMB  Taxis are very cheap but can get caught in traffic  The breakfast at the hotel is as good as you can get  The only one little complaint is that the coffee could be improved upon and could be hotter  All staff are very friendly and helpful We will stay here again the next time we return to Beijing  
P => Good location Hotel not so great This was our first experience of a Chinese hotel and I was disappointed  We had upgrated to the Club floor and really felt that the staff on this floor could have smiled a bit more  they were okay at check in but the lack of English probably did not help  Being on the Club floor you get complimentary tea coffee throughout the day and in the evenings drinks and canapes are free also  The drinks and canapes are done on a self service basis and I felt this was where the hotel let itself down  I have stayed in several hotels where I have stayed on Club floors  Singapore and Thailand and have always felt that the staff were very helpful but alas this was not the case  I served myself a gin and tonic and when I asked for some lemon I was looked at like I was from out of space  The food selection was also very poor The door men and girls at the down stairs bar were very friendly and smiled alot but the girls on this floor really looked quite miserable We had breakfast in the cafe and this was nothing out of the ordinary  we also had a meal in the same restaurant one evening and again was very disappointed We ate one night at the Regent Cafe  this was by far a better restaurant for a similar price and the view was good too  This hotel is good for location but if I go back to Beijing I won t be staying at this hotel again  
P => The Park Plaza Hotel was a mjaor factor in making our trip to Beijing memorable  The service at the hotel was exceptional  We received an outstanding welcome at check in including a surprise welcome package  We were celebrating our   th wedding anniversary and the hotel provided rose petals on the bed  wine  a fruit platter  and a delicious chocolate cake along with a special note from the mamager  The geat service continued throughout our stay  The concierge service and the hotel doormen were always efficient  helpful and welcoming  We were delighted to see that the room was just like the website listing  The location was close to attractions  shopping  and dining options  We were extremely happy with our hotel selection and highly recommend the hotel for travelers  
P => Excellent Location and Superb Service  Top Notch    Walking distance to Tianamen square  forbidden city and a ton of shopping  Everyone was very helpful and spoke good english  Concierge wrote out in chinese everywhere we wanted to go and advised the cab drivers for us  Cabs are so cheap so we didn t use public transport at all  Nothing cost more than   CNY  approx   US   with most around   CNY    US   Our rate included the tour of the great wall and ming tombs  Excellent tour  Breakfast was also included and there was a good selection of chinese and western foods  The airport lost our luggage on arrival and the front desk and concierge followed up with the airline multiple times to help us  I would highly reccommend this hotel  Excellent service  breakfast and rooms were modern  clean and very comfortable  
P => Best Value for Money Excellent value for money hotel  For what we were paying I was worried but were beyond pleasently surprised  We stayed in a Deluxe Room for   days over Christmas  it was bitterly cold outside   but a beautiful comfortable temperature inside Breakdast was included in the rate and was excellent  and although the choice is endless outside the hotel   this was a great start to each morning  Loved the free internet such a rareity in even the best hotels Excellent location  very cheap tasty food just a short walk away  we travelled everywhere else by the subway station  just outside the back door The subway is an excellent choice  but I must mention that the main reason we started to use it is that not a single taxi driver knew where this place was despite us having the address in chinese  I would recommend getting a card from the Peninsula which is in front of this hotel Only downside  the cost of drinks at the bar were the highest anywhere we travelled in China however it is a very comfortable place to have a drink  One thing though I noticed EVERYWHERE in China  the wait staff stare at you the entire time  for an Australian this is a little off putting but I do realise they are trying to give the best service possible Things to note Massage Place opposite subvway station out the side door of this hotel was the BEST I have ever had   these are vision impaired persons especially trained in massageRestaurants also near side door   the noodle place in the middle was great  watch the green chillis though  ouchUse the subway   it is easier than Taxis 
P => Fantastic hotel   great location and service With all the options available in Beijing  we had a difficult time choosing a hotel  But back from our    day trip  I believe this was the best choice  Our stay was the best we have ever had in any hotel in all of our travels although it did cost more than we usually would pay  We wanted a safe and comfortable place to go back to each night after the crowds and noise in the city We had a suite which was double the size of a normal room as it had a separate living area  The shower as mentioned in an earlier review was great  Being in a suite also gave us free internet access in the business centre on the top floor  We had breakfast every day in the business centre lounge  where although there were limited options compared to the main breakfast buffet located on the  nd floor  it was peaceful and quiet each morning The hotel staff are all nice and friendly especially the concierge and the doormen  They were always helpful and very polite When my husband fell sick on one of the days  one of the guys from the concierge  Gao  even accompanied us to a nearby hospital for him to see a doctor  ordered porridge for his dinner  requested extra bottled water for us and constantly checked up on him to see how he was feeling  The location of the hotel is also very good  It is just around a corner from the subway and a short walk to WangFujing street  We did not have any problems in getting taxi drivers to find it as well  Just tell them it is behind the Regent hotel and they will usually be able to get close enough for you to direct them if they are not aware of it Just opposite the subway entrance is a convenience store  there is Starbucks just opposite the hotel entrance and ATMs are located in lobby of the building where Starbucks is  Jinbao Tower  Close to the end of the trip  we realised that the hotel noodle bar had great Japanese rice and noodles at reasonable prices  We would have eaten there more often if we realised it earlier We would definitely stay here again when we next visit Beijing  In fact we almost would go to Beijing just to stay there again  
P => Nice Hotel in Upscale Location The hotel was not luxurious  as is the Regent next door or the Peninsula down the street  However  the room and bathroom were large and attractive  the beds comfortable  the closet large enough for quite a few clothes  and the service at the concierge desk very polite  They arranged for a guide and driver for us for   days  and the employee who did it even came to our room for    minutes to get it all written down and explained to us  This was a first in our experience with concierge desk personnel As far as I am concerned  the two best things were the location in a very upscale area of the city  the sister hotel Regent which is physically connected sells Lamborghinis and Rolls Royces on the ground floor   and the wonderful buffet breakfast  One could eat American  European  Chinese  or Japanese food   or try them all  as I did by the time I left  We ate   dinner in the hotel  one at the Regent cafe  and two at the Peninsula  I preferred the Regent Cafe  The view looking out at the lighted buildings was interesting  The Peking duck at the Chinese restaurant at the Peninsula was a disappointment  I guess I expected too much  It is definitely worth going there to see the lobby and the   floors of designer shops below  All gorgeous  I thought that we had a reasonable price at the Park Plaza until I met an American couple after we left Beijing who stayed at the Peninsula during same   days for a lot less than we paid  It pays to really shop around  evidently  for the special promotions late in the game Beware of the  quot Hello quot  people who will befriend you in order to lure you to an  quot art exhibit quot   Just realize that they want to lead you away to an out of the way building to purchase art for a high price  They are devious  It is fun to talk to them  but know what their purpose really is when they tell you that they are students  
P => Superb comfort      satisfaction We ahve just returned from a   day trip to Beijing to visit our son  We were initially overwhelmed by the choice of hotels available and must have read hundreds of reviews   thank you  quot Trip Advisor quot   We knew we wanted a really good western style hotel for comfort after a long day tramping the busy streets of Beijing  We chose the Park Plaza Wangfujing and were delighted It was quite expensive but we could have paid a great deal more at other hotels   equally we could have gone a lot cheaper  but you get what you pay for  We had a superior room   good views  well appointed  very clean and comfortable and a really smashing bathroom with good sized bath and very powerful shower The staff were lovely   a couple admitted to being nervous when they have to speak English which could account for other reviewers comments that they were not always very friendly  Our son speaks fluent Chinese so gleaned this information for us  We found all the staff delightful especially the young men on the door Taxis appeared from nowhere the minute you needed one and altogether our stay here was fantastic  Our only negative comment would be about the bar which was pretty expensive compared to bars in the city but it was very comforable and service was superb We paid the extra    RMB per day for both of us to have breakfast   about    GBP per person  and it was worth every penny  Yes  you can eat very cheaply outside the hotel but the choice at breakfast was excellent and it really set us up for the day  Didn  t need to eat again until the evening We will definitely stay at the Park Plaza Wangfujing again  Taxis are very cheap but the subway station is just around the corner    minute walk  and as the fares are just  RMB per journey    p   getting around is no problem  It is very conveniently placed anyway for many of the tourist sites  
P => Nice hotel and excellent value Agree with the many positive reviews already written  The combination of new  quality rooms and furnishings  helpful staff and location offered at very reasonable prices was satisfying  A few observations   Standard room seemed a bit small    we had small children and upgraded to a suite  which was very comfortable  essentially the size of   rooms but cost was much less than double    Rooms  bathrooms  furnishings were all new and high quality and very comfortable  Only item is that the temperature control in the room did not work very well   Breakfast buffet is convenient although if plan to use it consistently better get it as part of your room rate when you book than paying a la carte  Starbucks just across the street or if you are adventurous can go find a Chinese breakfast    No cab driver seemed to know where this place is so if you do not speak Chinese it is best to carry the Chinese address of the hotel  doorman will give you a card when you leave  and if taking a cab from the airport will need to find a way provide address    Well located  Although nothing very exciting in the immediate vicinity  unless you d like to purchase a Ferarri  Rolls Royce  etc  at the dealers a block away   Tiananmen square and the shopping areas of Wangfujing are not too far away  
P => Fantastic value    super location We came to this hotel because of its ranking on tripadvisor  It is not disappoint us in the least  The hotel is really more   star  but doesn t have the pools  big spa  etc  Although some in our group did the spa thing and said it was great  The plusses  Great central location    can walk to Tiananmen in about    minutes  The breakfast is included in rate and huge  ala Asia  buffet    very good service  Coffee is lousy  but Starbucks is a    second walk across the entry  The staff was extremely helpful in arranging our   days of touring  and very flexible with all our extra requests  The minuses  Somehow we were there for a couple nights when they said the aircon wasn t working in Beijing    something related to the changeover from heat to cooling  I ve heard this from others  but still don t understand how all of Beijing could be told  no AC for a week   Anyway  we survived it  and the staff was gracious and helpful as they could be  The rooms size wise are normal  but a shade on the small side  If you are a guy  and wanting to walk outside the hotel at night to Tiananmen down the walking street  be prepared for the female onslaught  No kidding    propositioned at least       times in    minutes  And  this was right in front of   star hotels  and high end shopping areas  We highly recommend this hotel    especially for the value  It far far exceeded our expectation  especially for the price we paid  Stay here  
P => Good vlaue well located hotel I agree with all other reviewers that the hotel is well located for the top tourist attrations  is very god value is very well maintained and clean  the rooms are excellent with all conveniences including free movies and free water  They also have a range of electric sockets in the rooms including European  US and British   a very useful addition  The concierge staff are very helpful and the lobby is loaded with free magazines inclduing three or four with current listings of what is going on around Beijing  Nearby restaurants we visited included Made in China in the Grand Hyatt which was very good although they gave us a bad table near a draughty window and Lei Garden which is right beside the hotel on the third floor of Jinbao Towers which was very ok   at least our food was generally very bland  The find of our stay was a local restaurant behind the food stalls just off Wangfunding St  We ate a fabulous meal here for about     of the cost of other restaurants  Unfortaunately everything was in Chinese including the restaurant s name but it was beside a hotel beginning with W and there were fake trees in the middle of the resaurant  The Eggplant with Chili was brilliant  My quibbles with the hotel were small   we had booked two rooms with kingsized beds but were told only twins available altho advised we could change the following day   the twins out to be larger than normal singles so we didn t bother changing  the coffee for breakfast was very poor as was the french toast but all else was very good for the price paid  and  finally  I wanted to charge extras on my credit card in Yuan and not Euro but was not offered the choice despite having to sign a form that said I was  Overall  however  these are pernickity points and Park Plaza is a very good choice of hotel and I highly recommend it  Another restaurant visited I highly recommend  though not within walking distance  is Nuage   a Vietnamese restaurant in the lakeside Bar district  
P => Nice hotel and location  I d stay here again  I booked the Park Plaza Wangfujing hotel for five nights in ober       which I got a discount using my government ID  Check in was fast and we were upgraded to an executive room with the club benefits  These benefits included breakfast  cocktails in the evening and use of the computers  there were two   Our room         was quite nice with two double beds  desk  tv   decent sized bathroom  chair and coffee table  and amenities  slippers  robe  and   bottles of water daily   The service was great at the Plaza  Every employee we encountered was friendly and always with a smile  The location of the hotel is great  A subway station is located next to the hotel and the Wangfujing night market is only a    minute walk away  Breakfast was just  ok    not enough of Chinese foods and they always put out American sausages  Got tired of that  In the evenings wine and hard liquor available  but we enjoyed the white wine  Most evenings we would have a drink or two while I got on the computer  followed by dinner out  One night the power was out in the lounge  so I asked if we could get some wine for our room  which they delivered promptly  The taxi driver had a hard time finding the place  but fortunately  I had the directions and helped him find it  I would gladly stay here again for the comfort  service  and location  
P => Awesome little hotel great location at a good price This little hotel is nestled behind the enormous Regent Hotel  which is also highly rated on TripAdvisor  with a Ferrari  Rolls Royce dealerships a few steps from the hotel  So this is definitely the fanciest part of Beijing and it s only about a mile away from Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City  We stayed here for five nights and the overall services were outstanding  all the way from the door person  front desk clerks  to the bell boys  They always had a smile on and greeted us with a friendly face whenever we go in and out  Very easy to get around from this hotel  plenty of taxis waiting in front of the hotel  There are only   small restaurants on premise and the small Japanese noodle restaurant on the first floor keeps running out of food  no worries though  there are a few Chinese restaurants that weren t too bad right next to the hotel  but if you want western fares  you will only have to walk a few minutes down the major road right in front of the Regent hotel  which is right in front of Park Plaza   
P => Nice hotel Great location My stay with the hotel is in early ch      Location  The hotel is behind Regent Hotel  Most of the taxi driver doesn t where exactly the hotel is although they know the road name and the area  You can t see the hotel from the main road  So if you see Regent Hotel  it s just at the back of it  The hotel basically located along the road leading to Wangfujing pedestrian mall     minutes walk  and along the way  you will see Peninsula Hotel  otel Peace  Lee Garden  There are restaurants nearby but unless you are only into western  Hotel ambience  Since the hotel is located off the main road  it s pretty quiet  The hotel lobby is quite small compared to its sister hotel  Regent but it s good for me  cozy  The coffee house is located on the  nd floor Room  I booked a superior room with breakfast and the room size is just nice for me  No flat screen TV though but it s ok  comfortable and cozy  There is no view though coz the room is facing Jinbao Office tower  There is a working table with complimentary internet access which is a plus point  Bed is comfortable and room temperature is good  Not too hot and not too cold   It s about  C outside   
P => Modern clean convenient w good prices Hotel rooms are large  nicely decorated  and quiet  with a nice bathroom and large bathtub shower  Great restaurant on  nd floor serves both Chinese and American food  including wonderful rice and chicken broth  a lifesaver since we both got food poisoning from Starbucks   Friends also stayed here on a previous trip and highly recommend it Good location  read the other reviews  hotel is located behind the Regency which is on a main street  and their bellman can tell your taxi driver how to go around the block to the Park Plaza driveway   Other reviews said guests were upgraded to the Regency  but when we asked they said it was full  Superior Rooms and Deluxe Rooms are exactly the same  except Superior are on floors     and Deluxe are on floors      We paid         more per night for the same exact room  which was just one floor higher  No difference in view  quality  or location for the higher price    Positives  I was very happy with the rooms and hotel in general  nice  clean  new  and a in a good location  with a good onsite restaurant and bar  Hotel is adjacent to a subway stop which links directly to the Pearl ket  amp  is close to the Temple of Heaven  Need   transfer to get to Tianamen Square and the Forbidden Palace  The subway was extremely easy to use  signs in Chinese  amp  English  with lighted route boards in each subway car  and sparkling clean  Negatives  there was somewhat of a language barrier  the front desk staff spoke little English beyond  quot you re in room X quot   Although the concierges were very nice  most weren t very helpful as they were inexperienced  didn t live in the area or weren t familiar with details  and couldn t provide much advice to the typical int l traveler  regarding major sites  hours  directions   Twice I was given the wrong dates times to the major sites  There s a Starbucks across the street  as well as a small store where you can buy soft drinks  The Italian restaurant in the Regency was also good if you re looking for Western food   Starbucks visitors beware  We ordered ham sandwiches from Starbucks for our day trip to the Great Wall  The sandwiches had lettuce and mayo on them  we were told they didn t   Despite packing them in ice  we became violently ill later that day after eating them for lunch  As a result  we drank ginger ale and ate chicken broth and rice for       days  The Park Plaza restaurant staff was amazing  and bent over backwards to accommodate our bland diets  When we told the Starbucks staff   days later about our food poisoning  they seemed indifferent  and even after contacting Starbucks corporate in the U S   I never received a reply  Don t be fooled  even a U S  restaurant doesn t have the standards of U S  stores  so I recommend ordering your  quot to go quot  orders from the Park Plaza hotel restaurant  which has been recognized for its high hygiene standards and food safety    Also bottled water in China is not necessarily purified  so be careful where and from whom you buy it I brought Cipro antibiotics with me in case of food poisoning  and it saved me from being sick for the entire trip Took the China Culture Center  recommended in Lonely Planet  pedicab tour of the traditional Chinese hutong neighborhood  which we really enjoyed  They also offer English speaking walking tours of major sites  as well as cooking and crafts classes that I d check out on my next trip  www chinaculturecenter org Over   days  we never saw the sun due to the extreme pollution  but all of the sights  Great Wall  Forbidden Palace  Summer Palace  and hutong  were amazing  P S  In any Asian country  I don t speak the language   I carry several business cards with the hotel address  which are printed in English and Chinese  Show the card to your cab driver  I always have spares in my pocket that I keep with me  
P => The best deal in Beijing In our opinion  one of the best and most reasonable upscale hotels in Beijing  The surrounding area is expensive with designer shops and boutiques at every corner  There is even a Starbuck s across from the lobby if you need a quick pick me up  The hotel staff is very friendly and courteous and the rooms are very clean and comfortable  We highly recommend it jrw richmond bc 
P => Will defiantly go back Great rooms  service and atmosphere  Very good value for money and my favourite hotel in Beijing so far  
P => Central yet quiet Park plaza is located along with more upscale hotels like the regent  grand hyatt and dynasty hotel the hotel itself isnt like other large chain hotel types because it offers that botique type of ambience where everything seems more personal  its centrally located but the hotel itself is soothing and quiet i love the park plazas door entrance  it automatically revolves around once you step around the area  the room and bathroom was on the small side but the fab interiors more than make up for it most of all  the staff of park plaza can speak english fairly well which was very helpful for a solo english traveller like me  the concierge was very helpful in making sure that my cab driver understood where i wanted to go  he helped me find a charger for my otherwise very old cellphone  i also got an urgent fax message which was immediately sent to my room even before i received a text from my family that theyve faxed it already park plaza was my parents choice of hotel and now its also my favorite  its not the cheapest hotel but they have an amazing staff and service couldnt have been better 
P => Beautiful hotel Hotel was lovely  beautiful big bathrooms and really good internet access  The rooms are exactly as you see them on the internet  All the staff were really friendly and very helpful   Only issue I had was that the food was alot more expensive than I realised  Breakfast is a buffet and isnt included in the room price and costs around    euro per person  
P => Top Notch I usually don t stay in large chain type hotels but I felt more comfortable staying in an American hotel for my first trip to China  I am so glad I did because this hotel is wonderful  It is conveniently located to Wangfujing  about a      easy walk  and felt very safe The staff could not have been better  They were always polite and went out of their way to help with decent English  The breakfast was huge with both American and Chinese items  Anything you could want for breakfast  they will have  The restuarant  Bloo Dining  I have to say is not very good and overpriced  For a luxury meal at reasonable US prices  around     for two   try Huang Ting in the basement of the Peninsula Hotel right down the street  I also tried Jing in the Peninsula hotel which was a little more expensive  It was very good but not great for the price  The rooms were very large and luxurious with spotless bathrooms For my first trip to Beijing  I felt more comfortable using a guide to get around  I do not like company tours where you re shuttled around with    other strangers and you never get to do exactly what you want to do  So I hired a personal guide  chineseqing  who was absolutely wonderful  We will do whatever you want to do or recommend thing you don t even know about  He has a wonderful knowledge of Chinese History and speaks great English  
P => Great hotel good location friendly staff We stayed in Beijing for   nights and booked Park Plaza Wangfujing due to it s price and rating on TripAdvisor  We paid about    USD per night and for a hotel of this quality  felt it was a great bargain This hotel is located about       minutes from the airport  depending on traffic  On average  our taxi rates were in the   RMBs  The hotel is located behind the Regent Hotel and the Jinbao Tower  so sometimes saying the Regent Hotel will help since some drivers didn t know where PPW was PPW is about a    minute walk from busy Wangfujing Street  which is full of malls and department stores with food courts that are reasonably priced and clean  There is a big variety of food to choose from and they are opened  til about   PM The hotel staff was friendly and spoke enough English  we speak Mandarin so did not test out their English skills as much but saw that they communicated with foreign guests with no problem   The concierge is very helpful and always tries to ensure that you have a safe journey in the taxis they hail for you The room is spacious and all amenities are given  toothbrush  toothpaste  sewing kit and the usuals   Note though  there are not many selections in TV channels  again  we understand the language so it wasn t a problem for us but it may be for some guests  There is WiFi available  but only in the lobby  I was not able to connect on my iPhone in my room but could downstairs PPW is located in a high end area  there is a Lamborghini dealership next door and plenty of big shops  a Gucci store was opening up across the street in the near future   There is a Starbucks and some restaurants in the immediate area  but we did not try any of them We would definitely come back to this hotel again  
P => Excellent stay loved it Stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing and just loved the hotel  The breakfast buffet was a bit too steep   approximately     per head  A lot of reasonably priced restaurants close by and the concierge was excellent in recommending places to eat  Tour service at the counter itself  very convenient  
P => Great value clean nice place to stay  Great location  close to subway which makes it easy to get around  Starbucks across the street for a quick cup of coffee then off to sightsee  We ate at several restaurants that were within walking distance which were fun friendly and great price food  Staff spoke english well enough to give directions  They were honest and made sure the taxi s were safe and fair that they called for us My husband stays in hotels     of the year and thought that it wasn t the best hotel in beijing but it was clean and good value for price  More like a three star  but they try In good location of the city  
P => Really good hotel  We stayed   nights in ember  including Christmas  The Park Plaza was great  We took the offered upgrade to executive room which not only included breakfast  excellent  but also access to the executive lounge  OK  with its   hour happy hour of free drinks and nibbles every evening  wonderful   Very good value for the money  A very comfortable room Park Plaza is well located  but not well known by taxi drivers  they can get to the locality  make sure you have the address in Chinese   and we soon learned how to find the actual hotel for them  As everyone says  the hotel staff are great Someone said it s  within walking distance  of the Forbidden City  which is true   if you are relatively young  and the weather is clement  For us pensioners on a bitter ember day  we wished we had taken a taxi  But it is within easy walking distance of the Peninsula hotel  where we had excellent Beijing duck for Christmas dinner in their lovely Chinese restaurant  
P => Best hotel in Beijing  Simply the best hotel in Beijing  been in quite a few   its main advantages are quite reasonable prices  extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff  very nice rooms  had executive suite   very nice   quietness  super efficient housekeeping twice a day    Will stay there again  definitely  
P => excellent hotel   three thumbs up   this hotel is very new and has modern decor  the rooms are spacious and very clean   the staff are curtious and spoke very good english the rooms are very quiet  although a little bit hard to find  it is behind the Regency hotel  
P => Convenient location     star quality The rooms  service including food  and all amenities such as gym and internet were what you would expect of the Plaza franchise  We were there before the Olympics so the room rates were only      night but were due to skyrocket later for a    star hotel  Very clean with new fittings  Lots of tv channels but could use more english ones  good study area but have to pay for internet service in room Food in restaurant was good as was the general hotel staff  
P => good value hotel service people need to think more The hotel is centrally localized  and a great value for the cost  The room was very nice  clean and quiet  The bathroom is high quality and functional  The internet is free  My only complain is after I came back from the trip  They charged me twice for the stay  I booked the hotel through Orbitz and prepaid  I even gave them a copy of my voucher showing that I have paid  The manager on duty seemed to have understood it fine  However  the other front desk people obviously most function as flower vases  When we checked in  the manager was instructing everyone to get him this and that  When we checked out  unfortunately  the manager was not on duty  The staff were left to themselves  and the lack of brain showed  The credit card was only supposed to be for incidentals  However  they charged the room on it without our approval and without any reciepts  of course   This happened after we left the hotel  Of course we could fight the charge off through the credit card  But what a waste of time and energy  If they only train their staff better or use someone with a brain  
P => Wonderful Experience This is an excellent hotel and deserves the high ratings of this website  It s a solid   star hotel  but priced more competitively  The Park Plaza has a great location within walking distance of the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Sq  A Starbucks is located right outside the front door  so you can grab a quick  cheap breakfast before you start the day  Their sister   star Regent hotel is connected via a short walkway  which has more upscale bars and restaurants  The Park Plaza is located behind the Regent and another office building  so it s not on the street  This means that the rooms are quiet  However  it might be hard for a taxi driver to find  I recommend that you take the hotel s card from the bellman before you head out for the day  Rooms were newly furnished and well appointed  Bed was extremely comfortable  The restaurants  I tried the Western and Japanese  were excellent and reasonably priced  Service was superb  All staff spoke English well  and eager to please  They really went out of their way to make sure that you didn t wait for anything  One of the most pleasurable hotels that I ve stayed at on vacation  Park Plaza is part of the Radisson Regent hotel chain  so you can earn use Goldpointsplus  Only drawback was at check out  Despite being shown a bill in the local currency  Chinese yuan  CNY  also called Renminbi  RMB   the hotel s credit card machine converted the amount into US dollars on the spot  without my consent  at an unfavorable rate   equal to about a    surcharge  Other charges in local currency to my credit card on the same day from other merchants resulted in a much better conversion rate  I was able to get the hotel to refund the surcharge  but it was a hassle  
P => Great Location  Would reccomend I just got back from being in China for a few weeks  I was in Beijing two different times and stayed at the Park Plaza both times  I called the Park Plaza directly in USA  and was given a great AAA rate  The staff were great  At the front door  Byron always greeted me and I was able to get a taxi without ever a wait  The front desk and concierge were just as nice  Everyone always greeted me whenever I was through the lobby  The front desk had ample people to help  Stephanie was great at the front desk  If I had any problems  she was right there  I believe she was from Sweeden  but spoke perfect english to help you  The room was decent sized and very clean  Free internet was a bonus for me  Two free bottles of water per day  The shower had great water pressure  The TV had your basic CNN  HBO and a couple of other english channels  Just enough for me at night to help fall asleep  The location was great  You can walk to one of the shopping areas  and about a five minute walk to the night food market  An interesting outdoor night market selling scorpions  crickets and other interesting things to eat  There is even a Starbucks outside the front door of the hotel  should you need your western style coffee fix  I think the price was good compared to US hotel pricees  and would highly recommend this hotel  
P => Great Stay My wife an I have just returned from a   night stay at the Park Plaza Wangfujing and thouroughly enjoyed our visit  Our room was spacious clean and comfortable and it s   th floor location gave us a nice view of the sun breaking through the fog over the city each morning As has been mentioned in previous reviews the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and we didn t find any problems communicating in English  which is just as well because my chinese is limited to  quot hello quot  and  quot thank you quot  The hotel is in a great location  within walking distance of Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City  but taxi s are numerous and inexpensive  There are a number of restaurants nearby and  for the more adventurous  Wangfujing food market wher you can sample deep fried bugs  star fish  seahorse  sheeps penis and a variety of other retch worthy foodstuffs  We didn t eat breakfast at the hotel as our guide  Qing   who was fantastic by the way  had us up and out bright and early but Starbucks across the road is a good option to grab something for on the go  The room service menu had a fine selection of western and Chinese dishes and wasn t too expensive under the circumstances  This hotel made a trip to this exciting city very comfortable and I d definately recommend it 
P => Warning  Do not book this hotel  The InterContinental Financial Street Beijing hotel is far better than this hotel  I m baffled why the Park Plaza is higher up in the ratings  this is the first travel review I ve ever written and it s to make sure you make an informed choice  because I picked this hotel on the strength of it s ranking here and quite frankly  I was very disappointed  Everything in life is comparative of course  and the Park Plaza is actually an ok hotel   the staff are indeed lovely  but it just doesn t compare to the InterContinental Financial Street Beijing  The Park Plaza is slightly dated  has no pool and the decor   rooms are nowhere near as swish  And the breakfast not as good either  So if you re looking for luxury  good service and great food  try the InterContinental Financial Street Beijing hotel   you won t regret it    
P => You have to try it  We stayed in a  quot Plaza Club quot  room with afternoon  quot High Tea quot  included between      and      p m each day  be some tea was available  but we went for the drinks and delicatessen table where there was everything you could wish  On top of that  staff and standard of the entire hotel were out of the ordinary excellent at a very reasonable price A Svensson  Sweden 
P => Excellent I stayed here for four nights in mid ember       weather  sunny and cool cold  perfect   The Park Plaza Wangfujing is an excellent   star  stylish  modern and comfortable hotel in a very good location for sightseeing or business From here it is just ten minutes  easy walk to Tiananmen and the Forbidden City  I imagine that people who are accustomed to staying in five star hotels would feel at home here  Liveried doormen welcomed me on arrival  The staff throughout the hotel were always very helpful and attentive  especially in the restaurants and bar  They mostly speak quite good English  some were very good   There was often a line of people waiting for reception   they could have done with more staff  and a wider reception desk  at busy times On arrival I was upgraded to a very nice  spacious twin room  see photo   with marble bathroom  If it s important to you  it would be worth asking for a room with a nice view   mine faced an office block across the street  The room was decorated in cream and brown  with deep carpets and elegant wood finishing on the doors and in the corridors  giving a very stylish atmosphere There is free broadband Internet in the rooms  a good wide  deep desk for writing or working at your laptop  Wifi is available in the lobby and bar area  and if you need a printer  there is an Internet lounge on the top floor  with tea  coffee and snacks  which were free all day long with my room deal Two free bottles of drinking water are provided in your room each day  in China you shouldn t drink or brush your teeth with the tap water   The breakfast buffet is excellent  going beyond the usual range of morning fare and providing international dishes of several kinds I would most definitely recommend the Park Plaza Wangfujing Tips  Your taxi driver from the airport almost certainly will not be able to speak English  and may have problems reading a hotel map with English street names  I downloaded an English map from the hotel website  but this was not enough  Of course  the driver had no problem getting to the general area of Wangfujing  but then he had to stop and ask directions twice  The hotel  as with many other places  has a different name in Chinese  Download or get the hotel to email you a map of the hotel location with the street names written in Chinese  When you check in  the hotel will give you a  Driver  please take me to    card with the Chinese address on it  together with a series of popular tourist destinations written in Chinese  But even armed with that  you may have some problems finding places  Make sure that taxis you use have a working meter Be very careful when crossing wide streets  Driving standards are not high  and turning traffic in nearside lanes will not stop at red lights  When walking around the main tourist areas  beware of aggressive rickshaw drivers  people who strike up a conversation with you and then some time later  they are skilled at this  offer to take you somewhere  expensive tea tasting ceremonies where they get a commission  tours of the hutongs  so called art students exhibiting their work   and all manner of other scam artists Beijing is an amazing  exciting place  I will be back there as soon as I get the chance  I hope you have a wonderful time  
P => Great staff I stayed at the Park Plaza as part of a tour group  The stay was fantastic from start to finish  Every member of staff did absolutely everything possible to make us welcome  A big thank you to Bessie and her staff at The First Bar for their impeccable service each night  Rooms are of a very good standard with plenty of space and full kit of amenities in the bathroom  You can use the wired internet in your room or the wifi at the bar reception area  both are free  All in all I would definitely recommend the Park Plaza if you are travelling to Beijing  
P => Loved the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing My husband and I stayed at the Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing for   nights in mid ober at the beginning of a two week tour of China  I booked the hotel based on very positive reviews on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed  This was the best hotel we stayed at during our trip  I stayed in a superior room and it was spacious  clean  and nicely decorated  The bathroom was huge  The two bottles of complimentary water were appreciated as you can not drink tap water anywhere in China  There is a nice convenience store around the corner that sells bottled water for   RMB and IP phone cards  I bargained for    RMB down from     RMB   The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful  The concierge was able to arrange tickets to the Legend of Kung Fu and the China Acrobatic Troupe at Chaoyang Theatre  I also arranged for a driver to the Great Wall Mutianyu  through the concierge  for     RMB  The hotel has a wonderful location and is only a short commute to the major sites and in walking distance of the Forbidden City  I used taxis exclusively for travel and the bell boy was excellent at telling the taxi driver where we wanted to go  However  returning to the hotel was challenging  Several taxi drivers had to call for directions after getting us in the general area of the hotel  However  the overall benefits of the hotel far outweighed this inconvenience  I do advise having the hotel email you a map so that when you arrive at the airport the taxi driver will have the best shot at locating the hotel  But  don t be surprised if the taxi driver still has to call for directions as ours did  Our room rate included breakfast and the breakfast buffet was the best of any of the hotels we stayed at during our trip  The buffet offered both American and Asian cuisine and the dishes varied from day to day  The food was excellent  I also enjoyed having Starbucks just across the road a nice place to unwind at the end of a busy day of sightseeing  I am recommending this hotel to all my friends who are planning trips to Beijing I wanted to share a few tips from my experience touring in Beijing    I always flagged legitimate taxis and the drivers always used the meter  Only once did a taxi driver try to negotiate a price without using the meter and my husband and I just walked away and hailed another taxi passing on the street  There is absolutely no need to do business with black cabs with legitimate ones being readily available    Don t be suprised if taxi drivers have difficulty finding theatres  I was surprised that the drivers didn t know Beijing better than they did  However  I always got to the right place eventually    Although the Legend of Kung Fu was recommended to me by friends  the show was actually not worth the time or money  It was rather boring and my husband and I were relieved when it was over    I tried very hard to get tickets to the Beijing Acrobatics Troupe at Wansheng Theatre  but was unable to secure tickets through my travel agency outside China or through the hotel concierge  As this theatre reportedly has the best acrobatic show  I was puzzled as to how no one seemed to know anything about the show  The concierge was able to get tickets to Chaoyang Theatre and I felt the performance was satisfactory    The Great Wall Mutianyu was the highlight of our Beijing trip  I followed recommendations made by other Tripadvisor reviewers and arrived at approximately      a m   I left the hotel at      a m    I strongly recommend taking the cable car up and then walking left on the Great Wall first  This  in my opinion  was the most impressive portion of the Great Wall  If you walk it first thing in the morning you will have it mostly to yourself  Most tourists take the chair lift up and start walking the Great Wall from the far right end making this section crowded and more touristy  Also  if you start walking at the extreme right end of the wall you won t likely have the energy to walk to the far left end of the Great Wall  The hike can get very steep at times and my husband and I were surprised at how tiring it was after   hours of hiking  However  if you start at the cable car and walk left to the end where it is blocked off and then walk right and end at the chair lift and toboggan entrance  it is a very pleasant     to   hour hike without the tourist crowds to contend with  Most tour groups only hike from the chair lift and then go down on the cable car  My husband and I took the toboggan down and that was a fun end to our Great Wall experience    The Olympic venues were open for touring during our stay in mid ober  For    RMB person you can visit the Bird s Nest  I believe it opened for touring at      a m  and closed at      p m  It was beautiful to visit at around      p m  so it could be seen both during daylight and lit up at night  The Water Cube is also open for touring  but I missed touring it as it closed earlier at      p m    The best people watching areas in Beijing are the parks  I loved visiting Bei Hai Park and Temple of Heaven Park  It was great fun to see the locals ballroom dancing under the trees and to watch     people spontaneously gather for a sing along     Beware of rickshaw drivers in and near the Hutong  My husband and I just wanted to walk this area on foot  but it was frustrating to have to deal with verbally abusive rickshaw drivers every few feet  I was surprised that the drivers thought their bullying would actually result in a fare  All it made me want to do was get away from them as quickly as possible  A final note of the Hutong skip Prince Gong s Mansion it is highly overrated and just crawling with Chinese tourists it is hard to even move around the grounds and the Mansion is no longer offering the mini Chinese Opera performance The   days we had in Beijing were some of the best of our entire trip in no small part because of the wonderful hotel and staff  This hotel is a great find  
P => Excellent Staff A friend and I stayed at the Park Plaza Wangfujing in Beijing and had a great experience  The location was very close to a subway stop  the Wanfujing Shopping Area and about    minute walk to Tian namen Square  The hotel is new and nice  Breakfast was included with plenty of Asian and Western options  The guys at the concierge desk were helpful  professional and nice to talk to  It was my first time in Beijing and they got us a private driver for a day trip to the Great Wall and recommended a great local restaurant  best food we had during the trip  And thanks to Hong  I brought home some really great new CDs of popular Chinese music  
P => Other reviews are spot on Earlier reviews of the Park Plaza were spot on and led us to that hotel  Friendly employees  nice and well appointed rooms  very clean and excellent location A few hints may be helpful to others     When I made reservations for   rooms the only rate available was the full one  I checked a couple weeks later and they had a AAA rate that was about     night less  So I cancelled the first reservation and made a new one at the AAA rate     Be aware that they add a     surcharge to everything   room  bar and dining room     If breakfast is not included in your rate  the Starbucks just a few feet away  is a good alternative     Email the hotel and they will send you a map in Chinese that you can give the taxi driver at the airport to help him find the hotel  The taxi cost is about     yaun  
P => Good hotel in good location I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of my recent trip to Beijing  I used membership points partially toward the stay so my actual cost was about     the usual rate Upon checkin I was upgraded to a club level room  a nice touch   though I was not given access to the club features on the floor  The room was good sized and clean English at this hotel was serviceable  both at the front desk and at the concierge  In China the concierges typically speak pretty limited English so that was a nice plus I would say the real highlight of this hotel is the location though  It is around the corner from the very easy to use Beijing subway and is very close to the night market  One note  I printed out a map of the location from the hotel s website  with Chinese street names  before I flew in so I could show it to the taxi driver at the airport  Unfortunately the font on the image was very small and the driver could not read it  So make sure you print it large otherwise you ll be driving around downtown Beijing for a while if you re not lucky  
P => Perfect Hotel My family  wife    kids aged        and   and myself  spent a week at this hotel earlier this month        This was the start of a China and Southeast Asia trip  We booked directly  based on tripadvisor reviews After a    hour journey Via Singapore we were really tired and wanted a quick check in and a soft bed  we got both plus much more The entire hotel is in great condition probably for the olympics  It is situated slightly off Jinbao and is seconds away from both the Regent and Peninsula hotels as well as other   star hotels  We were given two rooms interconnecting one with three single beds the other a king  the rate included breakfast which is good when travelling with kids  The rooms are absolutely perfect and we loved the feather pillows  Unfortunately we could hear our neighbours opening cupboards etc which was a little annoying early in the morning All in all the best hotel we stayed at in China rdifficult to fault  and we would not hesitate to return  Finally I mentioned to the hotel that the trip was to celebrate my wifes birthday  they sent magnificent flowers and fruit as well as a very sweet card up for our arrival Breifly to sum upPROS Really comfortable bedsAll the extras you could want  iron and board  fridge  free bottles of water etc etc Room very clean and new looking Great location close to Wangfujing easy walk  and really close to Dengshikou MRT    minutes if you go the right way  just ask the doorman Adequate breakfastWell appointed furnishings Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff Turndown CONS Only one unfortunately you can hear the people in the next room opening cupboards and drawers  This could have been just this room or those specific neighbours as I have not read any reviews mentioning this  Do yourself a favour and stay in this hotel you will not regret it  
P => loved the park plaza beijing The Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujing was the highlight of our two week trip to China  Our room was beautiful  the hotel staff always made us feel special and they did everything they could to help us  the breakfasts were fantastic  and the happy hour nightly  actually two hours because it ran from             pm  were so much fun that we seldom went out for dinner after that  They served appetizers  fruit  desserts  and drinks free of charge  The hotel also offered free internet and free tea or coffee  including fancy coffees  all day long  The concierge was most helpful  as were all the young men who worked at the hotel front  
P => Great hotel   super location   look no further  I recently stayed at this hotel for nights while in Beijing  Great hotel choice  Very courteous service and very helpful  The rooms are a good size equipped with little extras like robes  slippers  complimentary water daily  many English TV channels and great water pressure  The hotel also helped to organized tours and tickets   very helpful  The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable  I have recommended this hotel to friends that are going to Beijing in a few months  I would definitely stay here again  There is a subway station around the corner too  
P => Lovely Beijing Hotel We recently stayed at the Park Plaza for four nights while in Beijing  The rooms were lovely and well kept  the staff was extremely courteous and helpful and the food was adequate but not exciting  I would suggest that folks consider skipping the breakfast option as they have a limited selection and you ll probably want to venture out into Beijing where the food is much cheaper once you leave the hotel Aside from the stylish and comfortable room and the free internet  although not wi fi   the biggest plus of this hotel is definitely the location directly beside the subway  We took the subway everywhere in Beijing from the Olympic Park  Forbidden City and beyond  it s about    cents USD per person  per trip    without any problems And there is a Starbucks across the street if you yearn for a little western culture    
P => A very comfortable stay I stayed in this hotel for one night after roughing it out in Yunnan province  RMB     after taxes for a superior room with   queen bed   It is an excellent business hotel  Customer service was by and large excellent   fast check in  helpful concierge  directions  baggage storage  message delivery   great gym service  attendant served water  provided towels personally   and good in room breakfast service that takes orders until   am and begins serving at    The room was very stylish for a business hotel   great bed  not too hard or soft   good lighting  high ceilings and both new and clean  Tasteful washroom facilities  Free internet  cable provided  with ok speed and bandwidth  Location is a   minute walk to Wangfujing Street and is beside the massive Regency Hotel and another local chain  For a hotel in the US         range it s a solid  comfortable stay  No complaints here  
P => Great Hotel in a Fantastic City The hotel is in an excellent location which I think is its main selling point  The rooms could be bigger but what you would expect from hotel rooms in any large city We walked everywhere  good walking shoes are a must  and we also used the subway which is very close to the hotel  We didn t eat in the hotel restaurant but we did have our breakfast there every morning which was great  There is continental type breakfast and Chinese style  all of which were excellent The staff were attentive but on some occasions English was a problem  however it would be unfair of me not to congratulate the staff for their use of English which   out of    times was superb  We drank in the hotel bar once and it was expensive and they add a     service charge to your bill  Water was supplied everyday but if you need some more at any stage  there is a little shop just across the road from the Hotel beside Starbucks The hotel is a   minute walk from Wangfujing Shopping Street which is always hectic but worth a visit  Also just beside the shopping street  just go straight across the junction at Wangfujing shopping street  a food market is held every night  Its worth walking up to see this as the sell all sorts of wonderful things to eat  If sheep s penis or indeed Dog hotpot is your thing this is the place for you If you are looking for a more Western Style fantastic meal  I would highly recommend a restaurant called the Courtyard  This restaurant is right beside the Forbidden City  ask for a window seat  and the views and food are fantastic  It is expensive      per bottle of wine  but worth every penny The only other advice I can give on Beijing is that public toilets are pretty poor so hold your breath and get in and out ASAP  Also there is a lack of soap in all but hotel toilets  Take loads of Antibacterial gels and wipes  You ll be lost without them and probably get a dodgy stomach  Lucky we went prepared  I m obsessed with clean hands and neither I nor my husband got sick our entire holiday I can t recommend Beijing or the Park Plaza hotel enough  
P => Business hotel with style  Convenient location  tasteful and comfortable   stars business hotel in the downtown of Beijing  
P => Wonderful hotel We recently stayed at the Park Plaza  everything about the hotel was superb  The location is very close to the city centre  there is a subway station right behind the hotel and it is safe to walk around The rooms were great  and breakfast was good  on our last day we went down early before the breakfast started and they served us anyway  The best asset of the hotel is the staff they are wonderful  the best we have ever had the pleassure of staying with  The taxi marshals could nt do enough for you and the reception were great  Dont even think of going anywhere else  
P => Great hotel  no major complaints This is a great hotel for various reasons    great location  near subway station  nice neighborhood    Safe area  even late at nite    excellent amenities in room  room safe  internet  great bathroom  nice bed  not too hard    Great concierge team  One fellow was specially helpful  name      well priced    bank ATM around the block   I was able to eat at nearby hutongs  I dont speak any Chinese    nice hotel bar  though pricey  as most hotel bars Bad things   limited english spoke at check in  check out    gym is unimpressive  not too important for me    I thought breakfast was not cheap  so i ate at starbucks across the street  
P => Great hotel I agree   this is a great hotel  well managed   you can tell that from all the small thngs that they got right  as opposed to the equal status hotle in Xi am where I m writing this  and al the small things are wrong and make it secnd class   For instance  the staff were friendy and happy to chat   they seemed to be happy to be working there which is often not the case  The breakfast was the best I ve had in a hotel buffet  The rooms was big enough  very clean  and well thought out  the bedroom was well lit  bathroom toiletries just what we needed  etc  It was a pleasure to stay there  Happily  we re going back for one night at the end of this business trip and I m delighted  One niggle   as a vegetarian  the ground flor restaurant  which is open    hours  didn t serve any veggie sandwiches  I had a waldorf salad one lunchtime  without the walnuts  Reminds me of Fawlty Towers in that respect  We were in a great rush so didn t complain and anway  what doyou expect if you order western food in an asian hotel  But veggie food was a bit unsatisfactory  And the restaurant itself rather enpty and cold  But again  that s what you often get if you eat in a hotel  Overall  excellent  
P => Great Hotel I recently stayed at the Park Plaza in Beijing  Having read the previous reviews on this site I agree that it is a great hotel  It is very handy for exploring the city of Beijing  It is close by to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square and as taxis are cheap in Beijing it is very easy to get to the other areas of the city also  The concierge staff are excellent and will help with any of your travel requests  You must try Quanjude Peking Duck Restaurant on Wangfujing Street and for drinking and people watching go to Hou Hai in the evening  Only complaint was on arrival the hotel tried to sell us their Club package for an additional fee  Firstly we said yes but luckily they had no rooms available so we kept our superior room which was most than sufficient for our needs  In the end we were glad as we went to Starbucks each morning for breakfast  about   few metres from hotel entrance  and the free happy hour would have confined us each evening to being in the hotel  Would definitely recommend this hotel for a tourist stay in Beijing  
P => Good hotel and location A good hotel and relatively good value for money  The hotel is in a decent location  although as a westerner travelling alone it was difficult to find a suitable restaurant in the area  Thankfully the room service was excellent  Overall a good choice for a westerner visiting the city  The hotel has an arrangement with local drivers who will take you  for example  to the Great Wall  It costs more than the bus or local taxi  but it s still a good arrangement   with one catch  The driver may insist on taking you to a ceramics factory on the way  and a tea room on the way back  And in both places they ll try very hard to get you to buy something  It wasn t too over the top  but as with all of Beijing  some of the locals are trying every tourist trick in the book  Girls approaching single males to  quot practice their English quot   but in reality to entice you to an extortionate bar  can be really annoying after a while  But overall  Beijing is a great place to vist  I d definitely recommend it and the hotel  
P => A pleasant surprise  We found the hotel through TripAdvisor adn we check lost of hotels however we didn t know exactly what to expect and it was a very pleasant surprise  the hotel has very good looking facilities and rooms  it is clean and the service is great  the staff is very friendly and helpful The location is great  it is located in a very nice neighborhood  surrounded by shops  restaurants  and bars  near of one of the biggest malls  and the famous Wangfujing food Street and acrobatic theaters The price was a very good deal It was really good  
P => Awesome Olympic Stay Park Plaza was an excellent hotel  Having stayed at   star hotels in the states  this was no different  The service was great  We stayed on the club level which included a full breakfast  afternoon cocktails and snacks and    hour access to free internet  Well worth the extra money for the club amenities  Rooms were well appointed and bathrooms were large and spacious  Location is great  we walked everywhere  This was an IOC hotel during the Olympics so security was tight  but appreciated  We ate at Bloo restaurant and the japanese restaurant and both were reasonably priced and good  Highly recommend this hotel  
P => Good hotel It is a good  clean  high end hotel in Beijing  Although I won t rate it as highly as it is hyped Even service and concierage is not as great The enjoyable part is good decoration  cleanliness  comfortable rooms  very clean and well designed bathrooms and location  location  location  Its walking distance from Wangfujing and subway station which is a big plus  
P => Comfort friendly staff recommended for families We stayed at the Park Plaza for four nights with two kids         and enjoyed the comfort and really friendly and familiar atmosphere offered by the hotel  Reception  concierge desk  restaurant  bar and all other staff were very corteous  The hotel is located in walking distance to all major places of interest  Beds are just marvelous  We booked the rooms with breakfast included and that is what I would recommend  The buffet is very good  though  of course  dominated by Chinese specialities  However  for those who need their muffins and donuts   there is a Starbucks just    m from the hotel entrance  I recommend the Park Plaza for family trips  
P => Excellent hotel fantastic location We had a wonderful   day stay in Beijing and loved this hotel  When we arrived we upgraded to a club suite which gave access to the Club Lounge  with afternoon snacks and refreshments  a huge buffet breakfast with everything you could imagine and a nice gym  The room was excellent  nice and modern furnished  a huge comfy bed  spacious bathroom  international cable and all necessary conveniences The staff is over all very good and really friendly and helpful  most speak good English The location is fantastic  a short taxi drive to all the major attractions and only a five min walk to Wangfujing and the Donghuamen night market PSAsk for a note with the hotel name and street in Chinese  very helpful if you catch a taxi  
P => Loved this hotel    There is absolutely a reason this hotel was ranked    on the popularity index for Trip Advisory  I booked a standard room online  they offer AAA discounts  and then when we arrived  decided to upgrade to a suite for     the cost  had I booked the suite directly online  for    RMB we got a suite  two buffet breakfasts  and happy hour every days  which included a selection of hot and cold food  and alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks   the concierge and staff in general are excellent  they all speak fantastic english and are extremely friendly and helpful  the location is fantastic   we walked to the forbidden city on two separate days  you are also walking distance to a fun night market where you get to see numerous items  on a stick  including scorpions    the hotel arranged for a car for us to mutianyu and we had an excellent day on the great wall  i would definitely stay here again and i highly recommend it     
P => Great Location Great Rooms Great Value The Park Plaza offered a good value and a great location  While expensive by Chinese standards  most Western travelers would consider the hotel very affordable  For those familiar with hotels in the States  it is like staying at a Hilton for the price of a Hampton Inn or Courtyard Everything about the hotel was perfect  The rooms were well appointed  relatively spacious  and clean  The concierge was helpful  and you couldn t ask for a better location  It is about a      minute walk to the night market  Beijing s main shopping drag  Wangfujing  and several hutongs  Cabs are easy to come by  and although we never took it  the metro is apparently just around the corner I would definitely stay here again  and I would recommend it to friends traveling to Beijing  
P => Good Location and Value Started our three week China tour in Beijing at the Park Plaza  What a wonderful oasis after almost twenty hours in flight to arrive  Thanks to our guide  who handled the translation and check in for us   we had no problems and got exactly the room we had requested  Room     king bed non smoking   The room  while small  was well laid out with the typical business hotel set up  desk  chair  extra chair  bed and nightstands   Great use of space  mini fridge  TV  safe  drawers are all  quot enclosed quot  within closet furniture   Bathroom was fine  hotel provides bottled water daily and all needed amenities   Room was promptly cleaned each day and all staff members we encountered were courteous and friendly  Kudos to the doormen  so pleasant and outgoing  and concierge staff who always greeted us  and will handle mailing postcards for you for a small fee   Our included breakfast each morning  we stayed three days  was very good  though not the best we encountered on our trip   The options were fine  but same thing each day   We really liked the omelete and noodle stations  Breakfast dining room seemed a bit cozy to me  but I guess it is typical for a big city  Also  be aware only tea and coffee are  quot included quot  with the breakfast    if you start your day with soda  like me   it will be extra  Didn t try dinner at the restaurant  Hotel is in a great  very quiet  location  but close enough to all of the  quot action  quot  We walked each morning and evening and felt completely at ease  Great option for business or leisure travel  
P => Loved this hotel  We had a wonderful  wonderful   day stay at the Park Plaza Beijing in e  This hotel is really a  quot sleeper quot     neither big and over the top  nor boutique    but really everything a hotel should be  The location is terrific    close to the major attractions  and easy walking distance to Wangfujing  good restaurants  and shopping  Our room had all that we wanted  including a very comfortable bed  especially compared to other places we stayed in China   very nice linens  plenty of pillows  a well appointed bathroom  and quiet  But what really sets the Park Plaza apart from other hotels is the service  The staff was unfailingly welcoming  helpful  and so pleasant    really bending over backwards to make us happy  And it seemed as if everyone genuinely enjoyed what they were doing     helping to make our stay in Beijing a special one  We stayed in much more expensive and  quot exclusive quot  hotels in China  and they paled in comparison to the Park Plaza  This is a place that really understands the meaning of hospitality  I strongly recommend this hotel    you won t be disappointed   One caveat  the restaurant  while nice for breakfast  disappointed for dinner  There are many terrific dining options in the area     just ask the concierge for a recommendation   
P => Excellent Stay After carefully reviewing tripadvisor comments I stayed at the Park Plaza for   nights in mid e  It really does deserve its number   ranking in Beijing  While not the most luxurious hotel it has all the modern amenities and comforts you could wish for  minus pool  at a great price  It really was a good deal compared to some of the other hotels I looked at   Peninsular  Regent  etc  I think the room rate outweighs the little luxuries of the other     star hotels  While there is no pool you can use the pool of the Regent which is the Park Plaza s sister hotel right next door  For about     you can use the beautiful pool  sauna  srteam room  jacuzzis and exercise room I do think that the staff makes the stay even more pleasant  Concierge staff are very accommodating   especially Mr  Hong  A great young fellow  Hotel is tucked behind a main road and some taxis had a hard time finding it  Always carry the hotel business card with a little map on it  Beware some of the taxi drivers  They will drive you in circles and will plead they don t know where they are going  Hotel is a close walk to Wangfujing and of course all the main sites are only a      cab ride  unless you get the occassional round the world driver   
P => We loved Beijing  Stayed in the Park Plaza in ch for   nights  we had booked the hotel as part of a tour of Beijing booked through Dragonair  The hotel was lovely and very convenient for the Forbidden City and Wangfujing for great shopping and places to eat at night  The staff in the hotel were great  particularly the bell hops and door men who were always eager to speak to you in English and were always on hand to help in any way  Breakfast was included in our booking  and was a varied buffet  We also had drinks in the hotel at night  and the prices for cocktails were very reasonable  Don t miss the night market which is just a few minutes away  where you can buy scorpions  snakes  flies  and centipedes  all on a stick  If you are going to the Great Wall I thoroughly recommend that you go to the Mutianyu part of the wall  the day we were there were only about another    tourists  so it was great to get walking along without any overcrowding  We had one day off from our tour  and I decided I would like to go to the zoo  the door man advised us to get a taxi which were very cheap  but I was determined to try public transport  big mistake  We then joined about   million people trying to get on the subway  we nearly gave up  but eventually squeezed on  not for the faint hearted  If you re an animal lover or like animals at all  avoid the zoo at all costs  The animals seem to be very badly looked after  we didn t see a keeper while we were there  and a lot of people were throwing things at the animals  All in all I thoroughly enjoyed Beijing  the sights  the people and the food were all fantastic      
P => Very nice and cozy hotel This is a very nice and cozy hotel located in the center of beijing but in the inner street of a commercial complex  which makes it very quiet    Its a relatively new hotel  very clean and modern  the decoration is very simple so its almost relaxing  the staff is very friendly  specially the concierges who are very helpful with directions and helping you out with your plans   The breakfast buffet is very good and even the dinner buffet is worth it if you are too tired to go out     the hotel and meals are not expensive at allTip  Always have a card with the hotel directions in chinese so the taxi drivers know how to get there   they are puzzled when they see the address since its a very small street but they often call either the hotel or someone to explain it to them     Hand them the address once you are in the cab because if you show it to them before getting in and they dont know how to get there they may refuse to take you  happened to me a couple of times  
P => Excellent  Stayed here       th and absolutely loved it  I m ultra picky with hotels  so draw your own conclusions  Staff friendly  amp  helpful and always plenty on hand to advise  Uniformed doormen always on duty  and willing able to help  Building is gorgeous inside  and very much what you d expect from a   star hotel in Europe  Think InterContinental  Nice softly lit lobby  and bar area  Room was spacious and comfortable   very clean  stylish  well appointed  and large impressive bathroom  Robes  amp  slippers supplied  We stayed in a  quot standard quot  room  Room was no      and had a view to a side street   great for avoiding street noise  Breakfast not included  and was offered at RMB     pp  plus     cover charge  or a  quot deal quot  of RMB     per couple  to include happy hour drinks  In truth  this was the only let down  as these prices  esp in China  are just bonkers  That s about     for a buffet meal  whereas that would get you dinner for   anyplace else in Beijing  Anyhow  there s a Starbucks across the way  but that s also  relatively  expensive  Ate in  Oodles  restaurant  and were the only people there  the hotel restaurants don t seem to be busy at all   Food was nice   a bit pricey by Beijing standards   but ultra cheap by Western standards  About RMB    per dish  Good sushi  Service was smiling  attentive   and their command of English will just put you to shame  Transport wise  yes  as per other comments you ll always need the address in Chinese   and once our taxi dropped us off at the sister Regent Hotel   but OK as it s just in front of Park Plaza  The little card you get with your room keys has a fold out map of the area  with place names in Chinese   so you can just show that to taxi drivers  You can enter the new subway Line   directly next to the Regent   it s really impressive  cheap  RMB   per ticket any distance   and easy to navigate  But if there are   or   of you  taxis maybe just as cheap   rarely paid more than around RMB    for rides of about    mins  You can hail them anywhere on the street  Taxi to from airport should not cost more than RMB      No tipping  Driving  amp  traffic can be very scary   so buckle up  There s a little convenience store just near the intersection with Jinyu Hutong and Dongsi Nandajie   a few mins walk from hotel  You can stock up there on water etc  But you do get   free bottles per day in your room  Also Thai vegetarian  Japanese   and of course Chinese   restaurants all within minutes walk of hotel  Safe  pleasant area  Staff smile and wave at you  Isn t that nice  
P => Good hotel great location Recently stayed   nights at this hotel in a deluxe room  Enjoyed the stay very much  The room was comfortable and clean and had an ok view  The hotel is nice  We ate in the restaurant  Bloo  one night  the food was good but the restaurant was empty  which was a shame  Location is good  set back from the main street and within walking distance to main shopping area and we walked to parks within about     hour Overall  I would stay at this hotel again  Downpoint was no free internet access and cost of use in the business centre is pricey compared to other places  
P => Really enjoyed the Park Plaza I m in the middle of a stay here and really enjoy it  Staff is excellent  English is pretty good  location fantastic   right next to the Regent hotel but cheaper and set back from Jinbao Street so it s a bit quieter too  Being set back can be a bit difficult for a taxi driver but it s not too hard  Subway station just down the block  at the base of the Regent   Starbucks next door for a taste of home if  like me  you ve been gone a while  Lei Garden on the  rd floor of the Jinabo Tower is a good choice for food  and there are ATMs at the front of Jinbao Tower from several bank chains  Walking distance to Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square is a nice perk Beijing is a nice city  but not my favorite  If I come back  though  I will certainly stay here again  
P => Service is excellent This is a really nice hotel  with nice decor and great staff  We were only here for   nights on a stop over but felt wonderfully relaxed after staying here  The staff are great  really friendly  and willing to do anything to help  A special commendation goes to the concierge who managed to sort us out at     pm with a chauffeur driven car for a couple of days for sight seeing at a comparable rate to the tourist bus  The car was so much better The hotel was really good value  If I go back to Beijing I d stay here  
P => Great Location in the middle of the city  I stayed here with a slew of MBA classmates in ch to visit companies in Beijing  The hotel is very nice and the breakfast buffet was above average  The staff was very helpful and there was generally at least one English speaking person available  The conference room was a little small  but then again there was apx     of us  Lounge downstairs has a full bar  amp  is a very convenient place to get a drink before heading out for dinner in the evenings  Location is great  And if you need a Starbucks fix  it s just outside next door  I also walked to the Wangfujing market one night which is very close by  amp  an experience  You can even walk to Tienanmen Square The concierge was okay  They re good at setting up tours to all the major cultural sites and the most popular nightlife venues  But they seemed to be limited to exactly that   so  if you re looking for the inside track on the up  amp  coming art scene or authentic restaurants where not a word of English is spoken  it could be tough  Though they do seem to know these places  it s just not in their regular repertoire to recommend them  Lucky for me  my friend spoke fluent Mandarin  lived for a time in Beijing  amp  still had friends there which proved invaluable  Definitely take the hotel card that has their location on it  You will find that many cab drivers do not speak English and some also don t know the city that well b c even they are newcomers  
P => Great Hotel  PRICE  My parents and I spent   nights at the Park Plaza in il       We called the hotel directly and booked the following room    Twin Beds  Rollaway Bed  Non Smoking  Deluxe Room  Bed  amp  Breakfast Package for       per night       US   An extremely great rate for such an upscale hotel with a phenomenal location and breakfast buffet  STAFF  The staff spoke English very well and were extremely helpful  The hotel provides these little cards with the major sites written in Chinese for you to give the cab drivers  since most do not speak English  ROOM  The hotel rooms are fabulous  air conditioning is great  tons of hot water in the shower  complimentary bottled water is provided by the cleaning staff each day  linens are great  everything is really nice  AREA  There s a Starbucks and ATM across the driveway  and several restaurants and convenience stores steps away  The Dongdan metro stop is a couple blocks away    but blocks in Beijing are huge  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Beautiful room great location  Definintely have the hotel name info written in Chinese for your cab driver  but even then most will have trouble finding it  We used the English map printed from the hotel s website and our driver from the airport still had to pull over to call the hotel  I d definintely recommend taking a cab from the airport   I think it was less than    US or so  Once we found it check in was a breeze and we headed up to our room  The room was huge   much larger than expected and very well appointed  There was no view to speak of  we looked out over the office type building across the street  The bed was super comfortable  though  and I quickly forgot the view  We ended up on a smoking floor  there were no other non smoking rooms available  but there was no noticeable smell in the room and barely on the floor itself  A Starbucks is located virtually across the street and an ATM  convenience store  great for bottled water  and bakery  delicious cream pastries  are within short walking distance  The night market off of Wangfujing was a comfortable walk away and when we asked the concierge for walking directions to a chain restaurant in our guide book they actually knew of a location much closer near Wangfujing and sent us on a much quicker route  The hotel was extremely affordable and felt extremely luxurious for the price  Highly recommended  
P => Just Perfect Perfect Location  Perfect services  Perfect rooms and Very good food      
P => Loved the Park Plaza We just returned from   nights in this great hotel  Our family is two seniors and   twenties daughters  The price is right and the restaurants great  We opted for the extra money for the breakfast and cocktails  This was a bargain as well  The breakfast is sumptuous and provides everything you could want for breakfast no matter your country of origin  The cocktail area with a few hors d oeuvres was also nice and worth the money  We ate at the hotel restaurant two nights and had one lunch in the noodle restaurant  all excellent  The people at the front desk were very nice as were the concierge staff  One man even agreed to have our taxi driver keep in cell contact with him because of the language barrier  The rooms were good size and beautifully decorated  The bathrooms roomy  My husband is an architect and he was very impressed with the interiors  We walked to the Forbidden City a couple of times and Wangfujing Street is near by  If you are homesick there s a Starbucks in the cul de sac  If you need to call from the US we found the English to be good and the arrangements to be just as we requested  
P => Good choice for Beijing very good value Very well located close to the major attractions in Beijing  Had a suite in the top floor  well furnished  spacious  nice bathroom  two TVs  free high speed internet service Service is generally good but knowledge of English is not widespread  not unusual for China  Highly recommended  
P => Good hotel and great location We were impressed by the entrance and lobby area  All the public areas are well maintained  The reception dealt with us quickly and efficiently  The bedroom was clean  quiet and with modern furnishings  The linen is good quality  The bathroom was also a good size in good condition and clean  Towels are good quality  We had all that we needed  Bathrobes and sandals are provided  The TV was a large LCD with a large selection of english channels including CNN  BBC world  HBO  Discovery and National Geographic  The bed was confortable The location is very good and is in walking distance of shops and restaurants The bar provides live entertainment  although chinese renditions of western songs may not be your cup of tea   you judge The buffet breakast is a good mixture of chinese  continental and western full cooked breakfast foods  The service is good  
P => Don t look any further just book it  My husband and I just returned from   nights in Beijing at this fantastic hotel  All the other reviews have summed up this property well and the only thing I can add is   if you want a well located  value for money  nicely appointed  friendly hotel don t waste any more time looking  just book it   Beijing is a very exciting  vibrant city   enjoy   
P => Amazing Service We have traveled all over the world and the service at Park Plaza Wangfujing exceeds all others  From the gentlemen at the door and the bell desk to the front desk and the wait staff in the fantastic restaurant Bloo Dining the service was by far the best we have ever experienced  Every need was met in a flash and the hotel was planned with so much detail  Friendly and responsive are the two words that best describe the staff  You can exchange currency at the front desk and electric converters are available from housekeeping  Stay here  you will not be disappointed  
P => Incredible Hotel Perfect Location We stayed at the Park Plaza ch    ch   rd  This hotel absolutely met and exceeded our expectations  We picked this hotel due to the numerous and wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor  There were three of us and we stayed in a suite with a separate bedroom and living room  The living room had an attached bathroom which came in handy for the  rd guest  We had access to the executive floor which came in handy at the end of a long and exhausting day touring and shopping  The staff was wonderful  knowledgable and spoke very good english  The breakfast buffet was plentiful and had numerous choices including a made to order egg bar  We only had one complaint and that was the climate control system  We had seen this same complaint from other guests  We just compensated by opening the window  As far as location is concerned  this hotel has a great location  it is about a    minute walk to Tianmen Square and the Forbidden CIty  We found numerous restaurants within walking distance  They were very good and not expensive  Many of the people who have written about this hotel have said that there is a Starbucks across the way   even better  there is an ATM machine in the office building outside the door  We found one thing with the hotel  however and that is a majority of the taxi drivers dont know where this hotel is  You MUST ask the hotel to e mail you their name and address in Mandarin  We also found that once we were returning to the hotel  the taxi drivers would not take us because they didnt know where the hotel is located  Since the Park Plaza is right behind the Regent  i would suggest walking over there and asking them for their card   i would definately stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone   it was great 
P => Definitely worth a return visit  I spent   nights here based on other reviews here and wasn t disappointed  I booked via the hotel website to obtain the suite upgrade offer and was given a room on the upper floors  This also gave me free internet access and use of the Club floor facilities  mini breakfast and early evening snacks and Happy Hour  My check in was slightly marred as the room wasn t ready  a surprise as it was  pm but I was offered hospitality in the Club floor area whilst I waited  The suite was great  spacious and as other people have commented   clean  The only challenge was working out how to use the room thermostat and I had that cracked by the  rd day The breakfast is typical buffet style with some Chinese options as well as western style standard fare  The restaurant  called Bloo  in on the  nd floor and surprised me slightly by having a smoking section  but this has a separate set of tables  All the staff were pleasant and spoke enough English to get by I found the concierge and doorman both to be more than helpful and as other reviewers have commented  a very good reflection of the hotel hospitality Lastly  the location is great for access to Wangfujing Street and the Forbidden City  There is also a subway just around the corner which is very cheap a good way to get around if you want to avoid taxis All in all this was a great experience and I am happy to recommend it for other travellers  
P => Park Plaza Beijing Rocks  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel  Everything about the place is awesome  The lobby and grounds  much of the latter being shared with the Regent  are beautiful  and the front desk staff was prompt and courteous  The rooms were well decorated and spacious with good sized bathrooms  The bell desk guys were so helpful  For example  I needed help with a local SIM card  and one of the staff walked several blocks with me to the nearest China Mobile office and stayed with me until my issue was resolved  Incredible service from everyone  I would  however  like to specifically acknowledge the exceptional service provided by Nick at the front desk and Betty in the Club Lounge  These two employees are valuable assets to the hotel  They provided friendly and professional service above and beyond what I expected in every respect  Indeed  Betty and Nick made me feel at home during my four day stay  No complaints about anything  
P => Love this hotel  This hotel is wonderful and I can t fault it  It was a haven in a very polluted city full of people trying to squeeze every last yuan out of you    Rooms   We had a twin room  It was spacious  spotless  very comfortable and modern  Suits people on business as there s a large desk    Staff   All very friendly and efficient  If you re looking to book a tour  we highly recommend going to the concierge desk and asking them to recommend and book something for you  The tour operators will pick up and drop off at the hotel  For any part of the Great Wall  we recommend a guide called  quot Lily quot  who speaks excellent English and is very knowledgeable  Our tour consisted of just Lily  the driver  my sister and I    Location   Very central and you are near a hutong  Wangfujing snack street and lots of restaurants  shops and ATMs  I also felt safe in the area    Facilities and other   Internet was free when we were there and the breakfast buffet was plentiful and diverse  Japanese  Chinese  Western   
P => Great value great service close to everything and quite new We had an excellent five night stay at Park Plaza  We were upgraded to a junior suite  It was very new and beautiful decorated  The staff was very helpfull  especially the concierges  I strongly recommend you to ask them for places to visit and great restaurants  We considered the Holiday Inn Central Plaza  but prefered the location of Park Plaza  The hotel is not so big  and therefore it can be difficult for the taxidrivers to find it  The hotel will give you the directions written in chinese  so you can show it to the driver  The hotel is located in the same complex as the five star Regent Hotel  It s probably the same owner  It takes you about    minutes if you walk to Tiananmen Square or Forbidden City  In the evening it was only a short walk    min  to the street with the many strange food stalls or the big shopping street  The hotel was very clean It was a great place to stay  especially for couples  
P => I loved it  When I first checked in it was around noon and they asked me to wait for a couple minutes so they could get the room ready  I went for a    minute walk and when I returned I had been upgraded to a suite at no charge and it was amazing  This is one of the newest and cleanest hotels I have ever stayed at  The computer work station was in an area that jutted out with a floor to ceiling window  The staff and location was excellent  I will definitely stay here anytime I am in Beijing  
P => Good Bet In Beijing I don t see how anyone could complain about this hotel  Firstly  it is an outstanding location within walking distance of great shopping and tourist attractions  It is one street off the main drag so it is quiet  They had a special on their website for a suite and I found the room very nicely appointed  spacious and quiet with comfortable bed  pillows and amenities  The separate shower had instant hot water with lots of pressure  The food was good at the buffet breakfast and the staff spoke english and was very courteous  This may not be the ritz carlton  but you are not paying those prices  if that is what you want  then stay there but for a great overall experience in beijing at a very reasonable price  this is a winner of a place  
P => Great hotel The Park Plaza was a wonderful treat  The location was great and close to the metro  The staff was very helpful and spoke English very well  The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the hotel offered many various trips to see the sights in Beijing  I would definitely stay there again  
P => Great service and location We stayed here for   nights in ruary The rooms are very nice  free internet  large bathrooms The location is great  however since it was freezing while we were there  we took advantage of the taxis  Pretty much    total everywhere you go The concierge is excellent and had great restaurant recommendations  We ate at Da Dong for the Peking duck  Very good  They did send us to one of the acrobatic shows  the one with the kids  and we did not like that  Go to the big named ones They also set up a great wall tour for us to Metianyu  It was pricey at    RMB for the   of us  but was great  We had Tony as our guide The breakfast buffet was AWESOME   That was the best part of our day  It was included in our stay Getting there  take a cab  its between       RMB  Make sure you have it written down in chinese  and also I would print out a map because our driver still had some trouble finding it  
P => Fabulous hotel with helpful staff We couldn t believe the deal  about     a night for a centrally located and beautiful hotel  Great staff  gorgeous rooms  convenient location  and a Starbucks    feet from the entrance  Concierge arranged Italian  Thai  and Chinese restaurant reservations  even booking a private dining room for six when we showed up at   PM on Valentine s night  Prices on this will rise  but for us  it was a sweet deal  
P => Excellent hotel The room is new and spotless  The lay out of the room and bothroom has been      thoughtful and  quot human quot   Security is good as they do monitor those who use the lift to reach the residential quarter  Service is tip top and has nothing to be picked at  Bellboys are friendly and helpful  The hotel is just   minutes walk  or less  from the infamous Wang Fu Jing high street  Lots of restaurant and shops around  Also only    minutes walk to Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City  or RMB   starting price by using taxi  Not only that  the Metro station is located right outside the Hotel  In short  Excellent spot  wonderful hotel  Definitely recommended  
P => Fabulous We stayed there a while ago but absolutely loved it  Jeff  the concierge was extremely helpful and spoke good English  I can t wait to go back there especially now the subway is finished If anyone is there or about to go there check out the fabulously decorated toilets on the floor where you have breakfast  Would love to have a photo of how they were decorated  Had one but lost it  
P => Nice mod hotel This is a thoroughly enjoyable hotel in downtown Beijing  The hotel is very new and not overwhelming in size  There are many attractive and stylish features  The rooms and especially the bathrooms were modern and well designed  Internet was freely available and fast  The hotel sits practically on top of a subway stop which is very convenient and easy for getting around the city  A starbucks is located just outside the front door  
P => Wonderful place to stay Park Plaza is a nice place to stay after a long day of walking  The rooms are modern with enough closet and drawers for all your clothes  They replenish   complimentary water bottles everyday as well  It is conveniently located right next to the new subway station  So if your serious about shopping in the Silk ket  you can easily get there without the hassle of getting caught in traffic  The breakfast though is not that great  it s just ok  I think having bfast there once is enough  The concierge and front desk speaks decent English so you will be able to get directions if needed  
P => We recommend this Hotel   Detailed Review Summary  Excellent choice  great location  hotel rooms facilities  amp  staff are excellent  My friends and i all recommend General InfoA group of about    of us stayed in this hotel over the           New year period  Between us we shared the superior rooms and one deluxe suite which included buffet breakfasts for   for   days  and free happy hour drinks finger foods again for   for   days  I should warn you that although there were   of us in the deluxe suite  you are not permitted for all   to go at once  You must use   coupons in   day  and the other   the next day  The reasoning behind this is beyond me personally LocationWangfujing is considered one of  or the most high class expensive areas in Beijing  By staying in this hotel  and location  you can expect a very clean environment and very spacious paths  Despite a population of something like   million you would barely believe it when you walk around this area  There is just so much space that overcrowding is not an issue at all  It is a close walk       min  to the shopping area and food markets where if you re daring you can try things like scorpions  starfish and centipedes  You also feel extremely safe in this area  Located directly in front of the hotel is a starbucks  ferrari  Lamborghini and Roll s Royce outlets if that is an indication of the type of location you will be staying at  While walking to the shops you will also pass otel hotel and i think it was Regeant  Many restaurants are also along that road as you walk  For the price you pay i think this hotel is a bargain  In terms of getting to other tourist attractions from this hotel there were no issues  it is quite central to everything  Taxi s are cheap and we had no complaints about taxi fares because everything was quite close Rooms FacilitiesNo complaints  rooms look modern  clean and beds are comfortable  We were all very happy with our rooms  As with all hotels i stayed in in china  you also get free bottles of water everyday  The deluxe suite is very nice i should mention and included a large LCD tv in the living room  sofa bed and a nice study table  The bathroom is shared and is very big  The toilet is also in its own you could say cubicle and quite far so you don t have to worry about brushing your teeth and holding your breath because someone just did a dump StaffVery friendly  i must admit due to some complications and the fact that there were    of us staff were under pressure but they acted very professional and kept their cool  They can all speak english quite well  
P => Fantastic Hotel My wife and I stayed here for   weeks over Christmas and we didn t have one single complaint  The hotel is central   A    min walk to Wangfujing and is on top of a subway station which is really handy  The room was fantastic  king size bed  fantastic view and free broadband as well  The staff in this hotel should be cloned and sent to every other hotel   Never was a request a problem  they were genuinely happy and always greeted us  Breakfast was amazing and so was their Christmas buffet  We also took advantage of the happy hour offer and was real value for money  I will definitely stay at this hotel again if we are in Beijing  
P => The Best              I book this hotel online after reading some of the reviews on this site and we were certainly not disappointed  We stayed at the hotel for   nights over         Upon checking in we were given the opportunity to add daily breakfast for two  a room upgrade and happy hour in one of the bars daily for an extra    RMB  approx A    per day   which we decided to take up  The room that we had was a magnificent suite with a seperate lounge and desk with TV  seperate bedroom and large bathroom  It was just beautiful We had a problem with the airconditioning heating on the second day of our trip and when we spoke with the reception they moved us to another room immediately  The staff at the hotel were always extremely helpful  nothing was too much of a problem and most staff spoke very good english The concierge desk was also the best we came across in our travels of china  always willing to help with directions  taxis   writing down the plate number in case you had a problem   restaurant recommendations etc etc I can not express just how helpful this was travelling independantly in a country where very little english is spoken  The gym in the hotel is fairly small with a couple of treadmills and some other equiptment  although there was rarely anyone else using the facilities  Breakfast buffet was amazing  a few morning it was very busy but they had a huge range of western and chinese cuisine  The bar on the   th floor in which was part of the upgrade package provided free drinks from     pm til  pm offering a range of wine  beer  soft drinks and even spirits  johnny walker black  gin  campari  barcardi etc etc  and both hot and cold nibbles The hotel also offered free internet in the business centre  which was great  The location of the hotel was great  a short walk to the shopping malls  forbidden city etc Taxis were always about and there are many restaurants and even a starbucks within   m if you don t feel like going too far  I can t rave enough about this hotel  it really made our trip to Beijing magificent   
P => Christmas Magic at the Park Plaza Staying at the Park Plaza hotel was a great experience  Hotel is abouta    min walk to Tianammen and Forbidden City     min walk to Snack Street and main shopping area  The concierge were very helpful in booking city restaurants and also in ensuring that your taxi driver knew exactly where he was going before setting off  The hotel providedhelpful translations of all the main tourist destinations so if you got lost you could idiotically point at the card and magic your way to where you wanted to go We had a lovely view over a hutong  Housekeeping was fantastic  the place was spotless and a very nice touch     on Christmas Eve a little parcel of cookies and chocolates was left in our room  Staff very friendly  This was the first hotel westayed in in China and unfortunately for the others  it was the bar to which we measured the others against  Booking direct with the hotelseems to get you the best rates and it was definately great value for money  Would absolutely stay here again  We were very sad to leave thehotel and Beijing  a fantastic city  
P => Better than I imagined  I read positive review of this hotel and had high expectations  The hotel and staff were even better  I rented two rooms for a week  My    something daughter was so comfortable at the hotel she chose to stay there an extra two days while I traveled for two days  The hotel is nicely decorated with comfortable and inviting lobby bar spaces and the hallways and room have a teak wood look this is modern and warm Beautiful bathroom and rooms with high functioning lighting and nice amenities  The fitness room is well designed  We liked the carpeting and decorations  It was like exercising in your living room The staff spoke English very well and they were just fantastic at helping us with various arrangements  It was nice to be recognized at times and we found the hotel staff could recall earlier conversations and arrangements  A beneft of staying at a smaller property Once we learned the subway system  it was convenient having the station next door to the hotel  
P => Fantastic I stayed here for five days in ember  I got an amazing deal on Expedia for about     per day including tax  excluding breakfast though   The hotel is in a great location  close to tourist activities and shopping  It s modern and very pretty inside  but best of all  the service is fantastic  The staff is super helpful and friendly Overall  this is a great hotel for business and tourists alike  Why pay three times the price at the five star Peninsula  or other hotels  around the corner  when you get the same quality and service at this place  Who knows though how much longer such great deals can be had  
P => Park Plaza beijing absolut top We stayed for    days at this excellent hotel  As other reveiwers have mentioned  this is a   star  hotel for a   star price  Yes they might miss some special features to get the    rating  but none that we missed  We had an fantastic roomy suite  which felt like home and was kept very clean and nice during our entire stay  The staff of the hotel  without exception  was very friendly  helpful and courtious with a special mention for the business lounge staff  The location is also excellent with many tourist attractions within easy reach  Great value and we definite recommend this hotel to travellers to Beijing  
P => perfect location Stayed for   nights in early ember with my family     non smoking rooms    double and   twin  as requested  We weren t able to be given adjoining rooms  but were on the same floor Rooms are great   quite sleek  and everything looks new  the bathrooms are also nicely done  No smell of smoke at all  was definitely a non smoking room Location was fantastic   in a downtown area near Wangfujing street  I agree with previous reviewer   most taxi drivers don t know where it is  unless you know the Chinese name for the hotel   saying it is next to the Regent can help though  The breakfast buffet was fine  although some of the breakfast staff were a bit slow to serve tea coffee etc The doormen were very helpful   once we were heading out to meet a friend  but didn t quite have the right address written down in Chinese  They immediately offered to ring my friend on her mobile  amp  found out the correct address  then made sure the taxi knew where we were going Recommend a restaurant called  quot Xiao Nan Guo quot  which is in the JinMao tower opposite  can t remember if it was on the  nd or  rd floor    very sleek interior  all black   great service  best we had in Beijing   food was fantastic  and very very reasonably priced  Definitely recommend this hotel  
P => lovely hotel and friendly staff Stayed here for   nights  hotel was immaculate  staff in all areas were very friendly and helpful  expecially the   doormen  Starbucks just outside front door  Wangfujing St about    mins walk  all meals at restuarant were excellent qualitiy and price was quite good too  Would highly recommend 
P => Excellent Hotel   Location Room and Staff The hotel is located behind its sister property  the Regent Hotel  and the subway station Dengshikou  Line     new subway line  is next to the hotel  Starbucks is just next door if you need additional caffeine shots and Wangfujing pedestrian mall is around      mins walk away  Though its facilities are not as grand as the Regent  they are still very comfortable  trendy and clean      The staff members are enthusiastic and helpful  which makes up for the slight language challenges  common encounter in Beijing   I now understand why it had won the Park Plaza Hotel of the Year       Try its website for excellent deals  
P => V Nice Hotel in great location V nice modern hotel near the main shopping street  Wanfujing  and about a    minute walk from the Fobidden City The hotel doesn t make enough of it but the building complex the hotel is part of sits on top of a metro station on the new line    just opened   The line runs north south and connects with all the other metro lines  There s a flat rate of   Yen per trip which is    p Hotel rooms and reception are very nice  Ther view is not great as all the rooms  I think  overlook an office restaurant hotel block which is about   m away  the other hotel is called The Regent   There s also a Starbuck in this block The staff are all very nice and friendly but not all have great english  Great value  would definately stay there again but not a  quot waw quot  hotel  
P => excellent hotel we stayed here for three nights in august     the hotel was excellent  the rooms were beautiful and very clean  there was a very nice area and the restaurtant was also very good  the staff were extremely helpful and friendly at all times  it was approx    minutes walk to wangfujing shopping st  i would definately recommend  
P => Excellent Hotel at a Great Location The four star rating is a result of the hotel not having frills such as a swimming pool or a fancy restaurant  The guestroom we had was beautifully furnished  new  clean  and modern  The service is also first rate  With many international hotels nearby  a major shopping area within walking distance  and the new No    subway line    metres away from the hotel s back entrance  one can t ask for more in terms of location  The only drawback was the in room thermostat insisting on setting itself at    degrees celsius  regardless of what we tried to set it at  Overall  a very nice hotel that I wouldn t hesistate in recommending to friends  
P => comfortable hotel near all Prompted by the long list of favorable reviews we booked a five night stay at this newer hotel near the tourist sites of Beijing  Located on a quiet side street  tucked in behind the Regent hotel  our taxi driver from the airport had a difficult time finding it  On the other hand  our sixth floor room looked out onto a hutong  and we could observe from above the life on the street of one of these fast disappearing old neighborhoods  Pedestrianized Wanfujing Street  the major shopping street of Beijing  is but a couple of blocks away and reached in a short walk Check in was accomplished by friendly  efficient staff  who along with the bell captain never tired to assist us with information during our stay  On setting out for a day of sightseeing  they would write our destination in Chinese onto a business card of the hotel to show the taxi driver  who as a norm spoke no English Our room was comfortably furnished with a king size bed with a great mattress  nice linens and pillows  desk  flat screen TV  phone  broadband Internet access  mini bar  coffee and tea maker with supplies  and the closet held everything from shoe horn over cloth bush to ironing board and iron  The very nice bathroom with terrazzo counter top  modern bowl shaped porcelain sink  tub shower  came with very soft towels  cotton robes  and an ample supply of toiletries  Minor nuisances were a very slow draining sink from which at times emanated an odor  noisily slapping doors in neighboring rooms  alarm clocks and wake up call rings audible through thin walls  and not restocking the mini bar for two days  Laundry service turn around was prompt and within the time frame promised Liberal use of light colored wood to line walls enhanced lobby  restaurant  bar  hallways and elevators  Breakfast was served buffet style in the second floor restaurant and offered something for everyone  An omelet cook stood by as well  Dinner was served a la carte or buffet style The western style entr es were okay  though not exactly fine dining  For that one can go next door to Daccapo in the Regent hotel for some delicious Italian food  prepared by the Swiss chef  Lovers of French food will not be disappointed at Justine  a short taxi ride away  The lobby bar lounge offered entertainment some nights  A lobby shop and a business center  albeit expensive  round out the public area of the hotel In summary  we were thoroughly happy with our stay at this newer hotel  which provided a comfortable base from which to venture out to explore the sights in and near Beijing  It deserves its four star rating  Should we return to Beijing  we will definitely stay here again  
P => Very Pleasant Stay I had a very pleasant experience at this hotel during a six day stay in late ober       Staff were friendly and helpful  location is superb with a new subway stop tucked around the corner  and not yet on most tourist maps   Very clean room  lots of thick towels  high pressure shower nozzle  elegant bathroom decor  comfortable bed  complimentary broadband connection  bargain price  Most definitely would stay here again  
P => Good Location Friendly Hotel We spent a few nights here at different ends of our Mongolian travels  We were upgraded to a business room on one stay and got the best slippers of our entire    day trip The hotel is friendly  in a great location and walking distance to the Hutongs  shopping and night food market  It had fee broadband internet and good size rooms  We left really early one morning and the hotel arranged a packed breakfast for us and took into account our dietary requirements We stored our luggage at the hotel when we went to Xian and there were no problems  Overall a great hotel   felt like home from home by the time we left  Comfy beds  unusual for the region  and good service We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the sister hotel for one night  next door  The Regent and were spoilt by the Regent Breakfast buffet  but never went hungry  
P => Loved the Plaza Wangfujing WOW  I consider myself a hotel snob and I can t tell you how many hotels I reviewed  looked up  checked with travel agents and read every reveiw I could find on each of them    WELL  we did it right  Our stay was              WITH THE NATIONAL HOLIDAY  THE ENTIRE TOWN WAS PACKED  THAT IS THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE  Try to avoid that holiday Our hotel was wonderful  It was four star plus as USA standards go  I was afraid that it would be less than was shown or stated but I was pleased right from the moment we pulled up to the front door  It is located right behind the Regent Hotel and is owned by the Regent  First  the location was perfect  It was close to everything and walking distance to many attractions including Wangfujing Street and the night market  But don t make location everything because taxi rides are dirt cheap in Beijing The Lobby is very modern  the hotel is just a few years old and the staff spoke good english  They made wonderful suggestions and were always willing to direct the cab drivers  write the name of your hotel for our return back  The front desk cashed travelers checks with no problem  except once when they ran out of Chinese currency and told us we needed to return about   hours later  The exchange rate is the same for cash and travelers checks  Our room was beautiful  The bed was comfortable and pillows were soft  Everything was spotless  The bathroom was large  modern with marble everything  the tub large and new  water pressure great and perfect flushing toilets  They had all the modern aminities and the toothbrushes they give you are first rate just in case you forget yours  We got our room on the higher floors  but I would not pay the extra as I saw a room on the lower floor that cost much less then ours and was the exact same  We did get the breakfast plan and it was quite nice and held us most of the day  It was buffet with all the trimmings including dim sum which I love I did call for room service a couple of times and the service fast  food hot and the steak fries were the best I have had anywhere  They are quick to respond to any requests  I did tip the bellman and I think they are now starting to expect it even though they don t ask or make any gestures  Just a few    really goes a long way I would recommend this hotel to anyone  MAKE SURE BEFORE YOU GO THAT YOU HAVE THE HOTEL SEND YOU THE ADDRESS IN CHINESE BECAUSE IT IS SO NEW      If you want more bling in the lobby  stay at the Regent  but I am sure you will pay more  Again  service great  room outstanding  food better then most in Beijing  and the hotel also gives you free bottled water every day for your trip around the city  Last thing  if you are not on a organized tour  YOU MUST HIRE A GUIDE  That was one of the best things we did  It is really inexpensive and since the taxi drivers don t speak any english  you need one especially if you want to see the city  My best shopping was a the Silk ket I would be happy to answer any questions about the hotel or city  shopping as I wish I had someone to answer mine before I went Have a wonderful time pjdaut aol com 
P => A Great Base in Beijing For the life of me I can t understand what people are griping about with this hotel  The room was great  the location is excellent and the food was good too  You can walk to the forbidden city  the night food market and Wangfujing shopping street  and Tiannamen from here  The staff is very friendly and they will only put you in honest  licensed cabs with a map back to the hotel to give the return driver  The concierge can arrange just about anything you need  Next time we are in Beijing we will plan to spend the entire time in the Park Plaza I will say a few things that could be improved on    The buffett is expensive  especially the breakfast and especially for China  However  The food is fairly good and it managed to keep me happy    They need to add at least one person to each shift that speaks english fluently  The staff speaks passable English but if you want something out of the ordinary Like a glass of ice for your bottled water  they have trouble with that    More rooms so that I can get one on short notice All in all a great hotel and a great experience  I definitely give this hotel my stamp of approval  
P => The best hotel we stayed at in China We visited China for two weeks staying in Beijing  Xi an  Hangzhou and Shanghai and we can say that this hotel was above and beyond the rest of the hotels we stayed at  the rest were about the same price   They spoke fluent english  the room and bathroom was clean and very modern  It has good access to Wangfujing street and nearby shopping  It is less than a    minute walk to the Forbideen City  
P => hotel taxi are overpriced the hotel and rooms are nice and the price for the room is ok  location is not bad but could be better  never had problems with taxis not finding the hotel The hotel arranged a taxi for a one day trip and they charged me rmb      which seems rather expensive  I booked the room via the hotel webside  while booking the webside stated that the room will be charged within    hours but when I checked out  I had to pay again  not sure if I got charged twice  
P => Good base for everything Stayed for   nights on a room only basis Good quality hotel   staff friendly and helpful Used Bloo Restaurant in the hotel and food of a good standardand reasonably priced For the price we paid for this hotel this was value for money for a hotel centrally located for both shopping and sightseeing  A must is the Great Wall of China but try to aviod on Chinese public holidays  
P => Much more than I expected I trusted the reviews of former travelers in Trip Advisor  and it could never have been better  The hotel has an excellent location  just    minutes walk to the Forbidden City  amp  Tiananmen square  and   minutes to a pedestrian street packed with shops I booked the hotel through Expedia  and got a rate of      approx  When I arrived  I was given a standard room  so I asked for an upgrade  which was immediately consented  I stayed in suite       on the   th floor  which was around    sq mts divided into a living room with its own toilet and a bedroom  with a huge bathroom  The suite had one TV set in the living room and an LCD in the bedroom Breakfast was not included in the price  but there was a Starbucks cafe almost next door Laundry service was very good  
P => Good Business Hotel Good Business Hotel   relatively close to Dong Fang Guang Chang area  all the underground malls etc   Very large spacious rooms and free internet  Good value for money  
P => Good rooms walking distance to shopping close to restaurants I stayed here with a tour group recently  I have to echo the other positive reviews  The fitness center is a little smaller than I d like  but there are treadmills and some weight equipment I thought at first it was a little far from shopping  but it s still only      minutes walk to Wangfujing and some good restaurants The hotel lobby and bar are small and not impressive  but the best part is that the Park Plaza is right next to the Regent  sister hotel   which has a beautiful lobby and is a nice place to sit for a drink  They also have a better selection of scotch  Several of my friends and I went there and noted the bar prices at the Regent are not much higher than the Park Plaza  It was worth going next door for the better ambiance  Breakfast was good and the selection changed every day  There is a large nonsmoking area  The smoking section was light and airy and is where I chose to sit everyday  It didn t exactly have a view of anything but it was a nice place to sit and the smoke wasn t too bad Service was generally good  and the bell staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful  I didn t ask them for directions often  but when I talked to them they were glad to give advice I would definitely stay there again  I will admit  if the Regent weren t right next door I wouldn t enjoy it as much  but it s like having access to the amenities of a   star hotel at a   star price  
P =>  service    price Very pleasant hotel for the price  Staff were friendly and approachable and general level of English was very high  Concierge was especially helpful providing us with useful advice and tips for the area  We where lucky enough to get a room upgrade to a beautiful room on the top floor  Location is very close to the forbidden city and other sights  could not really ask for more  The only drawback was the one small bottle of drinking water each a day which was a little annoying however more was very easy to buy from shops nearby  
P => Park Plaza Wangfujing The Park Plaza Hotel is a relatively new hotel  less than   years old  connected to the Regent Hotel  Food and bar services at both hotels can be charged to your room  Rooms are comfortable and in excellent shape  Staff  and in particular the concierge doorman group  are excellent  All were able to converse in english and made arranging taxis and trips very easy  The doormen provided a card with your destination in chinese  taxi number  Park Plaza Hotel name in Chinese and a small area map  that facilitated the return trip  each time a taxi was used from the hotel  The hotel desk offered currency conversion for many currencies including usd  cad and aus at better rates than we could get at home  The hotel is within walking distance of the Wangfujing shopping area and within     meters of the not yet open Subway line     Breakfast buffet featured both Chinese and North American style food including an egg station for fresh eggs omelettes  Overall an excellent experience and very well valued   star hotel  
P => coming back great location   we are not backpacker so for the price       we went all the way and got a suite   this hotel is near forb city tiananmen    min by taxi  and walking distance to shopping amp street food  the hotel and the area are very modern and clean   downstair from the hotel  you have a ferrari rollroyce dealer      we did not try the food at the hotel  all the staff were friendly  amp helpful with all our needs  you have a  quot starbucks quot  near the hotel entrance   for the homesicks    we did not use the subway cuz the taxi are so cheap       for the  st   kms so a    mins ride will cost you around     you have better hotel grand hyatt  but the price is not the same      for a room not a suite   you can go there there is a nice restaurant quot made in china quot they make a very nice peking duck and is not expensive  crispy duck for   pax        the courtyard resto was great as well very romantic facing the forb city  the hotel concierge will help you with the tours for the great wall  for the city tours no need just take a map and a taxi so much fun   for the great wall  i do not recommend  quot badaling quot  is too busy  but  quot mutianyu  quot  was the best  not too many personne you have a cable car to reach the top or walk   then after walkin along the wall     miles down  you can take a different cable car down OR you can slide down the mountain on a  quot tobogan quot  great   the private driver upgraded vehicle  for the day was   hrs       tips   enjoy your trip    
P => Great choice in great area of Beijing I stayed at the Park Plaza for a week in ust and really liked the hotel  Having looked at the Park Plaza website  I m not sure that I would have stayed in any of their other properties but this was a cut above  The rest of my hotels in China were five star and this one could certainly compete with them on almost every level  perhaps the rooms were a bit smaller and there was no pool   The hotel is very new and modern  The rooms are clean and spacious enough for two  though i was only one person in it   The location is great just a block away from the Wangfujing shopping street  It s not far from the Forbidden City but  since distances are so large in Beijing  it makes sense to take cabs anyway  and they re cheap   What really sets this hotel apart from other   star properties is the service   which was at a   star or above level  From the front desk to the restaurants to the absolutely excellent concierge staff who always put      into everything they did  I can t speak highly enough of them   I would call this a  small   star  hotel rather than a   star and highly recommend it to anyone  
P => Overrated The Park Plaza in Beijing is okay  average at best   While it has decent rooms  clean  amp  new   the service is sub par when compared to similar hotels in China  for the same price   Its the little things around service     a meager breakfast buffet  cannot serve cappuccino  canned juice   only one small bottle of mineral water  day  bellboy complaining about a tip to our guide  Tips are not expected in China   etc On the plus side  its decently located  close to Wangfujin shopping area  Tiananmen square is a      min cab ride away  there s no subway nearby   amp  has a very helpful concierge  End of the day  its a fair deal   however doesn t deserve to be    on tripadvisor  
P => Nice western style hotel near city center The hotel is a clean western style hotel centrally located  The staff is efficient  and the concierge and door men are very helpful  The amenities for this hotel are sub par when compared to similar properties catering to western travelers     for ex  the gym is limited  business center has slow internet  etc The breakfast was not well prepared  but did offer some local options  as well as those westerners are accustomed The hotel is in walking distance to Wan Fu Jing Shopping District and the Forbidden City Tianamen Square  There are also charming bakeries and local eateries around the corner  Keep in mind that city blocks are very large in Beijing and cabs are required for most attractions  and this hotel is not in walking distance to metro  
P => Very good place Stayed for two nights with complete satisfaction The hotel is quite new and that shows from the cleanliness of both the lobby and the rooms Our room at   th floor was spacious  clean and comfortable  see the pics The restaurant was good as well and the staff was simply lovely Definitely go there  
P => Top Notch A travel buddy and I stayed at this hotel on   separate occasions and we loved it  The rooms were great  The staff was excellent  We actually walked back from Tiannamin square to the hotel through the Wangfujing shopping area  The bell hop helped us plan most of the daily travel and had a car reserved for each day we needed him  There is a starbucks across the alley way for the coffee drinkers  
P => loved it  It was tucked on a back street but a short walk to the shops  The major sights were a bit farther but also within walking distance  The staff was wonderful  The hotel is new  so the rooms were modern and well appointed with american current in the bathroom for our appliances   I liked the scale of the hotel  not too big  I have stayed in other hotels in Beijing  but so far  this is my favorite  I would return  Also  for what it s worth  they were building a Starbucks right across the walkway from the front door  
P => Sleek Lovely Fantastic Location Park Plaza We had an absolutely lovely stay at the Park Plaza  Sleek  new  Asian interiors  Fantastic location right off Wangfujing with a serene atmosphere and lovely service  The family with us has stayed at the Peninsula and the other top two hotels in Beijing and said that the rooms at the Park Plaza were bigger and as nice for probably much less than half the price  The only thing missing was the giant  super fancy lobby  However  the lobby at the Park Plaza was lovely as well and had an intimate  calm atmosphere  Easy walk to the night market on Wangfujing Street  Highly recommended  One of our rooms was upgraded to a suite and it was two full rooms with two full baths  very luxe  
P => Comfortable stay in hot summertime This hotel is ideal for travelers not interested in complete luxury but in clean comfortable modern accommodations  The rooms were decent sized  the bathrooms were spotless  and the lobby was warm and inviting  The only downside is the expensive Internet station  but overall highly recommend this property  
P => Great Place to Stay This hotel proved to be excellent value  The quality of the rooms was good  the staff were friendly and helpful  and there was little to complain about  All the comments and reviews from previous Trip Advisor reports proved to be accurate and set appropriate expectations  the hotel is tucked away behind the Regency Hotel and taxi drivers do struggle to find it  but once you get there the cards provided by the hotel provide good directions in chinese to major attractions and the hotel for outings and that return trip I need to make special mention of the concierge staff  who were just fabulous  They provided a good language bridge for communication problems  and came up with great solutions for our plans during our week stay at the hotel  They were much more helpful than any other concierges I have dealt with in the past  and they were always careful to make sure we were safe The lounge staff in the hotel were keen as mustard to please  and tried very hard  but their inexperience in hospitality was obvious  with some memorable moments  One needs to be patient and understanding with the lounge staff   they want to be good and with time and practice  I think they will get there Overall we were very pleased with the hotel and would not hessitate to stay there again  
P => Great hotel in Beijing Booked this through American Express  paid approx     I was hesitant and debated between Holiday Inn and the Plaza because many of the reviews I read mentioned problems with communication but I ve found the important staff are able to communicate and the concierges are excellent  Both conceirges I ve dealt with spoke great english  were very knowledgeable and helpful  Initial problem for taxi s to find the hotel as it is tucked away behind the regent but once you re here the hotel provides a map as well as a business card  The map is great as it shows you key destinations in the area with both english and chinese so you can show taxi drivers etc  The business card has these destinations as well as some other helpful phrases  We got someone in the Airport to phone the hotel to provide us a chinese version of the name and address From a business travel purspective I was really pleased to see all the plugs are adaptable for multi country so you don t need an adaptor  Something many hotels can learn from  I d rate the rooms better than most hotels I ve stayed at feven or higher rates The breakfast buffet is good although pricey for Beijing  I would suggest you roam a little and eat in some of the local restaurants  
P => Pretty good value I stayed her for   weeks in y       Overall a pretty good hotel at a good value  It s not the nicest hotel in Beijing but it s probably the best value  I managed to get it for under     night  and that included internet access  It is in a very good location  walking distance to Wangfujing and the Forbidden City  The rooms are   star quality  The beds are pretty confortable and the tv offers up quite a few US channels  The bathrooms are nice On the down side I don t like the following   no pool  it s hidden behind the Regent hotel and not taxis can find it  in total I ve checked into this hotel   times and they have screwed up my resevervation  date  price  room  everytime  I have yet to get into my room in under    minutes   the towels are paper thin 
P => Fantastic Hotel    Great hotel in Beijing  Really good location  about    minutes walking from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City  and   minutes from the main comercial area  The Concierge was really helpful and had really good english  The rooms were new and modern  The breakfast was ok  it was not included and for China it s a little pricy  but you have a Starbucks near  so    Would definately come back to this hotel  
P => Great hotel  This hotel was great  The price was right especially for the weekend  I found the staff very helpful and accommodating especially the concierge  The rooms are nicely appointed  and although they all pretty much look the same  there is a nice character to them in terms of decorations  The room service is also very good and very prompt  The location is also great  just a few blocks from the Wangfujing shopping street  The only thing that I would advise against is the   RMB Minute internet  Try to find an internet cafe in the area  I would definitely stay here again  
P => Great hotel loved it We stayed for   nights  and booked the hotel based upon the reviews here on tripadviser  It lived up to expectations Location is great  a       minute walk from Wangfujing Street  Forbidden City  Tienenmann Square  Staff was very friendly and helpful  arranging trips for us  writing directions in Chinese for the taxi drivers  mailing our postcards Even with Chinese directions  many taxi drivers had a hard time finding the hotel  It is tucked away off the main street behind Jinbao Tower  Coming in from the airport was a challenge since we ourselves could not help the driver  however once we knew where it was we were able to gesture to show the driver where to go once we approached the road it was on The room was very comfortable and everything worked perfectly  A C worked great  The complimentary in room broadband internet access worked without problem  though it was a little slower than I expected Morning breakfast buffett was awesome  with a tremendous selection of American and Asian food  It was a little expensive compared to the cost of the room  but that I think is a minor complaint All in all  we had a very good experience at this hotel and will definitely stay again  
P => I d Go Back Good location  If you don t mind exercise  it s within walking distance of Wangfujing Street  St  Joseph s Church  Oriental Plaza  Donghuamen Night ket  the Forbidden City  Tiananmen Square  the Museum of Chinese History    and even Liulichang Culture Street if you re up for a bit of a hike  Only a       RMB  around    US  cab ride from the Back Lakes  Prince Gong s Mansion and the Sanlitun Clothing ket Some taxi drivers didn t know where the hotel was because it is set back from the street  But if you show a map with the Jinbao Tower marked out in Chinese characters  you should be able to get there  In front of the hotel  there were showrooms for Rolls Royce  Lamborghini  Ferrari and Maserati  Behind the hotel  there was a hutong  traditional neighborhood  that we never got around to exploring There s a Starbuck s across from the entrance to the hotel  The cake  pastries  coffee and juice there were cheaper  and better  than the Continental breakfast served at the hotel  And there s a beer garden outside the hotel  with bottled beers and beer on tap  And in the Jinbao Tower  there are ATMs that allow transactions with foreign bank cards If you book through Expedia  make sure to print out a hard copy of your itinerary or e mail confirmation  since the hotel reception desk requires this at sign in  The staff was courteous  helpful and friendly  Many spoke passable English  Even housekeeping staff had learned some English phrases directly related to their work My only complaints are minor  First  the water pressure for the toilet wasn t all that good  although the water pressure in the shower was okay and the water drained fine   Second  the gym is pretty basic  with nothing but free weights  a running machine and stationary bike or two and a weight bench  No swimming pool  Third  not much of a view from the room we had  Fourth  the Continental breakfast was skimpy and overpriced All in all  it was a clean  decent  attractive  well situated hotel  
P => Loved it  We stayed at this hotel for one night  and we loved it  We wished we can stay there longer  The hotel is very new  clean  and nice  The hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful  Everything is very westernized  and everyone can speak English which made my boyfriend  non chinese speaker  feel very comfortable  We will definitely stay there again whenever we go to Beijing again  
P => Internet expensive and Concierges don t know the city well enough The hotel regarding location  dining  room etc    is fantastic only   slight negatives after our stay of a week to look out for    INTERNET  If you don t have your computer and use the internet in the hotel s business centre it is very expensive at RMB  a MINUTE  Cheaper to take walk   min or take a taxi  RMB    to an internet cafe nearby which costs RMB  an HOUR  The internet places are open all night  have about     computers  all computers have headsets and microphones if you want to Skype someone and they even sell icecreams at RMB   each  EUR         CONCIERGES  The various concierges at the hotel can sometimes not write down precise enough instructions for the taxi drivers which can leave you stuck at the requested location s nearby bus station instead of the requested shopping mall and they don t seem to know enough about Beijing  When we asked about a visit to the underground tunnels  the nearest supermarket etc    the concierges admitted they just didn t know or they advised us a place which we discovered in the end was further away  As a result this unfortunately left us sometimes with the need to find out thing for ourselves  Overall the hotel is wonderful and we will definitely return there again but in our opinion these   things could be improved and are something to look out for  
P => Best value in Beijing I have to admit that I booked the hotel due to the trip advisor review  I have never stayed in a park plaza before and even though I travel a lot  I decided to see how truly accurate all of these reviews actually are Simply said  they are right  even down to the banana bread  posted by another reviewer   ps it is excellent   They even have a heater behind the mirror in the bathroom  so after a shower  the mirror isn t fogged up completely ohh can i please say  COMPLIMENTARY internet  Why do you have to pay US       a day in other hotels  We all have it at home and it costs that much a month  These guys give it to you for free  which i think is very nice The hotel is literally behind the Regent hotel and about a    minute walk to tianamen square  this is my third visit to beijing and the first time i ve actually been happy with my hotel   it s a very big and spread out city   this place is very central  The hotel is excellent   frankly I m not sure why anyone would spend double the money for the regent  but it s the same company so I guess they are segmenting the market   Ok the basics  the room is modern  clean and has all you would expect from a     star hotel  the buffet is good  and while not over the top  it just means that I don t spend all morning eating too much  it s got everything you need plus a few extras like really good banana bread  The taxi drivers can find the place which is also a plus  ps take the hotel card if you ever want to get home again and don t speak chinese One tip  The concierge s there are very good  Each night I asked for restaurant recommendations and unlike some hotels that just send you to their normal run of the mill foreigner places  the guys at the desk really tried to find interesting and excellent places  Another suggestion is ask for the  south beauty  restaurant in the shopping centre  I know is sound strange but the concierge went there  and suggested it  It has been one of the best meals in china I ve had  and I ve had many   i ve included a photo of the business cardOverall this is an excellent hotel and it really is very good value  it s got everything you need and want  and one thing that I like that is really lacking in many chinese hotels  Soft beds  
P => BEST PLACE In BEIJING We arrived in Beijing on          and stayed for one night  I only wished I could stay longer  The hotel was fantastic  the breakfast was delicious and the service was wonderful  I will definitely stay there again  Good location  too  
P => Cosy and convenient hotel I have been to Beijing for many times  This is the first time for me staying in this hotel  To my surprise  it located very near Wangfujing central  It takes about   mins walk  If you were first time travelling to Beijing  I would recommend this hotel  The hotel is small but clean and comfortable  I also got a very good rate via hotel website  
P => great staff and free broadband internet We stayed for   night at the Park Plaza upon arrival in Beijing and before flying to Lhasa Tibet the very next day  The room was very nice and the staff was extremely helpful  We only had an email from our Tibetan travel agent regarding the flight to TIbet and I wanted to make sure that we were actually booked on the Air China flight  The staff took a lot of time to call Air China and confirm that we were on the flight  They also verified that we had the proper Tibet permit to go to Lhasa All in all  a very pleasant experience  We also really liked the free internet For the Starbucks addicts  there is an outlet right across the street  Another benefit is the somewhat secluded location of the hotel from the main street  reduced noise from the street   
P => Great Value Stayed at the Park Plaza for a several days spanning from the end of  to the beginning of e       Overall  I would recommend this hotel because of its central location  moderate price  and great comfort The hotel is located in the busy Wangfujing district   this means it s within walking distance to Beijing s premier shopping strip which is overflowwing with stores and people all day  Also  nearby are many local eateries  a bakery across the street  great for morning baos   and a Starbucks literally steps from the entrance Additionally  the hotel is pretty posh for it s nightly rate  The room I stayed in contained double beds and was able to accomodate luggage for   people  The workspace was adequate and the internet connection was good   internet is complimentary  The bathroom was clean and decent sized  I also used the gym  and it was good since the equipment was maintained  All in all  a modern hotel The only area requiring improvement is their customer service  The front desk was slow and the concierge was mediocre  neither were overly friendly  The bellhops  however  were mostly cordial and greeted us morning and night  
P => Mostly impressed We stayed at the Park Plaza for five nights in  and  as the title suggests  were mostly impressed by it  It s a newish hotel  very swish entrance  the rooms were spacious and very clean and the location is great   just a short walk to Wangfujing Mall  loved the night food market    while there were some older style alleys on the other side of the hotel that made for a great morning s exploring  The concierge  the gift store staff and the staff at the in house Oodles restaurant were lovely and friendly   but the reception desk staff not so much  more abrupt and less helpful  Every time we tried to change money  they d tell us to come back later   after three tries  we gave up and found ATMs instead  Also  the staff in the breakfast room were run off their feet and showed us to tables that either were still being used by people or hadn t been cleared  half full coffee cups on them   So overall  I d rate it a very good hotel  but not a great one  
P => Couldn t ask for better Based on the TripAdvisor rating  we booked the Park Plaza at the beginning of our trip  and we liked it so much that we also stayed there at the end of our vacation  The rooms are exactly what you need after a     hour flight  spotless and comfortable  lovely soft beds  fluffy sheets  gleaming bath room  excellent water pressure in the shower   The staff is friendly and accommodating for whatever one could need  be it a dinner reservation  suggestions on what to see and do  or help booking tickets for travel elsewhere in China  The restaurant and bar are pleasant as well   in all  an excellent place to stay in Beijing  
P => Simply Wonderful Stayed at the hotel for   nights  amp  it was wonderful  The hotel is very new and the location is great  about   min stroll to Wangfujing I booked   standard rooms on the internet and thought I had a really good deal  However on the day before my departure  I checked on the rates again and was shocked to see that the rates have dropped by RM    per room per night  Anyway  when I got there  I made a little fuss and in the end I got free breakfast throughout my stay  I also requested for a connecting room and to my surprise  the connecting room seemed to be a suite as it has a seperate lounge study room  The rooms are big  amp  new and the beds are very comfortable  We had a little problem with the airconditioning as it refuses to get to the temperature we want There was not much of a view as the hotel is behind Regent but the room still get pretty much sunlight I had a great time there and I ll definately stay at the hotel again  
P => Great hotel good price and location I really enjoyed staying at this hotel  The staff have all been very helpful  my room had free broadband and was spotless  I ordered room service for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent service and food  If you book at this hotel check out their internet rates as I managed to get a great rate through their website  Once I arrived at the hotel I was given a free room upgrade too  The location is great for visits to many of the downtown sites and shopping  The only thing I would say is if you want to get a feel for  quot real Beijing quot  spend a night or two at a hotel located in a Hutong  it s a totally different experience  However  if you re here on business or prefer the luxuries of an international chain then by all means choose the Park Plaza it s well worth it  
P => Great hotel with good location Stayed here with my husband in  for   nights  Staff were really helpful  nice and friendly  The location was fantastic within walking distance to all the shops  Buffet breakfast was good with lots to choose from  We ate in a couple of the restaurants and they were quite good too  Would definitely stay here again  
P => excellent hotel in the heart of Beijing very high standard hotel at reasonable prices  comfortable rooms  very friendly staff with good english  location near forbidden city 
P => Nice Hotel in a Difficult City After reading the glowing reviews of the Park Plaza  I think my expectations were a little high    that being said  after   days of navigating one of my least favorite cities  it was definitely a nice refuge  For the most part  the staff speaks english  which was helpful  There is free wireless internet access in the rooms  which are comfortable and modern  The location is good as far as I can tell  it always seemed to take forever to get anywhere with the traffic  obviously not the hotel s problem   BONUS  there is a starbucks     feet from the front of the hotel  Yeah My one disappointment with the room was the bathtub shower  The tub was clogged and backed up with water rapidly  and the shower curtain is cloth  not plastic   which did not keep water in  The room was always soaked  And it smelled moldy  We dealt with it  but it wasn t ideal  
P => Vanilla My wife and I stayed at the Park Plaza Wangfujing for two nights                My first recommendation for this hotel is to make certain you have the hotel name written down in Chinese prior to getting in a taxi  The hotel is not well known amongst Beijing taxi drivers  at least not the dozen or so I asked to take us to the Park Plaza I hate to start on a sour note  but the check in was simply awful  The hotel clerk  while friendly enough  must have been on his first day  He did manage to get us checked in with the help of a colleague  but when he refused to change a hundred so that I could tip the bellman I realized he was plain incompetent The rooms are fine   clean sheets  nice bed  tv  free wired internet  mini bar and safe  The bathroom is a good size and the towels are clean  Ladies   bring your own conditioner  The best part about the hotel is the housekeeping staff  The room was impeccably clean and the turn down service a nice touch  The room service is prompt and the food passable  About    USD per meal per person  The breakfast is average serving low quality juices  asian and western standards and an omelet stand I do not recommend the tours booked by the concierge  The prices are about double what you would pay at the local tour agents  Particularly annoying is the fact that the Park Plaza is the second of nine hotels on the coach pick up tour  Therefore a six hour tour to the Great Wall took eight hours while we stopped at every hotel in Dongcheng and the CBD both ways  The tours also include and stop a a  Silk Museum  which is a blatant scam  Book a private car for tours if you have the means In conclusion  I would recommend this hotel  However  I am not sure why it would merit such a high ranking on trip advisor  The staff is fair  the rooms are standard and the food average  The value for money is fine  The location is the best part about the place  The Park Plaza Wangfujing is a safe bet  but nothing special Good luck in your travels  
P => loved this hotel This was my first trip to beijing  prior to choosing this hotel i had read the reviews posted  I am so glad i chose this hotel   The staff were amazing  the hotel was new  chic and very clean The rooms were large and cleaned with perfection The buffet breakfast was fantastic  the breakfast choices were roatated daily  The location is perfect  situated off the main road  Walking distance to Wangfujing Street I highly recommend this hotel  Brisbane  Australia 
P => Great Location Great Hotel Stayed at Park Plaza for   nights at the end of the Trans Siberian Train journey and it was simply blissful  Friendly staff  central location  great breakfast and spanking new premises  Fully recommended  
P => Worth every penny This is my first trip to Beijing  By accident I booked two hotels  the Park Plaza and the Sino Swiss by the airport  Thank god I did this because the Sino Swiss is an absolute DUMP  Please see my review for that hotel The Park Plaza is a very beautiful and modern hotel  From the second you walk through the very cool revolving front door you know your in a very special hotel  Granted I have not stayed in other hotels in Beijing  but I would defintiely stay here again My rate was     RMB for which i recieved a great   room suite  When you walk in you enter a small foyer which leads you to the sitting and work area  Great desk over looking the city  very comfy couches  which I took a nice arrival snooze on The bathroom is fantastic  seperate  hot and strong  shower and toilet  beautiful bath and great sink  I happen to think that the most important features of a room should be a good shower bathroom  amp  a comfortable bed  This hotel has both The buffet breakfast caters to both western and eastern pallets  Plenty to choose from  Fresh egg station was really good  Breakfast was included in my rate I only had two small issues  one is the check in which took a little while and the second is the internet which keeps cutting in and out A quick hop in a taxi        RMB  will get you to Tian an Men Square and the Fobidden City  I will write seperate reviews on these two must see attractions Taxi to and from the airport will run about     RMB Great hotel  Will stay here again  
P => Great Hotel  I always read the reviews posted on tripadvisor before planning a trip  After finding out that this hotel is voted as the  rd most popular hotel in Beijing  I immediately checked out their website after seeing the average price per night  I had got a special rate of     CAD night  including breakfast  I really don t think that at this price  there is a hotel that can compete with the location  cleanliness  and service  The concierge staff was excellent in providing us with information on tours and helping us get around the city  I would highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to return  
P => Would stay there again The staff were always helpful  The rooms were immaculate and very comfortable  The location   a few minutes walk to Wangfujing Street   was excellent  The buffet breakfast was one of the best I ve had  and the lounge bar was a great place to relax after a busy day of sightseeing  I d definitely stay there again  
P => A pleasant stay     I recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza Wangfujing for   days and   nights the location is superb  just a stone s throw away from the Wangfujing Night market and   mins brisk walk to Quanjude  the famous peiking duck restaurant  Most taxi drivers know where it is as well The hotel staff were friendly and top marks to the concierge and bellboys for going through great lengths in helping me retrieve a package i left on my trolley whilst getting into a taxi at the airport    and realising it only after   hours    Could not have asked for better bunch of people  Most of them spoke English although some  rather basic  what I liked was the  D location map of Beijing  provided by the hotel to all guests  It also indicated approximate taxi fares to the popular tourist locations from the hotel  in order to prevent you from being taken for a ride by the taxi drivers literally  Only down side was the lack of breakfast buffet variety   it didnt change one bit in   days    after the  rd day  I could decide what I wanted for breakfast whilst in the shower   POverall  will not hesitate to stay at this hotel the next time I am in Beijing again  
P => Perfect Location for a weekend stay Wife and I stayed here for   nights and it was within walking distance to the Forbidden City   lt    minutes  and subway stop  Dongdan   Easy to get to shopping and food    blocks from Wangfujing St   Customer facing staff spoke excellent english and always made sure that the taxis got the directions right before you left the hotel  Great breakfast buffet as well  Will definitely stay here again if we re back in town  
P => First rate hotel Great hotel  large rooms with every amenity conceivable  Great buffet and very friendly  accommodating staff who spoke excellent English  The rooms were overheated  however  and the temperature could not be adjusted  Also  the lobby bar is understocked if you like martinis  
P => Highly recommended Where do I start  The concieger was superb   got me a phone card at midnight    got me a newspaper as I sat in the lobby waiting for my ride  The entire staff spoke English and understood my everyword smashing decor in the entire hotel  The hotel was very modern  amp  clean The room  amp  bathroom was very clean The water temperature could cook a Lobster Do try the Japanese noodle restaurant located on the first floor  Very affordable and very yummy  I could eat there everyday see attachement for their menu selections Breakfast buffet was a plus  Cater more toward westerners There s a traditional Beijing restaurant   blocks from the hotel that offers good local dishes   walk out and make a right on Wangfujing street Anyways  I could go on Your getting a great hotel without the heavy price tag I paid     including the breakfast This is why I gave it a   stars Bottom line  I will stay here next time I m in town 
P => Great little hotel Very nice hotel  lovely large rooms with new items  Only issue is the heating  which they tell me is a problem with the thermostat and a temporary problem  Great location  very friendly service and good price  Overall  just great  
P => Great service love it This was a fantastic hotel  Fairly new  so the accomodations were crisp and clean  The concierge was so kind and patience  I m sure they remember us for our thousands of questions  for which they had answers to almost every one   Rooms were spacious with internet connection  The hotel is on a strip with lots of other big hotels so the area is well known  However  the hotel is behind a business office tower  so it shields it from noise  We looked out our window to some water fountains below  very peaceful  Prb a    cab ride to the Forbidden City and Tienammen Square  The hotel can also get you reservations at almost any show or restaurant and have the tickets delivered that day to your door  Breakfast was good with lots of variety and included in the price  Would definetely stay again

P => Good hotel   a bit far from the city center We stayed in this hotel for three nights and enjoyed our stay  We were in a large room with a free internet connection available directly on the TV  The hotel staff was very friendly although their english was a bit poor The hotel is located about    minutes drive from the city center  Except that it is not really conveniant  it s not a big deal since taxi fares are really low and it is usually easy to find one We would definitly return it that hotel  
P => Very nice hotel Hotel was very good although it boasts four stars it s more like three stars  The hotel is owened and run the police dept       Yes thats right  the cops own and run the hotel  Can t complain really about it  Only thing was after a week of staying there I had to ask them to changethe bed sheets and vacuum the floor  But i mean i had a large flat screen with free internet in my kingsize bedroom  Staff had limited english but were usually willing to help where possible  Infact the manager  female  asked me out one day   lets just say not only the weather was hot     
P => Great Value  I am writing this review at the Peixin   the computer in the room is an excellent bonus  I have just read the previous reviews and would like to comment that this is my  th hotel in China and the beds are the same firm matress everywhere  so that is a non issue  There only IS one English language TV channel   CCTV channel     in China  so you can t blame the hotel for that  Yes  the hotel is a taxi ride from Tian amin Square but the ride is    Yuan   les than      and takes    minutes  which makes this hotel great value  The rooms are clean  my single has a king bed  and the room is quite spacious  The breakfast buffet is very good and great value for    yuan   served from      to       I had a problem with this computer and housekeeping was at my door within   minutes to solve the problem  The hotel is non smoking which is a pleasant change from most hotels in China  and is listed as a  quot Green Hotel quot   I booked on line and the price was a lot cheaper than the posted rack rate at the hotel  I would definitely recommend the Peixin   great value for the money  
P => very nice hotel The hotel is very near Hongquiao market and some malls  The staff are quite friendly and helpful  though some may have difficulty in speaking English  You can exchange your dollars to yuan at the front desk  Before going out  ask the front desk clerk to write in chinese characters the place where you would like to go to  The room is big enough for two people  There are no good views though  one side faces a school area and some residential areas  Overall  i think the place is wonderful and i will definitely will stay there again when i go back to Beijing  
P => Great Hotel is nice  Rooms very clean  Front desk staff have limtied knowledge of English BUT they do their best  There is a small gift shop that sells trinkets and personal items should you need them  The hotel is convenient to Pearl Shoping ket  It is about a    minute walk  Streets perfectly safe to walk around  There are a few small stores around  a McDonalds just down the street  The morning breakfast buffet at hotel is good  The coffee needs work though   so does most of China There is an atm machine in hotel  They also have a currency exchange at front desk  They take most currency at reasonable rates  Beds are firm as in most chinese hotels  There are computers in rooms with free internet access  It can get frustrating using them as they have a Chinese keyboard and you need to type all IN CAPS in order for the English not to convert over to chinese  Still  sending a quick email home without costing anything was great  Limited english speaking television  
P => A good comfortable hotel in a city that is changing before your eyes  I stayed at this hotel for a few nights and found it very pleasant  the room was very comfortable and spotless  I even had my own chinese dressing gown and the view was interesting with the ten lanes of traffic and young lads stopping buses with red flags The breakfast was a mixture of eastern and western and was nice  the loby area contains a bar which was relaxing to sit in at the end of the day and is not expensive for a four star hotel  The staff were pleasant and the whole hotel was spotless really Regarding the location  the hotel is situated on one of the ring roads that circle Beijing  which is such a massive City  if you are on a tour this will not affect you  the nearest underground is a very long walk away but taxis are cheap and can take you to all the sites like the Forbidden City  Temple of Heaven  Tianamen Square etc If you leave the hotel on foot and walk past the KFC parallel to the road for about fifteen minutes you will come to an area the contains a pocket of Beijings fast disappearing hutongs  which are like little houses in very narrow lanes  where not so long ago the whole of the city was populated with these dwellings  only here there is no guided tours for westerners  I also came across an interesting market in the same area which was pretty big and there were all kinds of things on sale  again with the area around the hotel being so far out  this was purely for the locals and I got some currious looks here but not unpleasant  With the pace of change in Beijing I doubt that this kind of place will exist in this city for much longer I forgot to add that opposite the hotel on the other side of the ring road there is a nice restaurant  I can t remember the name but it is up a flight of stairs  you will have to walk to the crossing to get to it  
P => great hotel for the price have stayed at plaza many times over past   years  always go back as it is great value for money  very clean  modern  great massages  food so so but when in beijing you should be eating at restaurants  
P => Much better than Hotels in UK As a frequent traveller I was very pleasantly surprised by just how good the hotel is  The room was quiet  pleasant  well equipped and clean and the staff most friendly and helpful  In the UK I have spent many years having to stay in upper range hotels for work and finding a quiet room where one stood a chance of a good night s sleep was  in cities  very difficult  The      a m  start for breakfast was spot on  unlike many UK hotels where they are never ready on time   I was the only foreigner who dined in the Chinese restaurant and the food and the service was just superb  Although not in the very centre of town it is only a short and very cheap taxi ride  considerably less than a bus fare for a comparable journey in the UK  took me to where I wanted to go  I would be pleased to stay there again  
P => Nice    The hotel is very high standard   staff are very friendly and have good english  Hotel is spotless and all amenties are excellent  rooms have all facilities and are really good  
P => Great Value I have stayed in this hotel a few times  Pro  The rooms are very nice and modern  Staff is friendly  It s is quiet  The breakfast buffet is great  At below RMB     is  a steal Con  The location is a bit inconvenient and it s a long long walk to the subway station I will stay there again on my next rip  
P => Not an ideal location The hotel itself is great  and the staff were friendly and helpful  The rooms are clean  spacious and comfortable  with a fridge and good size bathroom  with bath   Previous reviews have mentioned hard beds  our beds were fine  but our bed at home is hard anyway  We had an additional bed for our    year old son  this was fine  better that a lot of  put ups   They also give you a bottle of water for each person each day  Breakfast was plentiful and good  both Chinese and Western  Although the tea was luke warm  coffee was fine  The only complaint is the location of the hotel  there is nowhere to actually walk to  There are a few shops  mainly mobile phone shops and curio antiques  Also like all the other hotels it is on the side of the main roads  The dinner in the hotel was one of the worse we had throughout the holiday  we ate there twice  There is a cafe on site where you can buy cakes  which we did and they were quite nice  But salavation is at hand  there is KFC next door  and although they don t speak much English  they do have a menu you can point at  The only reason I would not stay there again is due to the location  nothing wrong with the hotel itself  
P => Wonders of China Very modern hotel  plenty of facilities  very good food   Hotel has got cards printed for taxi drivers so you can  quot show quot  them what you d like to see in Beijing  There s too much to see    Apart from climbing the Great wall  taking thousands of pictures in Forbidden city  Summer Palace  Tiananmen Square  walking down the Sacred way to Ming Tombrs with stone animals and statues on both sides   it is much recommended to hurry up and see the old Beinjing on rickshaws  before it s all destroyed for the Olympics  if you like your bargains  should go to many excellent markets  so much better than Turkish ones   it s wrong but they re such a good quality it makes me wonder whether they re not stolen       
P => Fair to middling This is a China rated   star hotel located in the Chaoyang District  The room I stayed in showed visible signs of wear but was comfortable and clean  The bed was a typical China hotel bed  hard as a rock and not very comfortable  My stay was one night and I was not able to walk around outside but a map indicated that Curio City is not too far away though probably outside of walking distance The hotel is on a busy street and street sounds could be heard    floors up  The breakfast buffet was average with a fair selection of food  When I ate at      AM  the seating was full and the option was to wait or share a table with strangers  This might be fine for those wishing to meet others  it can provide a grumpy morning start to others  There were a number of tourists seen at breakfast The airport is located about    km away and it took approximately    minutes by taxi at   AM during a weekday with traffic  
P => wonders of china Beijing is absolutely incredible  and our experienced was enhanced at our   nights at the Plaza Hotel  Excellent value for money  clean  super service  and a pleasureable manner with all the staff  They went out of their way to assist us with the food  We are  quot  Kosher quot   amp  they did everything to ensure that we had our meals without problems  Have only one small complaint  the beds were a little hard  but we were so exhausted from sightseeing that we fell asleep immediately  Very quiet  and a very nice Hotel  Thoroughly recommended  Met a lot of Israeli s who had the same opinions as ourselves  Thank you Plaza Hotel for such an experience  We shall return Anthony  amp  Gloria Hyatt Cardiff Wales  United Kingdom 
P => The Plaza is a modern slightly better than a Holiday Inn business hotel  Summary The Plaza is a modern  slightly better than a Holiday Inn  business hotel  It is an inexpensive taxi ride away from most of Beijing s major sites When and why we stayed Stayed for three nights in ember      during a Highlights of China tour Cost The hotel was included in the overall cost of our holiday Room Our room was clean and well furnished with new modern furniture  The large double bed was comfortable  Facilities included TV  tea  amp  coffee making facilities  Mini Bar  hair dryer  and desk  The bathroom was clean  with shower gel  shampoo  tooth brushes etc provided free of charge  Two bottles of complimentary water were left for us each day The Hotel  The Plaza is a modern business hotel  It has several restaurants  including Chinese  a coffee shop and Japanese restaurant  The buffet breakfast in the coffee shop was very good  with east meets west food  fruit  dim sum  cereals  noodles  bacon  rice  and cooked to order omelettes  Dinner for two in the coffee shop  soup  main courses  and beer cost     yuans The hotel s laundry service is excellent   it cost    yuans to get a pair of jeans cleaned  They were returned to our room within hours  The staff were friendly  spoke English far better than we speak Mandarin  and were helpful  When we had a problem with our toilet a repair man arrived promptly  Internet access in the business centre costs   yuans per minute with a    minutes minimum  Location The hotel is situated on Beijing s Third ring road  The nearest Metro Station  Guomao  at The World Trade Centre is a    yuans taxi ride away  To reach Tiannamen Square by taxi costs         yuans  There are few restaurants or shops in the immediate vicinity of the hotel  There is a KFC next door  Panjiayuan  Beijing s biggest antique market is within walking distance of the hotel The city We were amazed how modern  western  and huge Beijing is  We were amazed to discover the city has    Starbucks  Katie Melua can never have visited Beijing  There are far more cars than bicycles on the city s American wide roads  which including its six ring roads are mobbed all day with motorised traffic jams  Must sees within the city are Tiannamen Square  The Summer Palace  and The Forbidden City  The Silk ket on Chang an Avenue is worth a visit for the lover of inexpensive high quality faux designer gear  
P => signs of old Beijing I stayed at this hotel because of a conference i was attending here  The location was excellent  but the hotel is a bit old and dated  without particular charm to compensate  The hard beds were a real problem Although the food was good  the breakfast arrangements were a bit of a shambles  I wouldn t have classed this as   star as it is advertised  
P => Good Hotel We stayed here for several nights as part of a tour of China  so as the hotel was included in the tour  I have no idea of the price and whether or not it is value for money The public areas are not as spacious as some hotels we stayed at in China  and the room was adequate rather than enormous  It was clean and well presented  however The staff were helpful  and I used the internet in the business centre without diffculty and at a reasonable price We only had a set  quot Western quot  dinner here  organised by the tour company  and this was a mistake as there was no choice and difficulties in getting alternative dishes  Buffet breakfast was very good though The neighbourhood is a building site at present  and Beijing at this time of year was full of pollution  especially dust blown in from the Gobi desert  
P => Excellent hotel food availability in hotel somewhat peculiar I stayed at the Plaza Hotel from          till          while on a business trip to Beijing  The hotel is rated     The hotel is very modern  well kept and certainly very clean  There is free high speed broadband available  both wired and wireless  The wireless beacon signal is somewhat odd  I could get the signal in one position  but if I were to move my laptop by just a centimeters  I would lose signal  Wired connection was great  As for food availability in the hotel  if you want to have room service  there are effectively   Oriental dishes available only  wonton noodles and tempura   even though the menu lists much more  As I stayed up till quite late each night to talk to people back in the UK  I often got hungry and became a regular for their late night wonton noodles  The noodles were OK  though I have had better in various parts of SE Asia The hotel has   restaurants  one serving Western food and another serving Chinese food  In the Chinese restaurant  which was open from      till      and      till       some items on the menu were always  quot sold out quot  though the items available were excellent Their laundry service was excellent  The stated  quot regular service quot  was return of clothes by       though I got mine much earlier  by about      for clothes that left my room at about      I paid approx GBP    per night for the room  
P => Plaza very good We stayed at this hotel for three days and were very impressed  Very clean  comfortable and modern rooms  The food was uniformly excellent  particularly the breakfasts which were some of the best we ve ever had   juices  fruit  toast  bacon  eggs  cereals  tea and coffee  plus cold meats and cheeses or oriental foods I would recommend this place without hesitation  
P => 		
P => Good Quiet Hotel near Forbidden Ciy When we stayed here in y      the beds were what we in the US call  quot double beds quot   meaning two adults could sleep comfortably enough  unlike what many Chinese hotels call double beds which are really between a twin and a double and do NOT fit two adults comfortably  We had one room with two double beds for our family of four  and it was fine  much like  say  a riott  The marble tiled bathroom had a nice feature  a glassed in shower in addition to a tub with a shower  so two people could shower at the same time  perfect for our two kids   There was free WiFi in each room but we didn t pack our laptop  You could rent a laptop right in your room  or was it a desktop   but we used our BlackBerry to check email and write to our blog so we didn t go that route Our view was okay  looked out over Beijing  From rooms on the other side of the hotel  though  you could see the roofs of the Forbidden City  the back end of which is about a       minute walk from the hotel  Just outside the hotel door and to the left is a busy shopping street with restaurants  Further down the street  away from the hotel  the street is busier with more shopping opportunities if that suits you  not important to me on this trip   The staff were responsive when we needed them but we didn t have any problems so we didn t really test them  Check out was as expected  quick and accurate  The breakfast buffet is filled with Western and Chinese dishes  We didn t eat any other meals there so can t speak to that Over all  this was a safe  quiet hotel  which is exactly what I want when I m in a city  
P => Great Beijing Hotel In Comparison We stayed at one of their club level rooms in       for our    days holiday  Compare with the Best Western and Hiltons we stayed for long weekend breaks in the UK  we found the hotel was very clean with excellent services  We had own Breakfast area on the Club Floor   With plenty choice  Free afternoon tea and cakes   A plus for me    Check in  amp  out were smooth without any problems  Walking distant to the central shopping district  Tips  If you are looking for reasonable priced and clean food  walk to the shopping district  There is a food hall called  quot FoodRepublic dashidai quot  in the  quot Oriental Plaza quot  Shopping Centre where you could see the real finish dish or picture before your order  
P => Old hotel very central Big entrance  but rooms a bit out of date  Needs some renovation  I would say it is a better   star hotel  
P => Excellent hotel  one of the best I have ever been to I spend a week at the Prime Hotel on Wangfujing  The room was very comfortable and very big  the hotel offers some of the largest in rooms in Beijing I was told   had a sofa and a large desk with free internet  The bed was excellent  I liked the bathroom  very clean and stylish  The hotel supplied comfortable white slippers  toothpaste  toothbrush  combe  soap  all the luxury  The service was very good  My overall experience was that it felt like a home and provided a great escape from the often noisy streets of Beijing The location is great for Beijing  close to the main attractions  the shopping streets  som of the old hutongs  The subway is about a    minutes walk  but there are buses to the subway station  for those who dare using them  or otherwise there are always taxis in front of the hotel  Taxi is one of the easiest ways to travel in Beijing anyway and they are very reasonably priced The only downside is that the pool is rather cold  
P => Excellent hotel Stayed   nights at the Prime  Beds very comfortable  room extremely quiet and clean  apart from slightly grubby carpet  They supplied electric kettle and coffee and tea  and a minibar with space for our own drinks  Also free bottles of mineral water each day  Super bathroom with separate shower  which was excellent  Slippers and bathrobe supplied  Ate one evening in buffet which was expensive and not all that good  but we discovered they did good food in the coffee shop much cheaper so recommend that if you don t want to go out  But there are lots of cheap places to eat nearby  We found the room decoration a bit dark but it s Chinese style  and the furniture was in perfectly good condition and comfortable  Breakfast buffet was huge and excellent  Location is good  lots of small shops nearby and a supermarket a block away for supplies  Staff very friendly and helpful  Definitely recommended  
P => Excellent hotel We stayed here for three nights during a tour of China  our second tour of China  and this was our first destination on the tour The hotel was an excellent standard  with good food and excellent accommodation The hotel is situated centrally not far from Wanfujing which is the main shopping street in Beijing    the Oxford Street or  th Avenue  It is also not far from the Tiannenmen Square  Forbidden City  Drum Tower and Bell Tower We didn t eat dinner in the hotel but we did enjoy the excellent and wide ranging breakfast  There are many eating places nearby and all the key sights are handy  
P => Plus Points for Prime  We enjoyed our stay at Prime which was just about faultless  It s location is its main plus point with great shopping and all the sights nearby  The  local  shopping is also good and there s a supermarket nearby to get all the little stuff you need for your day trips  although we struggled to find fresh fruit   There s also a lovely little chain bakery about a   minute walk next to Dongsi station  opp corner from supermarket  which is good value and has a cosy seating area and possibly wifi  i was too busy stuffing my face on a delicious apple danish and thick hot chocolate too notice but someone nearby had their laptop out  We stayed on the  th floor which had a nice view over the city  or what you can see of it   Like the last reviewer  our room was  classic  but had some modern touches like a huge Plasma  nice throws  bedrunner etc It certainly wasn t run down and it looked like it had recently been renovated  The bed was huge and very comfy  The bathroom was spacious with both a bath and seperate shower We didn t have a breakfast package but we did sample room service was really delicious  keenly priced and efficient  We both had a heavy cold for the few days we were in Beijing and after our day trips we really appreciated coming  home  to a nice warm room  free HBO movies and that huge comfy bed  The staff were pleasant but their english was limited  The hotel seems popular with local businessman and the coffee shop bar was always busy  Overall  a great stay and i d highly recommend this place  Beijing was amazing and I can t wait to visit again  We had english speaking private tour guides for each day trip  we booked these through Flight Centre  and it was great to get the personal touch plus getting picked up and dropped after each tour  We also got the first day of snow on the Great Wall at Badaling which the Chinese consider lucky  It was amazing   don t hold off visiting China  it s a blast and the people are lovely  Happy travels  
P => Good value better location This Chinese run hotel is located in the heart of Beijing  A perfect jumping off point for western tourists visiting the red capital  This hotel is definitely not   Star and may not win any awards for service  But the rooms are clean  the beds are soft  and the breakfast buffet is bountiful A perfect place for families and tourists who are looking for something between holiday inn and four seasons If you want facilities like a nice pool and gym  then look elsewhere  That would be the biggest shortcoming  
P => Great Value and Nice Hotel Prime was a nice hotel  Location was pretty good and for the dollar  it was an excellent value  The pictures on the website both here and on the hotel s website do it justice  It s about   or   blocks      mile  from the pedestrian section of the Wangfung Street mall  That s close enough to enjoy  and far enough to be slightly off the beaten path and not feel like a tourist  Also  if you are budget traveler like me that enjoys a good value and using the local transport  then you re as close to a metro as you can get  You probably half to walk    minutes  and it only costs about    US cents  It doesn t go everywhere but it does go a few places  Lama Temple  Tiananmen Square  Temple of Heaven Prk   The door en were great too  and got taxis for you without hesitation  They also helped give directions  I use the matchbox from the ashtray in the dining room to show taxi drivers what hotel I was staying at  also has the address and phone number in Chinese   It has the name and address  so just flash it to the tax drivers  and they ll get you home  Taxis are very inexpensive  And you are about a    minute walk to Tiananmen Square Lots of folks on this site said they didn t do the restaurant  Personally  we had breakfast there several mornings and one lunch and one dinner  There are other options around for lunch and dinner  but the food is good and the prices are actually reasonable  for the buffet restaurants   It s easy to feel like you re paying too much because you can go out and hunt down cheaper food  but in reality I d pay the same or more if I went out here for any one of those meals in the states to just an average restaurant  The buffets were well stocked  and I never came close to eating the wide variety of items they had The room was nice size  and they did a great job with housekeeping  Firm beds  but very comfortable  and great pillows  Bathroom was well stocked  clean and good size We work out regularly and used the gym  It s older equipment and not great in quality  but it will get you through for a vacation  While we were there they re carpeted the gym and surrounding areas   that would have been my only real complaint  and they addressed it  Saw folks coming and going to the pool  but we never used  Only strange thing is that the hallway to the gym and pool is real dark   for some reason they keep the lights off  Only Complaints or Advice  There is monitor in the room with premium movies  in addition to the HBO you get included  and Internet Access  if you have wireless  it s free   I was investigating it and somehow on the final bill it appeared I had logged in for     second and got charged for one day s use  The difficult part is that we left about      am and no one spoke English  so we couldn t get it resolved  It s minor in the grand picture  but if you are leaving at off hours  perhaps you want to review your charges the day before during business hours when there will be staff who speak English  Only other tip  is that we hired the hotel car to take us to the airport at that      am time on a Sunday  Though it was about triple or quadruple the rate for a taxi  we figured it was a good investment to get to the right terminal  Sure enough  the driver didn t speak any English  nor did any staff at the hotel at that time  and we got dropped at the wrong Terminal for our flight  We had enough time to take an airport coach to the right one  but save your dime and just get a taxi  there were plenty even at      on a Sunday morning   The car was ok  but it wasn t anything special   just slightly nicer than a taxi  
P => Good Location Good Chinese hotel older style but clean and staff did there best to help where needed Location is good at the north end of Wangfujing road walking distance to the shops and restaurants and only    to    RMB for a taxi ride to most major attractions in Beijing  We book a Royal Regency Club room which gave us two rooms and breakfast  
P => Above average We spent   nights at Prime Hotel in il       Location  The hotel is located at the Wangfujing Str   Dongsi Str  crossing        mins walk to the biggest shopping malls at Wangfujing  The nearest Subway stations are  Dongsi     mins walk  and Wangfujing     mins walk   It takes about       min to get to the Forbidden City   depending which gate you choose  It is about    mins by taxi from the Beijing Capital Airport  The fare should not exceed         yuan if you take the official taxi  beware of scam taxi or unauthorized taxi drivers  Room  We have chosen the  quot Royal Regency Club Floor Room quot   The room was spacious  ca     sqm  and had everything what you could expect from the   star hotel  We have paid ca  EUR     per night    persons   the breakfast was included  TV with few English channels  CNN  ESPN   Free broadband internet access  wired  in the room  Both shower and the tub in the bathroom  As the Club Floor guest you get a separate check in on the Club Floor  on the   th floor   There are some snacks coffee tea offered in the afternoon in the Club Lounge Dining  the breakfast was OK  We did not eat the lunch or dinner there  I do not recommend the hotel bar   quite expensive and nothing special to offer Summary We were satisfied both from the room and the service we got  The biggest advantage is the location  The Forbidden City  Tienanmen Square  shopping malls at Wangfujing   everything in walking distance  The price is above average as for the Beijing  however it is adequate to the value you get  
P => An excellent value Stayed in this hotel for   days last summer and enjoyed it thoroughly  Service  as I have experienced in most Chinese hotels is very good and the room size was fine for a standard room  I also appreciated a roomy bathroom and firm bed The only downside I saw to this hotel was the location on end of Wafujing road  I think it would have been more convenient to be centrally located on the main drag  however the location still puts you near plenty of shops restaurants  Being on the end Wafujing  I also didappreciate that you could venture out to the more hole in teh wall type restaurants that really do not cater to tourists at all   we found some incredibly cheap and tasty eats within a few minutes walk We had Chinese speakers in our group  but I did notice that the staff spoke very limited English when compared to some of the other hotels I have stayed in Beijing  Shanghai  
P => Great hotel service buffet We stayed at the Prime as during our honeymoon  I let them know it when booking and our room was upgraded The breakfast buffet was one of the best we tried in Asia The staff was very kind and helpful  the concierge was able to suggests great restaurants and entertainment  they helped us with the taxis  even to book one to go the great wall Location is also convenient for walking and shopping Want to try other than typical chinese food too  ask for a korean grill nearby We would stay at the Prime again  Prime location  room  service  food  people  
P => Great hotel This is one of the nicest hotels I ve ever stayed in  My room was clean and the bed was very comfortable  The bathroom was larger than most hotel rooms that I have stayed in  The staff was friendly and accomodating  I had a problem with my electrical adapter and I was in the lobby for about    minutes trying to figure why it didn t work and by the time that I got back to my room  they had already put in an adapter for me  Great service  Great value for the money I paid also  approx     USD   
P => Nice but old hottel He stayed here one night on the way back to the states  Compared to the Hotels that we stayed at out in the sticks the Prime was absolutely wonderful Let s be a little realistic here  the Prime is an older hotel  As such  it has a few chips in the paint and a few eccentricities  However  the room was clean and  unusual for China  actually didn t smell like cigarettes  the bed was nice  the sheets were clean  the food was good and the location is wonderful I won t say that the Prime is the best hotel I ve ever stayed in but it is certainly a nice hotel and it is a great spot for your Beijing adventure  A good recommendation on this one  
P => Pretty Good for American Travelers We chose this hotel based on its rating on TripAdvisor  The rooms were fine and the non smoking was actually true  They had nice bathrooms and computers in each room for easy Internet access  Our only challenge was with English spoken by the front desk and the concierge  We struggled to communicate and have them find things on our map or make reservations  However  it was a fair price and a good location  Would recommend for several nights  
P => Wonderful location wonderful hotel We stayed at the Prime Hotel based on a recomendation from our travel agent  who has stayed there himself The Prime is conveniently located at the quiet end of Wangfujing  Beijing s modern shopping area with lots to see and do  It s also a reasonable walking distance to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City We opted to stay on the Club Level for a little more money  about     more  so      per night   At the Club Level we had a wonderful suite  our own concierge and our own longe for drinks and a buffet breakfast  You should really consider staying in the Club Level The hotel was very professionally managed  very clean and modern and the staff was very helpful and friendly  It was a wonderful hotel and we will stay there again on our next trip tp Beijong  
P => Prime hotel gets a prime review This was our first trip to China and we were a little intimidated  but once we arrived at the Prime hotel in Beijing we felt at ease  The front desk staff and concierge were very friendly  helpful  and spoke English fairly well  The bell boy even walked us down the street to a local resturant for dinner  The room was large  very clean and modern  For us the location of the hotel was perfect  we were able to walk to the forbidden city  tiananmen sq  temple of heaven  and several markets  I would definitely stay at the Prime hotel again  and I suggest you do the same  
P => Found the Prime less than Prime Just returning from a stay at the Prime  I upgraded to the Regency Club room and while the room was adequate  it was no great shakes  The biggest problem with the hotel is the totally inefficient air conditioning  The room was stifling and the air was dead  It became quite uncomfortable  Forget the exercise room  The stationary bikes are hazardous and the lights went out half way through my workout for no reason The rooms are a little dated but passable  And generally  the service ranged from ok to poor and indifferent  Perhaps I was spoiled by stays at the Xiamen Sheraton  great hotel  and the Hong Kong Harbour Plaza  likewise   both of which I found through TripAdvisor  but I can t recommend the Prime  Pony up a little extra and stay at one of the Western chains  
P => Great hotel handy location  My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel in      after deciding on it after reading all the reviews on this site We were upgraded on arrival and had the most gorgeous room with two showers     and a bath  The view was nice too with a temple in the distance that the sun would set behind  all the air pollution createsstunning sunsets   The breakfast was great and would set us up well through the day  The pool area is a bit dingy and they make you buy these ridiculous hats to swim in  It s too cold to stay in the pool so I wouldn t bother but doesn t affect your stay  The hotel is about  mins walk from the main shopping area of Beijing which is always buzzing and fun to wander around I had read that the hotel staff don t speak much English  but then no one does in China and we never found it to be a problem  We caughttaxi s everywhere and would get the staff to write our location in Chinese characters and then show it to the tax driver We had a great holiday in Beijing and in particular want to recomment quot Eddie quot  a driver who we hired to take us to the Great Wall of China  We were given his business card one night and hooking up with him wasthe best idea of our trip  For approx      he took us two two different sections of the wall and patiently waited  a long  full day   His English was great  he was friendly and his car was new and clean  We also got him to take us to the airport as we had an early morning flight and even at  am he was great  Thanks Eddie  
P => A Good Choice in Beijing My wife and I stayed for   nights in  and were very satisfied with the Prime  The location is excellent  very near the major sites in the Forbidden City area  The hotel was easily found by the airport cab   but have their name in Chinese characters   easily done at the tourist hotel booking office at the airport   The cab ride was    RMB or about      Stayed on the Executive    th  Floor  It included the breakfast buffet which we found to be very nice  The rooms were very large by normal hotel standards and the service was well above average  The hotel is on the main  quot tourist quot  thoroughfare in Beijing  so at night there is more than enough to do and many restaurants within walking distance  You feel quite safe on the streets of Beijing  and this area is no exception The staff s English was a bit weak  but someone could always be found to help  We did not have free internet access and even were billed for   days worth of service when we only used one   but management corrected the bill so it wasn t a problem I d recommend it to anyone and it s probably     less than the standard brands    ie riott  Sheraton etc  for very similar quality  
P => Enjoyed the Prime Stayed at The Prime for   nights and thoroughly enjoyed it  We stayed on the executive floor which included a buffet breakfast  which was a bit basic but you could always fill up on bacon  cereals  toast and meats We had a meal in the French restaurant one night which was expensive but very enjoyable  the main restaurant was good value and the food was not too bad Overall I would recommend The Prime and although it is unlikely I will ever return to Beijing again  if I did  then I would stay there again  
P => Nice Hotel   Good Location poor food Booked this hotel based on the review on this site and I have to say for the money  it is pretty good  The rooms are a good size  free internet access and clean and modern throughout  The Spa area is particularly good with very reasonable prices  It only takes about    minutes by taxi from the airport at a cost of about   The only down side is the food  having tried room service  it looked good but was not pleasant and even at a second attempt on one evening  the standards were poor  Having said that  many restaurants are only a    minute walk  
P => Excellent hotel in a great location I stayed at the Prime Hotel for   nights in ch     It was FABULOUS  The location was excellent     blocks from the Forbidden City and     blocks from shopping and restaurants on Wangfujing  Also  cabs all knew this hotel  so it was easy to communicate where we wanted to go  The level of English was great  and the bell boys  etc were extremely helpful  Great continental breakfast with a wide selection  Also compared to many hotels in Beijing  the beds were heaven  Very nice   wouldn t hesitate to stay there again  
P => Great location Have just returned from a months holiday in China  I stayed at the Prime due to reviews which had rated the hotel highly  I went there   days before Christmas for five nights  The hotels location is probably its best point as the place itself was nothing to write home about  No one had any interest in Christmas  it was another ordinary day  My feeling was that they were not particularly interested in anyone who didnt speak Chinese  Staff were ok  not overly helpful  Few spoke any English at all and those that did had a very basic knowledge  albeit my Chinese is nil   Rooms were clean   restaurant food was ok  Nothing spectacular at all  In all I stayed in three hotels in Beijing and found that you can get better value for money at    hotels  You just need to know how  I met a great bloke called Peter who works as a travel advisor  Before booking a hotel or internal flights contact him for some great deals    email       He is very honest and extremely helpful and no pressure  
P => good location good hotel Second time at the prime  no problem with air condition  very clean room and maids where very kind leaving enough water  chocolates and sometimes fruits  It was an extended stay and it was very comfortable Be aware that in your arraival you ve got to wait for your room 
P => Recommended by Brightonian Honeymooners We were really impressed with this hotel  The lobby is beautiful and the rooms spacious and modern  though retaining a classic feel  Location  service and comfort were all excellent  A great place to stay on our arrival in Beijing  Tip for any honeymooners  this hotel upgraded our room free of charge as it was our honeymoon  What a lovely touch  
P => The most cosy room ever We liked the Prime Hotel because we felt at home the moment we entered the room  The room was spacious and very comfy with big easy chairs  soft floorcarpet and warm lamplight   The bathroom was huge and luxuriuos  also there was no noise at all although our room was at a busy streetside  We were regretting to leave after   days  Breakfast was very nice too  On walking distance of the Forbidden City and the main shopping area of the Wanfungjin  although a litlle far if you  re tired  
P => Great hotel for all   Chinese  Luckily  my experience with this hotel was very good  The location is great  you can walk within      minutes to Beijing s main shopping street and other interesting places  Getting a taxi is easy and cheap  The room was very spacious and yes   there are non smoking rooms  And yes   the air condition is not cooling the room down to freezing temperatures  but to a comfortable and reasonable level  Staff was friendly and very helpful  room service was prompt and of good quality  not too expensive as well  It may well be that there is dual pricing as mentioned by a previous reviewer  but this is a reality in China whether you like it or not  I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to Chinese and Western tourists alike  be it for business  wireless internet in the room  or vacation sightseeing  
P => A great place to stay in  This was the best hotel we stayed in on our   week tour in China  A great place to stay in Beijing  in an excellent location  just   minutes walk from the main strip  Wangfujing street  and    minutes walk from the gates of the Forbidden City At the front desk they gave us an upgrade  so we spent   nights in a spacious room  with a king size bed and a huge bathroom  with both bath and shower Breakfast buffet was very rich  both Western and Chinese The only fault was the high rate they charge for internet use in their Business Center      per minute  quite expensive  
P => not for westerners I stayed here for a week  it s a beautiful hotel t but if you are not CHINESE stay clear of it  A previous reveiwer warned the same and he is right If you are Western stay a million miles from it  Why  The hotel has dual pricing for foreigners and Chinese  When I booked it was under a chinese name and I was given a rate  On arrival they discovered that I am not Chinese  had a little chat and told me the  foreigners   have a different price that is higher I immeadiately requested a Chinese member of my staff to book the room in her name  The cheaper price was then quoted  but withdrawn when they realised what was happening If a Chinese and  foreigners share a room they also pay the foreigner price  This makes company bookings a nightmare for companies that have mixed nationality workforce such as mine  Its very very hurtful to some people of certain cutures not to mention different skin colour  There is no laws against this practice in Chna unlike in the western world The Chinese view this that foreigners have more money so lets charge them more  I dio not agree  we all know what it isThis is common enough in Beijing but its not acceptable in      The hotel is nice inside and runs as good as a five star  The restaurant is excellent value and everyone is charged the same regardless of nationality  The bar has the same policy My advice is to ask any hotel in Beijing if they still operate dual pricing       do  thank them and more to one that doesn t I wrote to the hotel by fax  email and registered letter  I never got a reply  and would still welcome talks oin this matter  from anyone Love China  Love its people but greatly oppose dual pricing based on nationality For now the Prime is a stay clear  If it changes its pricing great 
P => Great place to stay  This was the best place we stayed on our       week world trip The rooms are first class  with a huge bathroom Free no fuss Broadband Ethernet in room We didn t want to leave The breakfast and dinner buffet are to die for  and are well worth paying for  You ll be hard pressed to get better food in Beijing AVOID the chinese restaurant upstairs  the service is attrocious  We were the only ones eating there and they still stuffed up our order twice and had no idea what they were doing It s a long walk  about  km  from where the airport bus drops you off  to the hotel  We walked it at   pm on a Sunday and it s quite safe  just a long way Cabs are cheap  but make sure you get one of the official Green and Yellow or Red cabs AVOID the cab hawkers at the airport at all costs  they will rip you off The hotel is right on the main strip  so you are just a stones thow from the action at night  
P => Perfect location in downtown Beijing I stayed at this hotel for   days   nights  Got a nice rate of      night for a Club floor Check in was very quick and smooth Rooms are very big and nice  Very comfortable  The bathroom was nice with shower AND bath  although a bit old    The lobby is very big and impressive I did regret the lack of international channels on satellite TV   only CNN and HBO were available   I tried the foot massage service which decent but expensive  and I do not recommend Did have a peak at the pool but did not try it   We made a   day trip to Great Wall for less than        very nice and easy Breakfast is fairly good  but would never recommend having dinner at the buffet because it s extremely expensive and not worth it considering the wealth of good adresses in Beijing  check out the surroundings of lake Qianhai at night     But the best point about hte hotel is its location  Right on Wang Fu Jing  the main commercial street in Beijing  It s in the center of the town  About   mn  walking  away from northern entrance of Forbidden City and Jingshan Park  and   mn from Beihai Park  And it s about   mn away from Tian An Men square If you like to do urban trekking  but being based on a nice    western like  but Chinese  hotel I surely would recommend this place   The only places I took a taxi to go to were the summer Palace and the Great Wall    
P => Very nice hotel I chose to stay at the Prime Hotel based on other reviews  which were right on the money  I had a room on the  th floor  It was really big as was the bathroom  You could tell the hotel wasn t new but everything was in nice condition  Staff all spoke some English and were quite helpful  I signed up for a tour to the Great Wall for     RMB at the concierge  The only thing they didn t mention on the itinerary was that the tour included stops at  quot state owned quot  factories stores for jade  tea and pottery  Oh well  went with the flow and had an enjoyable time  Don t forget to shop at the Silk market  This was a good hotel for my first visit to Beijing  
P => Good     but the pool   oh dear   Just stayed at the Prime in Beijing  Excellent value   nice hotel good location excellent standards and service  if limited English spoken   but thats China for you Only one real criticism   the pool and spa areas are dire    The pool room was cold dirty and unwelcoming    I was assured it was in use for guests but we decided against using it   The spa needs a serious facelift   shabby and dark and unkempt with tatty carpets and furnishings  Massage was very good though If swimming and pampering are important aspects of your stay   dont stay here  Otherwise it was a lovely place to stay  Staff v friendly and wanting to help  
P => Good Hotel   Good Value My wife and I stayed at the Prime Hotel in early ch       The Hotel was fine  I would not call it a full   star hotel  but it is very good  The room was large and comfortable  we were upgraded to a deluxe room   The well apointed marble bathroom had both a tub and a separate shower  The only complaint would be that the shower leaked some water onto the marble floor The location is convenient to the major shopping district down the street  and is also close to the Forbidden City  There are a number of restaurants nearby  as well as small shops to buy fruit bottled water etc The weather was quite cold is early ch  and we even had some snow  
P => Definitely Five Stars for us We stayed at the Prime Hotel for   nights and found it to be excellent on all counts Our check in was quick and painless and the room was spacious and clean The staff have good English and respond quickly to your requests We had a slight problem with the air conditioner but it wasn t a big enough deal to detract from the overall picture This hotel is nicely located for access to a range of things to do and see in inner Beijing We would stay at the Prime again any time  
P => Nice hotel in a great location MAKE SURE YOU TAKE YOUR HOTEL NAME IN CHINESE CHARACTERS and the phone number when you land in Beijing  All hotels have a Chinese name and a western name and the taxi drivers don t understand or know the western names That said  the Prime Hotel is in a great location for walking to the Forbidden City and Tiannemien Square during the day and to restaurants and shopping on Wafujing Street at night The rooms are comfortable and clean with huge bathrooms with both tub and separate shower  We found the hotel staff helpful and the doorman particularly so in helping negotiate a price with a taxi driver to a remote spot on the Great Wall I would definitely consider staying here again when in Beijing and looking for a centrally located tourist location  
P => Prime Hotel is a good pick  We just got back from a trip to the Far East and stayed at the Prime Hotel in Beijing  The rooms were well appointed and the bathrooms were large  very elegant and clad in black marble    and that was for a standard room  Laundry service was outstanding No mold to speak of  Only disappointment was a few stains on upholstery and carpet but that was not a big deal The dinner buffet is quite large and well executed and a good choice when returning in the evening exhausted from the day s activities  It was a blessing since it was too cold to brave the streets on several nights to scope out a good spot to eat  The hotel staff were exceptionally polite and accomodating  The front desk provided us with a driver whom they employed  quot Sun Shui quot   Soon Shwee  who cost     US per person for   hours and spoke enough English to accomodate our requests  Have the concierge write down your destinations in Chinese and then hand them to the driver before you depart    a safe bet for taxis as well We highly recommend this hotel but perhaps may try the Intercontinental on our next trip which is further up the street  
P => very good choice We  party of      rooms  stayed here for   nights in ober as a part of a tour package  Breakfast was included and it was good  The hotel is located on Wangfujing  which is their main street  However  it is at the far end of this street so you do have to walk a bit  about     blocks to the night market  to get to the busier area  which is fine for me but not so great for those with difficulty walking  our mothers    and    years old    yes  taxis are cheap  The hotel itself is solid   star  The lobby is very nice with a pianist at night and fountain  bars etc  and the room was spacious and comfortable  bathrooms very nice  We had no problems with the heat and I did not notice any smell  I would recommend this hotel  Yes  there is a language barrier but it did not hinder us  The only thing that I did not like was the pool is up   flights of stairs  so my mother could not utilize it and you have to pay for the saunas  which I felt was misleading as it does not mention this anywhere on their website  If you are wary of staying in a Chinese owned hotel they are renovating the Crowne Plaza on the same street but a bit closer to the action and there is a Grand Hyatt as well  This was our first tour and I found it to be excellent  We work for an airline so it is normally not financially beneficial for us to do tours  however  I felt with the language barrier it would be a good idea  It was an EXCELLENT idea  Very  very few people speak English and of those who do   they may be scamming you so   fully recommend for your  st time to do one  I also fully recommend our tour company Travel China Guide  It was top notch  I chose it because of the hotel  all of the tours included and the price  It also included lunch  one peking duck dinner and the opera  I had expected the lunches they provided to be sandwiches and chips or something of the sort   they took us to   star restaurants each one better than the last  We were always underdressed for these restaurants  to give you an idea  The peking duck restaurant was great and a couple of the other diners were diplomats from another country  couldn t recognize the flag   The opera was excellent  The only problem was   not enough time  We did   days   nights and we were up and out by  am every morning and did not get back until     every night  So if you want to shop too  plan for more time  Shopping  we did the xiushui market and the beijing silk market  We paid no more than     y       for anything but they are rip offs you can find real cashmere but you really have to know what you are looking at  if not I recommend you stick to the shops on Wangfujing because you WILL be taken  Also  check the sizes I bought a twin set and the shell was smaller than the cardigan  Also  if you do choose this tour company I recommend our tour guide Christie  She was phenomenal  She was with us    hours out of the day  would schedule our massages in our room  then leave us and go buy us things that we requested  such as phone cards and dvds  etc  Oh bars clubs  Sanlitun area and or there is an area in the hutong  I forget the name of the area but it is the hutong that is included in the tour right across from the summer palace  There is a long street of bars and clubs right on the waterfront beautiful They will take you to a few stores such as the jade factory en route to the wall  Don t bother it s a tour trap   I felt that we wasted a lot of time there I hope this helps  Have a wonderful time it really is a great place  
P => I want to give them   stars      but I can t My wife and I just got back from Beijing  We stayed at the Prime Hotel  The location is great  the service is excellent  However  we had two big problems  First  we couldn t control the temp in our room  They turned off the aircon  We had to open the windows to get any cool air and outside of the hotel they were doing construction nearby  So  you could either be very warm and have the room quite or cool and noisy The second problem was mold  Our room was really smelly  It smelled like mold and we started feeling ill when we were in the room  A friend was also staying in the hotel and his room smelled like mold  We were both on the  th floor Again  the hotel was great  the staff was great  the food was great  the location was great  everything was great except for the mold and lack of temp control  
P => Very satisfactory experience This hotel was chosen based on reviews from this site  We completely agree with the assessment  Staff was courteous and helpful  Minor difficulties in helping us find some restaurants but otherwise very capable  Rooms were large and comfortable  This hotel is a good value and is in a very good location  Why spend more  
P => Great hotel nice location My family and I enjoyed a very pleasant and comfortable five night stay at this hotel in mid ober  The hotel is exactly what other members have described     more than a   star hotel with clean spacious rooms  good service  and very friendly  helpful staff  Their breakfast buffet is reasonably priced and has a good mix of Chinese and Western varieties  Its location is superb which is in close proximity to the busy shopping area along Wangfujing Street  However  if you want to venture further out to either the east or west side of that area  a    to    minute walk from the hotel will take you to the nearest subway station which is located inside the Oriental Plaza Shopping Mall at the corner of Wangfujing and ChangAn Streets As someone recently mentioned about mold in the room  I would like to point out that although all of my family members including myself are highly sensitive to dust  mold  and other allergens  we did not experience any health problem while we were in the room  Instead  we did suffered some mild allergy symptoms while we were outside on the streets due to the city s thick blanket of smog and haze  Compared to other   star hotels  this hotel is definitely a good pick for the price  quality and service  I would stay there again in my next visit  
P => Good value for monay and a nice French Restaurant Enjoyed our stay on the concierge floor Good breakfast and nice French restaurant  Would recommend for average hotel in Beijing   
P => The Prime Hotel   A wonderful place to stay  We were lucky enough to stay at the Prime Hotel on a tour we booked with travel china guide Website         The hotel was of the finest standard and the Staff were very professional and friendly  The breakfeast was absolutely amazing with so much to choose from  something for all tastes  We were upgraded to superior at no extra cost  Our room was amazing  so clean  comfortable  classical  beautiful and quite  The photo s shown are exactly as we found  The room service was wonderful  We had to ask for some luggage to be stored for several days  It was absolutely no trouble  We would sincerely reccomend this wonderful hotel  A fantastic Japanese restaurant is located in the hotel  the food is also of amazing quality  A lovely shopping area is located to the side of and accross the road from the hotel  It is well worth exploring I believe that my review of this hotel is a great way to say thank you to all at this beautiful hotel and I hope one day we can return Cheers  Francine  Australia 
P => Excellent hotel  This hotel was absolutely fantastic  It was truly   star all round  Staff were so helpful and though English wasn t always fluent  they really made an effort to help with any query  Rooms were amazing  and bathrooms even better  and the hotel entrance and lobby were really impressive  The location could not have been better as it s about a mile walking to Tiannamen Sq and is situated on the shopping street of Beijing  You can even see the roof tops of the Fobidden City from the room I could not recommend this hotel more highly and thoroughly enjoyed the trip to Beijing  more so because of this great hotel which deserves   stars  The hotel organises trips to The Great Wall and I recommend Mutianyu which is the farthest  We didn t have breakfast included  but did sample the hotel buffet which was still a good price for Westerners  Excellent hotel on all levels  
P => The Prime Hotel  Aptly Named My fear is that anyone reading this review will think I m a shill for the hotel  writing a fake positive review  as I only have good things to say   That s how much I liked the Prime Hotel I ve been to Beijing before  so I understand the city  its people  and its hotels  I could not have been more happy with my stay at the Prime  The location is excellent  at the very north end of the Wangfujing shopping street  It s about a half hour walk to Tiananmen square  shorter to the Forbidden City  Easy access to tons of shopping and eating  bustling with activity day and night  Certainly for a first time visitor to Beijing  I couldn t think of a better area to stay in My room was big  quiet  very comfortable  and all amenities were in working order  A well thought out selection in the minibar  reasonably priced  and nice unexpected extras  I even used the hotel s laundry service  which was quick and did a great job  The TV had CNN  NHK  HBO  the Chinese equivalent of MTV  all   CCTV channels  as well as a bunch more  The bed was huge and very comfortable   A rarity in China  Most days  I went downstairs for breakfast at about      AM  and when I returned to my room about    minutes later  it had been made up already The staff is very friendly and helpful  I encountered none of the  limited English  complaints voiced in previous reviews  Then again  I ve made an effort to learn a bit of Mandarin  just to be a gracious guest in a foreign country  The conceirge desk was very capable  they helped me set up my China Mobile cell phone with no complaints or attitude   and the business center was able to help me check on a flight to Shanghai  Yes  internet access at   RMB minute isn t cheap  but it s far from highway robbery  either  and is the going rate for high end hotels in Beijing  In USD  that s about       for ten minutes  Elevator operators stand ready to call the elevator down when they see you coming through the lobby  and the bellhops out front not only will call you a cab  but they even give you a card with the taxi number when you return  in case you accidentally forgot something in the car The breakfast buffet was comparable to others I ve had in China and in the states  Perfectly fine  maybe better still  Chinese foods  as well as Western foods  even a selection of cereals for the Americans  and beans for the Brits  French toast and maple syrup  even  In China    BTW  The place is CRAWLING with Americans and Europeans  Looked to me like they make up     or better of the clientele  There are a couple of lounges in the large open lobby where you can sit and have a drink  a smoke  or some tea   Whichever vice you happen to have Honestly  I can t think of a single complaint about the Prime Hotel  And I consider myself a pretty worldly traveller  Having booked through Expedia  I paid a premium rate for my room       per night   but it was worth every penny  and by western standards  undoubtedly a bargain  To be sure of a similar experience next time  I would pay even more than that I recommend the Prime Hotel to anyone travelling to Beijing  and will not hesitate to stay there again  myself  Having found it through Tripadvisor  I even went to the trouble to take some photos  which I ve posted here  
P => Not every one in the world speaks english   I always love to read complaints that people in the hotel don t speak English  Well  when a Beijing resident comes to visit New York City  do the hotel people speak Mandarin   They should  There are a lot more Chinese in the world than Americans  The hotel was an excellent choice  It is   star and a little less expensive that the other   stars in the city  The location is perfect  It is about a   minute walk to the  quot Time Square quot  shopping area My only warning about Beijing in general   don t try to cross a street  The drivers are the worse I have ever seen and they never stop for pedestrians or bicycles   
P => Nice Hotel  
P => The Prime Hotel is OK    if you speak Chinese  
P => Nice Hotel Good Location  
P => Loved The Prime Hotel  
P => excellent quality  
P => Enjoyed the stay very nice room  
P => 			 
P => La posizione e centralissima  
P => Fabulous  Incredible value   This is a GREAT hotel in all aspects  if you do not mind being in the city center  The rooms are really as represented on their website  fab bathrooms and amenities  very unexpected considering their rates  Internet is complimentary and not restricted  great pool and spa  variety in dining options and the whole look of the hotel is very chic  Metro stop is   blocks away and a few minutes and the ride to Tiananmen Square is about    minutes on the same line  Taxis are inexpensive and hotel is on main road to downtown very near  quot ring road   quot   Staff is very helpful although language is still a bit of a barrier  but they do try their best This is one of the best value for the money I have ever encountered  
P => Very comfortable design hotel We stayed one week in this hotel  We arranged a hotel shuttle service and that was very comfortabel  They picked us up with an Audi A  and it costed about    minutes to reach the hotel  During rush houres you have to count on       minutes traveling time by car  You can also take the Airport Express line  than by circle line   and then take line   to Babaoshan subway station  exit D   Turn to the left if you leave the metro station  From there it s about   minutes walking  Metro prices are low    yuan for one trip and the bus is even cheaper    yuan  just put the money in the box when entering the bus and take your ticket  Checking in was smooth and the staff is warm and friendly  They always greet you when entering or leaving the hotel  We had a club room  They are situated on floors    and     You can use the executive lounge for complementary breakfast  soft drinks during the whole day and from             PM they have happy houre with snacks  They also provide internet on   computers and a printer The hotel is brand new and it s lovely designed  The rooms are good  spacious and one of the features of the rooms are the  Pullman  beds  They are very comfortable and they provide about   pillows per person  so u can use the pillow you like  Airco is fine  no noise  The lightning of the room is also very good  direct   indirect light  night lights  etc   Everything is very clean and comfortable  We used the pool  the gym and the small sauna and steamroom  Use is for free  But if you want to use the spa and   or the  quot big quot  sauna  you have to pay extra  I don t know the costs  but I think it will be reasonable priced  Rooms were also cheap in my opinion  about           yuan per night for the club room   The hotel is south westly situated from the city  Taking line   of the subway brings you in about         minutes in the city centre  For us this was no problem  Next to the hotel you can find Wanda Plaza  a shopping mall with also some  fast  restaurants  The only complaint I have is that service was not always      professional  During the first   days  they offered us turning down service  but then they stopped it  That was also with the newspaper  Sometimes they brought a newspaper  sometimes not  But in my opinion this were minor issues  The staff is  as said  very polite  friendly and warm and they will do everything to please you  If you want to have information about making some trips in and around Beijing  please ask for Alan  He can give you all the information you want and if necessary he can arrange cars  drivers etc  for you  Overall I think this hotel is very good and I can recommend it if it s not a problem to travel by metro or taxi  also very cheap  but use only the official taxis   
P => nice hotel it is a nice hotel  all the equipments are brand newalthough far away from hotel  walking distance to metro station  can go everywhere easily by subway staff is very friendly  but seem lack of experience  sometimes even how to do with certain proceduresshortage   hotel is in cemetery area    a little bit weired  but it s ok la   
P => Great value for money  I had some reservations about this hotel because of the location  but it was very easy to get into town  The staff was very helpful and they were always willing to assist me  Alan  the concierge  was particularly friendly and very professional  The rooms are spacious with great views of the city  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn t want to spend a fortune in accommodation but still expects a good service  I will definitely come back here again  
P => Superb Superb hotel rooms  attractive decor and mod cons  very clean  brand new  excellent service  all customer staff could speak english  and free internet  Also  nice shopping mall next door  and subway a short walk down the road  Only drawback is the location  which is slightly out of town  but a    yuan       taxi ride soon solved that problem  I definately would consider staying here again  
P => Beautiful clean comfortable hotel   would stay there again Our family stayed in this hotel for three nights with a large tour group  The rooms were big with great views and the beds were very comfortable  Everything was clean and brand new  There is a mall and grocery store across the street  The only draw back was that it was far from down town Beijing and thus it took an hour to get to anything    
P => Grand hotel and rooms The rooms are just fab    well appointed and very spacious  The lobby is stunning  the Bar is very cozy and the Buffet in the is also Restaurant very nice  The service is very good and helpful and the staff goes out of there way to make you feel welcome  The free internet is also a nice feature and the bathrooms have a separate shower with a soothing rainforest showerhead Great indoor pool and spa facilities I booked an advanced purchase rate with breakfast included and even though its not in the citycenter the taxi ride is only about   RMB to Tiannamen area  only   EUR  so if you don t mind the travel time about       minutes it is a really good value  There is also the metro stop line    just a few minutes walk that takes you straight to city center for    cents  
P => Beautiful new hotel This hotel is brand new and is a   star establishment  The rooms are very well appointed with lovely modern bathrooms  The food at the restaurant is excellent especially the dinner buffet  Although the hotel is a little way from the centre of Beijing  it is only a short walk to the subway  which takes you straight through to the main sites of Beijing  The subway fare is only   CNY  It is also near The Fragrant Park is is well worth a visit  The service was excellent   If I returned to Beijing I would definitely stay here again  
P => Could not be better Stayed for   nights in this new and great hotel  It is located less than    minutes from the subway station and    minutes to the Forbidden City by subway The staff is very attentive and accomodating  making sure that guest feel confortable and always a smile in their face The restaurants in the hotel are very beatiful and serve fine food aof the highest quality and affordable price  
P => Excellentes prestations  
P => Great location    very hard beds I got a very good deal through booking the hotel via bookings com        Upon arriving at the hotel and entering my room   I realised that the price I paid was just right   it is no way worth more than the price I paid   despite the prices showing RMB      Approx      at the hotel  The room itself was a standard room with king size bed  it was pleasant and I had a nice view of below  The bathroom is    an interesting glass cubicle   but none the less   it serves the purpose  The room it self was a modest size   and the air con worked a treat where it very quickly heated up the room The bed was very hard   it took a while to get used to it  but even then   I looked forward to coming home and sleeping in a proper bed The TV has   English channels and   French channel the other     are Chinese During check in the hotel could not find my booking and hence I did not get my breakfast included   despite having booked it  not a big problem   as there are ample restaurants lined up and down the road   which open at a very early hour The hotel is in a good spot   there are   subway stations in close vicinity and a      and McD s are not too far away Also   be aware you will need to put down a deposit for the room when you arrive   either cash or card  which will be returned when you leave  
P => Convenient stay at Qianyuan Qianyuan was a very nice hotel based on Chinese standards  The room decor was very pleasant  but the walls are very thin  You can hear everything in the hall and adjacent rooms  so bring earplugs  The beds are very hard  harder than the other hotels I stayed  The shower door leaked and flooded the bathroom floor but I remedied this by pointing shower head at the wall   This hotel provides room safes unlike the other hotels I stayed  The rooms were clean  staff was helpful  and location was perfect  It was just a      minute walk from Beixingqao and Dongzhimen subway stations  You can catch the     bus at Dongzhimen bus stop to Mutianyu Great Wall  The hotel is located on a very busy street that has tons of restaurants  I recommend the Yunan noodle shop across the street  order the fried noodles for    RMB  There is also an excellent massage place across the street that cost    RMB for     hr foot and shoulder massage  It is also located just    min walking distance from the llama temple  Confucian temple and Imperial Academy  
P => Some strange   but OK   things We stayed in this hotel for   nights in il  having found a good deal on a website  booking com   It is in an interesting area  near restaurant street  It is also accessible from   but not close to     different subway stops on two different lines We had breakfast included  It was buffet and absolutely fine  though some of the dishes are not what you would normally expect   see photo The room had some strange and impractical design features  The most obvious is a glass bathroom enclosure   admittedly with frosted glass in a broad band  see pictures   Obviously this was not a hit with clients  as there is a totally unnecessary  from the water control viewpoint  shower curtain  allowing privacy We speculated that someone must have designed this hotel so that it would look god   but had no idea of realities  The carpets on the floor of the lifts elevators have the day of the week written on them in English  This is  obviously  a pretty useful feature  if you have forgotten what day it is  having crossed the international date line  They accurately told us the day during our stay  be those of you with more experience of multi star hotels regard this as normal  It was new to me  So I took a picture This hotel is definitely not a western chain  
P => Great bargain  I stayed three nights at the hotel and upgraded to a deluxe room which is very spacious with a full kitchen  The room rate is very reasonable as making online booking wil give you half price the walk in rate  The location is nice  with a big food supermarket on the ground floor and situated right in the food street  Gui street   Less than    minutes by car from the airport and less than    minutes walk to either line   or   subway line  The breakfast is acceptable with sufficient Chinese and Western choice  The service is nice and the broadband access is ok  Not many facilities at the hotel  a very wide selection of TV channels though  but good enough for sleeping at night  though the bed is a bit hard  and spending the day outside  In sum  it is a really good bargain for a   star hotel in Beijing  
P => Excellent hotel  Really enjoyed our stay  We stayed for   nights in an  executive room  in tember       We paid about     night as we found a deal on the internet  I would highly recommend staying here  It is quite modern and the rooms are spacious  comfortable and well furnished  The staff are friendly and helpful  though quite limited English   We didn t eat in the restaurant except for breakfast   this was a buffet with a range of Western and Chinese dishes on offer   OK but nothing special  The hotel is very well located   about    mins walk from the metro and on a street full of restaurants   the ones we tried were great
